Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC): Homelessness/Migrancy as Nutritional
Risk Conditions 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Nutrition Service, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule would amend regulations governing the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and
Children (WIC) to comply with the mandate of section 204 of the Child Nutrition Amendments of 1992, enacted on August
14, 1992. Consistent with that legislation, this rulemaking would add homelessness and migrancy to the predisposing
nutritional risk conditions for the WIC Program. 


This proposed rule would also alter the current WIC nutritional risk priority system by placing individuals certified
for WIC due solely to homelessness or migrancy in Priority VII, along with previously certified participants who
might regress in nutritional status without continued provision of supplemental foods. The use of Priority VII for
this latter group of individuals would remain a State agency option. However, State agencies would be required to
use Priority VII for homeless or migrant individuals who are certified solely due to their homelessness or migrancy.

The intended effect of this proposed rule is to allow categorical and income-eligible homeless or migrant individuals,
who lack any other documented nutritional or medical condition, to receive WIC Program assistance. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Classification 


Executive Order 12866 


This proposed rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866. It has been designated ``not significant''
and did not require clearance by the Office of Management and Budget. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612).
Pursuant to that review, William E. Ludwig, Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service has certified that this
rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. WIC local agency participant caseloads
may potentially increase and thereby affect demand on local food vendor business.

The net effect on State and local agencies is expected to be minimal. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


This proposed rule imposes no new reporting or recordkeeping provisions that are subject to OMB review in accordance
with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). 


Executive Order 12372 


The Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic
Assistance Programs under 10.557 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation
with State and local officials (7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, and 48 FR 29114 June 24, 1983). 


Executive Order 12778 


This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This proposed rule is intended
to have preemptive effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its
provisions or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive
effect unless so specified in the 

EFFECTIVE DATE

 paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the application of the provisions of this rule, all
applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In the WIC Program, the administrative procedures are
as follows: (1) Local agencies and vendors_State agency hearing procedures issued pursuant to 7 CFR 246.18; (2) applicants
and participants_State agency hearing procedures issued pursuant to 7 CFR 246.9; and (3) sanctions against State
agencies (but not claims for repayment assessed against a State agency) pursuant to 7 CFR 246.19_administrative
appeal in accordance with 7 CFR 246.22; and (4) procurement by State and local agencies_administrative appeal to
the extent required by 7 CFR 3016.36.

Background 


There have never been specific, direct regulatory barriers or prohibitions to the participation of the homeless
or migrants in the WIC Program. Both before and since the enactment of the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-435),
the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has actively promoted service to homeless and migrant populations. Further,
particular attention has long been focused in the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1771 

et seq

.), on the needs of special populations, e.g. migrants and Native Americans. Section 17(f)(19) of the Child Nutrition
Act of 1966, 42 U.S.C. 1786(F)(19), requires that not less than nine-tenths of 1 percent of the sums appropriated any
fiscal year for special supplemental food programs be available for services to eligible members of migrant populations.

In an interim and a final rule on participation of homeless individuals in WIC, published in December 1989 and August
1992, respectively, the Department defined the term ``homeless individual'' based upon the definition provided
legislatively in section 212(a) of the Hunger Prevention Act, Public Law 100-435 (42 U.S.C. 1786(b)(15)).
This term identifies those otherwise eligible residents of specified overnight facilities who must be granted access
to WIC when caseload is available, provided such facilities meet conditions insuring that residents, and not the
facilities, benefit from the WIC Program. 
The August 1992 final rule, 57 FR 34500 (August 5, 1992), amended the WIC regulations to require State agencies to include
in their State Plans of Program Operation and Administration a description of how they will provide Program benefits
to and meet the special nutrition education needs of homeless individuals (7 CFR 246.4(a) (6) and (9), respectively)
and disseminate information about program availability and eligibility to organizations serving the homeless
(7 CFR 246.4(a)(7)). The August 1992 final rule amended 7 CFR 246.10(f)(1) to allow States, upon approval by FNS, to
make substitutions for foods normally required in the food package in order to accommodate the special circumstances
of the homeless. Further, the August 1992 final rule amended 7 CFR 246.10(f) (2) and (3) to require that competent professional
authorities take into account the special needs and problems of homeless individuals when prescribing supplemental
foods. 
FNS has also shared with State WIC agencies successful initiatives and targeting strategies employed by other States
to facilitate participation of homeless and migrant persons in the WIC Program. A number of State agencies have established
local agency clinics and WIC certification offices in hotels and facilities which house homeless and migrant families.
Other States have held statewide training sessions for their local WIC agencies to educate them about the special
problems most frequently encountered by homeless individuals, and how WIC can help to alleviate some of these problems.

According to a 1986 report to Congress by the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Government Operations,
families, especially those composed of women and children, are the fastest growing segment of the homeless population
nationwide (report cited by the National Advisory Council on Maternal, Infant, and Fetal Nutrition, 

1992 Biennial Report to Congress on WIC and CSFP

 (Commodity Supplemental Food Program)). Although the homeless have not been well studied relative to other population
groups, several studies have indicated that the homeless and migrants are predisposed to inadequacies in their diets
and in the medical care they receive. Homeless infants and children appear to be at higher risk of low birthweight and
malnutrition. (Chavkin, Kristal, Seabron, and Guigli, 1987). Studies have also found that a correlation exists
between homelessness in women and a general lack of prenatal care and poor pregnancy outcomes. Homelessness may also
impede access to health care services and other public assistance programs. Moreover, evidence indicates that homeless
children have high rates of delayed immunization, a higher risk of exposure to infectious diseases, and higher rates
of emotional and developmental problems. (Khan, 1991). 

Because of the difficulty in conducting research on the homeless, most studies have focused on the sheltered homeless.
The risks to unsheltered homeless mothers and children are likely to be somewhat greater. 

A recent study indicates that migrants suffer most if not all of the conditions identified above afflicting the homeless.
(Farmworkers Health for the Year 2000, 1992 Recommendation of the National Advisory Council on Migrant Health).
In addition, testimony before the National Advisory Council on Migrant Health of the Department of Health and Human
Services (DHHS) suggests that a lack of permanent housing also predisposes migrants to higher rates of infant mortality
than the general population. 

Over the years, FNS has incorporated into the WIC Program regulations various provisions with the expressed purpose
of addressing the unique circumstances of migrant farmworkers. State plans are required to include information
on how the State intends to provide program benefits to eligible migrant farmworkers and their families; State agencies'
nutrition education goals and action plans must include a description of the methods that will be used to meet the special
nutrition education needs of migrant farmworkers and their families; and, States must provide expedited processing
services to special nutritional risk groups such as migrant farmworkers and their families. 

Because of the increased risks associated with homelessness and migrancy, the National Advisory Council on Maternal,
Infant, and Fetal Nutrition recommended in its 1992 Report to the President and Congress that section 17(b)(8) of
the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, 42 U.S.C. 1786(b)(8), be amended to include homelessness and migrancy as predisposing
nutritional risk conditions for the WIC Program. Congress and the President accepted this recommendation and, as
manifested in section 204 of the Child Nutrition Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102-342, specifically identified
homelessness and migrancy as predisposing nutritional risk conditions for purposes of WIC Program eligibility.




Definition of Homelessness/Migrancy 

As previously stated, the current definition of a ``homeless individual'' in the WIC regulations is based on the legislative
definition provided in section 212(a) of the Hunger Prevention Act, Public Law 100-435 (42 U.S.C. 1786 (b)(15).
Specifically, 7 CFR 246.2 defines a ``homeless individual'' as ``a woman, infant or child who lacks a fixed and regular
nighttime residence; or whose primary nighttime residence is: A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter
(including a welfare hotel, a congregate shelter, or a shelter for victims of domestic violence) designated to provide
temporary living accommodation; an institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to
be institutionalized; a temporary accommodation in the residence of another individual; or a public or private place
not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings.'' 

The Department believes this definition, along with its current migrant farmworker definition, should accommodate
all individuals Congress intended to include in their references to homelessness and migrancy in section 204 of the
Child Nutrition Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102-342.

While Congress has specifically defined the term ``homeless 
individual'' for the WIC Program, section 17 of the Child 
Nutrition Act of 1966 does not contain a definition for the terms 
``migrant'' or ``migrancy.'' However, section 17 uses the terms 
``migrant'' (e.g. section 17(f)(1)(c)(iv)) and ``migrant farmworker'' 
(e.g. section 17(d)(4)(B)). The Department has interpreted 
Congress' references to migrants in section 17 to mean only 
migrant farmworkers and the latter term is currently defined at 
CFR 246.2. However, before assuming that its migrant 
farmworker definition was sufficient to apply to all 
Congressional references to the term migrant, the Department 
examined the definition of migrant(s) as used by other public and 
private organizations and agencies concerned with migrants and 
migrant services. In each case, some reference was made to the 
agricultural or seasonal nature of migrancy and movement of 
individuals for agricultural employment purposes. Based on this 
comparative analysis, the Department considered its current 
definition of migrant farmworker adequate to accommodate all of 
Congress' references and uses of the term migrancy as set forth 
in section 204 of the Child Nutrition Amendments of 1992. 



WIC Priority System 



The current WIC nutritional risk priority system was designed to 
ensure that persons at greatest health and nutritional risk are 
served first with available program funds. The priority system 
therefore follows a logical order of progression to determine 
priority for service. Applicants with documented nutritionally 
related medical conditions are served first, followed by those at 
nutritional risk due to inadequate dietary patterns. Finally, 
and as a State agency option, previously certified participants 
whose nutritional status might regress without continued 
provision of supplemental foods are certified in Priority VII. 

Under this proposal, State agencies would be required to include 
in Priority VII pregnant, breastfeeding or postpartum women, 
infants, and children who are certified at nutritional risk 
solely because of their homelessness or migrancy. State agencies 
may also continue to use Priority VII to identify certified 
participants who might regress in nutritional status without 
continued provision of supplemental foods. The placement in 
Priority VII of individuals certified solely due to homelessness 
or migrancy should not be viewed as diminished concern for these 
individuals. Rather, such a placement reflects the Department's 
obligation to serve persons with the greatest medical and/or 
nutritional needs first. Priority VII will only be used to 
classify those individuals who are homeless or migrants and have 
no other documented medical or nutritional risk. These are 
individuals who previously would not have otherwise qualified for 
WIC Program benefits due to lack of nutritional risk. 

Given the facts revealed in the aforementioned studies, there is 
a high likelihood that homeless and migrant individuals are 
already being served by the WIC Program by virtue of their 
nutritional risk(s). Proposed Priority VII will serve as a 
safety net for homeless or migrant individuals who are not 
otherwise eligible due to a lack of documented nutritional or 
medical risk conditions. However, like any other eligible 
applicant, a homeless or migrant individual may be placed in a 
higher priority if her/his nutritional/health assessment by a 
competent professional warrants a higher placement in the 
priority system. For example, a homeless or migrant individual 
whose nutritional risk assessment reveals the presence of anemia 
would be placed in a higher priority category than a homeless or 
migrant person with no other documented nutritional risk 
condition who would be placed in Priority VII. This is in 
keeping with the aforementioned system of prioritizing WIC 
service based on documented nutritionally or medically related 
conditions. Priority VII is the logical placement for homeless 
and migrant individuals with no documented nutritional risks who 
qualify for the program due solely to homelessness or migrancy. 

The Department does not intend for Priority VII to be used by 
States as an administrative shortcut in certifying homeless and 
migrant individuals. The Department expects that homeless and 
migrant applicants will receive all the normal and necessary 
health assessments that are routinely performed to determine the 
presence of a medical or nutritional risk which would determine 
their proper priority placement, and assist in identifying other 
health and social services to which such individuals may be 
referred. 

The Department recognizes that this proposed regulation might 
require some States to modify their current reporting systems to 
accommodate the revised Priority VII. As such, the Department 
intends to provide an implementation period adequate to 
incorporate the necessary system modifications.

The Department notes that while Congress has found homelessness and migrancy to be conditions predisposing individuals
to nutritional risks, and this determination has been recognized by the placement of these individuals in a WIC nutritional
risk category, alcoholism and drug abuse, similarly recognized by Congress in section 17(b)(8), have not been accorded
similar treatment by the Department. The Department believes the distinction is warranted. Over the past several
years, the health and medical communities have come to accept alcoholism or drug addiction, in and of itself, as a nutritionally
related medical condition sufficient to warrant placement in one of the first three priorities in 7 CFR 246.7(e)(4).
The Department does not believe that the same can be said for homelessness and migrancy. Recognizing that most State
agencies classify individuals suffering from alcoholism or drug addiction as a Priority I, based on recent medical
research, the Department is considering seeking a technical correction to the WIC legislation to remove alcoholism
and drug addiction from the examples of ``predisposing'' nutritional risk conditions. This change would thus recognize
these conditions as independent nutritionally related medical conditions in the law, thereby adjusting legislative
language to reflect current medical knowledge.

1995 Wheat Program, Acreage Reduction 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Commodity Credit Corporation, USDA. 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule would amend the regulations to set forth the acreage reduction percentage for the 1995 crop of wheat.
This action is required by the Agricultural Act of 1949 (the 1949 Act), as amended. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:




Executive Order 12866 




This proposed rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866. Based on information compiled by the USDA,
it has been determined to be ``economically significant'' because it would have an annual effect on the economy of
more than $100 million and would materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, or loan programs or rights
and obligations of recipients thereof. Budget outlays for deficiency payments are expected to range from $1.3 billion
to $1.8 billion annually. 
This proposed rule would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities,
would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency,
and would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866. 




Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis 




A Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis describing the options considered in developing this proposed rule and
the impacts of implementing each option is available from the above-named individual. 




Environmental Evaluation 




It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will not have significant impact on the quality
of the human environment. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement
is needed. 



Federal Assistance Program 




The title and number of the Federal Assistance Program, as found in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, to
which this rule applies are: Wheat Production Stabilization_10.058. 




Regulatory Flexibility Act 




It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is applicable to this proposed rule since the Commodity
Credit Corporation (CCC) is required by section 107B(o) of the 1949 Act to request comments with respect to the subject
matter of this rule. The Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis referred to above determined that the 1995 Wheat
Acreage Reduction Program (ARP) will have no significant economic impact on small entities because the regulatory
burden on the affected entities would remain the same regardless of the determinations made by this action. Thus,
CCC certifies that this rule will have no significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 




Executive Order 12372 




This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation
with State and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V published at 48 FR 29115 (June 24,
1983). 




Executive Order 12778 




This proposed rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. This rule does not involve the preemption
of State law, is not retroactive, and does not involve any exhaustion of administrative remedy issues.

Paperwork Reduction Act 




The amendment to 7 CFR part 1413 set forth in this proposed rule does not contain information collections that require
clearance by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. 35. 




Comments 




Comments are requested with respect to this proposed rule and such comments shall be considered in developing the
final rule. 




Background 




In accordance with section 107B of the 1949 Act, an ARP is required to be implemented for the 1995 wheat crop if it is determined
that the total supply of wheat would otherwise be excessive. 


Land diversion payments also may be made to producers if needed to adjust the total national acreage of wheat to desirable
goals. A paid land diversion program is not considered because, given the allowed ARP percentages, it is not needed.



If an ARP is announced, the reduction shall be achieved by applying a uniform percentage reduction to the acreage base
for the farm. In making such a determination, the number of acres placed into the agricultural resources conservation
program established under subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, must be taken into consideration.



Producers who knowingly produce wheat in excess of the permitted acreage for the farm plus any wheat acreage planted
in accordance with the flexibility provisions provided by section 504 of the 1949 Act are ineligible for loans and
purchases and all payments with respect to that crop on the farm. 


If an ARP for the 1995 crop is in effect, the program must be announced no later than June 1, 1994. Adjustments in the announced
program may be made if it is determined that there has been a significant change in the total supply of wheat since the
program was first announced. These adjustments must be made no later than 
July 31, 1994. 


In accordance with section 107B of the 1949 Act, not less than 60 days before the program is announced for a crop of wheat,
proposals for public comment on various program options for the crop of wheat are required to be set forth. Each option
must be accompanied by an analysis that includes the estimated planted acreage, production, domestic and export
use, ending stocks, season average producer price, program participation rate, and cost to the Federal Government
that would likely result from each option. 


In determining the 1995 Wheat ARP, the Secretary will choose a specific ARP percentage from within a range established
by the estimated ending stocks-to-use (S/U) ratio for the 1994/95 wheat marketing year. If it is estimated that the
1994/95 S/U in percentage terms will be_

(i) More than 40 percent, the ARP shall not be less than 10 percent nor more than 20 percent; or 


(ii) Equal to or less than 40 percent, the ARP may not be more than 0 to 
15 percent. 

The S/U for the 1994/95 marketing year at 24.0 percent is estimated to be well below 40 percent. Based on this estimate,
the 1995 ARP may be not more than 15 percent. 


In addition, section 1104 of the Agricultural Reconciliation Act of 1990 provides that the acreage reduction factor
for the 1995 crop of wheat may not be less than 5 percent. This provision does not apply if the beginning stocks of soybeans
for the 1991/92 marketing year are less than 325 million bushels or if the estimated S/U for the 1994 wheat crop is less
than 34 percent. 


The current estimate of soybean stocks on September 1, 1991, is 329 million bushels. The estimated S/U for the 1994/95
wheat crop is 24.0 percent. Thus, under current supply and use estimates for soybeans and wheat, the minimum 5-percent-ARP
provision is not applicable. 


The 1995 ARP options considered are: 





Option 1. 0-percent ARP


Option 2. 5-percent ARP


Option 3. 10-percent ARP

The estimated impacts of the ARP options are shown in this table. 






Accordingly, comments are requested as to whether there should be a 1995 acreage reduction percentage, and, if so,
whether it should be 0 percent, 5 percent, 10 percent, or some other percentage within the range of 0 to 15 percent. The
final determination of this percentage will be set forth at 7 CFR part 1413.

ACTION:

 Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking; Reopening of the comment period. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to provide additional time for the public to comment on a proposal to supersede two airworthiness
directives that currently require the following on certain Beech Aircraft Corporation (Beech) 35 series airplanes:
Checking the ruddervator static balance and adjusting as appropriate; fabricating and installing airspeed limitation
placards; incorporating certain airspeed limitations into the airplane flight manual (AFM); and installing stabilizer
reinforcements. Several comments received on the original notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) requested additional
time to respond to the proposed action. This proposed action would incorporate and update the procedures and applicability
of both AD's into one document. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent structural failure
of the V-tail, which could result in loss of control of the airplane.

Missouri 64106. 



Discussion 



A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an AD that would apply to certain Beech 35
series airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 27, 1993 (58 FR 57760). The action proposed to supersede AD 57-18-01 and AD 87-20-02
R1 with a new AD that would require: (1) Checking the ruddervator static balance and adjusting as appropriate; (2)
fabricating and installing airspeed limitation placards; (3) incorporating certain airspeed limitations into
the airplane flight manual (AFM); and (4) installing stabilizer reinforcements. The proposed actions would be accomplished
in accordance with the instructions to either Beech Kit No. 35-4016-3, 35-4016-5, 35-4016-7,
or 35-4016-9, as applicable and as specified in Beech Service Bulletin No. 2188, and the applicable maintenance
manuals. 

Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. 

Several commenters request an extension of the comment period in order to have additional time to respond to the actions
presented in the proposal. After careful consideration, the FAA has determined that the comment period for the proposal
should be reopened to allow the public additional time to comment on the proposed actions. 

The FAA has altered the proposal to include additional information that was inadvertently left out or referenced
incorrectly when preparing the original notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). Before final rule action is implemented,
the FAA will evaluate all comments received in response to the original NPRM as well as this supplemental NPRM. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other Beech 35 series airplanes
of the same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 57-18-01 and AD 87-20-02 R1 with
a new AD that would require: (1) Checking the ruddervator static balance and adjusting as appropriate; (2) fabricating
and installing airspeed limitation placards; (3) incorporating certain airspeed limitations into the airplane
flight manual (AFM); and (4) installing stabilizer reinforcements. The proposed actions would be accomplished
in accordance with the instructions to either Beech Kit No. 35-4016-3, 35-4016-5, 35-4016-7,
or 35-4016-9, as applicable and as specified in Beech Service Bulletin No. 2188, and the applicable maintenance
and shop manuals.

The FAA estimates that approximately 10,200 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that
it would take approximately 40 workhours per airplane to accomplish the proposed action, and that the average labor
rate is approximately $55 an hour. Parts cost approximately $500 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost
impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $27,540,000. AD 57-18-01 and AD 87-20-02
R1, which both would be superseded by the proposed action, currently require the same actions as are proposed. This
proposed action incorporates and updates the procedures of both the current AD's into one document. With this in mind,
the proposed action would not provide any additional cost impact upon U.S. operators than that which is already required.



The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 


For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under
Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034,
February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on
a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory
evaluation prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the
Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Figure 1_Weight and Balance Information Accuracy Method No. 1
 


A. Review existing weight and balance documentation to assure completeness and accuracy of the documentation from
the most recent FAA-approved weighing or from factory delivery to date of compliance with this AD.

B. Compare the actual configuration of the airplane to the configuration described in the weight and balance documentation;
and

C. If equipment additions or deletions are not reflected in the documentation or if modifications affecting the location
of the center of gravity (e.g., paint or structural repairs) are not documented, determine the accuracy of the airplane
weight and balance data in accordance with Method No. 2.



Figure 2_Weight and Balance Information Accuracy Method No. 2



A. Assemble the following equipment: 
1. One certified platform scale having a range of 750 to 1,000 pounds that is capable of supporting the nose wheel without
contacting the rest of the airplane; 
2. One scale ramp of sufficient incline to allow rolling the wheel onto the scale; and 
3. One gear strut inflation system capable of inflating the gear struts to full extension. 
B. Procedure 
1. Prepare the airplane for weighing in accordance with the Weighing Instructions in the Weight and Balance Section
of the Pilot's Operating Handbook/Airplane Flight Manual (POH/AFM). 
2. Ensure that the scale and airplane are on a level hangar floor and the airplane is shielded from any wind. 
3. Inflate the main landing gear struts to the maximum extension and completely deflate the nose strut. Inflate the
tires to correct tire pressure as listed in the applicable maintenance or shop manual.






Note:

 Extreme caution should be used when deflating the nose strut because the airplane could drop suddenly.




4. Adjust the height of the scale platform to 12 inches above the hangar floor.

5. Position the nose wheel onto the scale and ensure that the remainder of the airplane does not contact the scale. Verify
the proper wheel weight. Set the parking brake and chock the main wheels. 
6. Record the net weight registered on the scale. 
7. Remove the nose wheel from the scale.

8. Adjust the gear struts to the proper extension lengths in accordance with the applicable maintenance or shop manual.

9. Subtract the following unusable (less undrainable) fuel from the current airplane Basic Empty Weight, CG, and
Moment:





10. Multiply the net weight obtained in paragraph 6. by 83.25 to obtain moment.

11. Divide the weight obtained in paragraph 9. into the moment obtained in paragraph 10. to determine a value for X.

12. Calculate a value of CG from: CG=92.5^1.01X.

13. Subtract the CG obtained in paragraph 12. from the CG obtained in paragraph 9.

D. Results

1. If the results of paragraph C. 13., indicate that the difference in CG is equal to or less than .5 inches, then continue
to use the basic empty airplane weight and CG data listed in the existing airplane records as the basis for computing
the weight and CG for the loaded airplane while using the criteria specified in the POH/AFM, Weight and Balance Section.

2. If the results of paragraph C. 13, indicate that the difference in CG is more than .5 inches, then determine the basic
weight and CG of the airplane using Method No. 3.

Example of Above_The following presents a sample calculation of the information specified in Method 2:




Basic Empty Weight=2,064.5 lbs.

Arm=78.3 in.

Moment=161,650 in.-lbs.

Paragraph C. 6: Nose Wheel Weight_341 lbs

Paragraph C. 9: 




*Arm=(18920)=78.29 (2030.)

Paragraph C.10.: Moment=(341 lbs) x (83.25 in)=28,388 in-lbs.

Paragraph C.11.:  x =(23,388 in-lbs)=13.98 in. (2030.0 lbs)

Paragraph C.12.: CG=92.50 in.^(1.01) x (13.98)=78.38 in.

Paragraph C.13.: Difference=(78.29)^(78.38)=^.09 in.




Airplane is within plus/minus 0.5 tolerance, therefore paragraph D.1., applies.



Figure 3_Weight and Balance Information Accuracy Method No. 3



Determine the basic empty weight and CG of the empty airplane using the Weighing Instructions in the Weight and Balance
Section of the POH/AFM. Record the results in the airplane records, and use these new values as the basis for computing
the weight and CG information as specified in the POH/AFM, Weight and Balances Section. 
(i) Upon completion of the requirements of paragraph (h) of this AD, remove the placards required by paragraphs (d),
(e), and (f) of this AD (including all sub-paragraphs), as applicable, and observe the original limits.

(j) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with 14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location
where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.

(k) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an equivalent level of
safety may be approved by the Manager, Wichita ACO, FAA, 1801 Airport Road, Room 100, Wichita, Kansas 67209. The request
should be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and send it to the Manager,

Availability of NPRM's



Any person may obtain a copy of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation
Administration, Office of Public Affairs, Attention: Public Inquiry Center, APA-220, 800 Independence Avenue
SW., Washington, DC 20591, or by calling (202) 267-3485. Communications must identify the notice number of
this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list for future NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory
Circular No. 11-2A, which describes the application procedure.



The Proposal



The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the Class
E airspace near Freeport, IL, to accommodate a new NDB Runway 06 SIAP and a new LOC Runway 24 SIAP to Albertus Airport,
Freeport, IL. This modification would increase the Class E airspace area radius from 6.4 miles to 6.5 miles. Controlled
airspace extending from 700 to 1200 feet AGL is needed to contain aircraft executing the approach. The intended affect
of this action is to provide segregation of aircraft using instrument approach procedures in instrument conditions
from other aircraft operating in visual weather conditions. The area would be depicted on aeronautical charts to
provide a reference for pilots operating in the area.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would
be published subsequently in the Order.
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_
(1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866;
(2) Is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and
(3) Does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is
a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when
promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Proposal  

The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace near Savanna, IL, to accommodate a new VOR/DME-A instrument approach procedure to Tri-Township
Airport, Savanna, IL. Controlled airspace extending from 700 to 1200 feet AGL is needed to contain aircraft executing
the approach. The intended affect of this action is to provide segregation of aircraft using instrument approach
procedures in instrument conditions from other aircraft operating in visual weather conditions. The area would
be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published
in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would
be published subsequently in the Order.
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Receipt of a Petition to Designate Lands Unsuitable for Mining and To Prepare a Petition Evaluation Document and Environmental
Impact Statement


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare a combined petition evaluation document/environmental impact statement, and notice
of scoping meeting and scoping comment period for the petition.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) intends to prepare a combined
petition evaluation document/environmental impact statement (PED/EIS) for the decision on a petition to designate
certain lands within the Little Yellow Creek (Fern Lake) watershed in Claiborne County, Tennessee, as unsuitable
for surface coal mining and reclamation operations in accordance with section 522 of the Surface Mining Control and
Reclamation Act (SMCRA) of 1977. OSM has identified four alternatives that the combined PED/EIS would evaluate as
described in the supplementary information of this notice. OSM requests that other agencies and the public submit
written comments or statements on the need for an EIS on the petition and the scope of the issues which should be analyzed
in the combined document.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On February 14, 1994, the City of Middlesborough, Kentucky and the National Parks and Conservation Association petitioned
the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) of the United States Department of the Interior, to
designate an area located in the Little Yellow Creek (Fern Lake) watershed in Claiborne County, Tennessee, as unsuitable
for surface coal mining operations pursuant to the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (Pub. L. 95-87).
The petition was amended on February 22, 1994, and deemed administratively complete and accepted for processing
on March 15, 1994. A subsequent amendment with exhibits was received on March 16, 1994. The petition as accepted is
a 26 page document with 100 pages of exhibits and an amendment. An additional 18 pages were received as part of a second
amendment after the determination of completeness. The Federal Program for Tennessee, as administered by OSM, applies
to all surface coal mining operations in Tennessee including the processing of lands unsuitable for mining petitions
(49 FR 38874, October 1, 1984).


The petition area occupies approximately 3,780 acres of the Little Yellow Creek watershed in Claiborne County, from
the headwaters to the Tennessee State line and includes portions of Fern Lake. The petition boundary runs essentially
from the Tennessee State line at Kentucky Corner on Cumberland Mountain in a southwest direction along the crest of
Cumberland Mountain to a point at the watershed divide between Tackett Creek and Little Yellow Creek. The petition
boundary then crosses from Cumberland Mountain to the crest of Mingo Mountain across this watershed divide and proceeds
in a northeasterly direction until it intercepts the Kentucky/Tennessee State line. The boundary follows the State
line to the east back to Kentucky Corner.
The major allegations of the petition can be summarized as follows:




1. Surface coal mining operations will affect fragile lands in which the surface coal mining operations could result
in significant damage to important scientific or aesthetic values or natural systems.
2. Surface coal mining operations will affect land in which the surface coal mining operations could result in a substantial
loss or reduction in the long-range availability of water supplies.
3. Surface coal mining operations would be incompatible with local land use plans of the Cumberland Gap National Historical
Park.

<TEXT>
 

4. Surface coal mining operations will affect natural hazard lands in which the surface coal mining could increase
flooding potential in an already flood-prone area.



OSM has identified four possible alternatives that the combined PED/EIS would evaluate:



Alternative 1_Designate the entire petition area as unsuitable for surface coal mining operations.
Alternative 2_Not designate any of the area as unsuitable for surface coal mining operations.
Alternative 3_Designate parts of the petition area as unsuitable for all surface coal mining operations:
A. Designate as unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining operations, including the designation
of selected reserves, those parts of the petition area in which such operations would affect fragile lands and result
in significant damage to important aesthetic values and natural systems.
B. Designate as unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining operations, including the designation
of selected reserves, those parts of the petition area in which such operations would result in a substantial loss
or a reduction of long-range productivity of water supply.
C. Designate as unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining operations, including the designation
of selected reserves, those parts of the petition area in which such operations would be incompatible with existing
local land use plans and programs.
D. Designate as unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining operations, including the designation
of selected reserves, those parts of the petition area in which such operations would affect natural hazard lands.
Alternative 4_Designate the entire petition area as unsuitable for surface coal mining but allow underground mining
with or without certain restrictions.



A scoping comment period is intended to raise the relevant issues to be addressed by the combined document. OSM seeks
public comments in relation to the scope of issues to be addressed by the impact evaluation, including impacts and
alternatives that should be addressed. Written comments should be specific and confined to issues pertinent to the
petition. The public comments received during the scoping period will assist OSM in making decisions on the petition
evaluation and in preparing the PED/EIS. OSM believes that the proposed action is a major Federal action that may significantly
affect the quality of the human environment and may require the preparation of an EIS. OSM additionally gives notice
here that should information or analyses show that the proposed action does not require an EIS, it will terminate the
environmental impact statement process through an appropriate notice in the 

Federal Register

, prepare an environmental assessment, and continue processing of the petition under 30 CFR part 764 and 942.

Revitalizing Base Closure Communities_Base Closure Community Assistance


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Defense, DoD.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The proposed rule publishes for comment the guidance required by section 2908 of the National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 1994. Section 2908 of the Act provides authority for the Secretary of Defense to transfer real property
or facilities available as a result of a base closure, to persons paying the cost of environmental restoration activities
on the property.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In many cases the most difficult obstacle to getting property into productive reuse after a base closes is environmental
restoration, because the Department of Defense cannot convey title to property until this is accomplished. The potential
exists that persons who are interested in developing the property could clean it more quickly and efficiently than
the government. This section provides a proposed rule which in its final form would allow the Department to transfer
a property for the cost of cleanup to persons who agree to perform the environmental restoration. If the estimated
value of the base exceeds the cost of cleanup, the buyer shall make up the difference. The Department of Defense and
the Environmental Protection Agency will continue to consult regarding the implementation of Public Law 103-160,
section 2908.


List of Subjects in 32 CFR Part 91

Accordingly, 32 CFR part 91 is proposed to be amended to read as follows:


PART 91_[AMENDED]



1. The authority citation for part 91 continues to read as follows:

2. Section 91.7 is proposed to be amended by adding a new paragraph (j) to read as follows:


 91.7 

Procedures.


* * * * *



(j) Transfer of real property or facilities to persons paying the cost of environmental restoration activities on
the property.
(1) In many cases the most difficult obstacle to getting property into productive reuse is environmental restoration,
because the Department of Defense cannot convey title to property until this is accomplished. The potential exists
that persons who are interested in developing the property could clean it more quickly and efficiently than the government.
This section proposes instructions to implement a new authority which allows the Department of Defense to transfer
a property for the cost of cleanup to persons who agree to perform the environmental restoration. If the estimated
value of the base exceeds the cost of cleanup, the buyer shall make up the difference.
(2) Section 2908 of Title XXIX of Public Law 103-160 authorizes the Secretary of Defense, at any time before December
1, 1998, to enter into agreements to transfer by deed, real property or facilities at closing installations to a person
who agrees to perform all required environmental cleanup, waste management, and environmental compliance activities.
(3) The authority may be exercised in the following manner:
(i) An agreement to transfer may be executed with any person, provided that person can demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the Secretary concerned the ability to adequately perform all required environmental clean-up, waste management
and environmental compliance activities.
(ii) The property and facilities subject to the agreement must be located in an installation closed or to be closed
under a base closure law, as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and at the time the agreement is executed must
be available exclusively for the use, or expression of an interest in use, of a local redevelopment authority under
Public Law 103-160, section 2905. The reuse contemplated in the agreement must be consistent with the applicable
local redevelopment plan.

(iii) The Agreement may be in any form and transfer any interest allowable under the law of the State in which the property
or facility is located provided, however:
(A) The Agreement may not serve to transfer title by deed in violation of Section 120(h) of the Comprehensive Environmental
Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. 9620(h)).
(B) The Agreement must contain a stipulation that all environmental restoration, waste management and environmental
compliance activities required under Federal and State laws, administrative decisions, agreements (including
schedules and milestones), and regulatory agency concurrences, including those that become effective at any time
during the existence of the Agreement, shall be met by the person with whom the Agreement is to be executed. The environmental
restoration for the Agreement must include activities associated with cleanup of petroleum and its derivatives.
(C) The Agreement shall contain any item or condition that the Secretary of the Military Department concerned considers
appropriate to protect the interests of the United States. Such terms or conditions may include, but are not limited
to, providing continued access to the property and facilities by the U.S. and State and local regulatory agencies;
limitations upon the use to which the property may be put; and, provisions requiring a bond or other form of financial
assurance.
(D) The Agreement must contain a description of the information disclosed to the person to whom the property or facilities
will be transferred on the environmental restoration, waste management and environmental compliance requirements
and activities relevant to the property or facilities. This description shall include any specific information
required by the notice requirements of Section 120(h)(1) of CERCLA (42 U.S.C. 9620(h)).
(E) The Agreement should disclose to the person to whom the property or facilities will be transferred that the U.S.
will not indemnify, hold harmless or defend that person pursuant to Public Law 102-484, section 330, as amended
by Public Law 103-160, section 1002.
(F) The Agreement may provide for a transfer to occur at any point after all remedial action necessary to protect human
health and the environment has been constructed and installed by the person and the remedy has been demonstrated to
the Military Department concerned and EPA to be operating properly and successfully.
(iv) The consideration for the Agreement must equal the estimated fair market value of the property or facilities
to be transferred, as determined by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned. The consideration may be
in the form of the expected costs of all environmental restoration, waste management, and environmental compliance
activities to be paid by the recipient of the property or facilities. If such expected costs are lower than the estimated
fair market value of the property or facilities, the Secretary concerned shall obtain the difference in other consideration
satisfactory to the Secretary concerned.
(v) Before executing any Agreement authorized by Public Law 103-160, section 2908 the Secretary concerned
must:
(A) Disclose to the person to whom the property or facilities shall be transferred any information under the control
of the Secretary regarding the environmental restoration, waste management and environmental compliance activities
that relate to the property.
(B) Conduct an Environmental Baseline Survey to determine whether there are impediments to the ultimate transfer
of the property.
(C) Make the certification to Congress required by Public Law 103-60, section 2908.
(D) Ensure the consultation with the affected governor and local communities required by a base closure law, as defined
in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, has been conducted.

Clean Air Act Approval and Promulgation of PM-10 Implementation Plan for Colorado 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rulemaking. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In this action, the EPA proposes approval of the State implementation plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Colorado
for the purpose of bringing about the attainment of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate
matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM-10). The SIP was submitted
by the State on May 27, 1993 to satisfy certain federal Clean Air Act requirements for an approvable moderate nonattainment
area PM-10 SIP for Lamar, Colorado. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 I. Background 


Lamar, Colorado was designated nonattainment for PM-10 and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B)
and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act (Act) upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
 (See 56 FR 56694, November 6, 1991 and 40 CFR 81.306.) The air quality planning requirements for moderate PM-10
nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of part D of title I of the Act. The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble''
describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the
Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM-10 nonattainment area SIP requirements (see
generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)). Because EPA is describing its interpretations
here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations
of title I advanced in this proposal and the supporting rationale. In this rulemaking action on the Colorado moderate
PM-10 SIP for the Lamar PM-10 nonattainment area, EPA is proposing to apply its interpretations taking
into consideration the specific factual issues presented. Thus, EPA will consider any timely submitted comments
before taking final action on this proposal. 



Those states containing initial moderate PM-10 nonattainment areas were required to submit, among other things,
the following provisions by November 15, 1991: 1. Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures
(RACM) (including such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption,
at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology_RACT) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993;
2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously
as 
practicable but no later than December 31, 1994 or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable;

3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress
(RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 
4. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM-10 also
apply to major stationary sources of PM-10 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such
sources do not contribute significantly to PM-10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c),
188, and 189 of the Act. 
Some provisions are due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM-10 nonattainment areas were required
to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources of PM-10
by June 30, 1992 (see section 189(a)). Such States also must submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993 which
become effective without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to
achieve RFP or to attain the PM-10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. See section 172(c)(9) and 57 FR
13510-13512, 13543-13544. 


II. This Action



Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565-13566).
In this action, EPA is proposing to grant approval of the Lamar plan revision which was due to EPA on November 15, 1991
and submitted by the State on May 27, 1993. EPA believes the attainment plan for Lamar meets all of the applicable requirements
of the Act. 
Since the Lamar PM-10 SIP was not submitted by November 15, 1991 as required by section 189(a)(2)(A) of the Act,
EPA made a finding pursuant to section 179 of the Act that the State failed to submit the SIP and notified the Governor
in a letter dated December 16, 1991. See 57 FR 19906 (May 8, 1992). After the Lamar PM-10 SIP was submitted on May
27, 1993, EPA found the submittal to be complete pursuant to section 110(k)(1) of the Act and notified the Governor
accordingly in a letter dated June 14, 1993. This completeness determination corrected the State's deficiency and,
therefore, terminated the 18-month sanctions clock under section 179 of the Act.

A. Analysis of State Submission 


1. Procedural Background 


The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan
revisions for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by
a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing.
 Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under
the Act must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing.





The EPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see
section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). The EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51,
appendix V (1992). The EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission.
However, a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA 6 months
after receipt of the submission. 
After providing more than 30 days of prior public notice, the State of Colorado held a public hearing on April 15, 1993
to entertain public comment on the implementation plan for Lamar. The plan for Lamar was subsequently adopted by the
State and submitted by the Governor by letter dated May 27, 1993 as a proposed revision to the SIP. EPA received the submittal
on June 3, 1993. 
The SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with the
completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. The submittal was found to be complete, and a letter dated
June 14, 1993 was forwarded to the Governor indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to be taken
in the review process. In this action, EPA proposes to approve the State of Colorado's PM-10 SIP submittal for
Lamar relative to those moderate area PM-10 SIP requirements due on November 15, 1991 and invites public comment
on the action. 


2. Accurate Emissions Inventory



Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate, current
inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The emissions inventory
should also include a comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of allowable emissions in the area. Because
the submission of such inventories is a necessary adjunct to an area's attainment demonstration (or demonstration
that the area cannot practicably attain), the emissions inventories must be received with the submission (see 57
FR 13539). 
The State of Colorado submitted a winter/spring season emissions inventory for the base year of 1992. A winter/spring
season emissions inventory was calculated because the highest PM- 10 concentrations generally occur in the
winter/spring season in Lamar. The base year inventory identified area sources as the primary cause of high PM-10
concentrations, which contributed 99 percent of the total emissions, with wind erosion from agriculture lands contributing
49 percent, re-entrained road dust from paved and unpaved roads contributing 24 percent, cattle feedlots contributing
15 percent, residential wood burning contributing 8 percent, and point sources contributing 1 percent. The remaining
3 percent of PM-10 emissions was due to emissions from tailpipes, agricultural tilling, and storage piles.
The emission inventory demonstrates that wind erosion from agricultural land is the principal contributor to PM-10
emissions in the Lamar nonattainment area. However, the State and EPA believe that during the conditions when the
PM-10 exceedances have been known to occur (high wind days preceded by warm, dry weather), PM-10 from wind
erosion may be coming into the area from land much farther away than the area modeled by the State in developing the Lamar
PM-10 emissions inventory. Thus, on the high wind days, agricultural emissions not in the immediate area surrounding
Lamar may represent a much greater contribution to total PM-10 emissions in the area. However, emissions from
such sources not in the immediate area surrounding Lamar were difficult to estimate. 
The EPA is proposing to approve the emissions inventory because it generally appears to be accurate and comprehensive,
and provides a sufficient basis for determining the adequacy of the attainment demonstration for this area consistent
with the requirements of sections 172(c)(3) and 110(a)(2)(K) of the Act.
 For further details see the Technical Support Document (TSD). 




3. RACM (Including RACT)



As noted, the initial moderate PM-10 nonattainment areas must submit provisions to assure that RACM (including
RACT) are implemented no later than December 10, 1993 (see sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C) of the Act). The General
Preamble contains a detailed discussion of EPA's interpretation of the RACM (including RACT) requirement (see 57
FR 13539-13545 and 13560-13561). In Lamar, wind erosion from agricultural farmland in the area was identified
as the principal contributor to the PM-10 nonattainment problem, and these emissions will be controlled through
reliance on the soil conservation measures of the Food Security Act (FSA). See e.g., 16 U.S.C. 3801, 3811-
3813.

The FSA, which was enacted in 1985, applies to any farmer participating in a federal farm subsidies program. One of
the main provisions of the FSA requires farmers who cultivate highly erodible land (which includes the majority of
the farmland surrounding Lamar) to develop and implement soil conservation plans. The conservation plan is to document
the decisions of an affected farmer with respect to location, land use, tillage systems, and conservation treatment
measures and schedules. The plan is to be based on the local Soil Conservation Service technical guide, and it is to
be approved by the local soil conservation district. See 16 U.S.C. 3812(a)(2). The law provides that if such a conservation
plan is actively applied by January 1, 1990 or 2 years after the Soil Conservation Service has completed a soil survey
for the farm, whichever is later, affected farmers shall have until January 1, 1995 to comply with the plan without
being subject to ineligibility for certain program loans, payments, and benefits.  
In the area surrounding Lamar, approximately 75-80 percent of the agricultural lands are subject to the soil
conservation requirements. According to the Southeast Regional Soil Conservation Service (SCS) office, all of
the farmers subject to the FSA in the Lamar area have developed conservation plans, and most of the farmers in the Lamar
area have already begun at least partial implementation of these plans.
 The local SCS office has estimated that the implementation of these plans will result in a 70 percent reduction in wind
erosion emissions from the non-irrigated farmland surrounding Lamar (which represents 85 percent of the farmland
subject to the FSA in the Lamar area). 





 While the State is relying on these provisions to reduce the PM-10 emissions from wind erosion in the Lamar area,
the State did not adopt these measures into the SIP or take credit for these control measures. Since these measures
are federally mandated and will be implemented by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, it is not necessary for the State
to adopt these measures into the SIP. No credit was taken for these measures because of the difficulty in estimating
the effectiveness of these measures and, moreover, because no credit was needed to demonstrate attainment or maintenance
of the PM-10 NAAQS in Lamar (see section II.A.4. of this document). Nevertheless, EPA does believe that the provisions
of the FSA will have a significant impact on the emissions from wind erosion from agricultural land in the Lamar area.
 
RACT does not require controls on stationary sources in the Lamar nonattainment area because the point source emissions
in the Lamar area are de minimis, and control of such sources would not expedite attainment and maintenance of the PM-10
NAAQS. See 57 FR 13540, 13543. 

 
There are also Statewide control measures that apply in the Lamar area. Colorado Regulation No. 4 requires new wood
stoves to meet the emission requirements of EPA's Standards of Performance for New Residential Wood Heaters in 40
CFR 60.532(b). Colorado Regulation No. 3 regulates the construction and modification of new stationary sources
of PM-10.
 These measures will help to reduce emissions from new stationary source growth and residential wood combustion.






A more detailed discussion of the individual source contributions, the associated control measures, and an explanation
as to why certain available control measures were not adopted, can be found in the TSD. EPA has reviewed the State's
explanation and associated documentation and concluded that it adequately justifies the control measures to be
implemented. The Lamar PM-10 SIP demonstrates that the area will attain the PM-10 NAAQS by December 31,
1994. By this notice, EPA is proposing to approve Colorado's SIP submittal for Lamar as meeting the RACM (including
RACT) requirement. However, EPA is not proposing action on Regulations No. 3 and 4 because EPA has previously approved
these regulations in separate actions (see the TSD for further information). 



4. Demonstration  


As noted, the initial moderate PM-10 nonattainment areas must submit a demonstration (including air quality
modeling) showing that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December
31, 1994 (see section 189(a)(1)(B) of the Act). Alternatively, the State must show that attainment by December 31,
1994 is impracticable.  
EPA regulations provide that the adequacy of a control strategy to provide for timely attainment must be demonstrated
by means of a proportional model or dispersion model or other procedure which is shown to be adequate and appropriate
(see 40 CFR 51.112(a)). EPA policy specifies that the preferred approach for estimating the air quality impacts of
emissions of PM-10 is to use receptor modeling in combination with dispersion modeling. However, on July 5,
1990, EPA issued guidance providing that, in certain situations, it may be more appropriate to rely on a receptor model
demonstration alone as the basis for the attainment demonstration (see July 5, 1990 memo to Regional Air Branch Chiefs
from Robert D. Bauman, Chief of SO

2

/Particulate Matter Programs Branch and Joseph Tikvart, Chief of Source Receptor Analysis Branch). Lamar met the
criteria discussed in the July 5, 1990 memo to justify using receptor modeling alone and had originally planned to
use this approach in its attainment demonstration. However, after further review, the State determined that the
chemical mass balance (CMB) analysis (i.e., analysis of source contributions from PM-10 monitoring filters)
to be used in the receptor model was inadequate and decided to base the attainment and maintenance demonstration on
simple emissions rollback modeling, which involves using the ratio of the design day ambient concentration of 101
 u g/m3 to the design day emissions and projecting future concentrations.

<DOCNO> FR940406-1-00025 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940406-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


Because the Lamar attainment and maintenance demonstrations did not follow EPA general guidance, the State included
a commitment in the Lamar PM-10 SIP to conduct revised CMB analyses on all filters greater than 100  u g/m3 and
to use this information to assess the adequacy of the SIP. On September 20, 1993, the State submitted the revised CMB
analysis but did not utilize the results in calculating a revised attainment and maintenance demonstration. The
State determined that the receptor modeling performed for Lamar did not provide the conclusive source contribution
information that would be necessary in order to adequately revise the Lamar PM-10 attainment and maintenance
demonstrations. EPA has reviewed the State's analysis and concurs with the State's justification for using emissions
rollback modeling in its attainment demonstration. In addition, because the emissions rollback modeling demonstration
accounted for growth in source categories that were not even identified in the CMB analysis, EPA believes that the
use of emissions rollback modeling provides for a more conservative prediction of future concentrations. Thus,
EPA believes that the State's attainment demonstration adequately demonstrates that the Lamar PM-10 nonattainment
area will remain in attainment and maintain the 24-hour PM-10 NAAQS. (See the TSD for further information.)

 
The 24-hour PM-10 NAAQS is 150  u g/m3, and the standard is attained when the expected number of days per calendar
year with a 24-hour average concentration above 150  u g/m3 is equal to or less than one (see 40 CFR 50.6). The annual
PM-10 NAAQS is 50  u g/m3, and the standard is attained when the expected annual arithmetic mean concentration
is less than or equal to 50  u g/m3 (id.). The demonstration predicted that the 24-hour design concentration in the
attainment year of 1994 will be 115  u g/m3, thus demonstrating attainment of the 24-hour PM-10 NAAQS. The
demonstration also showed that the PM-10 NAAQS will be maintained in future years by predicting a 24-hour design
concentration in 1997 of 116  u g/m3.  
Since no violations of the annual PM-10 NAAQS have been monitored in the Lamar area and since the attainment demonstration
in the Lamar PM-10 SIP clearly shows attainment and maintenance of the 24-hour PM-10 NAAQS, it is reasonable
and adequate to assume that protection of the 24-hour standard will be sufficient to protect the annual standard as
well. For a more detailed description of the attainment demonstration, see the TSD accompanying this document. 



5. PM-10 Precursors  



The control requirements which are applicable to major stationary sources of PM-10 also apply to major stationary
sources of PM-10 precursors, unless EPA determines such sources do not contribute significantly to PM-10
levels in excess of the NAAQS in that area (see section 189(e) of the Act).  
The analysis of the air quality and emissions data for the Lamar nonattainment area indicates that the PM-10
exceedances in the Lamar area are generally attributable to particulate matter emissions from area sources, mainly
windblown emissions from agricultural lands, re-entrained road dust, cattle feed lots, and residential wood combustion.
In addition, the emissions inventory for this area did not reveal any major stationary sources of PM-10 precursors.
Consequently, EPA is proposing to find that major stationary sources of precursors of PM-10 do not contribute
significantly to PM-10 levels in excess of the NAAQS. If finalized, this finding would exclude major stationary
sources of PM-10 precursors from the applicability of PM-10 nonattainment area control requirements.
Further discussion of the analyses and supporting rationale for EPA's proposed finding are contained in the TSD accompanying
this document. Note that while EPA is making a general finding for this area, this finding is based on the current character
of the area including, for example, the existing mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore, that future
growth could change the significance of precursors in the area. The EPA intends to issue future guidance addressing
such potential changes in the significance of precursor emissions in an area. 



6. Quantitative Milestones and Reasonable Further Progress  


The PM-10 nonattainment area plan revisions demonstrating attainment must contain quantitative milestones
which are to be achieved every 3 years until the area is redesignated attainment and which demonstrate RFP, as defined
in section 171(1), toward attainment by December 31, 1994 (see section 189(c) of the Act). RFP is defined in section
171(1) as such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant as are required by part D or
may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment of the applicable NAAQS by
the applicable date.  
In implementing the quantitative milestone and RFP provisions for this initial moderate area, EPA has reviewed the
attainment demonstration for the area to determine the nature of any milestones necessary to ensure timely attainment
and whether annual incremental reductions should be required in order to ensure attainment of the PM-10 NAAQS
by December 31, 1994 (see section 171(1)). Because the Lamar area can demonstrate expeditious attainment of the PM-10
NAAQS without taking credit for the reliance on the soil conservation plans, no further reductions are necessary.
Therefore, EPA believes the Lamar PM-10 SIP satisfies the quantitative milestone and RFP requirement. However,
there will be emissions reductions that occur as a result of the federally mandated soil conservation plans, which
will help to ensure that the area attains and maintains the PM-10 NAAQS.

7. Enforceability Issues 


All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the State and EPA (see sections 172(c)(6), 110(a)(2)(A)
of the Act and 57 FR 13556). The EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated in
a September 23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation,
et al. (see 57 FR 13541). Nonattainment area plan provisions must also contain a program that provides for enforcement
of the control measures and other elements in the SIP (see section 110(a)(2)(C)). 
The specific control measures contained in the SIP are addressed above under section 3 entitled ``RACM (including
RACT).'' The State, while relying on the soil conservation measures of the FSA, has not adopted these measures into
the SIP or taken any credit for these measures. Since these measures are federally mandated and will be implemented
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, they are considered to be federally enforceable. Thus, it is not necessary
for the State to adopt these measures into the SIP. 
As discussed in section 3 above, there are State-wide regulations that will also impact the emissions of PM-10
in the Lamar nonattainment area. These regulations include Colorado Regulation No. 4, which requires all wood stoves
sold after July 1, 1991 to meet the emission requirements of EPA's Standards of Performance for New Residential Wood
Heaters in 40 CFR 60.532(b), and Colorado Regulation No. 3, which requires construction permits for new or modified
stationary sources. EPA previously reviewed Colorado Regulations No. 3 and 4 at the time these regulations were approved
by EPA as part of the SIP, and it was determined that these regulations met the enforceability criteria of the September
23, 1987 Potter Memorandum (see the TSD for information on EPA approvals of these regulations).






The State of Colorado has a program that will ensure that the measures contained in the SIP are adequately enforced.
The Colorado Air Pollution Control Division (APCD) has the authority to implement and enforce all emission limitations
and control measures adopted by the State, including the requirements of any emission control regulations, the SIP,
and any permit. The APCD has the authority to impose civil penalties of up to $15,000 per day per violation, as well as
criminal penalties. Thus, EPA believes the State has adequate enforcement capabilities to ensure compliance with
the Lamar PM-10 SIP and the State-wide regulations. The TSD contains further information on the State-wide
regulations, enforceability requirements, and a discussion of the personnel and funding intended to support effective
implementation of the control measures. 


8. Contingency Measures. 


As provided in section 172(c)(9) of the Act, all moderate nonattainment area SIPs that demonstrate attainment must
include contingency measures. See generally 57 FR 13510-13512 and 13543-13544. These measures were
to be submitted by November 15, 1993 for the initial moderate nonattainment areas. Thus, the measures were due separate
from the requirements addressed in this notice. Contingency measures should consist of other available measures
that are not part of the area's control strategy. These measures must take effect without further action by the State
or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to make RFP or attain the PM-10 NAAQS by the applicable
statutory deadline. The Lamar SIP submittal addressed in this notice did not include any contingency measures. The
State submitted the contingency measures for Lamar as a revision to the SIP on December 9, 1993. EPA will act on the December
1993 submittal in a separate notice.

III. Implications of This Action 


The EPA is proposing to approve the plan revision submitted by Colorado for the Lamar nonattainment area on May 27,
1993 to satisfy those moderate area PM-10 SIP requirements due on November 15, 1991. Among other things, the
State of Colorado has adequately demonstrated that the Lamar moderate PM-10 nonattainment area will attain
the PM-10 NAAQS by December 31, 1994. 
As noted, additional submittals for the initial moderate PM-10 nonattainment areas are due at later dates.
The EPA will determine the adequacy of any such submittal as appropriate. 


IV. Request for Public Comments 


The EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of this proposal. As indicated at the outset of this document, EPA will
consider any comments received by May 6, 1994.



V. Executive Order (EO) 12866 


This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On
January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements
of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The U.S. EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver
for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's
request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on
September 30, 1993. 


VI. Regulatory Flexibility 


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq

., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover, due to
the nature of the federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would
constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids EPA to base its actions
concerning SIPs on such grounds. 

Union Electric Co.

 v. 

U.S. E.P.A.,

 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. section 7410(a)(2). 
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

Indemnities Under the Arts and Artifacts Indemnity Act

 Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities, National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Advance notice of proposed rulemaking.



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking advises the public that the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities
is considering an amendment to the regulations implementing the Arts and Artifacts Indemnity Act, as amended (the
``Act''). The proposed amendment would permit the indemnification of eligible items from the United States while
on exhibition in this country in connection with an exhibition of eligible items from outside of the United States.
The proposed amendment is not intended to bring about a major shift in emphasis of the current policy or practice of
the indemnity program. Specifically, exhibitions consisting solely of domestic items would continue to be ineligible
for indemnification. 



This notice invites comments that will assist the Federal Council in more fully understanding the issues involved
in such a change. The Federal Council particularly invites comments from groups, individuals, and other governmental
agencies involved in the international exhibition process, including museums, private insurers, and professional
and scholarly organizations. The revised rules will be published in the 

Federal Register

 and will be included in guideline packages for prospective applicants and in Certificates of Indemnity. The Catalogue
of Federal Domestic Assistance number for the Arts and Artifacts Indemnity Program is 45-201.

The Federal Council believes that the proposed amendment to the Regulations will significantly enhance its ability
to provide the American public with the benefits of a high quality program of international exhibitions while not
significantly increasing the exposure of the Federal government to pay loss or damage claims nor significantly adding
to the administrative burdens or costs of the program. 

The Federal Council believes that widening the eligibility criteria under the Indemnity Program to include coverage
of U.S.-owned objects in exhibitions that also include foreign-owned loans would provide an important benefit to
U.S. cultural institutions and to the American public. Under the current guidelines, U.S.-owned loans may be indemnified
only when exhibited abroad. The Federal Council believes that if an exhibition of eligible items from abroad meets
the criteria of having educational, cultural, historical or scientific value, and is certified by the Director of
the United States Information Agency as being in the national interest, the U.S.-owned loans to the exhibition also
should be eligible for indemnification. 

The Federal Council wishes to stress that the proposed amendment is not intended to bring about a major shift in the
emphasis of the current policy or practice of the indemnity program. Under the proposed amended regulations, indemnity
coverage would continue to be available primarily for the exhibition of items coming from outside the United States.
It is anticipated that any U.S. loans to such international exhibitions would be a small but important component of
the exhibition. Exhibitions consisting solely of domestic items would continue to be ineligible for indemnification.
The Director of the United States Information Agency would continue to certify that the exhibition of items otherwise
determined by the Council to be eligible for indemnification is in the national interest. 

The Federal Council believes that the proposed modification would not significantly increase the exposure of the
Federal government to claims for loss or damage while providing important additional relief for U.S. borrowing institutions.
This is because coverage during international transit, the time of greatest risk, would not be required for loans
from U.S. lending institutions. Nor does the Federal Council anticipate a significant increase in either the number
of applications to the program or the administrative burdens associated with applying or reviewing indemnification
applications. Under current practice, applicants already are required to include information on domestic loans
in their applications, and indemnity panels consider the educational, cultural, historical or scientific value
of both the domestic and foreign items in determining whether to indemnify an exhibition.

Electronic Filing of Tariffs 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposal to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The ICC is proposing to establish a committee under the Negotiated Rulemaking Act to develop rules for electronic
tariff filing (ETF). The agency is inviting applications and nominations for the committee. The ICC has requested
approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to establish the committee. Although no difficulty in obtaining
approval is anticipated, no committee will be established until approval is obtained. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 After considering the comments filed in response to our last notice in this proceeding, we have decided to proceed
with the planning of a comprehensive ETF system (

i.e

., one that will support EDI and automated analyses). We believe that determining the scope and type of ETF system we
should adopt can best be achieved by initially specifying a comprehensive system in the context of an ongoing effort
to identify the needs that an ETF system should serve and the technologies (including EDI, tariff imaging, and others)
needed to meet them. There is currently no common understanding of what constitutes ETF. As ETF design progresses,
the choices among various benefit and cost packages will become clearer. This will help carriers and shippers to determine
what type of ETF system to support. 



We agree with virtually all of the commenters supporting ETF that extensive industry participation is needed to resolve
the technical and policy issues involved in ETF. We believe the project can best move forward under procedures authorized
by the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990.

1

 The ``Reg-Neg'' Act establishes a framework by which Reg-Neg committees may resolve particular questions that would
otherwise be resolved under traditional, formal rulemaking proceedings. If the committee reaches a consensus

2

 on a proposed rule, it prepares a report to the agency containing the proposal.

3

 The agency typically then publishes the proposal in a notice of proposed rulemaking. 







The Reg-Neg approach seems well-suited to the development of ETF. Many ETF issues will be highly technical and complex.
A Negotiated Rulemaking Committee will allow a core of experts representing the affected interests to work together
on the issues on a continuing basis until consensus is reached. Moreover, a Reg-Neg Committee will be flexible; it
could, for example, choose to host one or more industry conferences to allow different groups to present proposals.
An agency may establish a negotiated rulemaking committee if the head of the agency determines that the use of the procedure
is in the public interest. Reg-Neg Act, section 583(a). In making this determination, the agency must consider whether:


(1) There is a need for the rule; 

(2) There is a limited number of identifiable interests; 

(3) These interests can be adequately represented by persons willing to negotiate in good faith to reach a consensus;


(4) There is a reasonable likelihood that the committee will reach consensus within a fixed period of time; 

(5) The negotiated rulemaking procedure will not unreasonably delay the notice of proposed rulemaking; 

(6) The agency has adequate resources and is willing to commit such resources to the process; and 

(7) The agency is committed to use the result of the negotiation in formulating a proposed rule if at all possible. 

Id. 

For the reasons stated in the decision, we believe these criteria can be met for an ETF undertaking. 



ETF Issues 



As guidance to the Reg-Neg Committee, we will describe our current views on certain ETF issues and the characteristics
of a comprehensive system. We will also instruct the committee, however, not to limit its consideration to this type
of system. Rather, the Committee to identify the needs that an ETF system should serve, should review whatever alternative
technologies it believes may be preferable, and recommend appropriate rules to the Commission. 

We will specifically direct the Committee's attention to the electronic tariff imaging system currently being developed
by the Commission. The tariff imaging system provides for the retention of tariff page images on optical disks, rather
than retaining the printed tariff pages themselves. This system will provide much-improved security for tariff
documents, will greatly reduce the space required to store them, and will offer easier access to tariff information.
The imaging system can be enhanced to provide for the electronic transmission of tariff pages to the Commission, which
will allow carriers to file their tariffs ``electronically'' and avoid the time and expense of processing printed
documents. Therefore, unless EDI and automated analysis capabilities are required for tariff data, the tariff imaging
system (or some enhancement thereof) might offer a satisfactory and less expensive solution. 

Our views on specific issues are as follows: 



Bifurcation Into Separate Rail and Motor Carrier Sub-Dockets



We intend to begin with a unified proceeding, but to authorize the Committee to establish separate sub-groups (for
example, for rail and non-rail) at a later date if necessary.

4

 Some standardization across modes (using American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards, for example)
may be necessary to ensure that one EDI standard can accommodate all tariffs and that one ICC data base structure can
handle all tariffs. Ultimately, however, some data coding standards (commodity codes, etc.) may differ for rail
and motor carriers.

Carrier Sharing of the Commission's Custodial Responsibility for Official Tariff Data 



No commenter has described a shared system which assures protection of official tariff data. Under these circumstances,
we believe we must maintain custody of the data. The Commission will consider future shared custody arrangements
that do adequately ensure data integrity. 

Railroads' proposal to have carriers act as custodian of official tariff data is the most complete of those described,
but it does not contain enough information to permit an evaluation of the adequacy of data security. We have learned
from the undercharge crisis that strict security measures will be required to ensure that carriers cannot make unauthorized
changes to rates. Additionally, it's difficult to tell whether the data in Railroads' system is organized in ways
that would facilitate its use by shippers. It appears that Railroads, in response to an inquiry, can supply their determination
of ``the applicable rate''; however, prior tariff disputes have shown us that the carrier's determination is not
always accurate. Shippers need access to the array of published rates so they can make their own determination of the
correct rate. It is not clear whether or how Railroads' system would respond to such requests. 



Whether ETF Should Be Voluntary or Mandatory 



We reach no conclusion on this issue at this time. 

We will request that the Reg-Neg Committee consider it and make a recommendation. 



Other ETF System Design Issues 



We anticipate that the recommendations from the Reg-Neg Committee will encompass ETF system design issues. Particularly
in light of the lack of detail in the comments, we agree with commenters that further consultations are required before
such decisions can be made. 



Whether General Standards or Detailed Publishing Regulations Are More Appropriate for Printed Tariffs 



We will retain the status quo (general standards for rail tariffs and detailed regulations for other tariffs) while
ETF issues are being considered. The primary focus of this proceeding is on ETF; very few commenters address the printed
tariff issue; and we see no need to deal extensively with printed tariff issues at this time. 



Characteristics of a Comprehensive ETF System



While we expect the Reg-Neg Committee to thoroughly consider design issues and recommend appropriate regulations
to the Commission, we offer the following comments on what might be appropriate for a comprehensive ETF system (

i.e.

, one that will support EDI and automated analyses): 

1. Rates would be filed in a data base-oriented format with defined, computer readable codes designating origins,
destinations, commodities, and other conditions of rate application (such as minimum weight, special packaging
requirements, etc.). 

2. Although data coding standards should be required in a comprehensive system, additional analysis is necessary
to determine whether a common standard data coding structure should be required for all filers or whether different
standard structures should be adopted for rail, motor and/or water carriers. 

3. Although the publication of rules and accessorial charges in computer ratable formats is desirable, we do not believe
we should require that they be published in this manner. 

4. Only raw ETF data should be made available from the Commission. Whether the Commission would develop software to
automatically analyze rates would depend on whether the Commission needs such software for agency operations. 

5. The system should utilize ANSI EDI standards. We note FMC's contention that ANSI standards do not include all of
the fields required for tariff filing purposes, and hope that the ANSI standards can be expanded to meet such requirements
and enable us to avoid proprietary formats. 

6. We do not believe we should include a requirement that our ETF system be capable of determining the rates applicable
to particular movements. This determination does not, however, eliminate the need for data standards and standardized
EDI formats, since they will be required to enable shippers and carriers to automatically process ETF data. 



Establishing the Reg-Neg Committee 



We request the public to address in particular the interests that should be represented on the Committee (First notice).
As described more fully below, we are also soliciting volunteers

5

 to serve on the Committee. When OMB approves the Committee, we will publish another notice (Second notice) listing
the interests that are likely to be significantly affected by a rule; the persons proposed to represent such interests
and the persons or person proposed to represent the agency; and a proposed agenda and schedule for completing the work
of the committee, including a target date for publication by the agency of a proposed rule for notice and comment. See
Reg-Neg Act, section 584(a).

6

 The public will be asked to comment, particularly on the composition of the Committee and whether all interests are
represented, and will have another opportunity to volunteer to participate. We anticipate that the first meeting
of the Committee will occur some time during the summer. 





As indicated above and in the Reg-Neg Act, a negotiated rulemaking committee must contain members representing all
interests that will be affected by the rule. Membership is generally limited to 25, unless the agency determines that
a greater number is necessary for the functioning of the committee or to achieve balanced membership. Reg-Neg Act,
section 585(b). A committee must include at least one person representing the agency.

Light Truck Average Fuel Economy Standards, Model Years 1998-2006 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Department of Transportation (DOT). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM). 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In a final rule published elsewhere in today's edition of the 

Federal Register

, NHTSA is establishing light truck average fuel economy standards for model years 1996 and 1997. The purpose of this
advance notice is to announce that the agency is beginning to develop a proposal for light truck average fuel economy
standards for model years after 1997, and to request comments to assist the agency in developing the proposal. NHTSA
plans to propose standards for some or all of model years 1998 to 2006. The agency is seeking information that will help
it assess the extent to which manufacturers can improve light truck fuel economy during the period in question, the
benefits and costs to consumers of improved fuel economy, the benefits to the nation of reducing fuel consumption,
and the number of model years that should be covered by the proposal.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Introduction 



In December 1975, Congress enacted the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) because of a national concern with
the depletable nature and uncertain availability of most of the energy upon which the Nation relies for its economic
and social well being, and the need to implement a national program for conserving energy. Among other things, EPCA
added Title V, ``Improving Automotive Efficiency,'' to the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (Cost
Savings Act). Title V provides for the establishment of corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards for passenger
cars and light trucks. 

While Title V provides that the CAFE standard for passenger cars is 27.5 mpg for each model year after model year (MY)
1984 unless NHTSA amends it, the statute does not specify any particular level of light truck CAFE standards. Instead,
Title V requires the agency to set light truck CAFE standards for each model year, at least 18 months before the beginning
of the model year. In a final rule published elsewhere in today's edition of the 

Federal Register

, NHTSA is establishing light truck CAFE standards for MYs 1996 and 1997 at 20.7 mpg. The final rule follows a notice
of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) published by the agency in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 61377) on December 24, 1992. That NPRM did not address standards for model years after 1997. 

With the rulemaking for the MYs 1996-1997 light truck CAFE standards completed, NHTSA is turning its attention
to developing a proposal for light truck average fuel economy standards for model years after MY 1997. While the agency
has in the last decade set light truck CAFE standards for only one or two model years at a time, it believes that it may
be appropriate now to set standards for a much longer period, i.e., for some or all of the period including MYs 1998 to
2006. 

Since the early 1980's, NHTSA has established light truck CAFE standards as little as 18 months and not more than 30
months before the beginning of the model year. The effect of this practice has been to limit the CAFE increases that
could be required because there was insufficient leadtime for the manufacturers to change their product plans and
improve their light truck fuel economy by means of significant technological improvements. In this period, the light
truck CAFE standard changed very little. For MY 1984, it was 20 mpg; for MY 1994, it is 20.5 mpg. 

NHTSA explained the impact of such limited leadtime as follows in its December 1992 NPRM to establish the MYs 1995-97
light truck CAFE standards: 




NHTSA recognizes that the leadtime necessary to implement significant improvements in engines, transmissions,
aerodynamics and rolling resistance is typically at least three years. Also, * * * once a new design
is established and tested as feasible for production, the leadtime necessary to design tools and test components
is typically 30 to 36 months. Some potential major changes may take even longer. Leadtimes for new vehicles are usually
at least three years. Further, light trucks have a long model life, i.e., 8-10 years or more. If a manufacturer
must make a major model change ahead of its normal schedule, this change may have a significant, unprogrammed impact.


Given the leadtime constraints, the agency does not believe that manufacturers can achieve significant improvements
in their projected CAFE levels for these model years by additional technological actions.

57 FR 61379, December 14, 1992. The agency notes that manufacturers commenting on the December 1992 NPRM argued that
the leadtimes discussed above are more typical for passenger cars and that light truck leadtimes are even longer.




If the upcoming light truck CAFE rulemaking is to be effective in encouraging manufacturers to improve their light
truck fuel economy by means of significant technological improvements, it must address model years for which the
manufacturers would have substantial leadtime. Thus, the rulemaking must address model years well beyond MY 1997,
the last model year for which a standard has been established. 

There are several reasons why it appears necessary now for the agency to change the way it has been setting light truck
CAFE standards and to establish them high enough and far enough in advance to require significant fuel economy improvements.


First, the need of the Nation to conserve energy is increasing. The import share of oil is growing, as is the percentage
from Arab OPEC sources. The United States imported 15 percent of its oil needs in 1955. The import share reached 36.8
percent in 1975, the year EPCA was passed, and peaked at 46.4 percent in 1977, at a cost of $91 billion (stated in 1992
dollars). Although the share declined to below 30 percent in the mid-1980's, lately the United States has again become
increasingly dependent on imported oil. In 1992, imports totaled 43.6 percent. The Department of Energy projects
that imports will rise to between 52 percent and 72 percent of total use in 2010. 

Thus, the United States now imports a higher percentage of its oil needs than it did during 1975, the year EPCA was passed.
Despite the establishment of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the late 1970s, concern still exists over the stability
of the oil import supply. The trend during the 1980s toward increasing diversity in sources of oil imports appears
to be reversing. In 1975, OPEC accounted for 61 percent of U.S. oil imports; by 1984, OPEC's share had dropped to 43 percent.
However, in 1992 OPEC accounted for 59 percent of U.S. oil imports. Moreover, the percentage of total U.S. oil consumption
supplied by Arab OPEC sources was 11.6 percent in 1992, higher than the 8.5 percent level for 1975. Oil continues to
account for over 40 percent of all energy used in the United States, and 97 percent of the energy consumed in the transportation
sector. Despite legislation such as the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and California's strict ``clean fuel'' and
emissions standards, fuels derived from petroleum will likely remain the predominant fuels in the transportation
sector. 

Domestic oil production has declined steadily since reaching a peak of 10.6 million barrels per day in 1985. By 1992,
it had dropped to 9.0 million barrels per day. Domestic production is expected to continue declining by roughly 200,000
barrels per day each year through the year 2000. While the United States is currently the world's second largest oil
producer, it contains only about three percent of the world's known oil reserves. Persian Gulf countries contain
63 percent of known world reserves, and former Communist countries contain 9 percent. The Department of Energy projects
a continuing decline in domestic oil production to between 3.54 and 6.73 million barrels per day in 2010. 

A second reason why NHTSA believes there may be a need now to change its approach to setting light truck CAFE standards
is the current lack of consumer demand or other market pressure for manufacturers to improve light truck fuel economy.
In the early 1980's, during the energy crisis brought on by events in Iran, gasoline prices rose rapidly. That rise
significantly increased consumer demand for more fuel-efficient vehicles. Thereafter, however, gasoline prices
fell sharply and have remained at very low levels for a decade. Consumers now place much greater emphasis on high performance,
and make little demand for improved light truck fuel economy. Performance levels are now higher than they were when
EPCA was enacted. 

In the absence of strong consumer demand or other market pressure for improved light truck fuel economy, there is no
reason to expect manufacturers to make significant technological improvements for the purpose of improving light
truck fuel economy, absent higher light truck CAFE standards or other government measures. Indeed, light truck CAFE
has not changed appreciably in the last six years and is not expected to do so in the next several years. The average light
truck fuel economy of the domestic manufacturers was 20.5 mpg in MY 1987, and 20.4 mpg in MY 1992, five model years later.
(The import manufacturers' average light truck CAFE, representing a relatively small market share, declined significantly
during this time, from slightly more than 25 mpg in MY 1987 to less than 23 mpg in MY 1992.) Moreover, as discussed in today's
final rule establishing the MY 1996-97 light truck CAFE standards, GM currently projects a MY 1997 CAFE of 20.5
mpg, Ford 21.6 mpg, and Chrysler 20.9 mpg. 

A third reason why effective light truck CAFE standards assume increased importance now is the continued growth in
market share of those vehicles. Light truck production increased from 1.9 million in MY 1980 to 4.1 million in MY 1992.
Data Resources, Inc., projects sales of 6 million light trucks in MY 1998 and close to 7 million by MY 2004. Light trucks
comprised nearly 33 percent of the total light vehicle production in MY 1992, almost double their share in MY 1980.
That share is expected to increase to 39 percent in MY 1998 and 42 percent by MY 2004. As light trucks increase in market
share, so does their impact on energy consumption and the importance of their potential contribution in addressing
the Nation's need to conserve energy.

The impact of the growing light truck population on energy conservation efforts can be more fully appreciated when
the CAFE of the total light truck fleet is compared with that of the total passenger car fleet. The light truck CAFE is
approximately 21 mpg, while the passenger car CAFE is approximately 28 mpg. 
NHTSA also notes that there has been increasing concern in recent years about the impact of cars, light trucks and other
personal vehicles on global warming. There is an almost direct relationship between fuel consumption and emission
of carbon dioxide, a primary ``greenhouse'' gas. In other words, reducing fuel consumption also reduces carbon dioxide
emissions. 
As part of the Administration's Climate Change Action Plan, issued in October 1993, the White House's National Economic
Council, the Office on Environmental Policy and the Office of Science and Technology Policy will co-chair a process
to develop measures to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from personal motor vehicles. The efforts
of the task force may have a bearing on future light truck fuel economy standards. 
NHTSA also notes that the Administration is supporting research in improving vehicle fuel efficiency in a number
of areas, including the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles. However, the purpose of this notice is a limited
one_requesting comments to assist NHTSA in developing a proposal for light truck CAFE average fuel economy standards
for model years after 1997, possibly through MY 2006. To aid the agency in obtaining useful comments, this notice discusses
a variety of issues which are considered by NHTSA in developing a CAFE standard proposal, and asks a number of questions
and makes a number of requests for data. For easy reference, the questions and requests are numbered consecutively
throughout the document. 
In providing a comment on a particular matter or in responding to a particular question, interested persons are requested
to provide any relevant factual information to support their conclusions or opinions, including but not limited
to test data, statistical and cost data, and the source of such information. 
In addition to the questions in the body of this notice, NHTSA is also including an appendix to this notice which consists
of a number of additional questions directed primarily toward light truck manufacturers. The appendix questions
address their product plans through MY 2006 and the assumptions underlying those plans. The agency recognizes that
the manufacturers' product plans may not be approved formally for even the earlier model years addressed in this notice
and that some of the questions may be difficult to answer. Setting standards well in advance instead of only one or two
years in advance necessitates reliance on less definitive information. However, that approach is necessary in order
for the agency to attain greater CAFE improvements. The agency would appreciate answers that are as responsive as
possible so that appropriate weight can be given to the many factors whose magnitude now can only be estimated. While
the questions in the appendix are directed toward manufacturers, the agency welcomes comments from all interested
persons in response to those questions. 


II. The Statute 


Section 502(b) of the Cost Savings Act requires the Secretary of Transportation to issue light truck fuel economy
standards for each model year. The Act provides that the fuel economy standards must be set at the maximum feasible
average fuel economy level. In determining maximum feasible average fuel economy level, the Secretary is required
under section 502(e) of the Act to consider four factors: Technological feasibility; economic practicability;
the effect of other Federal motor vehicle standards on fuel economy; and the need of the nation to conserve energy.
The Secretary is permitted but not required to set separate standards for different classes of light trucks. (Responsibility
for the automotive fuel economy program was delegated by the Secretary of Transportation to the Administrator of
NHTSA (41 FR 25015, June 22, 1976.)
Based on definitions and judicial interpretations of similar terms in other statutes, the agency interprets ``feasible''
to refer to something that is capable of being done. Therefore, a standard set at the maximum feasible average fuel
economy level must: (1) Be capable of being done and (2) be at the highest level that is capable of being done, taking
account of what manufacturers are able to do in light of technological feasibility, economic practicability, how
other Federal motor vehicle standards affect average fuel economy, and the need of the nation to conserve energy.

<TEXT>
 

The statute does not expressly state whether the concept of feasibility is to be determined on a manufacturer-by-manufacturer
basis or on an industry-wide basis. As discussed in many fuel economy notices, it is clear from the legislative history
that Congress did not intend that standards simply be set at the level of the least capable manufacturer. Instead,
NHTSA must take industry-wide considerations into account in determining the maximum feasible average fuel economy
level. NHTSA has consistently set light truck standards at a level that can be achieved by manufacturers whose vehicles
constitute a substantial share of the market. Because of the relatively high volume of production by those manufacturers,
their capability bears a strong and close relationship to that of the industry as a whole. 


III. Issues in Developing a Proposal for MY 1998-2006 


Among the significant issues involved in developing a proposal for the MY 1998-2006 light truck CAFE standards
is the ability of manufacturers to improve their light truck fuel economy during that period. In order to help it analyze
that issue, NHTSA requests information or comments on the questions which follow. 
NHTSA is interested in the technology that will be available for improving fuel economy. It is particularly interested
in technological advancements. For example, the development of two-cycle engines may have progressed to the point
that their introduction to the light truck fleet would be feasible some time in the MY 1998-2006 period. Another
example is the development of aluminum and nonmetal composites for automotive applications. These high performance
materials, which have become less expensive, are providing new opportunities for lightweight, high-performance
automotive components. The Miller cycle engine or other variations on the internal combustion engine may offer improvements
in fuel economy. 
1. What is the technological feasibility and economic practicability of the various fuel efficiency enhancing technologies,
including, but not limited to each of the following, which were noted in the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) study
discussed below: Multi-valve and variable valve timing engines; electronic engine controls; port fuel injection;
lean burn-fast burn combustion; engine friction reduction; two-stroke engines; turbocharging; improved transmissions,
including continuously variable transmissions and electronic controls; redesigning vehicles for weight reduction
and aerodynamic enhancement; substitution of lighter-weight materials; lowering rolling resistance; low-friction
lubricants; and reducing parasitic losses, for improving manufacturers' CAFE for MY 1998-2006? In answering
this question, please address, for each of these technologies, as well as any other relevant technologies not yet
available: 
(a) The impact on fuel efficiency; 
(b) Costs and benefits to the consumer; 
(b) Manufacturer costs; 
(c) Leadtime; 
(d) Potential fleet penetration. 
2. What is the cost-effectiveness of each technology identified in Question 1, as well as any other relevant technologies,
assuming alternative plausible gasoline prices forecast for MY 1998-2006, and assuming alternative payback
periods ranging from 3 years to 10 years? 
3. Taking into account the response to Question 1, indicate the ability of each manufacturer to improve its light truck
CAFE for each model year during the MY 1998-2006 timeframe. By what model year would maximum penetration of all
current fuel economy enhancing technologies be feasible? Why wouldn't such maximum penetration be feasible earlier
than that model year? 
4. What analyses of manufacturer light truck fuel economy capabilities for MY 1998-2006 are available? What
are the strengths and weaknesses of each such analysis?

NHTSA notes that, in 1991, it joined with the Federal Highway Administration in commissioning the NAS to estimate
the practically achievable levels of fuel economy for various classes of passenger cars and light trucks. The NAS
report, Automotive Fuel Economy_How Far Should We Go?, was published in April 1992. NAS did not reach conclusions
on what the ``practically achievable'' levels of fuel economy were because it stated that it could not determine the
correct balance of the variables that would affect such an estimate. The variables include the ``technically achievable''
levels of fuel economy (described below), the economic effects in terms of jobs, higher vehicle prices, and competitiveness,
the effects on vehicle safety and petroleum consumption, etc. 
The NAS report did venture to offer ``technically achievable'' predictions of fuel economy capabilities in MYs 2001
and 2006. The ``technically achievable'' values were based on certain assumptions. The assumptions were that only
currently existing technologies would be used, that fleets would meet the Tier I emissions standards of the Clean
Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990, that vehicle interior volume and acceleration performance would be equivalent
to those of the MY 1990 fleet, and that the technologies used would be cost-effective at gasoline prices of $5-10
or less. 
NAS offered two estimates for the light truck fleet for both MYs 2001 and 2006. One estimate was given with a high degree
of confidence that the light truck fleet could achieve such a level. The other estimate, for a higher CAFE level, was
given with a lower degree of confidence that the fleet could achieve that level due to unidentified uncertainties.
These values are as follows: 






The figures in the table have several limitations. They do not represent the capability of any particular manufacturer.
Instead, they are intended to represent the light truck fleet as a whole. However, the fleet used by NAS did not include
all light trucks. The fleet included small pickups, small vans, small utility vehicles, and large pickups, but not
large vans and large utility vehicles. While those last two types of vehicles make up a small percentage of the light
truck market, they have low fuel economies. 
NHTSA is particularly interested in receiving comments concerning the NAS report and whether, and how, it should
be used in rulemaking for the MY 1998-2006 light truck CAFE standards. 
Energy and Environmental Analysis, Inc. has prepared a report for the Department of Energy that analyzes the domestic
manufacturers' light duty truck fuel economy potential to 2005. NHTSA is including it in the docket for this notice,
and would welcome comments on the relevance of the report to this rulemaking. 
NHTSA and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have mandated a number of safety and emissions standards for
light trucks that become effective in the next few years and that are likely to contribute to increased weight (and,
hence, decreased fuel economy) and increased cost of these vehicles. Among the safety requirements are the addition
of air bags (which phase-in through MY 1999), quasi-static side impact protection (by MY 1995), roof crush resistance
(by MY 1995), and interior head impact protection (with an effective date to be determined). The Clean Air Act Amendments
mandated a phase-in of more stringent emission standards for light trucks. The U.S. has agreed under the Montreal
Protocol to phase-out the chloroflourocarbons used in vehicle air conditioners. This will result in somewhat heavier
and less efficient air conditioners. Finally, EPA has also issued several final rules relating to test procedures
which could require calibration changes that reduce fuel economy and to onboard diagnostics which could add weight.

5. To what extent are other Federal standards likely to affect manufacturers' CAFE capabilities in MYs 1998-2006?
Answers to this question should include not only the effects of such standards when first implemented, but also the
prospect for reducing those effects subsequently.

6. Assuming that NHTSA establishes a single light truck CAFE standard for each of MYs 1998-2006, what would be
the manufacturers' responses to CAFE standards set at alternative levels, and what would the energy savings be from
those levels? For example, what would be the effect of setting a CAFE standard at x^y mpg versus x mpg versus x+y mpg for
a given model year? NHTSA requests that, at a minimum, commenters answer the questions in this paragraph based on the
standard levels discussed in the NAS report. 
Another issue that the agency must consider in setting light truck CAFE standards is the basic structure of the standards.
As indicated above, Title V provides the agency with discretion concerning whether to establish a single standard
for all light trucks or separate standards for different classes of light trucks. While NHTSA has in the past used its
authority to set separate standards for different classes of light trucks, most notably for two-wheel drive and four-wheel
drive light trucks, it has more recently established a single standard for all light trucks. 
A single standard has the advantage of maximizing manufacturer flexibility, e.g., enabling a manufacturer to decide
where in its light truck fleet to make fuel efficiency improvements. On the other hand, since the agency sets standards
at a level that can be achieved by manufacturers whose vehicles constitute a substantial share of the market, it is
possible that a single large manufacturer with a mix toward larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles could skew the single
standard downward for the entire industry. It might be possible to address this potential problem by establishing
separate standards for different classes of light trucks. The agency requests comments on the following question:

7. For MYs 1998-2006, should NHTSA propose a single standard for all light trucks or separate standards for different
classes of light trucks? Should the answer to this question vary depending on the extent to which the CAFE capabilities
of manufacturers differ? If the agency should propose separate standards for different classes of light trucks,
how should the different classes be defined? 
In the final rule issued today establishing light truck CAFE standards for MYs 1996-1997, NHTSA stated it believes
that CAFE standards for the last decade have not had any measurable effect on light truck weight or size; and, hence,
safety. In support of that belief, the agency noted that the levels of the light truck CAFE standards have not varied
significantly for more than a decade. The light truck CAFE standards for MY 1987-89 and MY 1994 were set at 20.5
mpg, and, as far back as MY 1984, the standard was only slightly lower at 20.0 mpg. NHTSA also noted that, in setting the
light truck CAFE standards over the last decade, the agency has not included in its analyses of manufacturer capabilities
any product plan actions that would significantly affect the weight, size or cost of the vehicles the manufacturers
planned to offer. Further, the average equivalent test weight of light trucks increased from 3,805 pounds in MY 1984
to 4,200 pounds in MY 1993. 
8. NHTSA requests comments on the extent to which the increases in light truck CAFE feasible during MYs 1998-2006
involve means, such as significant weight or size reduction, that could adversely affect safety. Would achievement
during that period of NAS' estimated ``technically achievable'' levels necessarily depend on such means? 
In setting CAFE standards, the agency takes into consideration that there are often technological risks associated
with actually achieving the full potential fuel economy improvement from a particular type of technology. 
9. How should the agency take technological risks into account in setting the light truck CAFE standards? What technological
risks are associated with gaining the full potential fuel economy improvements from any of the available types of
fuel economy enhancing technologies? What are the prospects for overcoming those risks or offsetting their effects
on CAFE capability? 


IV. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 


A. Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and the Departmental Regulatory Policies and Procedures



This rulemaking was reviewed under E.O. 12866. The agency has considered the potential economic implications of
this rulemaking and determined that it is significant within the meaning of the Department's regulatory policies
and regulatory procedures. A preliminary regulation evaluation has been prepared for this notice and placed in the
public docket. 


B. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism) 


This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that it is likely that CAFE standards for MYs 1998-2006 will not have sufficient Federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 


C. Civil Justice Reform 


This rule, when proposed, would not have any retroactive effect. Under section 509(a) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 2009(a)),
whenever a Federal motor vehicle fuel economy standard is in effect, a state may not adopt or enforce any law or regulation
relating to fuel economy standards or average fuel economy standards applicable to vehicles covered by the Federal
standard. Under section 509(b) of the Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2009(b)), a state may not require fuel economy labels
on vehicles covered by section 506 of the Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2006) which are not identical to those required
by the Federal requirement. Section 509 does not apply to vehicles procured for the State's use. Section 504 of the
Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2004) sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending
or revoking Federal average fuel economy standards. That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration
or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court.

<ACTION>
action: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing to amend
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to add specific guidance on overhead-should cost reviews. This regulatory
action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September
30, 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Background



The General Accounting Office (GAO) report dated October 30, 1991, entitled ``Economy and Efficiency Audits Can
Help Reduce Overhead Costs'', recommends that regulations be revised to provide guidance for the use of overhead
should-cost reviews.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq., 

because contracts awarded to small entities normally are not subject to program or overhead should-cost reviews.
An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small
businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will
also be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C.
601, 

et seq. 

(FAR case 92-17), in correspondence. 



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.

Therefore, it is proposed that 48 CFR part 15 be amended as set forth below:



PART 15_CONTRACTING BY NEGOTIATION



1. The authority citation for 48 CFR part 15 continues to read as follows:






Authority:

 40 U.S.C. 486(c); 10 U.S.C. chapter 137; and 42 U.S.C. 2473(c).




2. The heading of section 15.810 is revised and the text is removed, and sections 15.810-1 thru 15.810-3
are added to read as follows:



15.810

Should-cost review.



15.810-1

General.



(a) Should-cost reviews are a specialized form of cost analysis. Should-cost reviews differ from traditional evaluation
methods. During traditional reviews, local contract audit and contract administration personnel primarily base
their evaluation of forecasted costs on an analysis of historical costs and trends. In contrast, should-cost reviews
do not assume that a contractor's historical costs reflect efficient and economical operation. Instead, these reviews
evaluate the economy and efficiency of the contractor's existing work force, methods, materials, facilities, operating
systems, and management. These reviews are accomplished by a multi-functional team of Government contracting,
contract administration, pricing, audit, and engineering representatives. The objective of should-cost reviews
is to promote both short and long-range improvements in the contractor's economy and efficiency in order to reduce
the cost of performance of Government contracts. In addition, by providing rationale for any recommendations and
quantifying their impact on cost, the Government will be better able to develop realistic objectives for negotiation.

(b) There are two types of should-cost reviews_program should-cost review (see 15.810-2) and overhead should-cost
review (see 15.810-3). An overhead should-cost review may be performed independently, or in conjunction with
a program should-cost review. The scope of a should-cost review can range from a large-scale review examining the
contractor's entire operation (including plant-wide overhead and selected major subcontractors) to a small-scale
tailored review examining specific portions of a contractor's operation.



15.810-2

Program should-cost review.



(a) Program should-cost review is used to evaluate significant elements of direct costs, such as material and labor,
and associated indirect costs, usually incurred in the production of major systems. When a program should-cost review
is conducted relative to a contractor proposal, a separate audit report on the proposal is required.

(b) A program should-cost review should be considered, particularly in the case of a major system acquisition (see
part 34), when_

(1) Some initial production has already taken place;

(2) The contract will be awarded on a sole-source basis;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940406-1-00052 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940406-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) There are future year production requirements for substantial quantities of like items;

(4) The items being acquired have a history of increasing costs;

(5) The work is sufficiently defined to permit an effective analysis and major changes are unlikely;

(6) Sufficient time is available to plan and conduct the should-cost review adequately; and

(7) Personnel with the required skills are available or can be assigned for the duration of the should-cost review.

(c) The contracting officer should decide which elements of the contractor's operation have the greatest potential
for cost savings and assign the available personnel resources accordingly. While the particular elements to be analyzed
are a function of the contract work task, elements such as manufacturing, pricing and accounting, management and
organization, and subcontract and vendor management are normally reviewed in a should-cost review.

(d) In acquisitions for which a program should-cost review is conducted, a separate program should-cost review team
report, prepared in accordance with agency procedures, is required. Field pricing reports are required only to the
extent that they contribute to the combined team position. The contracting officer shall consider the findings and
recommendations contained in the program should-cost review team report when negotiating the contract price. After
completing the negotiation, the contracting officer shall provide the administrative contracting officer (ACO)
a report of any identified uneconomical or inefficient practices, together with a report of correction or disposition
agreements reached with the contractor. The contracting officer shall establish a follow-up plan to monitor the
correction of the uneconomical or inefficient practices.

(e) When a program should-cost review is planned, the contracting officer should state this fact in the acquisition
plan (see part 7, subpart 7.1) and in the solicitation.



15.810-3 

Overhead should-cost review.



(a) An overhead should-cost review is used to evaluate indirect costs, such as fringe benefits, shipping and receiving,
facilities and equipment, depreciation, plant maintenance and security, taxes, and general and administrative
activities. It is normally used to evaluate and negotiate a forward pricing rate agreement (FPRA) with the contractor.
When an overhead should-cost review is conducted, a separate audit report is required.

(b) The following factors should be considered when selecting contractor sites for overhead should-cost reviews:

(1) Dollar amount of Government business;

(2) Level of Government participation;

(3) Level of noncompetitive Government contracts;

(4) Volume of proposal activity;

(5) Major system or program;

(6) Mergers, acquisitions, takeovers; and

(7) Other conditions, e.g., changes in accounting systems, management, or business activity.

(c) The objective of the overhead should-cost review is to evaluate significant indirect cost elements in-depth,
identify inefficient and uneconomical practices, and recommend corrective action. If it is conducted in conjunction
with a program should-cost review, a separate overhead should-cost review report is not required. However, the findings
and recommendations of the overhead should-cost team, or any separate overhead should-cost review report, shall
be provided to the ACO. The ACO should use this information to form the basis for the Government position in negotiating
a FPRA with the contractor. The ACO shall establish a follow-up plan to monitor the correction of the uneconomical
or inefficient practices.

Federal Acquisition Regulation; Nonprofit Institutions Clause Prescription



AGENCIES: 

Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA).




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing to revise
the prescriptions for use of the clauses Termination of Defined Benefit Pension Plans, and Reversion or Adjustment
of Plans for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, and to clarify the language in the clauses. This regulatory
action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September
30, 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Background



The wording of the prescriptions at 15.804-8 (e) and (f) currently implies that the clauses at 52.215-27,
Termination of Defined Benefit Pension Plans, and 52.215-39, Reversion or Adjustment of Plans for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions, should also be used in solicitations and contracts with noncommercial organizations.
The clauses refer to the cost principles applicable to commercial organizations in FAR subpart 31.2, whereas OMB
Circulars A-21, A-87, and A-122 contain the cost principles governing contracts with noncommercial
organizations. In addition, the prescriptions currently contain dissimilar criteria concerning the use of the
clauses in preaward or postaward cost situations. The proposed revisions to the prescriptions at 15.804-8
(e) and (f) will correct these inconsistencies and clarify when the clauses at 52.215-27 and 52.215-39
should be used. Additional revisions to the clauses clarify the requirements specified in them.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

, because most contracts awarded to small businesses are awarded on a competitive, fixed-price basis and the cost
principles do not apply. An analysis of data available for fiscal years 1989 through 1991 reveals that, in the Department
of Defense, the number of contract actions awarded to small businesses which required the submission of cost or pricing
data averaged less than 1 percent of the total number of small business actions during the three-year period. In addition,
for other than small business entities, any impact on such entities is considered to flow from the respective cost
principles contained in the governing OMB Circular (

i.e.

, A-21, Cost Principles for Educational Institutions; A-87, Cost Principles for State and Local Governments;
and A-122, Cost Principles for Nonprofit Organizations). An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has,
therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered
in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601,


et seq.

 (FAR case 92-10), in correspondence.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.

PART 15_CONTRACTING BY NEGOTIATION



2. Section 15.804-8 is amended by revising paragraphs (e) and (f) to read as follows:



15.804-8

 Contract clauses.



* * * * *



(e) 

Termination of Defined Benefit Pension Plans.

 The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.215-27, Termination of Defined Benefit Pension Plans,
in solicitations and contracts for which it is anticipated that certified cost or pricing data will be required or
for which any preaward or postaward cost determinations will be subject to (FAR) 48 CFR part 31.

(f) 

Postretirement Benefit Funds.

 The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.215-39, Reversion or Adjustment of Plans for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions (PRB), in solicitations and contracts for which it is anticipated that certified cost
or pricing data will be required or for which any preaward or postaward cost determinations will be subject to (FAR)
48 CFR part 31.



PART 52_SOLICITATION PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT CLAUSES



3. Section 52.215-27 is revised to read as follows:



52.215-27

 Termination of Defined Benefit Pension Plans.



As prescribed in 15.804-8(e), insert the following clause:



Termination of Defined Benefit Pension Plans (Date)



The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing when it determines that it will terminate
a defined benefit pension plan or otherwise recapture such pension fund assets. If pension fund assets revert to the
Contractor or are constructively received by it under a termination or otherwise, the Contractor shall make a refund
or give a credit to the Government for its equitable share of the gross amount withdrawn. The Government's equitable
share shall reflect the Government's participation in pension costs through those contracts for which certified
(see section 15.804 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)) cost or pricing data were submitted or which are
subject to FAR part 31. The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause in all subcontracts under this contract
which meet the applicability requirements of FAR 15.804-8(e).




(End of clause)




4. Section 52.215-39 is revised to read as follows:



52.215-39

 Reversion or Adjustment of Plans for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (PRB).



As prescribed in 15.804-8(f), insert the following clause:



Reversion or Adjustment of Plans for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (PRB) (Date)



The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing when it determines that it will terminate
or reduce a PRB plan. If PRB fund assets revert, or inure, to the Contractor or are constructively received by it under
a plan termination, reduction, or otherwise, the Contractor shall made a refund or give a credit to the Government
for its equitable share of any amount of previously funded PRB costs which revert or inure to the Contractor. Such equitable
share shall reflect the Government's previous participation in PRB costs through those contracts for which certified
(see section 15.804 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)) cost or pricing data were submitted or which are
subject to FAR part 31. The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause in all subcontracts under this contract
which meet the applicability requirements of FAR 15.804-8(f).

(NASA).




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing amending
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to expand the circumstances when subcontracting plans may be required
and negotiated with more than the apparently successful offeror and to prescribe an Alternate II to the clause Small
Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan to be used when contracting by negotiation and subcontracting
plans are required with initial proposals. The intent of this proposal is to ensure that small and small disadvantaged
business concerns are being afforded the maximum practical subcontracting opportunities consistent with statutory
requirements and acquisition objectives. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget
review pursuant to Executive Order 12866, dated September 30, 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


A. Regulatory Flexibility Act




The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq

., because subcontracting plans are not required from small business concerns. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will
be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite
5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq

. (FAR case 92-19), in correspondence.


B. Paperwork Reduction Act




The Paperwork Reduction Act   
(Pub. L. 96-511) is deemed to apply because the proposed rule contains information collection requirements.
Accordingly, a request for approval of revised burden estimates for Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Clearance
Number 9000-0006 is being submitted to OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq

. Public comments concerning this request are invited through a notice document in this

Determining the need for a subcontracting plan. 



* * * * * 



(d) In solicitations for negotiated acquisitions, the contracting officer may require the submission of subcontracting

required, as well as when and with whom plans should be negotiated, the contracting officer shall consider the integrity
of the competitive process, the goal of affording maximum practicable opportunity for small and small disadvantaged
business concerns to participate, and the burden placed on offerors. 

3. Section 19.708 is amended in the first sentence of paragraph (b)(1) by removing the words ``has been'' and inserting
``is''; and at the end of the paragraph by adding a sentence to read as follows:

(DATE). As prescribed in 19.708(b)(1), substitute the following paragraph (c) for paragraph (c) of the basic clause:


(c) Proposals submitted in response to this solicitation shall include a subcontracting plan, which separately
addresses subcontracting with small business concerns and with small disadvantaged business concerns. If the offeror
is submitting an individual contract plan, the plan must separately address subcontracting with small business
concerns and with small disadvantaged business concerns with a separate part for the basic contract and separate
parts for each option (if any). The plan shall be included in and made a part of the resultant contract. The subcontracting
plan shall be negotiated within the time specified by the Contracting Officer. Failure to submit and negotiate a subcontracting
plan shall make the offeror ineligible for award of a contract.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing to amend
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to provide guidance on the use of foreign currency. A corresponding provision
is proposed regarding evaluation of foreign currency offers. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of
Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order 12866, dated September 30, 1993.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Background


This case was opened based on Department of Defense Inspector General Report Number 92-090, May 14, 1992, Impact
of Fluctuating Foreign Exchange Rates on Contract Prices, which found that regulatory guidance does not adequately
address consideration of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation.


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act


The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

, because this rule pertains to contracts entered into and performed overseas, and with rare exceptions, will affect
only foreign concerns. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments
from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 601. Such comments
must be submitted separately and cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.


C. Paperwork Reduction Act


The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.

2. In part 25, subpart 25.5, the heading is revised to read as follows:



Subpart 25.5_Use of Foreign Currency




3. Section 25.501 is revised to read as follows:



25.501 

Policy.




(a) Unless a specific currency is required by international agreement or by the Trade Agreements Act (see 25.405(d)),
contracting officers shall determine whether solicitations for contracts to be entered into and performed outside
the United States will require submission of offers either in U.S. currency or in a specified foreign currency. In
unusual circumstances, the contracting officer may permit submission of offers in other than a specified currency.

(b) To ensure a fair evaluation of offers, solicitations should generally require all offers to be priced in the same
currency. However, if submission of offers in other than a specified currency is permitted, the contracting officer
shall convert the offered prices to U.S. currency for evaluation purposes. The contracting officer shall use the
current market exchange rate from a commonly used commercially available source in effect on date of bid opening or
due date for receipt of final offers. 

(c) If contracts are priced in foreign currency, agencies must ensure that adequate funds are available to cover currency
fluctuations in order to avoid a violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act.

4. Section 25.502 is added to read as follows:



25.502 

Solicitation provision.



The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 52.225-OO, Evaluation of Foreign Currency Offers, in
solicitations if the use of other than a specified currency is permitted. The contracting officer shall insert the
source of the rate to be used in the evaluation of offers.



PART 52_SOLICITATION PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT CLAUSES



5. Section 52.225-OO is added to read as follows:



52.225-OO 

Evaluation of Foreign Currency Offers.



As prescribed in 25.502, insert the following provision:



Evaluation of Foreign Currency Offers (Date)



If offers are received in more than one currency, offers shall be evaluated by converting the foreign currency to United
States currency using (

Insert source of rate

Federal Acquisition Regulation; Insurance_Liability to Third Persons



AGENCIES: 

Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA).




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing to delete
the prescriptive language in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), particularly at ``Solicitation provision
and contract clause on liability insurance under cost-reimbursement contracts''. This regulatory action was not
subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A. Background



The FAR language proposed for deletion at 28.311-1 applies only to cost-reimbursement contracts for research
and development awarded to state agencies or charitable institutions that claim partial or total immunity from tort
liability. For these entities, Alternates I and II of 52.228-7, Insurance_Liability to Third Persons, limit
the contract's insurance requirements and the Government's obligation to indemnify for third party liability.
The Councils believe that the current language is obsolete.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.,

 because the language proposed for deletion applies only to cost-reimbursement contracts for research and development
that are awarded to entities which, by virtue of their status as either an agency of the state or as a charitable institution,
claim partial or total immunity from tort liability under such contracts. These entities are believed to be few in
number. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities
concerning the affected FAR subpart will also be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments
must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

 (FAR case 92-14), in correspondence.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501,

Federal Acquisition Regulation; Nonallowability of Excise Taxes on Nondeductible Contributions To Deferred Compensation
Plans



agencies: 

Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA).




<ACTION>
action: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing to revise
the cost principle concerning taxes. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review
pursuant to Executive Order 12866, dated September 30, 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Background



Under the current FAR 31.205-41(b)(6), excise taxes on accumulated funding deficiencies or prohibited transactions
involving employee deferred compensation plans pursuant to sections 4971 and 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1954, as amended, are unallowable. This reflects a long-standing Government policy that punitive-type excise taxes
are not reimbursable costs on Government contracts. Over the years, subsequent legislation has added several new
excise taxes to subtitle D, chapter 43 of the Internal Revenue Service Code such that the Code currently lists 13 such
taxes. The Councils have agreed that it is appropriate to revise FAR 31.205-41(b)(6) to insert a general prohibition
on all excise taxes found at subtitle D, chapter 43 of the Internal Revenue Service Code. Such a general prohibition
will ensure that future legislative changes to subtitle D, chapter 43 of the Internal Revenue Service Code will be
automatically reflected in the cost principle. 



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq., 

because most contracts awarded to small entities are awarded on a competitive, fixed-price basis and the cost principles
do not apply. An analysis of data available for fiscal years 1989 through 1991 reveals that, in the Department of Defense,
the number of contract actions awarded to small businesses which required the submission of cost or pricing data averaged
less than 1 percent of the total number of small business actions during the three-year period. An Initial Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected
FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately
and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq. 

(FAR case 92-604), in correspondence. 



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information

Federal Acquisition Regulation; Contractors' Purchasing Systems Reviews and Subcontractor Consent


AGENCIES: 

Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA).



<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing amendments
to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to increase certain dollar thresholds regarding Contractors' Purchasing
Systems Reviews (CPSR's) and Subcontractor Consent. These revisions are a result of recommendations submitted
in response to the FAR Council's request for industry's views on the FAR. This regulatory action was not subject to
Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order 12866, dated September 30, 1993.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Background


We raised the threshold for performing CPSR's from $10 million to $25 million to recognize the effects of inflation
on this threshold which had not been changed since 1980. The $25 million threshold will reduce administrative burden
on both the Government and contractors by reducing the number of reviews performed annually and focuses the Government's
attention on large dollar procurement systems.
We raised the $10,000 threshold stated in the clause at 52.244-2(a)(4) to $25,000 for notification to the contracting
officer on proposed subcontracts involving fabrication, purchase, rental, installation, or other acquisition
of special test equipment or any items of facilities to recognize the increased costs of this type of equipment and
the effects of inflation.
We also raised the threshold in the clause at 52.244-2(b)(1) requiring additional information on certain subcontracts
from $10,000 to $25,000. This increase recognizes rising hourly wage rates and contract costs.


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act


The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

, because the rule reduces burden on contractors by reducing surveillance and by increasing dollar thresholds at
which contractors are required to provide notification of intent to subcontract. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will
be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C.
601, 

et seq. 

(FAR case 92-40), in correspondence.


C. Paperwork Reduction Act


The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96-511) is deemed to apply because the proposed rule contains information
collection requirements. Accordingly, a request for approval of a new information collection requirement concerning
Contractors' Purchasing Systems Reviews and Subcontractor Consent is being submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq. 

Public comments concerning this request are invited through a notice document in this 

Federal Register

 issue.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Agricultural Marketing Service, United States Department of Agriculture, proposes to revise its regulations
in 
7 CFR Part 110, governing recordkeeping of federally restricted use pesticides by certified applicators. The regulations
governing recordkeeping of federally restricted use pesticides by certified applicators were published on April
9, 1993, and became effective on May 10, 1993. Since that time, issues have been raised regarding the regulations.
A lawsuit was filed challenging the substance of limited portions of the regulations. The changes specified in the
proposed rule would clarify certain provisions of the regulations, ensure consistency with the objectives of section
1491 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, and provide for a more pragmatic approach to the
implementation of the Pesticide Recordkeeping Program.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act



This rule has been determined to be non-significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been
reviewed by OMB. 

This proposed rule also has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et. seq.

). This proposed rule will (1) clarify certain definitions within the regulations; (2) clarify the availability
of pesticide record information to facilitate medical treatment or first aid; (3) clarify the utilization and release
of pesticide record information by licensed health care professionals; (4) modify the time period by which the information
required by the regulations shall be officially recorded, and (5) ensure uniformity in recording the location of
pesticide applications by removing the distinction between recording spot applications and other applications
of federally restricted use pesticides. We do not anticipate that any of these proposed changes will result in any
significant additional economic impact on certified (private and commercial) applicators of federally restricted
use pesticides.

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has determined that this action
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Executive Order 12778



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If adopted, this proposed
rule: (1) Will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule; (2) will not have any retroactive effect; and (3) will not require administrative proceedings
before parties may file suit challenging this rule.



Paperwork Reduction Act



In accordance with section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507), the recordkeeping provisions
included in this proposed rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), number 0581-0164.
The proposed rule does not change the data elements required for a record or the collection of information.

Background



As part of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (Pub.L. 101-624; 7 U.S.C. 136i-1), hereinafter
referred to as the FACT Act, Congress mandated the establishment, by the Secretary of Agriculture in consultation
with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, of requirements for recordkeeping by all certified
applicators of federally restricted use pesticides. 

Applicator certification programs are administered by EPA, other Federal Agencies, and States. A restricted use
pesticide, as distinguished from a general use pesticide, is one that has been classified as such under the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA, at 7 U.S.C. 136a(d)(1)(C)). EPA regulations issued under FIFRA,
further provide that restricted use pesticides may be applied only by, or under the supervision of, a certified applicator.
Applicator certification requirements are provided in the EPA regulations (40 CFR 171). 

A certified applicator may be a commercial applicator or a 
private applicator. A private applicator is one who uses or supervises the use of any restricted use pesticide for
purposes of producing any agricultural commodity: (1) On property that is owned or rented by the applicator, or the
employer of the applicator; or (2) if applied without compensation other than trading of personal services between
producers of agricultural commodities, on the property of another person. A commercial applicator is one who uses
or supervises the use of a restricted use pesticide for any purpose or on any property other than as provided under the
definition of a private applicator. 

On April 9, 1993, final regulations were published in the 

Federal Register

, ``Recordkeeping Requirements for Certified Applicators of Federally Restricted Use Pesticides.'' These regulations
went into affect on May 10, 1993. USDA proceeded to implement a national program for recordkeeping of federally restricted
use pesticides. One of USDA's first goals was to inform certified pesticide applicators of their responsibilities
under the new regulations. 

Early in the implementation phase of the USDA recordkeeping program, State regulatory agencies and others raised
issues involving specific interpretations of the regulations. A lawsuit was filed against the Secretary of Agriculture
and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency by the National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides
and others. The lawsuit challenged the substance of limited portions of the final regulations promulgated by USDA.
After careful consideration of the issues raised by the lawsuit and a thorough review of the regulations, we agreed
to propose changes to the regulations for the reasons set forth below. 



Proposed Amendments to  110.2 Definitions 



Concerns were raised that the regulation's definition of ``medical emergency'' was too restrictive and could hinder
the medical treatment by licensed health care professionals of an individual(s) who may have been exposed to a federally
restricted use pesticide. It was pointed out that some particular pesticide exposures could require immediate medical
treatment or first aid, but would not meet the criteria of the current definition. It is not the intent of USDA to limit
medical treatment of an individual(s) who may have been exposed to a restricted use pesticide. Because reactions
to some pesticide exposures could require treatment immediately and not fit the current definition of ``medical
emergency,'' USDA is proposing to amend the definition of ``medical emergency'' to read as follows:






Medical Emergency. 

A medical emergency shall be defined as a situation that requires immediate medical treatment or first aid.




Questions also were raised concerning the definition of ``licensed health care professional.'' There was some confusion
as to whether medically trained individuals who had been certified by a State, such as medical technicians on an ambulance
or emergency response vehicle, met the definition. USDA wishes to clarify that individuals that have been licensed
or certified by a State to provide medical treatment are considered to be ``licensed health care professionals.''
Therefore, individuals such as physicians, nurses, physician assistants, or emergency medical technicians, licensed
or certified by a State to provide medical treatment, would fall into the definition of ``licensed health care professionals.''
However, individuals who have been certified only to provide first aid or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) through
organizations such as the American Red Cross would not be ``licensed health care professionals.'' 

In order to clarify this definition, USDA is proposing to amend the definition of ``licensed health care professional''
to read as follows:






Licensed health care professional. 

A physician, nurse, emergency medical technician, or other qualified individual, licensed or certified by a State
to provide medical treatment.

Proposed Amendment to  110.3(a)(6)_Spot Applications


The reduced requirements for recording information for spot applications were intended to provide private certified
applicators with an incentive to record small spot applications on noxious weeds or similar type applications, without
recording each location, due to the usually small amount of pesticide associated with a spot treatment. Concerns
were raised that the spot application record provision does not require a specific location for each spot application,
which could be important information for the purpose of providing first aid or medical treatment. USDA has reviewed
the spot application provision and agrees that, in some instances, the location of spot applications could be valuable
information when needed to determine if a pesticide exposure could have occurred in a field or area. Therefore, we
are proposing to delete  110.3(a)(6). Under the proposed regulations, spot applications would be required
to be recorded in the same manner as are other applications of federally restricted use pesticides. This would provide
field or area locations which could be utilized to help determine if an individual could have been exposed to a federally
restricted use pesticide. 


Proposed Amendment to  110.3(b)_Time for Making an Official Record


USDA has reevaluated the 30 day time period allowed certified applicators to make an official record after concerns
were expressed regarding the accuracy of the records for both collecting information for a pesticide use data base
and for medical treatment if application information was not required to be recorded for 30 days. USDA recognizes
the importance of compiling accurate pesticide use data and believes that data recorded in a shorter time period would
be more accurate. USDA also reexamined existing State requirements for making official records of pesticide applications
for private and commercial certified applicators. We found that many State regulations require applicators to have
records available ``upon request'' which, in some situations, could be interpreted to be immediately after an application.
Therefore, to assure more accurate information for both medical treatment and accuracy of collected data on pesticide
use, USDA proposes to change the time period from 30 days to 7 days. USDA considers the proposed 7 day requirement adequate
to allow the private certified applicator time to make an accurate official record without causing an undue hardship
in peak production periods. This proposed requirement also is less stringent than similar existing State requirements
for recordkeeping in many States. 
Additionally, concerns were raised regarding the certified applicator's responsibility to provide federally
restricted use pesticide information concerning a specific application prior to the time to make an official record
for purposes of providing medical treatment. USDA interprets the current regulations to require certified applicators
to provide the record information for purposes of providing medical treatment or first aid, in accordance with the
provisions of  110.5(a), whether or not the time to make an official written record has elapsed. Nonetheless,
in order to make this clear, we propose to add explicit language to this
