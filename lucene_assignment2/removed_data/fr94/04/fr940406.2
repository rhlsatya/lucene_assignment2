Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA) directed the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) to make
program changes as necessary to improve actuarial soundness of the Federal crop insurance program and to achieve,
by the fiscal year beginning October 1, 1995, a projected overall loss ratio not to exceed 1.10 (110 percent) (section
1501(a)). Section 1501(c)(2) further directed the Department to issue for public comment a comprehensive plan or
``blueprint'' that identifies, among other things:






 Steps FCIC intends to take to achieve a projected overall loss ratio of no greater than 1.10 on and after October
1, 1995.


 Additional steps if further action is required, based upon actual program experience or unforeseen external
circumstances.


 Modifications to be considered if initial actions to improve actuarial soundness work better than anticipated.


 Projections, assumptions, and analyses which underlie the FCIC conclusions that the above actions will achieve
the required loss ratio within the stated deadline while maintaining fairness and effective coverage to agricultural
producers, and which thereby demonstrate FCIC's compliance with the performance standard identified in section
1501(a).


The following notice outlines such a plan. Readers are requested to identify additional issues other than those outlined
herein that they believe are relevant and important in assisting FCIC in its actions to manage the program to achieve
the target loss ratio. This notice encourages comment and participation from the affected public. Comments and inquiries
should be sent to the address listed below.

FCIC establishes premium rates for the various coverage levels, yields, crop types and farming practices (e.g.,
irrigated) for each county. All planted acres of the crop are covered by the insurance policy unless for some reason
the acreage is uninsurable. The premium owed by the insured person is determined by multiplying the average yield
per acre by the coverage level, multiplied by the number of acres planted, the price election, and the premium rate.
For example, if the average yield is 100 bushels per acre, the coverage level is 65 percent, planted acres are 50, the
price election is $2.25, and the premium rate is 5.2 percent, the premium is equal to 100  x  0.65  x  50  x 
$2.25  x  0.052, or $380.25. The potential indemnity in the event of a total loss is $7,312.50 (determined by multiplying
the average yield, coverage level, planted acres, and price election). 

A portion of the total premium is subsidized to encourage participation in the program. The subsidy is 30 percent of
the total premium for coverage levels up to and including the 65 percent level. The subsidy for 75 percent level of coverage
is equal to the dollar amount that would be paid at the 65 percent level of coverage. The premium subsidy for the above
example would be $114.08; thus, the insured person would pay $266.17. The same $114.08 subsidy would be paid if the
insured person chose the 75 percent coverage level. 

In the event of a loss, the amount of production that was harvested, or that was determined should have been harvested,
is measured by the insurer. An indemnity payment is made if the determined production is less than the total guarantee
for the acreage (yield multiplied by coverage level and acres planted). For example, if the insured person harvests
1,000 bushels from 25 acres and does not harvest a potential yield of 10 bushels per acre from the remaining 25 acres,
the total of the production to count is 1,250 bushels (1,000 bushels harvested plus 25 acres multiplied by 10 bushels).
This is subtracted from the total bushel guarantee for the acreage (100  x  0.65  x  50, or 3,250 bushels),
resulting in a loss of 2,000 bushels. The indemnity is equal to the number of lost bushels multiplied by the price election.
For this example, the indemnity would be 2,000 bushels  x  $2.25, or $4,500.

Crop insurance does not guarantee revenue. As the above example illustrates, it provides an insurance indemnity
only if production is less than the established guarantee. No protection is provided if the market price is less than
the price election.



B. Legislative Background and Issues



Federal crop insurance was established as a pilot program in the 1930's. Prior to 1980, crop insurance was available
only on major crops in major producing areas. The coverage level often was limited to 60 percent or less of a long-term
average yield for an area. Congress amended the Act in 1980 to expand the scope and coverage of the program with the intent
that it be the sole means of providing public disaster assistance to U.S. farmers. Participation in the program increased
after the 1980 amendments, but remains below levels deemed necessary to be regarded as the principal vehicle for disaster
assistance. Insured acreage peaked at about 40-45 percent of the total acreage planted to insurable crops in
1988-89, but more commonly has been in the 30-35 percent range. Losses also increased with the expansion
of the program. The loss ratio has exceeded the break-even amount of 1.00 in every year since 1980. Cumulative losses
for the years 1980-1992 were approximately $2.9 billion, with a cumulative loss ratio of about 1.45 for the 13
years.

Program participation is an issue influencing the Federal crop insurance program. Full participation (i.e., 100
percent of eligible acres insured) is the measure of program success that is accepted (at least implicitly) by some
persons. This measure may not be the most appropriate. A rational decision to buy insurance of any kind must be based
on the magnitude of the financial difficulties that accompany a loss. For example, buying collision coverage on a
15-year old automobile makes little financial sense. Similarly, buying insurance on a crop that contributes only
a small portion of the expected income of the insured person may not make financial sense. Full participation in the
crop insurance program may not represent an efficient use of the taxpayer's resources. However, participation must
be high enough to minimize or eliminate perceived needs to legislate disaster assistance funded under dire emergency
provisions of the Budget Enforcement Act. The level of participation in the crop insurance program that maximizes
returns to the public is not known, and is an area needing further definition.

Many losses paid in the 1980's and early 1990's were due to widespread disasters, the adverse financial effects of
which Congress intended to mitigate under the Act. However, continuing loss ratios exceeding 100 percent, enactment
of disaster assistance in nearly every year since 1988, and lower than desirable participation indicate that the
public policy goals of the program have not been fully realized. The Secretary of Agriculture has proposed a reform
of the crop insurance program to:

 Achieve actuarial soundness.

 Increase participation to levels that render ad hoc disaster legislation.

 Eliminate incentives to enact ad hoc disaster assistance legislation.

The proposals contained in this Blueprint focus on these three areas that directly relate to the goal of achieving
the targeted loss ratio. They are:

(1) Actuarial matters such as premium rates and yield guarantees,

(2) Underwriting matters such as terms and conditions of insurance policies, and

(3) Management issues such as compliance and risk-sharing arrangements with commercial insurers.



II. Management Actions To Achieve a Loss Ratio of 1.10



A. Develop More Accurate Insurance Yields



The insurance yield may be the single most important factor in determining the success or failure of the crop insurance
program. A yield that is too high compared to the productive potential of the person or land will increase the number
of years that a loss is paid. An excessively high yield also increases the amount paid when a loss occurs. A yield that
is too low will not effectively protect farmers from loss and, because it is regarded as insufficient, will not induce
desired levels of participation. 

From the 1985 through 1993 crop years, insured yields were based on a program called the Actual Production History
(APH) Plan. The goal of this program was to obtain 10 previous yields to establish the insured yield for the next crop
year. Proxy yields largely based on ASCS farm program payment yields or county averages were allowed whenever farmers
would not or could not provide 10 years of history. Analysis by FCIC and others determined the proxy yields were benefiting
farmers whose yields tended to be lower than average and discouraging farmers whose yields tended to be above average.
Consequently, a modified-APH program that reduced the influence of the proxy yields was introduced beginning with
the 1994 crop year; thus, a ``ladder'' was introduced into the proxy yields. Only 65 percent credit is given to the proxy
yield if no actual yields are reported, 80 percent credit is given if one actual yield is reported, 90 percent if two
actual yields are reported, and 100 percent if three actual yields are reported. The proxy yields are not used after
four actual yields are available. The insured yield is a simple average of the 4 years of actual and modified proxy yields
for the first 4 years, and then (after 4 years) is the simple average of the actual yields reported. Acquiring 10 years
of production history remains the goal of the program. These revised procedures are the core of the initiatives to
comply with the mandate of OBRA 93 to institute rules to demonstrate actual production histories.

The revised rules are expected to substantially reduce losses of the Federal crop insurance program. Analysis performed
by FCIC indicates the new rules would reduce losses by 15 percent for corn, 22 percent for soybeans, and 18 percent for
wheat. These analyses were based on simulations of loss histories using the rules for the two computational methods_the
previous APH and the proposed modified-APH plans. The analyses encompassed nine states each for corn and soybeans
and three states for wheat. These states and crops represented nearly 60 percent of the total premiums earned in 1990.
The results indicated that the modified-APH rules would reduce losses by a weighted average of 19 percent and are believed
to be representative for most crops.

The actual loss ratio for the 1990 crop year was 1.23. If the modified-APH rules did reduce losses by an average of 19
percent, the loss ratio would have been 0.996. This would achieve significant compliance with the loss ratio target
of 1.10. 

Based on these results, FCIC implemented modified-APH for the 1994 crop year by:

 Promulgating regulations for the program during calendar year 1994. 

 Measuring the impact of the modifications upon net program losses by calculating insured yields, premiums,
and indemnities of policyholders under 1993 and 1994 rules. 

 Where possible, determining whether the modified-APH rules had the intended effect of providing a more accurate
offer for farmers who previously elected not to purchase crop insurance. 

 Determining whether the average number of yields reported for prior years has changed under the modified-APH
rules compared with APH rules for 1990 through 1993.

 Implementing a tracking system to assure that insurance experience remains associated with a person in future
years (see item D below). 

 Developing reporting processes to assure that the accuracy of yield determinations is continuously monitored
and improved. 

 Actions requiring analysis of the effects of the modified-APH rules upon the accuracy of insured yields cannot
be completed until losses from the 1994 crop year are processed. For wheat and other fall planted crops, such availability
will occur by about the fourth calendar quarter of 1994. For spring planted crops, this does not occur until about the
middle of the first calendar quarter of 1995.

FCIC believes that these actions to implement modified-APH will reduce the average loss ratio over time by 10-15
percentage points (e.g., from an average of 1.40 for several years to 1.25 to 1.30). This estimate is based on a conservative
expectation of the actual results of the simulations described above.



B. Catastrophic Yield Adjustment



FCIC recognizes that the average of a series of observations as short as 4 years is subject to significant variations
due to abnormally large or small yields during that time. For example, if a major disaster year such as 1993 is included
in the 4 years, the procedure implicitly states that a similar year will occur once every 4 years. This is not likely.
Thus, FCIC will examine certain adjustments to the modified-APH rules with a goal to assign more appropriate probabilities
to the individual observations. These adjustments commonly are called catastrophic yield adjustments. However,
just as the yields for 1 year may be abnormally low, they also may be abnormally high. Capping the abnormally high years
may also be appropriate so that average yields are not excessively high due solely to a few observations.

FCIC will evaluate alternative methods to recognize catastrophic and unusually good crop years, and consider implementing
appropriate adjustments to the modified-APH plan effective for the 1995 crop year.

C. Implement Group Risk Plan



FCIC is implementing a program of insurance that is based on the average yield of an area, not upon individual yield
coverage as is offered under the traditional APH program. The area coverage is called the Group Risk Plan (GRP) by FCIC.
GRP was introduced as a pilot program for the 1993 crop year for soybeans in 96 counties. It was expanded for the 1994
crop year to include seven additional crops encompassing, 1,872 county crop programs (one crop in one county) in 27
states. Crops now included under GRP are barley (three states), corn (17 states), cotton (seven states), forage (two
states), grain sorghum (four states), peanuts (four states), soybeans (24 states), and wheat (eight states).

The GRP is intended to protect the insured person against the financial consequences of a disaster that strikes all
or nearly all farmers in an area. It sets an expected county yield for each year based on historical yields, adjusted
for any trends. Whenever the actual county average yield for the year is less than the expected county yield by a predetermined
amount, an indemnity is paid. The principal differences of the GRP compared to traditional individual coverage area:

 Coverage is based on a trend projected yield, which probably will exceed the average yield of all farmers insured
under individual yield coverage is there is a positive trend in yields for the area.

 Higher coverage levels (deductibles are as low as 10 percent) at affordable premium rates can be sold.

Thus, in the proper circumstances, GRP will offer risk protection that may be better than the individual coverage,
and may do so at a lower cost.

GRP has characteristics that make it unsuitable for managing the adverse financial consequences of crop loss in certain
circumstances. A farmer's yield each year must change in the same direction and by about the same amount as the county
yield if it is to be fully effective coverage for the individual. For example, if the county's yield decreases by 25
percent from the expected yield for that year, the farmer's yield also should decline by about 25 percent from the yield
he or she would have expected. In financial market terms, the ``beta'' or the farmer's yields and the county yields
should be near 1.00.

Adequate data are a limitation to further significant expansion of GRP. The concept as presently developed uses many
years (30 or more) of county yields. These data are routinely available only for counties in which the crop has been
grown in commercially significant quantities. Weather data and crop growth models may permit expansion into counties
in which the historical yield data are not available, but research is needed to develop and test these approaches.
Further, acceptance of GRP by bankers as collateral for loans is yet to be determined. 

Significant expansion of GRP is not anticipated until its contributions to agricultural risk management can be measured.
No estimates of savings can be attributed to GRP because customer acceptance is not known. Customer acceptance of
the soybean GRP for the 1993 crop year was limited. Fewer than 500 policies (of nearly 700,000 total for the crop insurance
program) were sold. Even if the plan improves the actuarial soundness of crop insurance, the present volume of business
is not sufficient to make any noticeable difference in program results.

D. Implement Data Base of Taxpayer Identification Numbers 


Amendments to the Federal Crop Insurance Act enacted in 1990 authorize FCIC to collect and use social security numbers
and employer identification numbers to administer its programs. These regulations were appropriately approved
and were published in the 

Federal Register

 in late 1992. OBRA 93 further directed FCIC to implement a database of these numbers for certain uses not later than
the 1995 crop year. 
FCIC implemented the database described above in January 1994, effective for the 1994 crop year. This database is
used to locate production history that is not reported by a person to assure that classifications assigned under the
nonstandard classification system (NCS_see paragraph E below) are used for both the individual who accumulated
the adverse history and any person having a significant beneficial interest in a crop produced by that person, and
for other related purposes. In particular, further efforts will be made to accumulate information about persons
involved in sales and servicing of crop insurance_agents, loss adjusters, and other insurance providers_so that
their contributions to achieving the target loss ratio can be measured. 
Implementing this database will make both modified-APH and the NCS more effective by permitting FCIC and reinsured
companies to assure that all appropriate experience and premium rating factors are used. Incremental improvement
in the loss ratio due to modified-APH and NCS is difficult to quantify. The database will enhance those programs as
well as permit FCIC to systematically measure the performance of insurance providers for the first time. 
FCIC will also use the social security numbers and employer identification numbers for the implementation of an Ineligible
File Tracking System. This system will be used to restrict (through an automated environment) producers who have
been declared ineligible to obtain benefits provided by the Federal crop insurance program. The FCIC expects to implement
the Ineligible File Tracking System beginning with the 1995 fiscal year. 


E. Expand the Nonstandard Classification System (NCS) 


FCIC instituted the NCS for the 1990 crop year because evidence indicated that a small percentage of insured persons
had losses in nearly every year. The losses paid to these persons far exceeded paid premiums. For various reasons,
the insured yields for these individuals exceeded their apparent capabilities, and the premium rates were not representative
of the risks posed by these persons. NCS was intended to reduce the insurance guarantee and increase the premium rate
for such individuals. Modified-APH eliminates the need to reduce insured yields because the insured yield will be
based solely on actual yields when a person is selected for NCS. However, NCS will continue to increase the premium
rates as appropriate for those individuals who persistently have losses. 
The Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug, and Related Agencies Appropriation Act for the 1994 fiscal year
prohibited FCIC from using any funds appropriated to insure crops in certain counties unless an NCS program had been
implemented in those counties. Counties were affected if the loss ratio, after applying the 1993 premium rates, was
greater than 1.10 more than 70 percent of the years that the crop had been insured in that county. Approximately 2,100
county crop programs were affected by this provision. 
For the 1994 crop year, NCS has been extended to 11 crops encompassing over 90 percent of the total value of insurance
in force. Additionally, all of the county crop programs affected by the Appropriations language have been included
under the NCS. Over 25,000 individuals (about 3.6 percent of all active policies for the 1993 crop year) were included
under this program. Not all of these persons had been insured during the base period. NCS also extends to persons who
participated in growing the crop in some way but who may not have been insured. These persons also are classified under
NCS so that the acreage cannot simply be insured under a different name to avoid the NCS classification. 
In 1993, FCIC commissioned a study of the NCS to determine its effectiveness. A draft report of that study indicates
that the NCS reduced the loss ratio by 5 to 10 points. This report is undergoing final preparation as this Blueprint
for Financial Soundness is finalized. 
FCIC will expand the NCS program for the 1995 crop year. All eligible crops will be included, although greater flexibility
in selections may be authorized whenever program factors that led to poor experience have been identified. NCS is
not suited to certain insured crops (e.g., Texas citrus trees) that are subject to infrequent losses of great severity.
The additional savings from NCS are likely to be small in terms of the total business because the crops that constitute
the majority of premiums and losses already are included. 


F. Institute Premium Rate Adjustments 


Premium rates are essential to the success of the crop insurance program. Rates that are too low will not produce adequate
income and will lead to persistent losses. High rates will, paradoxically, likely lead to the same outcome. Excessive
premium rates discourage participation by a broadly based cross-section of the farming community. Instead, persons
who are most likely to collect indemnities will buy, and it is not likely that rates can be increased as rapidly as the
relative risk of the pool of insured persons increases. 
FCIC has increased premium rates for all crops in a systematic fashion beginning with the 1991 crop year. Rates have
increased as much as 70 percent for some crops in some counties from the 1991 to the 1994 crop years. Decreases of up to
20 percent have been made for some crops in counties with histories of low losses. By an amendment to the Act in 1990,
Congress limited general premium rate increases to 20 percent annually. 
The above statistics indicate the amounts that FCIC has increased the base premium rates. The average premium rate
actually earned (actual premium paid divided by actual liability) may not have increased by the same magnitude for
various reasons. Most importantly, insured persons may choose a lower coverage level when the rate increases. By
doing so, they accept a lesser degree of protection but also pay a lower premium rate. 
FCIC proposes to continue premium rate increases as needed to help achieve the required loss ratio. The rate increases
made during 1991-1994 have done much to enhance the actuarial soundness of the program. However, the premium
rates for some crops and areas of the country remain below the levels needed to achieve the overall 1.10 loss ratio target.

The impact of premium rate adjustments has been evaluated by using data for the 20 years from 1973-1992. The effectiveness
of the adjustments was measured by applying the current 1993 premium rate levels to the historical period from 1973
and all subsequent years. The loss ratios were recalculated by using the revised premium amounts. 
This method does not include any change in sales that may occur due to a higher or lower cost of insurance. It assumes
the 20-year base period is adequate to measure actuarial performance, an assumption that may not be the most appropriate
definition of actuarial soundness. Events such as a 1993 Midwestern flood may or may not be appropriate to include
in the 20-year base period for a particular area of the country. 
In 1993, seven crops (barley, corn, cotton, grain sorghum, oats, soybeans, and wheat) constituted 75 percent of total
premiums. The loss ratio for 1980-1992 for these seven crops was 1.45, identical to the loss ratio for all insured
crops for this same period. Thus, changes in premium rates for these crops should be representative of the changes
that have been made for all crops in recent years. The premium rate changes for the seven crops through the 1994 crop
year are estimated to have been adequate to reduce the 1980-1992 loss ratio from 1.45 to 1.08. This aggregate
result meets the 1.10 standard required by OBRA 93, but only two of the seven crops individually meet this standard.
Within each of these crops, many parts of the country will meet the standard but others will not. Hence, additional
rate changes in 1995 and later years are appropriate. 
FCIC recognizes that premium rate increases are an important component of a viable crop insurance program. It is also
recognized that increasing premium rates to the levels suggested by the most recent 20 year experience may not be good
public policy. Extremely high premium rates will preclude realization of the social benefits and public policy goals
of the program because participation will be discouraged. If this happens, experience indicates that ad hoc disaster
assistance will be enacted. Such assistance is less likely to satisfy social objectives with regard to maintaining
rural communities and adequate supplies of food and fiber because it is uncertain for any particular year or region
of the country. Thus, a catastrophic adjustment process may be needed to temper the influence of a year such as 1993.
If the weather of 1993 truly is a 1 in 100 year event (or, as some have suggested, a 1 in 500 year event), its influence should
be tempered in terms of the premium rates charged to insured persons.

In addition to changing premium rates as needed, FCIC proposes to take a number of additional actions to enhance the
accuracy and adequacy of its actuarial activities. These include: 
 
Develop computer software and other tools to enhance the quality of the data used to establish premium rates and perform
actuarial analyses (``STATPLAN'' database, due for completion in October 1994). 
 Plans to contract with a major actuarial consulting firm to review all aspects of FCIC's actuarial methods.

 Enhance staff skills by additional training in analytical methods for existing personnel and more emphasis
on recruitment of actuarial trainees (ongoing) for appropriate functional units. 
 
Continue to contract with external specialists such as the Economic Research Service, land grant universities,
the Cooperative Extension Service, and others (ongoing). 
 
Develop models to measure sources of change in premium volumes and track the effects of premium rate changes as isolated
from changes induced by factors such as price elections, coverage level choices, insured crops, and other factors
that are not controllable by the rate-making function (development to begin immediately). 



G. Improve Underwriting of Crop Insurance Contracts. 



Underwriting begins by establishing the basic terms and conditions of the coverage. These include defining conditions
that result in a covered loss, measuring the amount of that loss, and defining the responsibilities of the insured
and the insurer. Underwriting continues with proper classification of an insured risk. For example, planting crop
B the year after crop A was grown on the same acreage may be riskier that if other crops were grown the previous year. Some
land, such as flood plains, is more prone to losses. Quality of management also is important. A farmer who is organized,
plans, performs preventive maintenance on equipment, and performs field operations in a timely manner may minimize
losses. 

A comprehensive underwriting system requires effective risk management strategies and goals, standards, and documentation.
Initiatives to improve underwriting that began in the early 1990's will be continued as part of the strategy detailed
in this Blueprint. The following specific actions will be pursued: 
 
Fully automate the actuarial documents to facilitate more comprehensive underwriting at the point of sale and to
verify the classification of risk in an automated environment (completed by the 1996 crop year). 
 
Develop standards and classification systems to assess and classify individual risk, including completion of research
intended to develop a ``scoring model'' for risk that is based on measurable attributes of a person or situation similar
to a credit rating model (for implementation by crop year 1996 if this model is feasible). 
 
Continue to rewrite crop insurance policies to better describe the insurance coverage and limitations and to reduce
vulnerabilities to actuarial soundness that exist due to imprecise, unclear, or omitted terms and conditions (ongoing,
with major crops scheduled for the 1995 crop year). 
 
Encourage development of supplemental or alternative insurance coverages authorized by section 508(b) of the Act
so that coverage may be improved with most of the risk remaining in the commercial sector. 

Improved underwriting will improve program performance. However, meaningful measures to quantify possible benefits
are not readily available. For this reason, FCIC cannot attribute a specific dollar amount to the benefits of improved
actuarial systems and crop insurance policies. 



H. Emphasize Program Compliance 



The FCIC Compliance function is designed to confirm that the Federal crop insurance program is operated and delivered
as intended. Through internal reviews based on generally accepted auditing principles, it assures that program
controls are in place against excess losses due to waste, fraud and abuse. Compliance emphasis will focus on:



1. Program Delivery 



Beginning in 1987, the Compliance staff conducted reviews of program delivery to assess compliance with regulations,
policy, and procedure. That year, according to GAO and OIG audits, errors in claims payment represented an estimated
15 percent of all losses paid equaling $55 million of taxpayer dollars. Since that time, Compliance efforts have reduced
these errors to approximately 5 percent of indemnities but still need continued improvement. Losses due to claim
payment errors are not included in underwriting calculations of risk, so this reduction in excess losses has a direct
and immediate impact of lowering the program loss ratio without increasing program cost or premium rates. 

To further reduce claims overpayment the Compliance Staff will review the entire operations of each delivery company
in coordinated nationwide reviews. The review methodology was recently revised to reflect generally accepted auditing
principles and statistically projectable sampling techniques. 

Beginning with the 1995 crop year, Compliance requirements will be expanded to define specific quality control and
performance measurement processes for each delivery company. Policy service error rates will be monitored. The
performance of each company will then be compared to an established national standard. 



2. Program Performance



Compliance reviews for several years have shown that a proportion of the excess losses are attributable to features
in program construction that produce unintended results. The Compliance Staff will conduct program performance
reviews that assess regulations, policies and procedures designed to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse and that the
program, policies, and procedures perform as intended. 

As an example, in 1989 GAO claims that construction of policy language in the California Safflower program alone resulted
in approximately $20 million in excess losses. It is not possible to determine how much of FCIC losses may be attributable
to unintended features of program construction. However, recent program performance pilot reviews of the peanut
program and regional irrigated practices resulted in an estimated 4 to 10 percent reduction in losses for those areas
that may otherwise have gone undetected. 

For the past several years Compliance has conducted ad hoc program reviews on topical issues. These reviews will be
expanded to identify and target reviews for crop insurance programs with the greatest potential vulnerability.




3. Fraud Prevention 



The risk of fraud is particularly acute in the insurance industry. Estimates for property-casualty insurance indicate
insurance fraud may represent as much as 15 percent of all losses paid. Recent efforts at crop insurance fraud detection
and subsequent prosecution have been increasingly successful. However, after-the-fact controls on program abuse
are not fully effective. Compliance will work with the delivery companies to focus on practical, cost efficient fraud
prevention. Compliance operations, program performance, and complaint reviews will emphasize identifying systemic
vulnerabilities and assessing program safeguards. Discrepancies noted in review findings will be evaluated to
determine the underlying causes. 

Emphasis also will be placed on measures to control program abuse that include strict contract enforcement and pro-active
policy analyses that identifies potential abuse and targets additional claims review. These measures will be coupled
with the aggressive implementation of civil sanctions, agent/loss adjuster debarment, and designating producer
ineligibility in finding related to program abuse.

I. Assure that Adequate Risk is Borne by the Commercial Insurance Industry



Amendments to the Act in 1990 directed FCIC to assure that adequate risk is borne by the commercial insurance companies
reinsured by FCIC, consistent with their ability to bear risk and the availability of commercial reinsurance. For
the 1992 reinsurance year (a 12 month period that began on July 1, 1991 and ended on June 30, 1992), FCIC substantially
modified its Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA) with the commercial insurers which participate in the program.
Both the amount and the probability of losses on the part of the commercial insurers were increased in this agreement.
Additional incremental changes in the amount of potential gains and losses were made for both the 1993 and 1994 SRA's.


The GAO suggests in a report entitled Crop Insurance Program Has Not Fostered Significant Risk Sharing by Insurance
Companies (GAO/RCED 92-25, January 13, 1992) that the changes in the 1992 SRA are not significant enough in the
area of risk bearing by the commercial insurance companies. Still, the 1992 SRA fundamentally changed the manner
in which gains and losses are calculated, a subtle but effective measure to increase risk. The amount of potential
loss increased, but the change in the formula increased the chances that the company would lose in years of poor experience.
As a comparison, the commercial industry lost approximately $8 million in 1988 when the crop insurance program sustained
a loss ratio of 2.45 primarily due to drought in the Midwest. If that experience is restated to the larger 1993 premium
amounts, the loss still would have amounted to only about $10-$15 million. Results from the 1993 crop year are
not yet complete, but current estimates indicate that commercial insurers will sustain losses of $80-$85 million
although the loss ratio will be less than in 1988. The difference is caused by the SRA changes.


Some will argue that industry-wide losses of $80-$85 million are not significant compared to overall program
losses that may be near $900 million in 1993. Two factors bear on this issue:


(1) The ability of the insurance companies to earn reserves under the SRA, and


(2) The effect of losses upon an insurance company's operations in future years.


The commercial industry can bear a greater share of the losses only if there is corresponding opportunity to achieve
comparable earnings in favorable years. Over the long term, the industry must achieve a satisfactory rate of return
on invested capital, or it would make economic sense for participants to invest in other endeavors. The SRA must allow
adequate opportunity to earn this satisfactory rate of return. It also must permit accumulation of reserves to pay
losses in years that disasters strike. Under the present SRA and the conditions of actuarial soundness of the program,
there is no opportunity to accumulate the reserves needed to bear a large portion of a $900 million loss.


Losses directly impact the capital structure of the companies. An insurance company leverages its capital (the term
``surplus'' is used by the industry) to support the volume of business that it writes. As a general rule, an insurance
company is permitted by regulators to bear the risk associated with $2 to $3 of premium per $1 of surplus. The ratio of
premiums to surplus may be lower for risky lines of insurance such as multiple peril crop insurance. Thus, whenever
an insurance company loses a portion of its capital, its ability to accept premiums in future years is reduced by a greater
amount, which in turn reduces its ability to earn profits and reserves. These factors must be considered when the ability
of the industry to bear risk is evaluated, as is mandated by the Act.


As appropriate, given the factors discussed above, FCIC will evaluate (1) the need to increase risk sharing with the
commercial insurance industry as the program achieves greater actuarial soundness, (2) reducing cessions to the
assigned risk fund by requiring the industry to share in losses for loss ratios that exceed 5.00, (3) changing the stop
loss provisions of the SRA, and (4) recruiting additional commercial insurers to participate in the crop insurance
business. These changes will be made incrementally beginning with the 1995 SRA that takes effect on July 1, 1994.



J. Improve Loss Adjustment




Any actuarial and underwriting system can be affected by errors in adjustment of losses. These errors include both
overpayment and underpayment of claims. Underpayment would not seem to be a factor influencing actuarial soundness,
but failure to pay a loss when due will cause insured persons to question the value of the insurance and potentially
reduce participation. The insurance experience also will not accurately depict the nature of the risk insured, leading
to inaccuracies in future premium rates.


Some problems in loss adjustment are directly related to deficiencies in underwriting. For example, if the crop insurance
policy is not clear on a particular point, the loss adjuster may find it necessary to make a determination in favor of
the insured person.


FCIC will undertake the following initiatives to assure high quality of loss adjustment determinations so that results
are fair to insured persons and taxpayers:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940406-2-00008 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940406-2-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Develop uniform loss adjustment standards that clearly specify the requirements for accurate determinations.

 Continue research to improve loss adjustment methods, such as yield appraisal methods and techniques for
unharvested crops, and measurement techniques for stored production.

 Strengthen the quality adjustment provisions of crop insurance contracts and develop standards to prevent
abuse of production determinations when quality losses are claimed.

The contributions of these factors to achieve the 1.10 target loss ratio will be measured by a reduction in improper
amounts paid on claims and a reduced error rate. The potential impact of these actions is difficult to quantify since
the initiatives to improve underwriting also affect this area. These actions are ongoing. Loss adjustment standards
for major crops and changes to the quality adjustment provisions are targeted for the 1995 crop year.



K. Marketing Crop Insurance



FCIC marketing efforts for 1994 will be directed by a strategic marketing plan based on information and data received
from market research compiled across the country. The plan's main objectives will be to inform members of the farming
community about changes in the program and to educate farmers about risk management, emphasizing the value of crop
insurance to farming operations.

FCIC will conduct a year-long media campaign targeted at publications and broadcast markets with an agricultural
audience.

Also, emphasis on outreach to minority farmers, traditionally under-represented in the program, will be coordinated
through a Minority Outreach Marketing Plan that specifically identifies minority farmers in each of the 10 FCIC Regional
Service Offices.



L. Expand Participation by Introducing New Products



Numerous ideas for products that will enhance the quality and acceptance of the crop insurance program have been suggested.
These include cost of production coverage (several different concepts), dollar denominated coverage, revenue
insurance, replacement cost insurance, and others. FCIC currently has contracts with the Economic Research Service
to evaluate several alternatives in the context of public policy contributions, availability of data to support
the concepts, assessments of producer acceptance, and other factors. FCIC proposes to continue such research and
seeks comments about additional concepts that may be appropriate. Implementation of a pilot test of the best alternatives
will be pursued.



M. Improve Accuracy of Other Program Variables



This section includes items that impact the program but are not easily categorized under a previous heading. These
are:

 Unit division. A unit is a tract of land used to establish the amount of insurance and any indemnity. For example,
the crop insurance policy defines a unit as all land in a county that is owned by the farmer or rented for cash and planted
to the insured crop. This unit may be subdivided under certain conditions, including payment of additional premium.
Generally, insured persons favor a program that gives them great flexibility and freedom for establishing a unit.
Some research indicates that size of a unit may affect losses, i.e., a unit consisting of 10 acres may have a great loss
(in relative terms) than a unit consisting of 100 acres. This research, if verified, suggests that a surcharge may
be needed for small acreage units regardless of how these are formed (by dividing larger units or because this is all
the land planted to the crop). FCIC will examine the research and determine if this surcharge is appropriate, both
actuarially and as a public policy initiative. FCIC also will explore the potential to provide greater flexibility
of unit determinations as a tool to enhance program acceptance by customers. The pricing needed to support greater
flexibility must be determined before it can be implemented. Implementation of changes will be targeted for the 1996
crop year.

 Program dates. Program dates include sales closing, acreage reporting, cancellation, and others. Several
of these dates may directly affect the actuarial soundness of the program. For example, neither the farmer nor the
insurer should be able to predict the potential for loss on the sales closing date. However, a study by one university
indicates that farmers may achieve better than a 50-50 probability of predicting a loss with the current sales
closing date of April 15 in the Midwest. Arguments in favor of having a sales closing date as late as possible generally
focus on the need to maximize sales opportunities; i.e., that interest in purchasing crop insurance is greatest as
planting time approaches. In a draft report, the GAO has encouraged FCIC to close sales earlier. FCIC proposes to close
sales for the 1995 crop year by 15-30 days earlier than the present dates. FCIC requests comments regarding other
actions with regard to program dates that will facilitate achievement of the targeted 1.10 loss ratio.

 Staged guarantees. Staged guarantees reduce the amount of insurance when a crop is lost before harvest. For
example, a farmer who abandons a crop within 30 days of planting might be paid only 40 percent of the amount of insurance.
The concept underlying staged guarantees is investment costs; the farmer's investment is less than the total needed
to produce and harvest the crop. Some believe this approach will reduce outlays for indemnities and help achieve actuarial
soundness. However, in the long run its efforts could be to reduce premium rates from levels otherwise needed. The
impact of staged guarantees upon customer acceptance of crop insurance may be the valid measure of this concept. FCIC
specifically requests comments on this feature and assessments of its potential contribution to achieving the targeted
1.10 loss ratio.

 De minimis yields. This term denotes a yield below which any production is disregarded for the purpose of determining
the amount of indemnity. The concept is advanced by interested parties as an equity issue_that it costs the farmer
more to harvest the crop than it is worth in the market. If allowed by the program, indemnities will increase compared
to the present provisions of the crop policies, which, in turn, requires higher premium rates to achieve the goal.
Readers are encouraged to comment on the desirability of increasing premium rates by an amount needed to permit this
feature to be included in crop insurance policies.

 Suspension and debarment. Inappropriate determinations and poor administration of the crop insurance program
is alleged about agents, loss adjusters, and others who are involved with delivery of crop insurance. The SSN/EIN
database is intended to help FCIC monitor the conduct of these persons. However, monitoring in and of itself is insufficient
if there are no penalties for violations of program rules. FCIC proposes to develop clear and concise suspension and
debarment procedures for agents, loss adjusters, reinsured companies and others who fail to observe the highest
standards of performance in program delivery and administration.

 Price Elections. The GAO recommended in a 1991 report that for the major crops, FCIC set its price elections
equal to the forecasts issued by the World Agricultural Outlook Board in its semi-annual estimates. These estimates
correspond to the cycle used to prepare the annual budget of the United States Government. These estimates are available
only twice each year. Based on a sampling of a few years, GAO stated that overall losses would be reduced if this recommendation
were adopted. FCIC is committed to offering a price election that complies fully with the requirements of the law.
In addition, the offer must be meaningful to farmers. FCIC requests comments regarding this recommendation and assessments
by readers of its likelihood of contributing to reduced loss ratios and improved participation.

Readers are requested to identify additional issues that they believe are relevant and important to assist FCIC in
its actions to manage the program to achieve the target loss ratio while maintaining or increasing participation
levels.



III. Management Actions If Section II Are Not Successful



The actions identified in Section II of this document represent a continuation of current management initiatives
that have been and continue to be important for the effective administration of a public program. FCIC believes that
successful completion of these actions will meet the objective of achieving actuarial soundness as required by OBRA
93. Several years must elapse before it will be possible to observe FCIC's achievement of the objective. In the interim,
attainment must be measured by realistic models of risk that adequately represent the crop insurance program. Flexibility
in managing the program to attain the objective while simultaneously achieving other important policy objectives
must be stressed.

Few options that do not adversely affect participation in a material manner are available in the event the actions
described in this blueprint are determined to be inadequate. One option is to focus better on defining the risk that
is included in the premium rates charged to current insureds. Extreme crop disasters (such as the 1993 flooding and
cold, wet growing season) tend to be widespread and occur infrequently. Crop insurance is not actuarially sound in
a commercial sense because the private sector cannot manage the magnitude of these risks or arrange the financing
over the long periods of time needed to accumulate reserves for a major disaster. This characteristic of crop disasters
argues that actuarial soundness perhaps should be measured on a basis that separates normally expected conditions
from the extreme disasters. This would serve to more precisely define the risk included in the premium rates for current
insureds, and the risk that should be amortized over longer time periods.

If the above is not acceptable, another action would be to limit the liability of crop insurance to specific areas and
crops. This limitation could take the form of complete withdrawal of insurance in some cases, or limitations on the
volume of business that would be accepted in a year for a crop or area. Commercial insurers use this process to manage
their exposure to avoid concentrations geographically or by product line. Crop insurance may need the same management
of its exposures rather than accepting any and all risk whenever farmers decide to enter and exit the program. This
extreme action would indicate that the program was unable to completely fulfill its social and public policy responsibilities,
and must be regarded as an initiative of last resort.



IV. Management Actions If Actions in Section II Are More Successful Than Needed



The greatest impediment to increased program participation will be high premium rates that might result from the
actions defined in this plan. Moderation of premium rate increases will be a priority if more stringent program administration
reduces the loss ratio below the target. If this occurs, experience should be examined to identify losses paid that
no longer should be expected. Once the impact of those losses is eliminated from the experience, some improvement
in premium rates would be anticipated. FCIC believes that the remaining management actions that have improved administration
of the program or that have better defined the coverage provided to U.S. agriculture should not be relaxed because
these generally represent good administration of public policy.

<DOCTITLE>Americans With Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent to establish advisory committee.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) announces its intent to establish
an advisory committee to review the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) for buildings
and facilities and requests applications from interested organizations for members to serve on the committee. The
committee will make recommendations to the Access Board for updating ADAAG to ensure that the guidelines remain consistent
with technological developments and changes in national standards and model codes, and meet the needs of individuals
with disabilities.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) is responsible for developing guidelines
under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to ensure that newly constructed and altered buildings and facilities
covered by the law are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.

1

 The Access Board published its accessibility guidelines for the Americans with Disabilities Act in July 1991. 36
CFR part 1191, Appendix A. These guidelines, known as the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines
(ADAAG), have been adopted by the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation as the accessibility
standards for newly constructed and altered places of public accommodation, commercial facilities, and transportation
facilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act.

2

 28 CFR part 36, Appendix A; 49 CFR part 37, Appendix A.





When it initially published ADAAG, the Access Board announced that it would periodically review and update the guidelines
to ensure that they remain consistent with technological developments and changes in national standards and model
codes, and meet the needs of individuals with disabilities. 56 FR 35410 (July 26, 1991). The Access Board also stated
that it would work cooperatively with national standards and model code organizations to achieve a single standard
over time that meets the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and that can be adopted as an accessibility
code by State and local governments throughout the country. Id.
The Access Board will begin the process of reviewing and updating ADAAG this fiscal year by establishing an ADAAG Review
Advisory Committee (Committee). The establishment of the Committee would be in the public interest and would support
the agency in performing its duties and responsibilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Committee
will review ADAAG in its entirety and make recommendations to the Access Board on:



 Improving the format and usability of ADAAG;
 Reconciling editorial and substantive differences between ADAAG and national standards and model codes,
including the CABO/ANSI A117.1-1992 American National Standard for Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities;
 Updating ADAAG to reflect technological developments and to meet the needs of individuals with disabilities;
and
 Coordinating future revisions to ADAAG with national standards and model codes organizations.



The Committee will be expected to present a report with its recommendations to the Access Board within one year of the
Committee's first meeting.


The Access Board requests applications from organizations representing the following interests for membership
on the Committee:



 Architects and design professionals;
 Building owners and operators;
 Individuals with disabilities;
 Model code groups;
 State and local building and accessibility code officials; and 
 Other persons affected by accessibility standards.



The number of Committee members will be limited to effectively accomplish the Committee's work and will be balanced
in terms of interests represented.


Applications should be sent to the Access Board at the address listed at the beginning of this notice. The application
should include a statement of the organization's interests and the name, title, address and telephone number of the
person who would represent the organization on the Committee. The application should also describe of the person's
qualifications, including any experience the person has had with developing or applying national standards, model
codes, or State and local codes. Committee members will not be compensated for their service. The Access Board may
pay travel expenses for a limited number of persons who would otherwise be unable to participate on the Committee.
Committee members will serve as representatives of their organizations, not as individuals. They will not be considered
special government employees and will not be required to file confidential financial disclosure reports.
After the applications have been reviewed, the Access Board will publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 announcing the appointment of Committee members and the first meeting of the Committee. The Committee will operate
in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 U.S.C. app 2. The Office of Management and Budget has approved
the Committee in accordance with Executive Order 12838. Committee meetings will be held in Washington, DC. Each meeting
will be open to the public. A notice of each meeting will be published in the 

Federal Register

 at least fifteen days in advance of the meeting. Records will be kept of each meeting and made available for public inspection.
Although the Committee will be limited in size, there will be an opportunity for the public to present written information
to the Committee and to comment at Committee meetings. Persons and organizations who are interested in particular
sections of ADAAG, are encouraged to inform the Access Board of their interests. The Access Board will notify persons
and organizations who indicate interest in particular sections of ADAAG when Committee meetings are scheduled to
discuss those sections.
Authorized by vote of the Access Board on November 10, 1993.

Silicon Metal From Argentina; Amendment to Final Results of Antidumping Administrative Review



<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On December 14, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register 

the final results of administrative review of the antidumping duty order on silicon metal from Argentina. The results
covered the period March 29, 1991 through August 31, 1992. For one firm, Silarsa, we are amending these final results
due to a clerical error.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



On December 14, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 65336) the final results of administrative review of the antidumping duty order on silicon metal from Argentina
(57 FR 48779, September 26, 1991). The review covered the period March 29, 1991 through August 31, 1992.

Since Silarsa did not respond to the Department's request for cost of production and constructed value information,
for the final results we relied on best information available (BIA) for Silarsa. As BIA, we used the dumping margin
petitioners had constructed by using the information on the record of the review.

Subsequent to the publication of the final results, we received timely allegations of ministerial errors from Silarsa.
Silarsa requested that we correct certain claimed errors in the calculation of Silarsa's cost of manufacturing (COM)
and constructed value (CV), which affected the final margin we assigned to Silarsa. Silarsa pointed out that, contrary
to basic accounting principles, the Department had erroneously double-counted the cost of materials by adding ``1992
WIP (work in process)'' and ``1992 Finished Goods'' to Silarsa's ``1992 Purchases''.

In response, petitioners stated that Silarsa's request was without foundation. Petitioners noted that the Department
assigned Silarsa a BIA rate of 54.97% because Silarsa terminated its participation in the review only after the Department
initiated a sales-below-cost investigation based on petitioners' allegations. Petitioners further asserted
that the arguments raised by Silarsa in its clerical error allegation did not constitute the type of ministerial error
discussed in 19 CFR 353.28(d), which covers ministerial errors of a clerical or arithmetic nature.

Petitioners contended that Silarsa argued its case in its rebuttal brief and in its December 23, 1993, clerical error
allegation. In petitioners' view, this attempt by Silarsa to bring its post-decision reargument of its case under
the guise of allowing for identification of ministerial errors is an abuse of that rule and should be rejected.

On March 2, 1994, the Court of International Trade (CIT), in 

Silarsa S.A. 

v. 

United States 

(Court No. 94-01-00030), issued an order remanding the final results of the 1991-1992 administrative
review of the antidumping duty order on silicon metal from Argentina for the correction of ministerial errors. We
agreed with Silarsa and the CIT that certain inventory items were double-counted in petitioners' calculation of
Silarsa's cost of materials. On March 17, 1994, the Department submitted its redetermination on remand to the CIT.
On March 24, 1994, the CIT affirmed the Department's redetermination on remand.



Amendment to the Final Results of Review



As a result of our correction of this ministerial error, we have determined that the weighted-average margin for Silarsa
for the period March 29, 1991 through August 31, 1992 is 24.62 percent.

Accordingly, the Department will determine, and the Customs Service will assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate
entries. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service.

Furthermore, a cash deposit of 24.62 percent will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise produced
by Silarsa and entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after the publication date of this notice.
The cash deposit requirement for manufacturers/exporters other than Silarsa specified in the final results of this
administrative review remain unaffected by this amendment.

This notice is published pursuant to section 751(f) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and  353.28 of the Department's
regulations.

On March 22, 1994, respondent submitted clarifications regarding its response to section C of the Department's questionnaire
regarding U.S. sales. Respondent requested that the Department consider backup calculations for reported ocean
freight charges, and U.S. short-term interest rates. In this submission, Fuji also provided clarification concerning
certain Fuji-Hunt (a U.S. entity related to Fuji) delivery expenses and certain Fuji-Hunt indirect selling expenses.
This submission was received too late to be used for purposes of the preliminary determination; however, we will consider
this submission in our final determination. 

Based on information submitted by respondent, we reclassified a certain movement expense as revenue, and added it
to the U.S. gross unit price. We added, where appropriate, freight revenue to the U.S. gross price, before adjusting
for freight costs. 

We made deductions, where appropriate, for discounts and rebates, and the following movement charges: foreign brokerage,
foreign inland freight, ocean freight, marine insurance, U.S. brokerage and handling, U.S. broker's commission,
U.S. duty, and several U.S. inland freight charges including inland freight insurance. For certain inland freight
charges applicable to sales made through Fuji-Hunt, as minor charge-specific best information available (BIA),
the Department increased the reported charges to account for missing values. Additionally, we deducted commissions
and direct selling expenses which include advertising, credit expenses, and a combination of promotional expenses
which constitute other direct selling expenses. We recalculated U.S. imputed credit using the reported dates of
shipment and payment because the amounts reported by the respondent did not consistently reflect the method described
in the questionnaire response. We then adjusted the U.S. price for additional product preparation performed by certain
parties after exportation. The preparation performed by certain parties was treated as a component of total packing
costs which were deducted from USP. 

We also deducted indirect selling expenses which include those indirect selling expenses that Fuji-USA (Fuji's
principal related U.S. entity) incurred in its general sales activities, those indirect selling expenses that Fuji-Hunt
incurred in its sales and marketing activities, foreign and U.S. pre-sale warehousing expenses, inventory carrying
costs, premiums for product liability insurance, and indirect selling expenses incurred in Japan. 

For purposes of the preliminary determination, we are accepting respondent's treatment of Fuji-USA's commissions
paid to an unrelated party and Fuji-Hunt's commissions as direct selling expenses and commissions paid to Fuji-USA's
employees as indirect selling expenses pending the receipt of additional information to be used for the final determination.
We treated all advertising costs as direct selling expenses because respondent reported that all advertising is
directed at their customers' customers. 

We made an adjustment to U.S. price for the consumption tax paid on the comparison sales in Japan. In 

Federal-Mogul Corporation and The Torrington Company 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 93-194 (CIT, October 7, 1993), the Court of International Trade (CIT) prohibited us from applying a
purely tax-neutral margin calculation methodology. Accordingly, we made our tax methodology conform to the instructions
of the CIT, and adjusted U.S. price for taxes by multiplying the home market tax rate by the price of the U.S. merchandise
at the point in the chain of commerce of the U.S. merchandise that is analogous to the point in the home market chain of
commerce at which the foreign government applies the home market consumption tax. 

In this investigation, the tax levied on the subject merchandise in the home market is three percent. We calculated
the appropriate tax adjustment to be three percent of the price of the U.S. merchandise net of discounts reflected
on the invoice at the time of sale (which, in this case, is the point in the chain of commerce of the U.S. merchandise that
is analogous to the point in the home market chain of commerce at which the foreign government applies the home market
consumption tax). We then added this amount to the U.S. price. We also calculated the amount of the tax adjustment that
was due solely to the inclusion of expenses in the original tax base that are later deducted from the price to calculate
USP (i.e., three percent of the sum of any adjustments, expenses and charges that were deducted from the price of the
U.S. merchandise). We deducted this amount after all other additions and deductions had been made. By making this
additional tax adjustment, we avoid a distortion that would cause the creation of a dumping margin even when pre-tax
dumping is zero. 

The Department instructed respondent to report by April, 1, 1994, a revised sales listing for sales of further manufactured
merchandise. Since respondent will submit this sales information too late to be included in our preliminary analysis,
and because respondent's first submission was too deficient to use for purposes of this preliminary determination,
we have not included further manufacturing sales in our analysis (see March 24, 1994, decision memorandum from Richard
W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford). 



Foreign Market Value 



We compared the volume of home market sales of subject merchandise to the volume of third country sales to determine
whether there was a sufficient volume of sales in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating FMV. We found
that the home market was viable for sales of CNPP. 

The Department excluded from its analysis certain sales of control paper, hobby paper, crystal paper, and softech
paper, because these sales were made outside of the ordinary course of trade due to the nature of the products and were
made in insignificant quantities. We omitted error entries and inventory adjustment entries because these entries
are not sales of CNPP, and because respondent did not directly tie these entries to the relevant sales in the CNPP database.
Additionally, we dropped cancellation transactions from the sales database, as respondent has stated that it cannot
identify the original transaction to which a specific cancellation entry applies. We also excluded certain low-priced
sales of CNPP because, despite a specific request to do so, respondent did not adequately explain the nature of, or
circumstances surrounding, these low-priced sales.

We used the Department's current related party test, which considers differences in the level of trade, to determine
whether sales to related customers were made on an arm's-length basis. For purposes of the preliminary determination,
we considered a party as related to respondent whenever respondent had substantial ownership in, or contractual
agreements constituting business control over, the party. See Appendix II to the Final Determination of Sales at
Less Than Fair Value: Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from Argentina (58 FR 37077, July 9, 1993) for
more information on the Department's related party test. We did not include in our analysis any sales to related customers
that we determined were not at arm's length.

We calculated FMV based on delivered prices, inclusive of packing. We made deductions for inland freight, rebates
and discounts, and direct selling expenses, including promotional and advertising expenses, credit expenses,
warranty and guaranty expenses, and interest for guarantee deposits, where applicable. For those rebate programs
where respondent did not identify in the database which customer actually received the rebate, we made no adjustment.
We disallowed any rebate not established before the filing of the petition. For one expense claimed as a rebate, we
determined that the expense, although viewed as a direct selling expense for CNPP, was overstated through a misallocation
of the costs; consequently we did not make any adjustment for this expense, but will consider doing so subsequent to
verification and further explanation. With regard to one promotional program reported as a direct selling expense,
we did not make an adjustment to FMV because respondent failed to report the expense properly.

We treated all advertising costs as direct selling expenses because respondent reported that all advertising is
directed at the customers' customers. We deducted home market packing costs and added U.S. packing costs in accordance
with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. Where respondent's reported total packing costs in Japan for certain transactions
for certain packing forms omitted a particular packing processing charge, we added, as minor charge-specific BIA,
the reported average charge.

We made the following deductions from FMV in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56. We calculated home market credit expenses
using the reported dates of shipment and payment. Where no payment had been received we used the average credit period
for home market sales.

We deducted from FMV the weighted-average home market indirect selling expenses, including inventory carrying
costs, warehousing expenses, product liability premiums, technical service expenses, and two promotional minilab
programs, up to the amount of indirect selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales. We reclassified these two promotional
programs as indirect selling expenses. While respondent had reported these as direct selling expenses, we have preliminarily
determined that respondent has not directly tied them to specific sales of CNPP. We also reclassified technical expenses
as indirect selling expenses because respondent's documentation illustrates that these expenses relate to general
long-term assistance, rather than customer- or sales-specific expenses. We offset commissions paid to unrelated
parties in the United States by the amount of indirect selling expenses incurred in the home market by respondent,
capped by the sum of U.S. commissions and indirect selling expenses incurred, both in Japan and the United States,
for U.S. sales.

For purposes of the preliminary determination, we have treated all movement expenses as direct selling expenses.
Therefore, in accordance with the decision in 

Ad Hoc Committee of AZ-NM-TX-FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 93-1239 (Fed. Cir., January 5, 1994), we made a circumstance-of-sale adjustment for home market movement
expenses. We recalculated indirect selling expenses incurred in the home market by reallocating certain rebates
and promotional programs as indirect selling expenses rather than as charges or direct selling expenses, respectively,
because we found that respondent misclassified these expenses. We classified product liability expenses as indirect
selling expenses because respondent's explanations demonstrate that its liability policy is general in nature
and not tied to specific sales.

We included in FMV the amount of the consumption tax collected in the Japanese home market. We also calculated the amount
of the tax that was due solely to the inclusion of expenses in the original tax base that are later deducted from home
market price to calculate FMV (i.e., three percent of the sum of any adjustments, expenses, charges, and offsets that
were deducted from the home market price). We deducted this amount from the FMV after all other additions and deductions
were made. By making this additional tax adjustment, we avoid a distortion that would cause the creation of a dumping
margin even when pre-tax dumping is zero. In addition, we calculated a re-adjustment of the amount of tax to take into
account the amount of packing expenses added to FMV (i.e., three percent of the packing expenses).



Currency Conversion



We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified
by the Federal Reserve Bank.



Verification



As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify the information used in making our final determination.



Critical Circumstances



On March 2, 1994, petitioner alleged that ``critical circumstances'' exist with respect to imports of CNPP and chemical
components thereof from Japan. We preliminarily find that critical circumstances do not exist with respect to imports
of CNPP from Japan, in accordance with section 733(e)(1) of the Act. To determine whether or not there have been massive
imports of CNPP (one of the criteria in a critical circumstances analysis) we compared the export volume for the six
months subsequent to the filing of the petition to that for the six months prior to the filing of the petition. We found
that exports of this merchandise from respondent during the period subsequent to receipt of the petition had decreased.
Unless we find that imports of the subject merchandise were massive, we do not need to determine whether there is a history
of dumping in the United States or elsewhere or whether there is knowledge that the exporter was selling the merchandise
at less than its fair value.



Suspension of Liquidation



In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of CNPP from Japan, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice, that are entered,
or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

.

The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated preliminary dumping margin,
as shown below. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice.






ITC Notification



In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination.

If our final determination is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether these imports are materially injuring,
or threaten material injury to, the U.S. industry before the later of 120 days after the date of this preliminary determination
or 45 days after our final determination.



Postponement of Final Determination



On March 8, 1994, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.20(b), the sole respondent requested that, in the event of an affirmative
determination, the Department postpone the final determination. We find no compelling reason to deny the request.
Accordingly, we are postponing the date of the final determination until not later than 135 days after the date of publication
of this notice.



Public Comment



In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments in at least ten copies may be submitted by any
interested party to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration no later than June 30, 1994, and rebuttal briefs
no later than July 8, 1994. We request that parties in this case provide an executive summary of no more than 2 pages in
conjunction with case briefs on the major issues to be addressed. Further, briefs should contain a table of authorities.
Citations to Commerce determinations and court decisions should include the page number where cited information
appears. In preparing the briefs, please begin each issue on a separate page. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b),
we will hold a public hearing, if requested, to give interested parties an opportunity to comment on arguments raised
in case or rebuttal briefs. Tentatively, the hearing will be held on July 15, 1994, at 10 a.m. at the U.S. Department
of Commerce, room 3708, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. Parties should confirm the
time, date, and place of the hearing 48 hours before the scheduled time.

Interested parties who wish to request a hearing must submit a written request to the Assistant Secretary for Import
Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, room B-099, within ten days of the publication of this notice
in the 

Federal Register

. Requests should contain:

(1) The party's name, address, telephone number;

(2) The number of participants; and

(3) A list of the issues to be discussed. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), oral presentations will be limited to
the issues raised in the briefs.

This determination is published pursuant to section 733(f) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b(f)) and 19 CFR 353.15(a)(4).

Also excluded from the scope of the investigation are paper that is designed exclusively for use in graphic arts proofing
equipment and does not exceed 160 microns in thickness, and emulsions classified under subheading 3707.10.0000
of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) that are used in the manufacture of monochrome graphic
arts film or paper that are not used in the production of color negative photographic paper. 
The color negative photographic paper subject to this investigation is currently classifiable under HTSUS subheadings
3703.10.3030 and 3703.20.3030. Emulsions are currently classifiable under HTSUS subheadings 3707.10.0000 and
3707.90.3000. Couplers and coupler dispersions are currently classifiable under HTSUS subheadings 3707.90.3000,
3707.90.6000, 2933.19.3000, 2933.90.2500 and 2934.90.2000. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience
and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. 
To avoid suspension of liquidation of non-subject chemicals, those items entered under the HTSUS subheadings listed
above, which are not for use in the color negative photographic paper production process, must be accompanied by an
importer's declaration to the Customs Service to that effect. 
In order to be excluded from the suspension of liquidation ordered in this notice, all sensitized (whether chemically
or spectrally) and unsensitized emulsions, couplers, and coupler dispersions entered into the United States must
be accompanied by an importer's declaration to the Customs Service to the effect that they are not for use in the color
negative photographic paper production process and will not be used in the color negative photographic paper production
process. 
On February 18, 1994, petitioner and respondent submitted comments on whether the chemical components are in the
same class or kind of merchandise as color negative photographic paper. Petitioner argues that the subject merchandise
constitutes one class or kind of merchandise, whereas respondent argues that the merchandise included in the scope
of investigation constitutes two classes or kinds of merchandise. We determined that color negative photographic
paper and the chemical components constitute one class or kind of merchandise (see March 24, 1994, decision memorandum
from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford). We based our determination on the criteria set forth in 

Diversified Products 

v.

 United States, 

572 F. Supp. 883 (1983) and 

Kyowa Gas Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. 

v.

 United States, 

582 F. Supp. 887 (1984). 


Period of Investigation (POI) 


We initiated this investigation using a six-month POI from 
March 1, 1993, through August 31, 1993. On October 13, 1993, petitioner requested that the Department expand the POI.
We expanded the POI in order to capture U.S. shipments made pursuant to an October 1, 1991, contract with the single-largest
unrelated purchaser (see December 30, 1993, decision memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford).
We instructed respondent to submit foreign sales information of the subject merchandise for the month of November
1991 to be the basis for the foreign market value (FMV) comparison to the U.S. shipments made pursuant to the long-term
contract (see January 17, 1994, decision memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford). 


Such or Similar Comparisons 


In this investigation, we have examined sales of color negative photographic paper; we have not examined sales of
chemical components because respondent did not make such sales during the POI (see October 22, 1993, memorandum from
James Maeder to David Binder). We have determined for purposes of the preliminary determination that the color negative
photographic paper covered by this investigation comprise a single category of ``such or similar'' merchandise.
Respondent reported products that are identical according to the Department's matching criteria but have minor
cost differences based on the emulsions contained in each product. For purposes of the preliminary determination,
we are treating these products as identical and are making no adjustments for differences in merchandise between
the products as claimed by respondent in accordance with 19 CFR 353.57. This is because respondent failed to provide
a narrative description for its adjustments for differences in merchandise that explains the exact nature, source,
and size of each difference. We have instructed the respondent to submit a thorough description of its adjustments
for differences in merchandise so that these adjustments can be considered for use in the final determination (see
February 23, 1994, decision memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford). 


Fair Value Comparisons/Multinational Corporation Provision 


In its petition, Kodak alleged that all of the criteria for invoking the multinational corporation (MNC) provision
have been met. To determine whether sales of CNPP from the Netherlands to the United States were made at less than fair
value, we compared the United States price (USP) to the appropriate FMV as required by the MNC provision. 
The MNC provision, contained in section 773(d) of the Act, requires the Department to determine if the following three
criteria are met: 
(1) Merchandise exported to the United States is being produced in facilities which are owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by a person, firm or corporation which also owns or controls, directly or indirectly, other facilities
for the production of such or similar merchandise which are located in another country or countries; 
(2) The sales of such or similar merchandise by the company concerned in the home market of the exporting country are
nonexistent or inadequate as a basis for comparison with the sales of the merchandise to the United States; and,

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940406-2-00018 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940406-2-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) The FMV of such or similar merchandise produced in one or more of the facilities outside the country of exportation
is higher than the FMV of such or similar merchandise produced in the facilities located in the country of exportation.
(In this comparison, we must adjust the FMVs for any differences between the costs of production in the two countries
(including taxes, labor, materials and overhead), pursuant to section 773(d) of the Act). 
If the above criteria are met, then the MNC provision instructs the Department to compare USP to the FMV of such or similar
merchandise produced in one or more facilities outside the country of exportation.

Regarding the first criterion, Fuji Photo Film B.V. is wholly owned by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. in Japan. Further,
Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. produces the subject merchandise in Japan. Thus, Fuji Photo Film B.V. meets the first criterion.

Regarding the second criterion, we compared the volume of home market sales of color negative photographic paper
to the volume of third country sales of color negative photographic paper, in accordance with section 773(d)(2) of
the Act and 19 CFR 353.48(a), in order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of color negative photographic
paper in the home market to compare to sales of color negative photographic paper to the United States. We found that
the Netherlands home market was not viable for comparison to sales to the United States (see January 11, 1994, memorandum
from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford).

We determined, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.49, that Germany is the most appropriate third country market for purposes of
the comparison of FMVs under the MNC provision because:
(1) Germany is the largest single third country market;
(2) The type of merchandise sold in Germany is more similar to Dutch exports of color negative photographic paper to
the U.S. than the type of merchandise sold elsewhere; and
(3) The channels of distribution in Germany are most similar to those for color negative photographic paper from the
Netherlands sold in the United States (see December 30, 1993, memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford).

Regarding the third criterion, we compared German and Japanese FMVs. To calculate the FMVs, we first compared the
German and Japanese prices to U.S. price (see the ``Foreign Market Value'' section of this notice for a complete description
of how we calculated the German and Japanese FMVs).

Once we had calculated the two FMVs, we calculated a comparison adjustment for each product-specific FMV to determine
whether any of the observed differences in value between the FMV of products produced in Japan and the FMV of products
produced in the Netherlands and sold in Germany were attributable to differences in costs of production. The comparison
adjustment included the costs of materials, labor, fixed and variable overhead, general and administrative expense
and interest incurred in producing the product.

For the German adjustment, the Department relied on the submitted cost information except in the following instances
where the costs were not appropriately quantified or valued: 
(1) We excluded income from investment grants as this generally relates to income tax credits which are not considered
a production cost; 
(2) We did not include foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from sales transactions as they are not related to
production costs; and, 
(3) We reallocated CNPP specific research and development costs to reflect the benefits experienced by facilities
in Japan and the Netherlands.

For the Japanese adjustment, the Department relied on the submitted cost information except in the following instances
where the costs were not appropriately quantified or valued: 
(1) We excluded losses from the disposal of fixed assets as these costs did not appear to relate to the subject merchandise;

(2) We did not include foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from sales transactions as they are not related to
production costs; 
(3) We reallocated CNPP specific research and development costs to reflect the benefits experienced by facilities
in Japan and the Netherlands; and,

<DOCNO> FR940406-2-00019 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940406-2-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(4) We excluded the enterprise tax in our calculation of general and administrative expenses because this tax is based
on income and is not considered a production cost.

In calculating the FMVs, Japanese prices included a consumption tax and German prices did not. Thus, we adjusted the
Japanese FMV by deducting the consumption tax.

Next, we deducted the German comparison adjustment from the German FMV and the Japanese comparison adjustment from
the Japanese FMV. We multiplied the resulting amount for each product by the quantity of U.S. merchandise to which
the product was compared in order to provide for an equitable comparison. Finally, we aggregated the values. From
these aggregated values, we determined that the Japanese value was higher than the German value. Thus, the third criterion
for invoking the MNC provision has been met.

Because all of the above criteria for the MNC provision have been met, we are required to base the FMV for the Netherlands
on sales prices by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. in Japan (see the March 10, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford
for a further discussion of the Department's MNC methodology).



United States Price 


We based USP on exporter's sales price (ESP), in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act, because the subject merchandise
was sold to the first unrelated purchaser after importation into the United States. Respondent did not provide a revised
sales listing for the foreign extended POI sales because of ambiguous language in our deficiency questionnaire regarding
the due dates. Therefore, we have not considered the extended U.S. POI sale for purposes of the preliminary determination,
but will do so for purposes of the final determination. Additionally, we determined that it is not necessary to examine
U.S. further-manufactured sales from the Netherlands for purposes of this investigation (see January 17, 1994,
memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford).

On March 21, 1994, respondent submitted clarifications regarding its response to section C of the Department's questionnaire
regarding U.S. sales. Respondent requested that the Department recalculate a certain inland insurance expense
and a certain indirect selling expense. This submission was received too late to be used for purposes of the preliminary
determination; however, we will consider this submission in our final determination.

Based on information submitted by respondent, we reclassified a certain movement expense as revenue, and added it
to the U.S. gross unit price.

We made deductions, where appropriate, for discounts and rebates and for the following movement charges: foreign
brokerage, foreign inland freight, marine insurance, ocean freight, U.S. brokerage and handling charges, U.S.
duty, U.S. inland freight, and U.S. inland insurance. We added an amount for duty drawback. 

We deducted commissions and direct selling expenses which include advertising, credit expenses, and a combination
of promotional expenses which constitute other direct selling expenses. We recalculated U.S. imputed credit using
the reported dates of shipment and payment because the amounts reported by the respondent did not consistently reflect
the method described in the questionnaire response. We have adjusted USP for additional product preparation performed
by certain parties after exportation.

We also deducted indirect selling expenses which include those indirect selling expenses that Fuji-USA (respondent's
principal related U.S. entity) incurred in its general sales activities, those indirect selling expenses that Fuji-Hunt
(a U.S. entity related to respondent) incurred in its sales and marketing activities, foreign and U.S. pre-sale warehousing
expenses, inventory carrying costs, premiums for product liability insurance, and indirect selling expenses incurred
in Japan.

For purposes of the preliminary determination, we are accepting respondent's treatment of Fuji-USA's commissions
paid to an unrelated party and Fuji-Hunt's commissions as direct selling expenses, and commissions paid to Fuji-USA's
employees as indirect selling expenses. We treated all advertising costs as direct selling expenses because respondent
reported that all advertising is directed at their customers' customers.

We made an adjustment to USP for the consumption tax paid on the comparison sales in Japan. However, in 

Federal-Mogul Corporation and The Torrington Company 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 93-194 CIT (October 7, 1993), the Court of International Trade prohibited us from applying a purely
tax neutral margin calculation methodology. Accordingly, we made our tax methodology conform to the instructions
of the CIT, and adjusted U.S. price for tax by multiplying the Japanese tax rate by the price of the U.S. merchandise
at the point in the chain of commerce of the U.S. merchandise that is analogous to the point in the Japanese chain of commerce
at which the Japanese government applies the consumption tax.
In this investigation, the tax levied on the subject merchandise in Japan is three percent. We calculated the appropriate
tax adjustment to be three percent of the price of the U.S. merchandise net of discounts reflected on the invoice at
the time of sale (which, in this case, is the point in the chain of commerce of the U.S. merchandise, that is analogous
to the point in the Japanese market chain of commerce at which the Japanese government applies the consumption tax).
We then added this amount to the U.S. price. We also calculated the amount of the tax adjustment that was due solely to
the inclusion of expenses in the original tax base that are later deducted from the price to calculate USP (i.e., three
percent of the sum of any adjustments, expenses and charges that were deducted from the price of the U.S. merchandise).
We reduced this tax adjustment to take into account the adjustment to U.S. price for duty drawback (i.e., three percent
of the duty drawback amount that was excluded from the tax base). We deducted this amount after all other additions
and deductions had been made. By making this additional tax adjustment, we avoid a distortion that would cause the
creation of a dumping margin even when pre-tax dumping is zero.


Foreign Market Value


As described in the ``Fair Value Comparisons/Multinational Corporation Provision'' section of this notice, we
had to calculate FMVs in both Germany and Japan in order to make our MNC comparison. We calculated FMVs based on German
and Japanese home market sales prices, pursuant to section 773(d) of the Act. Respondent did not provide a revised
sales listing for the foreign extended POI sales because of ambiguous language in our deficiency questionnaire regarding
the due dates. Therefore, we have not considered the extended U.S. POI sale for purposes of the preliminary determination,
but will do so for purposes of the final determination.
For German sales, we classified respondent's discounts and rebates to reflect the Department's standard definitions
of discounts and rebates (i.e., a discount is a price concession before invoicing, whereas a rebate is a price concession
after invoicing). We determined that certain discounts were, in fact, rebates, and were treated accordingly. Additionally,
we recalculated credit expenses in Germany using the reported dates of shipment and payment.
For Japanese sales, we excluded certain sales of control paper, hobby paper, crystal paper, and softech paper from
our analysis because these sales were made outside of the ordinary course of trade due to the nature of the products
and were made in insignificant quantities. We omitted error entries and inventory adjustment entries because these
entries are not sales of CNPP, nor did respondent directly tie these entries to the pertinent sales in the CNPP database.
We also dropped cancelling transactions as respondent stated that it could not identify the original transaction
to which a specific cancellation entry applies. Finally, we excluded certain low-priced sales of CNPP in Japan because,
despite a specific request to do so, respondent did not adequately explain the nature of, or circumstances surrounding,
these low-priced sales.
Additionally, for Japanese sales, we made no adjustment for those rebate programs where respondent did not identify
in the database which customer actually received the rebate. Additionally, we disallowed any rebate not established
before the filing of the petition. For one expense claimed as a rebate, we determined that the expense, although viewed
as a direct selling expense to CNPP, was overstated through a misallocation of the costs; consequently, we did not
make any adjustment for this expense, but will consider doing so subsequent to verification and further explanation.
With regard to one promotional program reported as a direct selling expense, we did not make an adjustment to FMV because
respondent failed to report the expense properly. Because respondent failed to report shipment dates, we were unable
to recalculate credit expenses; thus, we made no adjustments for credit expenses. We treated all advertising costs
as direct selling expenses because respondent reported that all advertising is directed towards the customers'
customers.
For Japan sales, we recalculated indirect selling expenses incurred in the Japanese home market by reallocating
certain rebates and promotional programs as indirect selling expenses rather than as charges or direct selling expenses,
respectively, because we found that respondent has misclassified these expenses. We classified product liability
expenses as indirect selling expenses because respondent's explanations demonstrate that its liability policy
is general in nature and not tied to specific sales. We also reclassified technical expenses as indirect selling expenses
because respondent's documentation illustrates that these expenses relate to general long-term assistance, rather
than customer- or sales-specific expenses.
For both German and Japanese sales, we used the Department's current related party test, which considers differences
in the level of trade, to determine whether sales to related customers were made on an arm's-length basis. For purposes
of the preliminary determination, we considered a party as related to respondent in Japan whenever there was evidence
of substantial ownership in, or contractual agreements constituting business control over, the party. See Appendix
II to the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from
Argentina (58 FR 37077, July 9, 1993) for more information on the Department's related party test. For both German
and Japanese sales, we did not include in our analysis any sales to related customers that we determined were not at
arm's length.
We calculated German and Japanese FMVs based on delivered prices, inclusive of packing. We made deductions for discounts
and rebates, where applicable. For purposes of the preliminary determination, we have treated all movement expenses
as direct selling expenses. Therefore, in accordance with the decision in 

Ad Hoc Committee of AZ-NM-TX-FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 93-1239 (Fed. Cir., January 4, 1994), we made a circumstance-of-sale adjustment for foreign movement
expenses.
We further deducted from the Japanese FMV the appropriate direct selling expenses, including advertising expenses
and warranty expenses. We deducted credit expenses from the German FMV.
We deducted German and Japanese indirect selling expenses, including inventory carrying costs, technical services
(Japan only), warehousing (Japan only), and product liability premiums (Japan only) from FMV, capped by the sum of
U.S. indirect selling expenses and the U.S. commission amount.

We deducted German and Japanese packing costs and added U.S. packing costs, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)
of the Act.
We included in FMV the amount of the consumption tax collected in the Japanese home market. We also calculated the amount
of the tax that was due solely to the inclusion of expenses in the original tax base that are later deducted from home
market price to calculate FMV (i.e., three percent of the sum of any adjustments, expenses, charges, and offsets that
were deducted from the home market price). We deducted this amount after all other additions and deductions were made.
By making this additional tax adjustment, we avoid a distortion that would cause the creation of a dumping margin even
when pre-tax dumping is zero. In addition, we calculated a re-adjustment of the amount of tax to take into account the
amount of packing expenses added to FMV (i.e., three percent of the packing expenses).


Currency Conversion


We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified
by the Federal Reserve Bank.


Verification


As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify the information used in making our final determination.


Critical Circumstances


On March 2, 1994, petitioner alleged that ``critical circumstances'' exist with respect to imports of color negative
photographic paper and chemical components thereof from the Netherlands. We will preliminary determine that critical
circumstances exist in accordance with section 733(e)(1) of the Act if we determine that there is a reasonable basis
to believe or suspect that:
(A)(i) There is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the class or kind of merchandise which is the
subject of the investigation, or
(ii) The person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter
was selling the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value, and
(B) There have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation over
a relatively short period.
Regarding requisite (A)(i) above, we normally consider whether there has been an antidumping order in the United
States or elsewhere on the subject merchandise in determining whether there is a history of dumping. Regarding requisite
(A)(ii) above, we normally consider margins of 25 percent or more for purchase price comparisons and 15 percent or
more for exporter's sales price comparisons as sufficient to impute knowledge of dumping. Because the preliminary
estimated dumping margin for all exporters of color negative photographic paper and chemical components thereof
from the Netherlands is in excess of 15 percent, we can impute knowledge of dumping under section 733(e)(1)(A)(ii)
of the Act.
Under 19 CFR 353.16(f), we normally consider the following factors in determining whether imports have been massive
over a short period of time:
(1) The volume and value of the imports;
(2) Seasonal trends (if applicable); and
(3) The share of domestic consumption accounted for by imports.
To determine whether or not there have been massive imports of CNPP, we compared export volumes for the six months subsequent
to the filing of the petition to the six months prior to the filing of the petition. We found that exports of the subject
merchandise from the Netherlands during the period subsequent to receipt of the petition had increased by an amount
sufficient to categorize the imports as massive. Accordingly, we preliminarily determine that critical circumstances
do exist.


Suspension of Liquidation


In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, and with 19 CFR 353.16(c), we are directing the Customs Service to
suspend liquidation of all entries of CNPP from the Netherlands, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section
of this notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date which is 90 days
prior to the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

.
The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated preliminary dumping margin,
as shown below. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice.

ITC Notification 


In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. 
If our final determination is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether these imports are materially injuring,
or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry before the later of 120 days after the date of this preliminary determination
or 45 days after our final determination. 


Postponement of Final Determination 


On March 8, 1994, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.20(b), the sole respondent requested that, in the event of an affirmative
determination, the Department postpone the final determination. We find no compelling reason to deny the request.
Accordingly, we are postponing the date of the final determination until not later than 135 days after the date of publication
of this notice. 


Public Comment 


In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments in at least ten copies may be submitted by any
interested party to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration no later than June 30, 1994, and rebuttal briefs
no later than July 8, 1994. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), we will hold a public hearing, if requested, to give
interested parties an opportunity to comment on arguments raised in case or rebuttal briefs. Tentatively, the hearing
will be held on July 15, 1994, at 10 a.m. at the U.S. Department of Commerce, room 3708, 14th Street and Constitution
Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. Parties should confirm the time, date, and place of the hearing 48 hours before
the scheduled time. 
Interested parties who wish to request a hearing must submit a written request to the Assistant Secretary for Import
Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, room B-099, within ten days of the publication of this notice
in the 

Federal Register

. Requests should contain:
(1) The party's name, address, telephone number;
(2) The number of participants; and
(3) A list of the issues to be discussed. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), oral presentations will be limited to
the issues raised in the briefs. 
This determination is published pursuant to section 733(f) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b(f)) and 19 CFR 353.15(a)(4).

 The Department of Commerce is notifying the public of its determination not to revoke the countervailing duty order
on cotton sheeting and sateen from Peru.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



On February 1, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 4691) its intent to revoke the countervailing duty order on cotton sheeting and sateen from Peru (48 FR 4501;
February 1, 1983). Under 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii), the Secretary of Commerce will conclude that an order is no longer
of interest to interested parties and will revoke the order if no domestic interested party objects to revocation
or no interested party requests an administrative review by the last day of the fifth anniversary month.

On February 25, 1994, ATMI and five member companies who are interested parties objected to our intent to revoke the
order. ATMI and its member companies were petitioners in the original investigation. Therefore, because the requirements
of 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii) have not been met, we will not revoke the order.

This determination is in accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4).

for the first budget period (12 months) from August 1, 1994 to July 31, 1995, is estimated at $388,898. The application
must include a minimum cost-share of 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. Cost-sharing
contributions may be in the form of cash contributions, clients fees, in-kind contributions or combinations thereof.
The MBDC will operate in the Anaheim, California Geographic Service Area.




The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.


The MBDC program provides business development services to the minority business community to help establish and
maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate public and
private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of management and technical
assistance to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority
business.


Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: The experience and capabilities of the firm and its staff
in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs of minority businesses,
individuals and organizations (50 points); the resources available to the firm in providing business development
services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included
in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points). An application
must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category to be considered programmatically
acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will then be evaluated
by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the demonstrated responsibility
of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit
findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application
not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point score will not necessarily receive the award.

MBDCs shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. To
assist in this effort, the MBDCs may charge client fees for management and technical assistance (M&TA) rendered.
Based on a standard rate of $50 per hour, the MBDC will charge client fees at 20% of the total cost for firms with gross
sales of $500,000 or less, and 35% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of over $500,000.


Quarterly reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as an MBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities.

<DOCTITLE>Cooperative Demonstration Program (Correctional Education) </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed priorities, required activities, selection criteria, and Other rquirements for grants to be
made in Fiscal Year 1995.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary proposes priorities for awards to be made in fiscal year (FY) 1995 using funds appropriated in FY 1994
under the Cooperative Demonstration Program, which is authorized by the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology
Education Act (Perkins Act). Under the proposed absolute priority, funds under this competition would be reserved
for applications proposing to demonstrate successful cooperation between the private sector and public agencies
in vocational education programs that serve criminal offenders under the supervision of the justice system. In addition,
the Secretary intends to invite applications that, within the absolute priority of correctional education, incorporate
one or more of the following invitational priorities: (1) Advanced technologies; (2) community-based correctional
education; and (3) juvenile justice education. The Secretary also proposes to impose requirements related to the
priorities and other matters, and to use new selection criteria in evaluating applications submitted for this competition
only. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
The Cooperative Demonstration Program provides financial assistance for, among other things, model projects that
demonstrate successful cooperation between the private sector (including employers, consortia of employers,
labor organizations, building trade councils, and private agencies, organizations, and institutions) and public
agencies in vocational education (including State boards for vocational education, State or local corrections
or correctional education agencies, or eligible recipients as defined in 34 CFR 400.4). This program can help further
the purposes of the National Education Goals. Specifically, the correctional education priority directly supports
Goal 5, that every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in
a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. 


The designation of correctional education as a priority under the Cooperative Demonstration program is based on
the critical problems of illiteracy and recidivism pervading our Nation's adult and juvenile corrections population.
The U.S. Department of Education's National Adult Literacy Survey Report, ``Literacy Behind Prison Walls'' described
a 70 percent illiteracy rate among a sample of prisoners as follows: 



About seven in ten prisoners * * * are apt to experience difficulty in performing tasks that require
them to integrate or synthesize information from complex or lengthy texts or to perform quantitative tasks that involve
two or more sequential operations and that require the individual to set up the problem (1993, p.vi).

 

Additionally, a recent study, ``Vocational and Academic Indicators of Parole Success'' published in the Journal
of Correctional Education, found that inmates who had received academic and vocational training while in prison
were more likely to be employed and less likely to commit crimes after their release than other inmates (Schumacker,


et al

., 1990). 

Academic and vocational training is also critical for probationers and parolees since the majority of the Nation's
criminal offenders are serving sentences within community corrections settings. There were about 4.5 million individuals
under correctional supervision in the United States by the end of 1991, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
Of these, 3.3 million, or approximately 73 percent, were under active probation or parole supervision within the
community. 
Educational programs for criminal offenders that use applied learning strategies to teach life skills, job skills,
and literacy can reduce the likelihood that the offenders will return to the criminal justice system. After completing
their sentences, ex-offenders often have limited opportunities for meaningful employment and lack necessary basic
life skills, including the job-seeking and job-retention skills needed to obtain and maintain employment. Without
basic literacy and job skills, it is unlikely that these persons will become fully productive members of society.

The Secretary will announce the final priority in a notice in the 

Federal Register

. The final priority will be determined by responses to this notice, available funds, and other considerations of
the Department. Funding of particular projects depends on the availability of funds, the nature of the final priority,
and the quality of the applications received. The publication of this proposed priority does not preclude the Secretary
from proposing additional priorities, nor does it limit the Secretary to funding only this priority, subject to meeting
applicable rulemaking requirements. 
The Office of Vocational and Adult Education's Office of Correctional Education coordinates programs for criminal
offenders with other Department of Education offices and other Federal offices, including the Department of Justice's
Federal Bureau of Prisons, National Institute of Justice, and Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.
The Office of Correctional Education collaborated with these Department of Justice offices in preparing this notice.







Note: 

 This notice of proposed priorities does 

not 

solicit applications. A notice inviting applications under this competition will be published in the 

Federal Register

 concurrent with or following publication of the notice of final priorities. 


Priorities


Absolute Priority 


Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) the Secretary gives an absolute preference to applications that meet the following priority.
The Secretary will fund under this competition only model projects that demonstrate ways in which public agencies
in vocational education and the private sector can work together effectively to assist vocational education students
who are criminal offenders under the supervision of the justice system to attain the advanced level of skills they
need to make a successful transition from correctional education programs to productive employment including_
(a) Work experience or apprenticeship programs; 
(b) Transitional worksite job training for vocational education students that is related to their occupational
goals and closely linked to classroom and laboratory instruction provided by an eligible recipient;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940406-2-00037 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940406-2-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(c) Placement services in occupations that the students are preparing to enter;

(d) If practical, projects that will benefit the public, such as the rehabilitation of public schools or housing in
inner cities or economically depressed rural areas; or

(e) Employment-based learning programs.



Required Activities



The Secretary requires that any projects funded under this competition_

(a) Coordinate with community agencies that furnish transitional supportive services to criminal offenders such
as individual and family counseling, housing assistance, transportation, and social and cultural activities;

(b) Include a well-designed staff inservice education component to ensure the effective implementation of the program;

(c) Address the special learning needs of offenders;

(d) Use applied learning strategies to teach life skills, jobs skills, and literacy;

(e) If applicable, provide for a transition from institutional environments to community settings;

(f) Address State and local labor shortages and consult the State Occupational Information Coordinating Committee
or State Labor Market Information Unit in making this determination; and

(g) Must submit proof of committed partnerships between public agencies and the private sector. The definitions
of ``private'' and ``public'' contained in 34 CFR 77.1 do not include entities under the supervision or control of
the Federal Government; thus, Federal entities, including Federal prisons, are not eligible members of the partnerships
required by 34 CFR 426.4(b).

This program activity is authorized by section 420A(a)(2) of the Perkins Act (Pub. L. 101-392, 104 Stat. 753
(1990)).



Invitational Priorities



Within the absolute priority specified in this notice, the Secretary is particularly interested in applications
that meet one or more of the following invitational priorities. However, under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(1) an application
that meets these invitational priorities does not receive competitive or absolute preference over other applications:



Invitational Priority 1_Advanced Technologies



Projects that incorporate the use of interactive instructional technologies, such as distance learning, in the
context of both student training and staff inservice training.



Invitational Priority 2_Community Corrections



Projects that provide integrated vocational and academic education to individuals on probation or parole in community
corrections.



Invitational Priority 3_Juvenile Justice Education



Projects that provide integrated vocational and academic education to students in the juvenile justice system.
This may include youth placed in detention centers, training schools, boot camps, or community-based programs.



Definitions



As used in this notice_

``Applied learning'' is actively student-oriented, characterized by lively classroom discussions, absorbing
group projects, meaningful homework assignments, laboratory experiments, live and videotaped presentations,
and other hands-on activities. The purpose of applied learning is to create an environment that actively engages
students and teachers in a collaborative learning process.

``Community corrections'' refers to programs serving probationers and parolees.

``Life skills'' includes self-development, communication skills, job development, and education.

``Literacy'' means an individual's ability to read, write, and speak in English and compute and solve problems, at
levels of proficiency necessary to function on the job and in society, to achieve one's goals, and to develop one's
knowledge and potential.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Program Interest; Amendment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice replaces and supersedes the Notice of 
Program Interest (NOPI) published in the 

Federal Register

 on 
February 22, 1994 (59 FR 8462). The purpose of this announcement 
is to correct the previous NOPI and clarify the program needs in 
risk assessment and risk management for the Office of 
Environmental Management.

III. Proposal Format 
IV. Evaluation Criteria 
V. Awards 


I. Purpose 


The Office of Environmental Management (EM) is seeking to award grants or cooperative agreements to applicants,
to fund (in whole or in part) projects, or cost share in projects, that will help EM implement a program to develop credible
risk assessment and risk management practices to protect the public health and environment at DOE facilities and
sites. 
For more information about EM's needs in risk assessment and risk management, including information related to the
integration of risk assessment and risk management, interested applicants are referred to the National Research
Council's report ``Building Consensus Through Risk Assessment and Management of the Department of Energy's Environmental
Remediation Program,'' National Academy Press, 1994, and the presentations contained therein by Assistant Secretary
Thomas Grumbly and concerned stakeholders. Copies of the National Research Council's report may be obtained from
the Department of Energy by calling Ms. Mary Wilson, Telephone (202) 586-2661. It is strongly recommended that
interested applicants review this document prior to submitting a proposal. 
EM's program in integrated risk management faces two critical activity areas: First, a statutory requirement to
report to Congress on the risks to the public health and safety posed by the conditions at the Nation's nuclear weapons
complex; and second, the need for long-term assistance in risk assessment and risk management at DOE facilities and
sites. The first activity was mandated by Congress in Public Law 103-126, enacted October 28, 1993. The DOE is
addressing the Congressional requirement through actions that are on a separate track and not addressed by this announcement.
It is the second activity that this solicitation addresses, i.e., the long-term needs for assistance in developing
credible processes and methods for risk assessments and risk management decisions that include meaningful involvement
of affected parties, future land and facilities use planning, cost of proposed remediation activities, public and
worker health and safety, and environmental impacts. 
As discussed in the National Research Council's report and in specific remarks by Assistant Secretary Thomas Grumbly,
DOE is seeking to define the risks to human health and the environment on a site-by-site basis. Further, DOE is seeking
approaches and methods: 
 To systematically identify and characterize, on a site-by-site basis, the risks to human health and the environment;

 To systematically identify and characterize the data gaps and uncertainties, and identify methods for filling
gaps and reducing uncertainties, in our present understanding of the above cited risks; 
 To systematically review and recommend the process by which the above cited risks will be reduced; 
 To systematically review and recommend how public participation should be involved in risk evaluation and
how such risks should be communicated to non-technical audiences; and 
 To systematically review and define the costs for risk reduction.
In addition, the credibility of DOE and its site contractors is a serious issue that must be appropriately addressed
if valid and persuasive risk assessments are to be conducted, i.e., serious consideration must be extended to the
question of who performs the risk assessment, who performs the risk reduction assessment, who performs the cost assessment,
etc. 
The National Research Council has identified several obstacles associated with using a risk based approach at DOE
sites. These obstacles include the fact that:
 The use of risk assessment to set priorities for remediation is viewed with skepticism;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940406-2-00040 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940406-2-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Risk assessment is viewed as a mechanical process, without opportunity for public input, that often fails
to give due consideration to affected stakeholders; 
 Stakeholders have voiced concerns that risk assessments may result in an inequitable distribution of resources
both among and within facilities and sites. 
Notwithstanding these obstacles, the National Research Council has concluded that a risk based approach to environmental
cleanup is both feasible and desirable. In order for such an approach to be effective in influencing Remedial Action
Decisions, it is necessary that risk management and risk assessment theory and processes, robust public participation
programs, and public policy decision makers be brought together and integrated into one coherent decision making
process. 
EM is interested in receiving proposals from applicants that propose creative and innovative methods for providing
credible risk assessments and credible practices for implementation of risk-based decisions. Proposals should
address cost/risk policy and priority setting at the DOE sites involving decontamination, decommissioning, environmental
restoration, facilities transition, technology development, and site management.
Proposals that include an integrated-systems approach that includes technology-based solutions for reducing,
eliminating, or mitigating risks at the weapons complex are most desirable. In addition, proposers should demonstrate
an organizational capability both to work with diverse multi-disciplinary technical groups and to work with social
and cultural issues in the risk assessment arena. Additional factors to be considered in decision-making and in establishing
priorities include: 
 Federal Facilities Agreements; 
 State and local agreements; 
 Tribal agreements; 
 Public participation and outreach to affected citizen groups; 
 Innovative approaches to development of credible risk assessments and implementation of risk-based decision
making; 
 Strategies and methods for identifying and filling data gaps and reducing uncertainties; 
 Environmental justice, socioeconomic and sociopolitical issues; and 
 Other environmental, worker, and public health and safety issues. 


II. Objective Merit Review 


An objective merit review of each proposal will be accomplished in accordance with EM's Merit Review System, as published
in the 

Federal Register

 on May 6, 1991 (56 FR 20602). Applicants are advised that EM shall utilize the procedure detailed under subsection
IV(E)(2) of its Merit Review System (56 FR 20604), i.e., field readers shall be utilized in lieu of standing review
committees. 


III. Proposal Format 


The proposal shall contain two sections, technical and cost. Technical proposals shall be no more than fifty (50)
pages in length; resumes of proposed key personnel should be submitted as an appendix to the technical proposal and
will not be counted against the page limit. It is left to the proposer to determine how best to structure the proposal.
However, the following information shall be included: 
a. Proposals shall include a detailed project description that discusses the specific tasks to be performed under
the proposed project. 
b. Proposals must also demonstrate that the offeror is perceived as neutral and credible, and is capable of conducting
scientifically valid and responsible assessments. Assessments must include clear statements of what is not known
and what is uncertain, as well as statements of what is known. Proposals must demonstrate how independent, external
peer-review will be conducted. 
c. Proposals must demonstrate that the offeror has the experience and capability to plan, organize, manage, and facilitate
public participation in communities. Proposals must also demonstrate that the offeror has the experience and ability
to effectively communicate complicated scientific information on potential risks and uncertainties, to local
and national stakeholders, other affected and concerned citizens, and decision makers at all levels. 
d. Proposals must demonstrate that the offeror presently has or is capable of obtaining staff with the training, expertise,
and experience needed to conduct scientifically complex risk assessments and cost assessments. Proposals must
identify the technical and scientific staff that will actually conduct the studies and detail their professional
experience as well as their level of program involvement. 
e. Proposals must demonstrate that the offeror has the ability to integrate their work with the activities of other
organizations conducting risk assessments. 
f. Proposals must demonstrate that the offeror has management capability, for both financial and scientific management,
and a demonstrated skill in planning and scheduling projects of comparable magnitude to that proposed under this
NOPI. 
Cost proposals shall have no page limit. The cost proposal shall include a summary breakdown of all costs, and provide
a detailed breakdown of costs on a task-by-task basis for each task contained in the project description. In addition,
any expectation concerning cost sharing shall be clearly stated. Cost sharing is encouraged, but it shall not be considered
in the selection process. 


IV. Evaluation Criteria 


The evaluation criteria are as specified in subsection IV(G) of EM's Merit Review System (56 FR 20604). 


V. Awards 


Approximately $20 million may be available in FY 1995 for projects. If sufficient acceptable applications are received,
available funding may determine the number of awards. Awards, if any, will be determined through evaluation of applications
received against the evaluation criteria, and the availability of funds. Awards, either grants or cooperative agreements,
will be made only to technically acceptable applicants. Budget and project periods may be negotiated to fit the requirements
of particular projects; awards will be on a schedule to be agreed to 
by DOE and the awardee. DOE reserves the right to support or not support any portion, all, or none of the proposals submitted.

<DOCTITLE>Financial Assistance Award: Underground Injection Practices Research Foundation</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Energy, Metairie Site Office.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy (DOE), Metairie Site Office, announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i) (A) and (D)
it intends to make a Non-Competitive Financial Assistance Award (Grant) through the Pittsburgh Energy Technology
Center to the Underground Injection Practices Research Foundation.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The UIPRF has proposed a two-task project relating to Class II injection well operations in various states throughout
the country. Task I of the proposed project is designed to extend the implementation of a Risk-Based Data Management
System (RBDMS) in four states. Alaska, Mississippi, Montana, and Nevada would be given assistance with converting
data from existing data management systems; coding and internal testing of the RBDMS; preparing documentation,
training, and technology transfer; and project management. Task II of the proposed project would offer assistance
in conducting four regional training seminars related to Area of Review (AOR) investigations and environmental
compliance.



The Underground Injection Practices Council (UIPC) was formed in 1983 to work with various federal agencies, state
underground injection control (UIC) officials, municipal and county officials, representatives of environmental
groups, industry, scientists, and others on safe and effective methods for waste disposal. The UIPC, through its
Research Foundation, conducts a comprehensive program of original research and data collection and serves as a clearinghouse
for information on underground injection. The UIPC also conducts a variety of educational programs and serves as
a forum for the development of more sound regulations and technical standards. 


Greater emphasis is currently being placed on the ability of states to justify their regulatory decisions, with interest
in developing reliable procedures for assessing the risks posed by oil and gas injection wells increasing rapidly.
Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, agencies that implement UIC programs are required to prevent subsurface injection
that endangers an underground source of drinking water (USDW). 

The UIPRF just completed a grant from DOE that involved the investigation of state environmental, oil, and gas data,
and data management systems that pertain to underground injection control. The primary goal of this research was
to increase the base of technical and environmental knowledge related to the application of the UIPRF model that has
been developed to assess the risk of injection water contaminating a USDW. The project involved four major tasks:
(1) Conducting an inventory and needs assessment of the database management systems of the 21 states that have primacy
to supplement the UIC requirements for Class II wells, (2) conducting investigations of six state's data management
system capabilities and making hardware and software improvements, (3) conducting a Technical Symposium on Class
II injection wells relating to the application of the UIPRF model that was developed to assess risk of injection water
contaminating USDWs, and (4) conducting investigations of four states' data management system capabilities and
making hardware and software improvements. Task I of the current project proposed by UIPRF seeks to expand upon Task
IV of the just-completed grant by extending the implementation of the RBDMS in four states (Alaska, Mississippi,
Montana, and Nebraska). These states will be given assistance with converting data from existing data management
systems, coding and testing RBDMS, preparing documentation, and training efforts. 

In accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i) criteria (A) and (D), a noncompetitive Financial Assistance Award to the
UIPRF has been justified. This effort is a continuation of the just-completed grant and opening up a continuation
effort to competition would have a significant adverse effect on continuity of the activity. The Applicant has exclusive
domestic capability to perform this activity successfully, based upon the unique technical expertise of the UIPRF
which will ensure maximum utilization of existing state, federal, industry and commercial sources of data necessary
to complete the study. This effort therefore is considered suitable for noncompetitive financial assistance and
would not be eligible for financial assistance under a solicitation, and a competitive solicitation would be inappropriate.


DOE funding for this research is estimated to be $499,745 for the duration of the project. These funds will be used to
pay for the reasonable cost of research staff, administrative support personnel, consultants, experts, and printing
costs as necessary for the research project.

<DOCTITLE>Forms EIA-23, 23P and 64A, ``Oil and Gas Reserves Surveys'' </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Energy Information Administration, Department of Energy.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of the Proposed Extension of the Forms EIA-23, ``Annual Survey of Domestic Oil and Gas Reserves,'' EIA-23P,
``Oil and Gas Well Operator List Update Report,'' and EIA-64A, ``Annual Report of the Origin of Natural Gas Liquids
Production,'' and solicitation of comments. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Energy Information Administration (EIA), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent
burden (required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. No. 96-511, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), conducts a presurvey consultation program to provide the general public and other Federal agencies with an opportunity
to comment on proposed and/or continuing reporting forms. This program helps to ensure that requested data can be
provided in the desired format, reporting burden is minimized, reporting forms are clearly understood, and the impact
of collection requirements on respondents can be properly assessed. 



 Currently, EIA is soliciting comments concerning the proposed extension of the Forms EIA-23, ``Annual Survey
of Domestic Oil and Gas Reserves,'' EIA-23P, ``Oil and Gas Well Operator List Update Report,'' and EIA-64A,
``Annual Report of the Origin of Natural Gas Liquids Production.'' It is proposed that Forms EIA-23P and EIA
64A be extended without modification. For large operators reporting on Form EIA-23, the form will be modified
to also collect estimates of reserves and production associated with enhanced oil recovery methods and nonconventional
gas. This proposed modification reflects the growing importance to U.S. oil and gas supplies of enhanced oil recovery
and nonconventional gas. To offset the incremental burden associated with this proposed modification, the requirement
to report indicated additional reserves on Form EIA-23 will be discontinued. For small operators reporting
on Form EIA-23, the form will be extended without modification.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



I. Background 

II. Current Actions 

III. Request for Comments 



I. Background 



In order to fulfill its responsibilities under the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974 (Pub. L. No. 93-275)
and the Department of Energy Organization Act (Pub. L. No. 95-91), the Energy Information Administration is
obliged to carry out a central, comprehensive, and unified energy data and information program. As part of this program,
EIA collects, evaluates, assembles, analyzes, and disseminates data and information related to energy resource
reserves, production, demand, and technology, and related economic and statistical information relevant to the
adequacy of energy resources to meet demands in the near and longer term future for the Nation's economic and social
needs. 

Operators of crude oil and natural gas wells are the target respondents of the Form EIA-23 and operators of natural
gas plants are the target respondents of the Form EIA-64A. The amount of crude oil, associated-dissolved and
nonassociated natural gas, and lease condensate production and reserves by field are requested of major oil and gas
well operators. In addition a selected sample of small operators provides production and reserves of crude oil, natural
gas and lease condensate at a State level on the Form EIA-23. The amount of natural gas processed, natural gas
liquids produced, the resultant shrinkage of the natural gas, and the amount of natural gas used in processing are
requested of natural gas plant operators. In response to Public Law 95-91 Section 657, estimates of U.S. oil
and gas reserves are to be reported annually. These estimates are essential to the development, implementation,
and evaluation of energy policy and legislation. Data will be used directly in the annual publication 

U.S. Crude Oil, Natural Gas, and Natural Gas Liquids Reserves, 

and incorporated in a number of other publications and analyses. Secondary publications which use the data include
the 

Annual Energy Review, Annual Energy Outlook, Petroleum Supply Annual, 

and 

Natural Gas Annual. 



II. Current Actions 



This notice is for a proposed three-year extension of the Forms EIA-23, ``Annual Survey of Domestic Oil and Gas
Reserves,'' EIA-23P, ``Oil and Gas Well Operator List Update Report,'' and EIA-64A, ``Annual Report
of the Origin of Natural Gas Liquids Production,'' until December 31, 1997. Forms EIA-23P and EIA-64A
will be extended without modification. For large operators reporting on Form EIA-23, the form will be modified
to also collect estimates of reserves and production associated with enhanced oil recovery methods and nonconventional
gas. Implementation of this proposed modification is contingent upon the availability of resources required to
make the EIA-23 data system capable of handling the new data. To offset the incremental respondent burden associated
with reporting enhanced oil recovery and nonconventional gas reserves and production, and to focus the survey more
effectively on proved reserves, the requirement for large operators to report indicated additional reserves (a
reserves category that is not proved) will be discontinued. For small operators reporting on Form EIA-23, the
form will be extended without modification.

Wolverine Hydroelectric Corp., Availability of Draft Multiple Project Environmental Assessment



March 31, 1994.





In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the applications for an original license for the Edenville, Secord, and Smallwood Hydroelectric Projects, located
on the Tittabawassee River, Gladwin County, Michigan and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA) for
the projects. In the DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the potential environmental impacts of the proposed
projects and has concluded that approval of the projects, with appropriate mitigation or enhancement measures,
would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

Copies of the DEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.

Please submit any comments within 30 days from the date of this notice. Comments should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell,
Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Please affix

<DOCTITLE>Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline </DOCTITLE>
Gas Supply Realignment Costs; Public Conference 



March 30, 1994.



Agency: 

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, DOE.




<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Public Conference.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is issuing this notice to establish a date for a public conference to discuss
the use of pricing differential mechanisms by interstate natural gas pipelines to recover gas supply realignment
costs. 




</SUMMARY>
<SIGNER>
Lois D. Cashell, 


</SIGNER>
<SIGNJOB>
Secretary. 



Santa, Commissioner, concurring: 





Issued March 30, 1994.





With this notice of Public Conference, the Commission is initiating an inquiry into whether permitting the recovery
of pricing differential costs (PDC) is an ``effective way to minimize gas supply realignment costs.'' The Notice
includes the Commission's reassurance that, if PDC recovery is not an effective method for minimizing gas supply
realignment (GSR) costs, we will limit ourselves to the consideration of ``alternatives that are consistent with
the Commission's policy to permit pipelines full recovery of their prudently incurred gas supply realignment costs.''
Notwithstanding this reassurance, I am troubled by the prospect that the Commission would appear to be considering
a mid-stream change in its mechanism for the recovery of Order No. 636 transition costs. 

In Texas Eastern Transmission Corp.,

1

 the Commission authorized PDC recovery for a period of two years. The Commission made clear that at the end of this period,
the effectiveness of PDC recovery as a means to minimize transition costs would be subject to reexamination. In particular,
the Commission has provided pipelines with warnings that:




(1) the burden is on the pipeline to support the continuation of PDC recovery beyond the initial period;

2







(2) a pipeline cannot prudently delay realigning its problem contracts on the basis of the possibility of an extension;

3

 and




(3) after the two-year period, the Commission may revisit the issue of continuing the mechanism.

4

 




The Commission already has established a procedure for determining whether, ultimately, these costs will be recoverable.
In addition to examining the eligibility and prudence of PDCs, if raised by parties to the proceedings, the Commission
has stated that the burden will be on the pipeline to demonstrate that the PDC methodology will minimize GSR costs.

5

 Further, the pipeline will have the burden of demonstrating that it made a bona fide effort to renegotiate the contracts
underlying the PDCs it has filed to recover.

6

 Filings to recover PDCs have been set for hearing, and the records developed in those proceedings will give the Commission
a basis for determining whether the PDC recovery procedure in fact minimizes Order No. 636 transition costs. 





Consequently, it is troubling that approximately nine months into the two-year period

7

 the Commission is initiating a proceeding, docketed as a rulemaking, to consider whether the PDC recovery mechanism
is ``an effective way to minimize gas supply realignment costs'' and to consider proposals for alternatives. I would
hope that the end result of this proceeding is not a termination or modification of the PDC recovery mechanism effective
prior to the end of the two-year period. Rather, I would hope that the record developed in this proceeding, together
with the case-specific records developed in the section 4 GSR cost proceedings, will be used to inform the Commission's
decision whether to terminate, modify, or continue the PDC recovery mechanism beyond two years. 




Absent compelling evidence that the PDC recovery mechanism is not minimizing GSR costs, I would be reluctant to modify
the mechanism mid-stream. I believe that regulatory certainty is important, and that pipelines have relied on the
two-year time horizon provided by the PDC recovery mechanism. Therefore, I would urge my colleagues to consider carefully
the consequences of modifying this aspect of the Order No. 636 transition cost recovery procedure at this time.

<DOCTITLE>State of Oklahoma; NGPA Notice of Determination by Jurisdictional Agency Designating Tight Formation</DOCTITLE>


March 31, 1994.



Take notice that on March 25, 1994, the Corporation Commission of the State of Oklahoma (Oklahoma) submitted the above-referenced
notice of determination pursuant to  271.703(c)(3) of the Commission's regulations, that part of the Atoka
Formation at a depth of 12,436 feet, underlying portions of Caddo, Blaine and Custer Counties, Oklahoma, qualifies
as a tight formation under section 107(b) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. The recommended area is described as
all of Section 6, Township 12 North, Range 13 West; Section 31, Township 13 North, Range 13 West; Section 1, Township
12 North, Range 14 West and Section 36, Township 13 North, Range 14 West.
The notice of determination also contains Oklahoma's findings that the referenced formation meets the requirements
of the Commission's regulations set forth in 18 CFR part 271.

Title:

 New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for the Phosphate Fertilizer Industry (Subparts T, U, V, W, and X). (EPA ICR
No. 1061.06; OMB No. 2060-0037). This is a request for renewal of a currently approved information collection.



Abstract:

 Owners or operators of phosphate fertilizer plants must notify EPA or the delegated regulatory authority of construction,
modification, startups, shutdowns, malfunctions, and dates and results of initial performance tests. Owners and
operators must install, calibrate, and maintain monitoring devices to determine the mass flow of phosphate-bearing
feed, and devices to measure and record continuously pressure drop across the scrubbers, and must keep records of
the mass of phosphate bearing feed. This industry is not required to submit excess emission reports. EPA or the delegated
authority reviews the records during routine inspections to ensure compliance with the standards. 


Burden Statement:

 The reporting requirements apply only to the initial performance tests, and since no new or reconstructed sources
are expected to become subject to the standards in the next three years, there is no burden projected for reporting.
The public recordkeeping burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 87.5 hours per recordkeeper
annually. The estimated burden includes the time needed to review instructions, search existing data sources, gather
the data needed and review the collection of information. 

Respondents:

 Owners or operators of phosphate fertilizer plants. 


Estimated No. of Respondents:

 11.


Estimated No. of Responses per Respondent:

Title:

 Worker Characterization and Blood-Lead Study of Renovation and Remodeling Workers. (EPA ICR No. 1689.01). This
is a new collection.


Abstract:

 The Residential Lead-Base Paint Hazard Reduction Act, also designated as Title IV of the Toxic Substances Control
Act (TSCA), became law on October 29, 1992. Section 402(c)(2) of Title IV of TSCA, directs EPA to conduct a study of persons
engaged in various types of building renovation and remodeling activities. The purpose of the study is to establish
the extent to which workers involved in these activities are exposed to lead, or disturb lead and create a lead-based
paint hazard on a regular or occasional basis. The study involves a targeted survey of three categories of renovation
and remodeling workers in two cities, and the collection of venous blood samples from those workers. The categories
of renovation and remodeling workers are: union laborers, union carpenters, and independent non-union contractors.
The two types of data that will be collected are: (1) Worker blood samples that will be chemically analyzed for lead;
and (2) questionnaire data that will characterize the workers and will be used to understand differences in blood-lead
levels. The questionnaire will be administered either by telephone or self-administered and data collected includes
information relevant to lead exposure on: (a) Demographics; (b) work history (both current and long-term); (c) personal
characteristics and habits; (d) non-work activities; (e) medical history; and (f) previous training or knowledge
of lead. 
The EPA will use data resulting from the survey to determine which groups of workers require training, certification
or educational materials. These data will also be used in conjunction with other studies conducted by the Agency,
and may be distributed to other agencies in summary form for use in addressing other requirements of the Act.


Burden Statement:

 Burden for this collection of information is estimated to average .563 hour (40 minutes) per respondent. This estimate
includes the time needed to listen to recruitment information, answer the screening questions, complete the questionnaire,
provide a blood sample, and review the collection of information.


Respondents:

 Union laborers, union carpenters, and independent non-union contractors.


Estimated Number of Respondents:

 1,620.


Estimated Number of Responses per Respondents:

 1.


Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents:

 912 hours.


Frequency of Collection:

 One time only.

<DOCTITLE>Pesticides; Prioritization of Actions Subject to the Delaney Clause; Policy Notice</DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is announcing that it will temporarily cease review and processing of tolerance petitions received under the
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) and the associated registration applications received under the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) if any of the pesticide uses that are subject of the applications
and petitions appear to result in a residue that needs a food additive regulation under section 409 of the FFDCA and
such a regulation would be barred by the Delaney Clause. EPA is adopting this policy to concentrate on food additive
regulations currently in force which are inconsistent with the Delaney Clause and to avoid expending EPA resources
on action which may be revised once various policy issues are resolved.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


I. Background


EPA's regulations regarding FIFRA registration in 40 CFR 152.112(g) require that all needed tolerances for pesticide
residues in food be in place prior to the approval of a FIFRA registration for the use of a pesticide which will result
in such residues. Raw food tolerances for pesticides are established under section 408 of FFDCA, 21 U.S.C. 346a, and
tolerances for certain processed foods and for feed additives (``food additive regulations'') for pesticides are
established under FFDCA section 409, 21 U.S.C. 348.
EPA's current policy is that a food additive regulation is needed when there is a possibility that the processing of
a raw food containing pesticide residues would result in residues in the processed food or in animal feed at a level
greater than the raw food tolerance. EPA determines whether there is such a possibility based on the review of processing
data supplied by the applicant for registration purposes or the petitioner for a tolerance. 
Under section 409, a food additive regulation for a pesticide residue may not be promulgated if EPA concludes that
the pesticide ``induces cancer'' in man or animal as specified in the Delaney Clause. 21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3). In 

Les v. Reilly

, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the Delaney Clause barred the establishment of
a food additive regulation for any pesticide that meets the induce-cancer standard no matter how infinitesimal the
risk, 968 F.2d 985 (9th Cir. 1992), 

cert. denied

, 113 S. Ct. 1361 (1993). The court overturned EPA's interpretation of the Delaney Clause as subject to an exception
for pesticide residues which pose a 

de minimis

 risk.
FIFRA and section 408 of the FFDCA contain no Delaney Clause and instead require consideration of both risks and benefits
in making regulatory decisions. Thus, pesticide uses which might qualify under the standards for registration and
a section 408 tolerance could still fail to meet the standard for a food additive regulation under section 409. Where
that is the case, and a section 409 food additive regulation is needed, EPA regulations state that a FIFRA registration
may not be granted, and it is EPA policy not to approve a section 408 tolerance for such a use either. 
In the wake of 

Les v. Reilly

, the National Food Processors Association (NFPA) and other food processing and production groups have petitioned
EPA to change its policy linking actions under section 408 (raw food) and section 409 (processed food). Such a change
in policy would require EPA to amend its regulations concerning the registration requirement that all needed section
409 food additive regulations be in place. Additionally, the NFPA petition challenges the factual basis for EPA's
conclusion that processing studies are an accurate measure of whether processed foods will contain pesticide residues
greater than the section 408 tolerance and thus need a section 409 tolerance.
In response to the NFPA petition, EPA has published for public comment a notice (``NFPA petition notice'') summarizing
the petition and current EPA policies and procedures that are potentially affected by issues raised in the NFPA petition,
including EPA's procedures for determining when a 409 food additive regulation is needed and EPA's policy of coordinating
the decision on the 408 tolerance and registration with the 409 food additive regulation (58 FR 7473, Feb. 5, 1993).
Further, EPA also has released, on Febrary 2, 1993, a list of 32 pesticides that either have or need section 409 food
additive regulations under EPA's policy and that also appear to induce cancer within the meaning of the Delaney Clause.
EPA intends to update this list periodically. Although EPA has not made a formal ``induces cancer'' finding for many
of these pesticides, EPA currently believes that most, if not all, of the pesticides classified in Group A, B, or C according
to EPA's Cancer Assessment Guidelines will come within the Delaney Clause standard. EPA places a high priority on
responding to the legal, policy, science, and factual issues raised by the NFPA petition and the 

Les v. Reilly

 decision. However, these issues are both complex and interrelated and cannot be addressed quickly.


II. Reasons for Policy on Tolerance Petitions and Registration Actions Affected by Delaney Clause


EPA is adopting this policy at the present time as part of the priorities it has established following the decision
in 

Les v. Reilly

. The 

Les v. Reilly

 decision clearly established that the Delaney Clause bars the existence of a food additive regulation for any pesticide
that induces cancer in man or animal. EPA has determined that there presently exist as many as 50 food additive regulations
for pesticides that may meet the induce-cancer standard. EPA's first priority, thus, following the 

Les v. Reilly

 decision is to determine which of these regulations must be revoked and to do so promptly. Because food additive regulations
are only established in situations where EPA believes they are needed to prevent the adulteration of food, EPA's second
priority will be to determine what action should be taken, if any, against the FIFRA registrations and section 408
tolerances which are associated with the food additive regulations to be revoked. This issue has been made more complex,
as explained above, by the NFPA petition which challenges EPA's existing policies on this matter. Finally, EPA's
third priority is to address the many petitions for establishing food additive regulations which raise Delaney Clause
problems. 
Ideally, EPA would prefer to address simultaneously all pending petitions to establish food additive regulations
and all existing food additive regulations which are inconsistent with the Delaney Clause. EPA, however, has limited
resources. EPA estimates that in the next several months it will initiate revocation actions against over 25 food
additive regulations based on the Delaney Clause. EPA will also have to resolve what policy to follow on the associated
section 408 tolerances and registrations and implement those actions as well. This could result in EPA action against
80 or more pesticide uses. Aggressively moving to deny pending applications which raise Delaney Clause problems
could exhaust EPA's limited resources on pesticide uses not on the market while tolerances inconsistent with the
statute remain in place. Finally, EPA also must take into account that it receives thousands of registration and tolerance
actions each year. Devoting substantial resources to petitions raising Delaney Clause issues will delay action
on the more routine actions. This is especially the case where EPA has not yet resolved the important policy issues
relating to the interrelationship of section 409 food additive regulations and section 408 tolerances and FIFRA
registrations because actions taken today might have to be revised if EPA policies are altered. EPA will reexamine
this policy once it has resolved the policy issues raised by the NFPA petition.


III. Policy 


EPA will temporarily stop all review and processing work related to 

establishing

 a registration and/or tolerance(s) for any chemical/crop combination in which: (1) either the chemical has been
found to induce cancer in man or animal or the chemical has shown evidence of carcinogenicity in animals or humans;
and (2) the pesticide residue in or on a raw agricultural commodity concentrates when that commodity is processed
or EPA otherwise determines that a food additive regulation is needed for the use. This will include any work on registrations
under FIFRA section 3, experimental use permits under FIFRA section 5, associated tolerances under section 408 of
the FFDCA, as well as food additive regulations under section 409 of the FFDCA. Work on tolerances and registrations
for other uses of the chemical, where a food additive regulation is not needed, may continue. However, EPA approves
or denies tolerance petitions in toto. Therefore, if a petition seeks a tolerance for any residue that appears subject
to the Delaney Clause, that petition cannot be approved and work on all tolerances in that petition will temporarily
stop. The Agency advises any person who has submitted a pending tolerance petition containing a tolerance that appears
to be subject to the Delaney Clause to amend the petition to separate the tolerances not affected by the Delaney Clause
so that work on these tolerances may resume. 
EPA will also disapprove any State registrations approved under section 24 of FIFRA if the registration depends on
the existence of a food additive regulation that is subject to revocation under the Delaney Clause. The basis of such
disapproval would be that the registration is ``inconsistent with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,'' FIFRA
sec. 24(c)(3). States are urged not to approve such section 24(c) registrations, since State approval followed within
90 days by EPA disapproval will be disruptive and cause unncessary economic burdens. 


IV. Implementation


Once the determination has been made that a pesticide use may result in a residue that appears to be subject to the Delaney
Clause, the PM will notify the applicant or petitioner in writing of the status of the tolerance petition and associated
application(s), i.e., that all review and processing work has been stopped and the reason for this action. These registrations
and petitions will continue to be considered pending; EPA is not denying these registrations and petitions. If a registrant
wishes to amend the tolerance petition after such notification to allow work to continue on uses not affected by the
Delaney Clause, such an amendment may be submitted to the PM by the usual procedure. The tolerance petitions or registration
applications will not be returned to the registrant or subject to any ``abandoned petition'' policy unless EPA, in
the future, prescribes some further action that registrants must respond to affirmatively within a set time period.
EPA will notify applicants and petitioners if and when the the Agency resumes review and processing of a petition and
associated registration applications on which review was stopped under this policy. Such notice may be by letter,
or by issuance of a policy notice or rule in which implementation is addressed.
EPA believes its limited resources are best directed at first removing regulations inconsistent with the statute
and EPA policies and then making final determinations on petitions which, because they meet the above criteria, are
likely to be denied. To the extent, however, that a petitioner believes that EPA has wrongly characterized its petition
as meeting the criteria or that there exists some other basis for granting the petition, EPA will, on a case-by-case
basis, consistent with its obligation to protect the public health, adjust its priorities so that a formal action
can be taken on the petition. In addition, EPA will give any petitioner a denial, if that is requested.
There are approximately 60 actions currently in review that EPA believes are subject to this policy. EPA will begin
sending individual notices to registrants and petitioners within 30 days of this notice and expects to complete notification
within 90 days. A registrant who receives no notification may assume that petitions and application actions continue
in active review. 
This policy does not affect the registration of new products or new uses which have an associated 409 tolerance that
has already been established even if, under the Delaney Clause, that tolerance would not now be granted. However,
EPA intends to revoke such tolerances in the future, and will, after revocation, immediately stop review and processing
of additional pending actions dependent on the tolerance at that time. Registrants who intend to submit new registration
applications under these circumstances may wish to await further Agency action before submitting applications
that may be affected by such revocations.
A final decision on whether to approve or deny the tolerance petitions and associated FIFRA applications that appear
to be subject to the Delaney Clause must await resolution of the complex, interrelated issues raised in the NFPA petition
and summarized above and will be staggered in such a manner so as to conserve resources for addressing currently approved
food additive regulations, tolerances, and registrations. Some of these issues may be addressed by pending legislation.
In the absence of such legislative changes, EPA does not believe that most of the issues will be addressed until later
this year.

<DOCTITLE>Receipt of Application for Emergency Exemption To Use Imidacloprid; Solicitation of Public Comment </DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has received specific exemption requests from the Oregon and Utah Departments of Agriculture (hereafter referred
to as the ``Applicants'') to use the pesticide Imidacloprid (CAS 105827-78-9) to treat up to 13,000 acres
of apples to control aphids. The Applicants propose the use of a new chemical; therefore, in accordance with 40 CFR
166.24, EPA is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant the exemption. 



 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator
may, at her discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency
conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicants have requested the Administrator to issue specific
exemptions for the use of imidacloprid on apples to control aphids. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166
was submitted as part of this request. 



The Applicants state that aphids have been a chronic pest of apples in Oregon and Utah. Aphids feed on the plant tissues
of young trees, which can stunt growth and affect future tree productivity. On large, vigorous trees, the primary
concern is fruit damage. Aphids excrete such large amounts of honeydew that it drips on the fruit, causing russetting
or providing a substrate for the growth of sooty mold. The value of such damaged fruit is considerably reduced, as it
is diverted to a processing market. The Applicants state that some of the registered alternative pesticides, while
once effective, have lost much of their effectiveness due to build-up of resistant aphid populations. Others are
said to only provide suppression, and not adequately control aphids. One of the registered alternatives (phosphamidon)
that is still somewhat effective for this pest problem was withdrawn from the market in 1991, due to non-support for
re-registration, and existing stocks have been mostly depleted. Another chemical (mevinphos) was previously used
for this pest, but because of human risk concerns the manufacturer removed all labeled uses of mevinphos on apples
and pears from the label in 1993. Therefore, the Applicants claim that Oregon and Utah apple growers are left without
adequate means to control aphids. The Applicants anticipate crop value losses of approximately 10 percent without
the availability of imidacloprid this growing season. 

The Oregon and Utah Departments of Agriculture propose that imidacloprid be used at a maximum rate of 0.1 lb. active
ingredient (a.i.), or 6.4 fluid oz. of product, per acre with a maximum of 5 applications. No more than 0.5 lb. a.i. (32
fluid oz. of product) applied per year. Oregon proposes treatment on up to 9,500 acres of apples. This would total approximately
4,750 lbs. of a.i, or 2,375 gal. of product. Utah proposes treatment on up to 3,363 acres of apples. This would total
approximately 1,682 lbs. of a.i., or 841 gal. of product. This is the first time the Applicants have applied for the
use of imidacloprid on apples. A section 18 for this use of imidacloprid was issued by the Agency to Washington State
on March 7, 1994 for up to 160,980 acres.

This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the applications themselves. The regulations governing section
18 require publication of a notice of receipt of an application for a specific exemption proposing use of a new chemical
(i.e., an active ingredient not contained in any currently registered pesticide). Such notice provides for opportunity
for public comment on the application. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject
to the Field Operations Division at the address above.

The Agency, accordingly, will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining
whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the Oregon and Utah Departments of Agriculture.

<DOCTITLE>Receipt of Application for Emergency Exemption To Use Imidacloprid; </DOCTITLE>

Solicitation of Public Comment 





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has received a specific exemption request from the Arizona Department of Agriculture (hereafter referred to
as the ``Applicant'') to use the pesticide imidacloprid (CAS 105827-78-9) to treat up to 25,000 acres
of melons to control the sweet potato whitefly (

Bemesia tabaci

). 
The Applicant proposes the use of a new chemical; therefore, 
in accordance with 40 CFR 166.24, EPA is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant
the exemption. 



 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator
may, at her discretion, exempt a state agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency
conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific
exemption for the use of imidacloprid on melons to control the sweet potato whitefly (SPWF). Information in accordance
with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of this request. 



The SPWF is common on many wild and cultivated crops such as tomatoes, cotton, cucurbits and solanaceae. The sweet
potato whitefly (SPWF) is a relatively new pest on melons. The SPWF has caused severe economic damage to several other
commodities nationwide including cotton, lettuce, squash, beans, peanuts, and ornamentals. According to the Applicant,
SPWF populations for this season are expected to be widespread, and heavy enough to cause serious economic loss to
the melon crop. SPWF causes damage through feeding activities, and also indirectly through the production of a honeydew,
which encourages growth of sooty mold and other fungi. The Applicant claims that adequate control of the SPWF is not
being achieved with the currently registered compounds and that without imidacloprid, melon growers will incur
a significant economic loss. 

Along with this request, the Applicant has also requested a specific exemption for use of a different chemical (bifenthrin)
on melons for control of the SPWF. The Applicant justifies requests for two chemicals, by stating that the imidacloprid
would be applied at or near planting/transplanting, as a soil incorporated treatment; since imidacloprid is a systemic,
it would be taken up by the small seedlings, and protect them from SPWF feeding during this early stage of development.
The Applicant states that bifenthrin, being non-systemic, is only of use as a foliar spray, which is of little value
during the early phase of development, when there is limited leaf area. Thus the Applicant proposes that use of bifenthrin
be allowed later in the crop season, as a foliar treatment, to maintain season-long control. The Applicant indicates
that imidacloprid would not be of use as both a soil treatment and a foliar spray, because its mode of action is such that
resistance development is a concern. The Registrant of imidacloprid will not support the use of this chemical further
into the growing season for this reason. 

The Applicant proposes to apply imidacloprid at a maximum rate of 0.25 lb. (dry) active ingredient (16 fluid oz. of
product) per acre with a maximum of one application per crop season on a total of 25,000 acres of melons. Use under this
exemption could potentially amount to a maximum total of 6,250 lbs. of active ingredient, or 3,125 gal. of product.
This is the first time that the Applicant has applied for the use of imidacloprid on melons. However, the Applicant
requested, and was granted, specific exemptions for the use of bifenthrin for SPWF control in melons for the past two
years (this is the third consecutive year for the request for bifenthrin). 

This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing section 18
require publication of a notice of receipt of an application for a specific exemption proposing use of a new chemical
(i.e., an active ingredient not contained in any currently registered pesticide). Such notice provides for opportunity
for public comment on the application. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject
to the Field Operations Division at the address above.

The Agency, accordingly, will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining
whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the Arizona Department of Agriculture.

<DOCTITLE>Receipt of Application for Emergency Exemption To Use Mancozeb; Solicitation of Public Comment </DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has received a specific exemption request from the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection
(hereafter referred to as the ``Applicant'') for use of the pesticide mancozeb (CAS 8018-01-7) to control
leaf, stem blight on ginseng. In accordance with 40 CFR 166.24, EPA is soliciting public comment before making the
decision whether or not to grant the exemption. 



 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator
may, at her discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency
conditions exist which require such exemption.



The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific exemption for the use of the mancozeb, available
as Dithane DF (EPA Reg. No. 707-180) from Rohm and Haas Co., to control leaf, stem blight, caused by the fungus


Alternaria panax

 and 

Phytophthora cactorum

, on a maximum of 4,167 acres in Wisconsin. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of this
request. 

According to the Applicant, Alternaria blight rarely kills the ginseng root, which is the marketed portion; however,
loss of the foliage results in significant root yield loss in a harvested crop, and retards root growth and overwintering
ability in younger crops. Infestations of Alternaria blight in one season greatly increase the potential for epidemics
in subsequent seasons, since the fungus remains in the infected plant debris. 

Alternaria panax

 has become resistant to Rovral 50W, the only fungicide carrying a section 3 label for use against Alternaria blight
on ginseng. Rovral by itself can no longer be effective to control Alternaris. Other fungicides are also substantially
less effective than Dithane. If not controlled, the disease can be expected to infest all of Wisconsin's 5,000 acres
of ginseng.

Under the proposed exemption 2.0 lbs of product (1.5 lbs of a.i.) per acre will be used on 4,167 acres. A maximum of 12
applications at a minimum of 7-day intervals will be made by ground equipment using a minimum of 80 gallons of
water per acre. A 28-day pre-harvest interval will be observed. Applications will be made by certified private
or commercial applicators or persons under their direct supervision. In addition, applicators, mixer/loaders,
and persons entering treated ginseng gardens to work must wear chemical-resistant gloves, long-legged pants and
long-sleeved shirts.

This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing section 18
require that the Agency publish notice of receipt in the 

Federal Register

 and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption if an emergency exemption has been subject to
a Special Review, and is intended for a use that could pose a risk similar to the risk posed by any use of the pesticide
which is or has been subject of the Special Review. [40 CFR 166.24 (a)(5)].

The Agency initiated a Special Review of the ethylene bisdithiocarbamate (EBDC) fungicides on July 17, 1987, which
includes mancozeb. A notice of final determination was issued March 2, 1992. The Agency took this action based on an
assessment of the risks from exposure to ethylenethiourea (ETU) present in, or formed as a result of metabolic conversion
from, pesticide products containing the active ingredient mancozeb. ETU, a potential human carcinogen, teratogen,
and thyroid toxicant, is present as a contaminant, degradation product, and metabolite of all the EBDC pesticides.
The Agency concluded that the estimated cumulative risk of 10

-5

 from all current 55 food uses was unacceptable and, therefore, canceled the following 11 food uses: apricots, carrots,
celery, collards, mustard greens, nectarines, peaches, rhubarb, spinach succulent beans and turnips. These cancellations
reduce estimated lifetime dietary risk to 1.6 

 x 

 10

-6

 which the Agency has determined does not outweigh the benefits of the 44 retained uses.

The regulations governing section 18 also require the Agency to publish a notice of receipt in the 

Federal Register

 and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption if an emergency exemption has been requested
or granted for that use in any 3 previous years, and a complete application for registration of that use has not been
submitted to the Agency [40 CFR 166.24 (a) (6)]. Exemptions for the use of mancozeb on ginseng have been requested for
the past 7 years (1987 thru 1993). Mancozeb was granted for use on ginseng in 1991 and 1993 and Wisconsin went crisis
in 1992. An application for registration of this use has not been submitted to the Agency.

Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject to the Field Operations Division at the
address above. The Agency will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining
whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer
Protection.

products K-Othrine SC 5.0 and Deltamethrin Technical, containing active ingredients not included in any previously
registered products pursuant to the provisions of section 3(c)(5) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide
Act (FIFRA), as amended. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA issued notices, published in the 

Federal Register

 of July 1, 1992 (57 FR 29311) and November 18, 1992 (57 FR 54402), which announced that Roussel Bio Corp., 170 Beaver
Brook Road, Lincoln Park, NJ 07035, had submitted applications to register the pesticide products K-Othrine SC 5.0,
and Deltamethrin Technical, (EPA File Symbols 432-TAG and 432-TAE), ~containing the active ingredients

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces Agency approval of applications submitted by Sandoz Agro, Inc. to conditionally register
the pesticide products Sentinel 40WG Turf Fungicide, Technical Cyproconazole, and Sentinel 40WG For Repackaging
Use Only containing a new active ingredient not included in any previously registered products pursuant to the provisions
of section 3(c)(7)(C) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA issued a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of September 28, 1988 (53 FR 37866), which announced that Sandoz Crop Protection Corp., 1300 E. Touchy Ave., Des Plaines,
IL 60018, had submitted applications to register the pesticide products Cyproconazole 40% WG Fungicide containing
the active ingredient (4-chlorophenyl)-(1-cyclopropylethyl) triazole-1-ethanol at 40 percent and Technical
Cyproconazole containing the active ingredient cyproconazole-alpha-(4-chlorophenyl)-alpha-(1-cyclopropylethyl)-(1

H

-1,2,4-triazole-1-ethanol) at 93 percent~ (EPA File Symbols 55947-RGE and 55947-RGG) respectively,
active ingredients not included in any previously registered products. 



The company changed the name of one of the products from ``Cyproconazole 40% WG Fungicide'' to ``Sentinel 40WG Turf
Fungicide'' and amended the active ingredient to read ``cyproconazole [alpha-(4-chlorophenyl)-(1-cyclopropylethyl)
triazole-1-ethanol.'' 

EPA also received an application from Sandoz Agro, Inc. to conditonally register the product Sentinel 40WG For Repackaging
Use Only (EPA File Symbol 55947-RLA), which was inadvertently omitted from the notice that published in the


Federal Register

 of September 28, 1988. This product contains 40 percent of the active ingredient cyproconazole [alpha-(4-chlorophenyl)-alpha-(1-cyclopropylethyl)-(1

H

-1,2,4-triazole-1-ethanol). However, since the notice of receipt of application for Sentinel 40 WG was not published
in 

Federal Register

, as required by section 3(c)(4) of FIFRA, as amended, interested parties may submit written comments within 30 days
from the date of publication of this notice for this product only. 
~These applications ~were approved on December 22, 1993 as Sentinel 40WG Turf Fungicide (EPA Registration Number
55947-132) for foliar application on turf, Technical Cyproconazole (EPA Registration Number 55947-133)
for manufacturing purposes only, and Sentinel 40WG For Repackaging Use Only (EPA Registration Number 55947-156)
for repackaging use only. 
A conditional registration may be granted under section 3(c)(7)(C) of FIFRA for a new active ingredient where certain
data are lacking because a period reasonably sufficient for generation of the data has not elapsed since the Administrator
first imposed the data requirements, on condition that such data are received by the end of the conditional registration
period and do not meet or exceed the risk criteria set forth in 40 CFR 154.7; that use of the pesticide during the conditional
registration period will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment; and that use of the pesticide
is in the public interest. 
The Agency has considered the available data on the risks associated with the proposed use of cyproconazole, ~~~and
information on social, economic, and environmental benefits to be derived from such use. Specifically, the Agency
has considered the nature of the chemical and its pattern of use, application methods and rates, and level and extent
of potential exposure. Based on these reviews, the Agency was able to make basic health and safety determinations
which show that use of cyproconazole ~~~during the period of conditional registration is not expected to cause any
unreasonable adverse effect on the environment, and that use of the pesticide is in the public interest. 
Consistent with section 3(c)(7)(C), the Agency has determined that these conditional registrations are in the public
interest. Use of the pesticides are of significance to the user community, and appropriate labeling, use directions,
and other measures have been taken to ensure that use of the pesticides will not result in unreasonable adverse effects
to man and the environment. 
More detailed information on these conditional registrations is contained in the EPA Pesticide Fact Sheet on cyproconazole.

~~~
A copy of the fact sheet, which provides a summary description of the chemical, use patterns and formulations, science
findings, and the Agency's regulatory position and rationale, may be obtained from the National Technical Information
Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. 
In accordance with section 3(c)(2) of FIFRA, a copy of the approved label and the list of data references used to support
registration are available for public inspection in the office of the Product Manager. The data and other scientific
information used to support registration, except for material specifically protected by section 10 of FIFRA, are

Assessment of Medical Technology 


The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR), through its Office of Health Technology Assessment (OHTA),
announces that it is initiating a Technology Assessment or a Technology Review (see below) of the safety, clinical
effectiveness and indications for the use of signal-averaged electrocardiography (SAECG). This technique reduces
the level of background noise that is present in the standard electrocardiography and allows the detection of signals
of very low amplitude, such as ventricular late potentials. The AHCPR is particularly interested in whether the performance
of SAECG has a positive effect on health outcomes and whether it influences the medical management of the patient.

A description of AHCPR's process for conducting technology assessments and technology reviews was published in
the 

Federal Register

, December 3, 1993. In brief, the full assessment process includes an extensive review of the published literature,
consultation with other components of the Public Health Service (PHS), obtaining information from relevant specialty
groups and evaluation of information received in response to a 

Federal Register

 notice. A technology review is a shorter evaluation of a technology; it may be performed if the medical or scientific
questions posed are limited, the available evidence is limited and the published medical literature is insufficient
in quantity or quality, or the time frame available precludes utilization of the full assessment process. 
The AHCPR is interested in receiving information which would help in the assessment or review of the technology as
described above. To enable the scientific community to evaluate the information included in the assessment or review,
AHCPR will discuss in the assessment or review only those data and analyses for which a source(s) may be cited. Respondents
are therefore encouraged to include with their submissions a written consent permitting AHCPR to cite the sources
of the data and comments provided. Otherwise, in accordance with the confidentiality statute governing information
collected by AHCPR, 42 U.S.C. 
299a-l(c), no information received will be published or disclosed which could identify an individual or entity described
in the information, or could identify an entity or individual supplying the information. 

Information and comments should be submitted in writing no later than July 5, 1994 to the AHCPR Office of Health Technology
Assessment at the address below.

Cooperative Agreements for Studies to Evaluate the 
Effectiveness of Interventions to Prevent or Reduce 
Childhood Lead Poisoning, 
Notice of Availability of Funds for Fiscal Year 1994 


Introduction


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
a cooperative agreement program to conduct studies to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to prevent or
reduce childhood lead poisoning. 
The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality
of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of Environmental Health. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy
People 2000,'' see the section 

WHERE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

.)


Authority 


This program is authorized under sections 301(a) (42 U.S.C. 241(a)) and 317A (42 U.S.C. 247b-1) of the Public Health
Service Act, as amended. Program regulations are set forth in 42 CFR part 51b. 



Smoke-Free Workplace 


The Public Health Service strongly encourages all cooperative agreement recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace
and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the
physical and mental health of the American people. 


Eligible Applicants 


Applications may be submitted by public and private, nonprofit and for-profit organizations and governments and
their agencies. Thus, universities, colleges, research institutions, hospitals, other public and private organizations,
State and local health departments or their bona fide agents, and small, minority and/or women-owned businesses
are eligible for these cooperative agreements. 
Applications will be considered for funding to conduct studies in one or more programmatic interest areas. Applicants
interested in conducting more than one study must submit a separate application for each. If a single study addresses
more than one programmatic interest area, only one should be identified as the primary interest area. The programmatic
interest area should be clearly indicated for each study. 



Availability of Funds 


Approximately $600,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund approximately three cooperative agreements. It is expected
that the average award will be $200,000 (direct and indirect cost), ranging from $100,000 to $350,000. It is expected
that the awards will begin on or about September 30, 1994. The awards will be made for 12-month budget periods within
a project period up to 3 years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change based on the availability of funds.

Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability
of funds. 


Purpose 


The purpose of these awards is to study important epidemiologic questions critical to the implementation, operation,
and expansion of childhood lead poisoning prevention programs, and to support the development of guidelines and
policies. These awards are to study: 
1. The effectiveness of environmental interventions for primary prevention of childhood lead poisoning;

<TEXT>
 

2. The effectiveness of nutritional strategies in preventing and/or reducing childhood lead poisoning; and
3. The effectiveness of education strategies in preventing and/or reducing childhood lead poisoning.


Program Requirements


To fulfill the objectives of this cooperative agreement, an applicant must meet the following requirements:
1. A director who has specific authority and responsibility to carry out the requirements of the project.
2. Demonstrated ability to collect and analyze data needed to fulfill the study objectives.
3. Demonstrated experience in conducting relevant epidemiologic studies.
4. Demonstrated effective and well-defined working relationships within the performing organization and with
outside entities which will insure implementation of the proposed study.
5. Demonstrated access to a laboratory with demonstrated proficiency in performing blood lead (and other laboratory
measurements as indicated in the applicant's study protocol).
6. Demonstrated ability to insure that children identified with elevated blood levels receive appropriate medical
and environmental management through an ongoing childhood lead poisoning prevention program (which need not be
applicant's organization).
7. For applicants proposing to ``evaluate the effectiveness of environmental lead hazard reduction interventions,''
the following additional requirements apply:



 Applicant has responsibility for ongoing lead hazard inspection and reduction activities or must document
a close working relationship with the agency or organization responsible for ongoing lead hazard inspection and
reduction activities. If the applicant does not have direct responsibility for such activities, a letter of support
from the organization with that responsibility is required. Ongoing activities should include the inspection of
residences of children identified with elevated blood lead levels for lead hazards and provide for or insure the reduction
of identified lead hazards.
 The lead hazard identification and reduction program should be based on written guidelines, statutes, or
regulations that specify methods used to inspect dwellings, and identify and reduce lead hazards. Lead hazard reduction
standards should include: acceptable methods of controlling lead-based paint hazards (including dust); requirements
for containment and clean-up of dust and debris generated by the lead hazard control process; and inspection of dwellings
to ensure compliance with applicable lead hazard control standards.





Note:

 Eligible applicants may enter into contracts, including consortia agreements, as necessary to meet the requirements
of the program and strengthen the overall application; however, applicants must perform a substantial portion of
the activities for which funds are requested.


Programmatic Interest Areas


The studies must be in one of these following areas:
1. Prospective studies to evaluate the effectiveness of environmental lead hazard reduction interventions in primary
prevention of childhood lead poisoning (e.g., preventing blood lead levels from increasing). Preferably, these
studies should be done collaboratively with health, housing, and environmental government agencies, and community-based
organizations.
2. Prospective studies to determine the effectiveness of nutritional supplements or dietary changes in preventing
blood lead levels from increasing and/or in reducing blood lead levels in young children.
3. Prospective studies to determine the effectiveness of education of care givers in preventing blood lead levels
from increasing and/or in reducing blood lead levels in young children. Educational activities may include provision
of cleaning or other supplies.


Cooperative Activities


In conducting activities to achieve the purpose of these cooperative agreements, the recipient will be responsible
for conducting activities under A. (Recipient Activities), and CDC will be responsible for conducting activities
under B. (CDC Activities):


A. Recipient Activities


1. Conduct study activities, including: (1) Enrolling eligible study subjects, after obtaining informed consent;
(2) collecting data; (3) ensuring appropriate medical and environmental management of study subjects, and (4) conducting
all other components required for implementation of the study.
2. Enter and maintain data in a computerized database.
3. Analyze collected data and prepare a report of the study findings.


B. CDC Activities

State-Based Programs to Reduce the Burden of Diabetes: 
A Health Systems Approach; 
Notice of Availability of Funds for Fiscal Year 1994 



Introduction 


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
new applications for cooperative agreements to develop, implement, and evaluate State-based diabetes control
programs (DCPs). The program is designed to establish the DCP as a key component of an evolving health care environment.
The conceptual framework within which successful applicants should operate is characterized by four areas of program
activity: (1) Defining the nature, extent, distribution, and causes of the burden of diabetes; (2) Developing new,
effective approaches for reducing the diabetes burden which complement emerging health care systems; (3) Implementing
specific measures to ensure the widespread application of accepted standards, policies, and protocols to reduce
the burden of diabetes; and (4) Coordinating the diabetes-related efforts of the public health system with private
health care providers and payers, as well as with all appropriate governmental, voluntary, professional, and academic
institutions. 

This announcement addresses two distinct levels of program support, both of which are consistent with the conceptual
framework described above. The first is a Core Capacity Program, which defines basic diabetes prevention and control
activities to be carried out through existing and evolving health care systems. The second is an Enhanced Program,
which is intended to introduce additional, innovative elements to a State's diabetes prevention and control efforts,
and is also carried out through existing and evolving health care systems. 
The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and 
disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led, national activity to 
reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is primarily related to Priority
Area 17, Diabetes and Chronic Disabling Conditions_with particular attention to populations at disproportionate
risk of developing diabetes, 
including minorities and the elderly. However, it also is relevant to other priority areas, including Physical Activity
and Fitness, Nutrition, Tobacco, Educational and Community-Based Programs, Maternal and Infant Health, Heart
Disease and Stroke, Clinical Preventive Services, and Surveillance and Data Systems. (To order a copy of Healthy
People 2000, see the section 

WHERE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

.) 


Authority 


This program is authorized under sections 301(a) and 317(k)(3) [42 U.S.C. 241(a) and 247b (k) (3)] of the Public Health
Service Act. Applicable program regulations are found in 45 CFR part 92. 


Smoke-Free Workplace 


The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 


Eligible Applicants 


Eligible applicants are the official public health agencies of States or their bona fide agents or instrumentalities.
This includes the District of Columbia, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U. S. Virgin Islands,
the Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the
Republic of Palau. 


Availability of Funds 


Approximately $9,750,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund approximately 42 awards in two categories (Core Capacity
Programs and Enhanced Programs). 


A. Core Capacity Program to Reduce the Burden of Diabetes 


Approximately $8,750,000 is available to fund approximately 40 awards for Core Capacity Programs. It is expected
that the average award will be $230,000, ranging from $150,000 to $350,000. 



B. Enhanced Program to Reduce the Burden of Diabetes 


Approximately $1,000,000 is available to fund approximately 2 awards for Enhanced Programs. It is expected that
the average award will be $500,000, ranging from $300,000 to $700,000. Enhanced Program awards will only be considered
for those applicants who compete successfully and are funded for Core Capacity Program awards. 
It is expected that awards will begin on or about July 1, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project
period of up to 5 years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. 
Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and availability
of funds. 
At the request of the applicant, Federal personnel may be assigned to a project in lieu of 
a portion of the financial assistance. 


Purpose 


The purpose of this program is to provide financial and programmatic assistance to States and territories for integrating
diabetes prevention and control activities within existing and evolving health care systems.

Program Requirements 


The program described in this announcement reflects a significant shift by the DCP from the direct provision of personal
health services to a responsibility for leadership and coordination of overall efforts of the health system to reduce
the burden of diabetes. Both a Core Capacity Program and an Enhanced Program are conceptualized by the four categories
of program activity described under 

INTRODUCTION

 in this announcement. The central objective of a Core Capacity Program is to assist the State to establish the basic
public health framework for leading and coordinating the efforts of the health care system and other public and private
resources to reduce the burden of diabetes. A Core Capacity Program must address all four categories of program activity.

An established Core Capacity Program is the foundation on which an Enhanced Program is built. The central objective
of an Enhanced Program is to move the State program vigorously into a position from which it can take the lead in ensuring
that diabetes-specific, community preventive health services are an integral part of a reformed health system.
An Enhanced Program must involve the addition of innovative approaches not employed in the Core Capacity Program
to reduce the burden of diabetes. Simple expansion of Core Capacity Program activities does not constitute an Enhanced
Program. 
A recipient of an award for an Enhanced Program may choose to focus its initial enhancement efforts on fewer than all
four of the basic categories of program activity. However, at a minimum, the recipient must indicate that activities
will be undertaken in 
the first budget year related to (1) defining the burden of diabetes and (2) coordinating 
the overall effort to reduce the diabetes burden. It is expected that each Enhanced 
Program will be fully operational, including all four categories, within four years of the State's initial Enhanced
Program award. 
In conducting activities to achieve the purpose of this program, the recipient shall be responsible for the activities
described under A., below, and CDC shall be responsible 
for carrying out the activities described under B., below. 


A. Recipient Activities 


1. Define and monitor the burden of diabetes through the establishment and maintenance of a State-based surveillance
system which focuses on diabetes as a public health problem. 
2. Develop new approaches to reduce the burden of diabetes through the development or adaptation of specific interventions
to be applied within the existing and evolving health care system. 
3. Implement specific measures to reduce the burden of diabetes by ensuring the widespread application of accepted
standards, policies, and protocols developed for that purpose. These should include protocols designed to prevent
or postpone the occurrence of the major complications of diabetes, as well as diabetes-related cardiovascular disease.
In addition, they should include protocols to ensure that persons with diabetes improve their efforts to achieve
levels of glycemic control consistent with the results of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). 
4. Coordinate overall program efforts of the health system to reduce the burden of diabetes through the establishment
of appropriate linkages with other governmental agencies; private health care providers; academic institutions;
community-based organizations; voluntary agencies; health care reimbursement organizations; national organizations
representing populations disproportionately burdened by diabetes, such as minorities and the elderly; and others.



B. CDC Activities 


1. Define and monitor the burden of diabetes by providing technical assistance in the development of surveillance
and other data systems to measure and characterize the burden of diabetes and its complications. 
2. Develop new approaches for reducing the burden of diabetes through the provision of program guidelines for, and
technical assistance in, the development or adaptation of specific interventions to be applied within the existing
and evolving health care system. 
3. Implement specific measures to reduce the burden of diabetes through the provision of program guidelines for,
and by collaborating in the implementation of, accepted standards, policies, and protocols within the existing
and evolving health care system. 
4. Coordinate overall program efforts of the health care system to reduce the burden of diabetes through the provision
of program guidelines, and by facilitating communication among DCPs and with other governmental agencies, private
health care providers, academic institutions, community-based organizations, voluntary agencies, health care
reimbursement organizations, and others, to assist them in ensuring optimal coordination among all components
of the public health and health care systems to address the burden of diabetes.

The Community Services Block Grant Act as amended authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make funds
available under several programs to support program activities which will result in direct benefits targeted to
low-income people. This Program Announcement covers the grant authority found at Section 681A, Community Food and
Nutrition, which authorizes the Secretary to make funds available for grants to be awarded on a competitive basis
to eligible entities for local and statewide programs (1) to coordinate existing private and public food assistance
resources, whenever such coordination is determined to be inadequate, to better serve low-income communities;
(2) to assist low-income communities to identify potential sponsors of child nutrition programs and to initiate
new programs in underserved or unserved areas; and (3) to develop innovative approaches at the State and local levels
to meet the nutrition needs of low-income people. 
The Act also requires that 20 percent of appropriated funds in excess of $6 million be awarded on a competitive basis
to eligible agencies for nationwide programs, including programs benefitting Native Americans and Migrant Farmworkers.

_Eligible Entity: States and other public and private non-profit agencies/organizations including agencies which
administer nationwide programs. 

_Project Period: The term ``project period'' refers to the total time a project is approved for support, including
any approved extensions. 

_Self-Sufficiency: A condition where an individual or family does not need and is not eligible for public assistance.




3. Purpose of Community Food and Nutrition Program 



The Department of Health and Human Services is committed to improving the health and well-being of individuals through
improved preventive health care and promotion of personal responsibility. The Department seeks to unify the approach
to health promotion and disease prevention activities with personal messages aimed at families and communities,
in various settings and environments in which individuals and groups can most effectively be reached. 
The Department is specifically interested in improving the health status of minority and low-income persons. HHS
encourages community efforts to improve the coordination and integration of health services for all low-income
families, and to identify opportunities for integrating other programs and services for this population. 



a. Project Requirements 



Projects funded under this program should: 

(1) Be designed and intended to provide nutrition benefits, including those which incorporate the benefits of disease
prevention, to a targeted low-income group of people; 

(2) Provide outreach or public education to inform low-income individuals and displaced workers of the services
available to them under the various Federally-assisted nutrition programs; 

(3) Focus on one or more legislatively mandated program activities: 

(a) Coordination of existing private and public food assistance resources, whenever such coordination is determined
to be inadequate, to better serve low-income populations;

Part B_Application Requirements 


1. Eligible Applicants 


Eligible applicants are States, public and private non-profit agencies/organizations with a demonstrated ability
to successfully develop and implement programs and activities similar to those enumerated above. OCS encourages
Historically Black Colleges and Universities to submit applications. In addition, applicants for the set-aside
must be either: (1) Indian tribes, 
(2) private non-profit groups whose governing board is comprised of a majority of Indians and whose primary purpose
is serving Indian populations, or (3) groups 
whose sole purpose is serving migrant and seasonal 
farmworker populations. Proof of non-profit status must be included in the Appendices of the Project Narrative where
applicable. Any of the following is acceptable evidence of non-profit status: (1) A copy of the applicant organization's
list in the Internal Revenue Service's most recent list of tax-exempt organizations described in section 501(c)(3)
of the IRS code; or (2) A copy of the currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. Failure to provide evidence of non-profit
status will result in rejection of the application. 


2. Availability of Funds and Grant Amounts 


a. FY 94 Funding 


The funds available for grant awards under the CFN Program in FY 94 are:

 

General Projects 
$2,777,600
Set-Asides 
400,000
Nationwide Programs 
388,800


b. Grant Amounts 


No individual grant application will be considered for an amount which is in excess of $50,000 for applications submitted
under General Projects and Set-Asides. No eligible organization may receive more than $300,000 in the aggregate
for a nationwide program. 


c. Mobilization of Resources 


OCS would like to mobilize as many resources as possible to enhance projects funded under this program. OCS supports
and encourages proposals submitted by applicants whose programs will leverage other resources, either cash or third-party
in-kind. 


3. Project Periods and Budget Periods 


For most projects OCS will grant funds for one year. However, in rare instances, depending on the characteristics
of any individual project and on the justification presented by the applicant in its proposal, a grant may be made for
a period of up to 17 months. 


4. Administrative Costs/Indirect Costs 


There is no administrative cost limitation for projects funded under this program. Indirect costs consistent with
approved Indirect Cost Rate Agreements are allowable. Applicants should enclose a copy of the current approved rate
agreement. However, it should be understood that indirect costs are part of, and not in addition to, the amount of funds
awarded in the subject grant. 



5. Program Beneficiaries 


Projects proposed for funding under this Announcement must result in direct benefits targeted toward low-income
people as defined in the most recent Annual Update of Poverty Income Guidelines published by DHHS. Attachment A to
this Announcement is an excerpt from the most recently published guidelines. Annual revisions of these guidelines
are normally published in the 

Federal Register

 in February or early March of each year and are applicable to projects being implemented at the time of publication.
Grantees will be required to apply the most recent guidelines throughout the project period. The 

Federal Register

 may be obtained from public libraries, Congressional offices, or by writing the Superintendent of Documents, U.S.
Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402. No other government agency or privately defined poverty guidelines
are applicable to the determination of low-income eligibility for this OCS program. 


6. Number of Projects in Application 


An application may contain only one project and this project must address the basic criteria found in Part C. Applications
which are not in compliance with these requirements will be ineligible for funding. 


7. Multiple Submittals 


There is no limit to the number of applications that can be submitted as long as each application contains a proposal
for a different project. However, no applicant can receive more than one grant. 


8. Sub-Contracting or Delegating Projects 


OCS will not fund any project where the role of the eligible applicant is primarily to serve as a conduit for funds to
other organizations. 


Part C_Program Priority Areas 


1. General Projects_FN 


The application should include a description of the target area and population to be served as well as a discussion
of the nature and extent of the problem to be solved. The application must contain a detailed and specific work program
that is both sound and feasible. Projects funded under this Announcement must produce permanent and measurable results
that fulfill the purposes of this program as described in the above. The OCS grant funds, in combination with private
and/or other public resources, must be targeted to low-income individuals and communities. 

Applicants will certify in their submission that projects will only serve the low-income population as stipulated
in the DHHS Poverty Income Guidelines (Attachment A). 
Failure to comply with the cited Act may result in the application being ineligible for consideration for funding.

If an applicant is proposing a project which will affect a property listed in or eligible for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places, it must identify this property in the narrative and explain how it has complied with the
provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 as amended. If there is any question as
to whether the property is listed in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, applicant
should consult with the State Historic Preservation Officer. The applicant should contact OCS early in the development
of its application for instructions regarding compliance with the Act and data required to be submitted to the Department
of Health and Human Services. In the case of projects proposed for funding which mobilize or improve the coordination
of existing public and private food assistance resources, the guidelines governing those resources apply. However,
in the case of projects providing direct assistance to beneficiaries through grants funded under this program, beneficiaries
must fall within the official DHHS Poverty Income Guidelines as set forth in Attachment A. 
Applications which propose the use of grant funds for the development of any printed or visual materials must contain
convincing evidence that these materials are not available from other sources. OCS will not provide funding for such
items if justification is not sufficient. Approval of any films or visual presentations proposed by applicants approved
for funding will be made part of the grant award. In cases where material outlays for equipment (audio and visual) are
requested, specific evidence must be presented that there is a definite programmatic connection between the equipment
(audio and visual) usage and the outreach requirements described in Part A.1.b of this Announcement. 

OCS also is interested in projects that address the needs of homeless families, welfare families, low-income and
minority health initiatives. 

OCS welcomes project proposals which seek to develop innovative approaches to promote health, particularly among
low-income and minority populations. These proposals should have as their goals the reduction of incidences of premature
death and chronic disease among the targeted populations.

2. Set-Asides_SA 


In recognition of the special needs of Indians and Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers, a set-aside will be established
to afford priority consideration to proposals submitted by agencies serving these populations. Applications which
are not funded within this set-aside will also be considered competitively within the larger pool of eligible applicants.

See Part D, Section 1-6, (Criterion II) for special instructions on developing a work program. 


3. Nationwide Programs_NA 


Projects funded must be nationwide in scope and must meet the requirements of Part C.1 (General Projects). No eligible
organization may receive more than $300,000 in the aggregate for a nationwide program. 



Part D_Review Criteria 


Applications which pass the initial screening and pre-rating review (See Part F, Section 5) will be assessed and scored
by reviewers. Each reviewer will give a numerical score for each application reviewed. These numerical scores will
be supported by explanatory statements on a formal rating form describing major strengths and weaknesses under each

from these seventeen jurisdictions need take no action regarding E.O. 12372. Applicants for projects to be administered
by Federally-recognized Indian Tribes are also exempt from the requirements of E.O. 12372. Applicants must submit
any required material to the SPOCs as soon as possible so that the program office can obtain and review SPOC comments
as part of the award process. It is imperative that the applicant submit all required materials, if any, to the SPOC
and indicate the date of this submittal (or the date of contact if no submittal is required) on the Standard Form 424,
item 16a. 

Under 45 CFR 100.8(a) (2), a SPOC has 60 days from the application deadline date to comment on proposed new or competing
continuation awards. Applicants should contact their SPOCs as soon as possible to alert them of the prospective applications
and receive any necessary instructions. SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine endorsements
as official recommendations. Additionally, SPOCs are requested to clearly differentiate between mere advisory
comments and those official State process recommendations which may trigger the ``accommodate or explain'' rule.


When comments are submitted directly to ACF, they should be addressed to: Department of Health and Human Services
Administration for Children and Families 
Division of Discretionary Grants, 6th Floor 
370 L'Enfant Promenade, SW. 
Washington, DC 20447. 

A list of the Single Points of Contact for each State and Territory is included as Attachment E of this Announcement.




4. Application Consideration 



Applications which meet the screening requirements in Section 5 below will be reviewed competitively. Such applications
will be referred to reviewers for a numerical score and explanatory comments based solely on responsiveness to program
guidelines and evaluation criteria published in this Announcement. Applications will be reviewed by persons outside
of the OCS unit which would be directly responsible for programmatic management of the grant. The results of these
reviews will assist the Director and OCS program staff in considering competing applications. Reviewers' scores
will weigh heavily in funding decisions but will not be the only factors considered. Applications will generally
be considered in order of the average scores assigned by reviewers. However, highly ranked applications are not guaranteed
funding since the Director may also consider other factors deemed relevant including, but not limited to, the timely
and proper completion of projects funded with OCS funds granted in the last five (5) years: Comments of reviewers and
government officials; staff evaluation and input; geographic distribution; previous program performance of applicants;
compliance with grant terms under previous DHHS grants; audit reports; investigative reports; and applicant's
progress in resolving any final audit disallowances on OCS or other Federal agency grants. OCS reserves the right
to discuss applications with other Federal or non-Federal funding sources to ascertain the applicant's performance
record. 



5. Criteria for Screening Applications 



a. Initial Screening 



All applications that meet the published deadline for submission will be screened to determine completeness and
conformity to the requirements of this Announcement. Only those applications meeting the following requirements

(2) The SF-424 must be signed by an official of the organization applying for the grant who has authority to obligate
the organization legally. 



b. Pre-rating Review 



Applications which pass the initial screening will be forwarded to reviewers for analytical comment and scoring
based on the criteria detailed in the Section below and the specific requirements contained in Part A of this Announcement.
Prior to the programmatic review, these reviewers and/or OCS staff will verify that the applications comply with
this program announcement in the following areas: 

(1) 

Eligibility: 

Applicant meets the eligibility requirements found in Part B. 

(2) 

Number of Projects: 

The application contains only one project.

Grantees are subject to the audit requirements in 45 CFR Parts 74 and 92. 
Section 319 of Public Law 101-121, signed into law on 
October 23, 1989, imposes [new] prohibitions and requirements for disclosure and certification related to lobbying
when applicant has engaged in lobbying activities or is expected to lobby in trying to obtain the grant. It provides
limited exemptions for Indian tribes and tribal organizations. Current and prospective recipients (and their subtier
contractors and/or grantees) are prohibited from using appropriated funds for lobbying Congress or any Federal
agency in connection with the award of a contract, grant, cooperative agreement or loan. In addition, for each award
action in excess of $100,000 (or $150,000 for loans) the law requires recipients and their subtier contractors and/or
subgrantees (1) to certify that they have neither used nor will use any appropriated funds for payment to lobbyists,
(2) to submit a declaration setting forth whether payments to lobbyists have been or will be made out of non-appropriated
funds and, if so, the name, address, payment details, and purpose of any agreements with such lobbyists whom recipients
or their subtier contractors or subgrantees will pay with the nonappropriated funds and (3) to file quarterly up-dates
about the use of lobbyists if any event occurs that materially affects the accuracy of the information submitted by
way of declaration and certification. The law establishes civil penalties for noncompliance and is effective with
respect to contracts, grants, cooperative agreements and loans entered into or made on or after December 23, 1989.
See Attachment F for certification and disclosure forms to be submitted with the applications for this program. 
Attachment G indicates the regulations which apply to all applicants/grantees under the Discretionary Grants Program.

Instructions for the SF-424A
General Instructions


This form is designed so that application can be made for funds from one or more grant programs. In preparing the budget,
adhere to any existing Federal grantor agency guidelines which prescribe how and whether budgeted amounts should
be separately shown for different functions or activities within the program. For some programs, grantor agencies
may require budgets to be separately shown by function or activity. For other programs, grantor agencies may require
a breakdown by function or activity. Sections A, B, C, and D should include budget estimates for the whole project except
when applying for assistance which requires Federal authorization in annual or other funding period increments.
In the latter case, Sections A, B, C, and D should provide the budget for the first budget period (usually a year) and
Section E should present the need for Federal assistance in the subsequent budget periods. All applications should
contain a breakdown by the object class categories shown in Lines a-k of Section B.

National Wild and Scenic Rivers System: Big and Little Darby Creeks, OH



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Secretary, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of approval.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Secretary of the Interior hereby announces approval of an application by the Governor of Ohio to include segments
of the Big and Little Darby Creeks, Ohio, as State-administered components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers
System.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to the authority granted the Secretary of the Interior by section 2 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (Pub.
L. 90-542, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 1273, et seq.) and upon proper application of the Governor of the State of Ohio,
85.9 miles of the Big and Little Darby Creeks are hereby designated as State-administered components of the National
Wild and Scenic Rivers System. 



On October 1, 1990, the Governor of Ohio petitioned the Secretary of the Interior to add 85.9 miles of the Big and Little
Darby Creeks to the National System. On January 24, 1992, the Governor of Ohio reaffirmed the same request which was
followed by a revised application dated February 3, 1992. This river had been designated a State scenic river on June
22, 1984, pursuant to the Ohio Scenic Rivers Act. In response to the Governor's request, the Secretary conducted a
complete review of the State application and documents associated with the designation decision. As a result of that
review, the Secretary has determined that 85.9 miles of the Big and Little Darby Creeks should be designated as a State-administered
component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, as provided for in section 2(a)(ii) of the Wild and Scenic
Rivers Act.

The State of Ohio has fulfilled the requirements of the act by designating these segments as a ``State Scenic River''
and by adopting a program of action that will adequately protect the creek from adverse State actions. The National
Park Service evaluation of the river concluded that these segments of the Big and Little Darby Creeks meet the criteria
for scenic classification under the act. 

Accordingly, the following river segments are classified as scenic pursuant to section 2(b) of the act to be administered
by State and local government:








Upper Darby Creek: 

Scenic_From the Champaign-Union County line (River Mile (RM) 71.8) downstream to the Conrail railroad trestle (RM
39.7), which is 0.9 mile upstream of US 40 (32.1 miles).



Lower Darby Creek: 

Scenic_From the confluence with Little Darby Creek (RM 34.1) near Georgesville to the Scioto River (34.1 miles).



Little Darby Creek: 

Scenic_From Lafayette-Plain City Road Bridge (RM 20.5) to 0.8 mile upstream from the confluence with Big Darby Creek
(RM 0.8) (19.7 miles).






This action is taken following public involvement and consultation with the Departments of Agriculture, Army, Energy
and Transportation, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as
required by section 4(c) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. A 45-day period for public comment on the State's application
and river management plan and on the environmental assessment of the proposed national designation was provided
from July 14, 1993, to August 30, 1993. All comments received have been carefully considered.

Notice is hereby given that effective upon this date, the above-described river segments are approved for inclusion
in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System to be administered by the State of Ohio.

Proposed Plan Amendments to Management Plans



<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to amend plans.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given of intent to prepare Category I plan amendments to the Diamond Mountain, Browns Park, and Ashley-Duchesne
Management Frameworks Plans (MFPs) and the Book Cliffs Resource Management Plan (RMP). The proposed plan amendments
will be prepared in conformance with the planning requirements and policies of the Federal Land Policy and Management
Act of 1976. The proposed plan amendments and accompanying environmental assessment will provide the basis for designating
additional public lands to those lands previously identified for sale in the land tenure adjustment portions of the
existing MFPs and RMP. The sale of public lands not previously identified in the above-referenced planning documents
will be subject to existing planning criteria and will meet the disposal standards established in section 203(a)
of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (43 U.S.C. 1713; 90 Stat. 2750).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Vernal District's Diamond Mountain and Book Cliffs Resource Areas are situated in northeastern Utah near the
Colorado-Utah border and include portions of Uintah, Daggett, and Duchesne Counties. The issue in completing the
proposed plan amendments is the degree of potential adverse environmental impacts that may occur should the public
land be conveyed into non-Federal ownership. As part of the proposed plan amendment process, an environmental assessment
will be prepared to provide a detailed analysis of the following resource concerns: wildlife and fisheries habitat,
recreation, watershed, paleontological and cultural resources, threatened and endangered plants and animals,
and land uses. Upon completion of the environmental assessment and approval of the proposed plan amendments, additional
public lands may be disposed of through public lands sales. The public, state and local governments, and other Federal
agencies are asked to participate in the proposed plan amendment process.

<DOCTITLE>Fresh Cut Roses From Colombia and Ecuador </DOCTITLE>



Determinations 



On the basis of the record

1

 developed in the subject investigations, the Commission determines, pursuant to section 733(a) of the Tariff Act
of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1673b(a)), that there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially
injured by reason of imports from Colombia and Ecuador of fresh cut roses, provided for in subheading 0603.10.60 of
the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, that are alleged to be sold in the United States at less than fair
value (LTFV). 




Background 



On February 14, 1994, a petition was filed with the Commission and the Department of Commerce by the Floral Trade Council,
Haslett, MI, alleging that an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material injury
by reason of LTFV imports of fresh cut roses from Colombia and Ecuador. Accordingly, effective February 14, 1994,
the Commission instituted antidumping investigations Nos. 731-TA-684 and 685 (Preliminary). 

Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigations and of a public conference to be held in connection therewith
was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington,
DC, and by publishing the notice in the 

Federal Register

 of February 24, 1994 (59 FR 9000). The conference was held in Washington, DC, on March 8, 1994, and all persons who requested
the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel. 

The Commission transmitted its determinations in these investigations to the Secretary of Commerce on March 31,
1994. The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2766 (March 1994), entitled ``Fresh Cut Roses
from Colombia and Ecuador: Investigations Nos. 731-TA-684 and 685 (Preliminary).'' 




Issued: April 1, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Certain Steel Wire Rod From Brazil and Japan</DOCTITLE>


Determinations


On the basis of the record
 developed in the subject investigations, the Commission determines,
 pursuant to section 735(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C.  1673d(b)) (the Act), that an industry in the United
States is not materially injured or threatened with material injury, and the establishment of an industry in the United
States is not materially retarded, by reason of imports from Brazil and Japan of certain steel wire rod,
 provided for in subheadings 7213.31.30, 7213.31.60, 7213.39.00, 7213.41.30, 7213.41.60, 7213.49.00, 7213.50.00,
7227.20.00, and 7227.90.60 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, that have been found by the Department
of Commerce to be sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV).






Background


The Commission instituted these investigations effective November 26, 1993, following preliminary determinations
by the Department of Commerce that imports of certain steel wire rod from Brazil and Japan were being sold at LTFV within
the meaning of section 733(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b(b)). Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigations
and of a public hearing to be held in connection therewith was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the
Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC, and by publishing the notice in the 

Federal Register

 of December 16, 1993 (58 FR 65732). The hearing was held in Washington, DC, on February 15, 1994, and all persons who
requested the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel.
The Commission transmitted its determinations in these investigations to the Secretary of Commerce on March 25,
1994. The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2761 (March 1994), entitled ``Certain Steel
Wire Rod from Brazil and Japan: Investigations Nos. 731-TA-646 and 648 (Final).''



Issued: March 28, 1994.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company and Northeast Nuclear Energy Company; Haddam Neck Plant and Millstone Nuclear
Power Station, Unit Nos. 1, 2 and 3


Exemption 


I.


The Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company (CYAPCO or the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License
No. DPR-61 which authorizes operation of the Haddam Neck Plant, and Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (NNECO
or the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-21. DPR-65 and NPF-49 which
authorize operation of the Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit Nos. 1, 2, and 3 (Millstone) respectively. The license
provide, among other things, that the Haddam Neck Plant and Millstone plants are subject to all rules, regulations
and Orders of the Commission now or hereafter in effect.
The Haddam Neck Plant is a single-unit pressurized water reactor located at the licensee's site located in Middlesex
County, Connecticut. The Millstone plants consist of a boiling water reactor and two pressurized water reactors
located at the licensee's site in New London County, Connecticut.


II.


Section 26.21(b) of title 10, of the Code of Federal Regulations requires that Fitness-For-Duty (FFD) refresher
training be completed on a nominal 12-month frequency or more frequently where the need is indicated.
By letter dated February 10, 1994, the licensees requested a one-time exemption from their requirements of 10 CFR
26.21(b). The exemption is needed because the licensees perform FFD refresher training as part of a consolidation
of various annual training requirements. While the consolidation of annual training requirements results in substantial
gains in efficiency, it also results in the potential for individuals who would have been scheduled to receive FFD
refresher training during January 1994, to go until October 1994, before receiving this training. In addition, there
will be individuals whose scheduled training interval is extended for shorter durations. However, the 9-month delay
is the most bounding, so an overall extension from 12 to 21 months has been requested by the licensees.
The licensees state in there February 10, 1994, application that they are confident that affected personnel understand
the FFD program and requirements, and that no adverse impact will result from this requested change. Between the four
units, approximately 15 percent of the on-shift personnel will fall outside of the nominal 12-month window. All of
the individuals have received FFD training in the past, and will read and sign a synopsis of the FFD requirements prior
to exceeding the nominal 12-month window. In addition, within each shift, the supervisory personnel will be trained
within the nominal 12-month frequency pursuant to 10 CFR 26.22.


III.


The Commission has reviewed the licensees' rationale for a one-time exemption from 10 CFR 26.21(b) in order not to
separate FFD refresher training from other annual training requirements.
Based on its review, the Commission finds the licensees have shown good cause for the requested exemption from 10 CFR
26.21(b). Therefore, the exemption to extend the time requirement to 21 months for completing FFD refresher training
is acceptable.


IV.


Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 26.6, the exemption is authorized by law and will
not endanger life or property or the common defense and security and is otherwise in the public interest and hereby
grants an exemption from the time requirements of 10 CFR 26.21(b).

Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the issuance of this exemption will have no significant
impact on the quality of human environment (59 FR 13750).

This exemption is effective upon issuance.




Dated at Rockville, Maryland, the 30th day of March 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Energy Fuels Nuclear, Inc.; Receipt of Application from Energy Fuels Nuclear, Inc, for a Source Material License
</DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has received, by letter dated
November 18, 1993 from Energy Fuels Nuclear, Inc., an application for a source material license to commercially produce
uranium oxide by in-situ leaching (ISL) of uranium ores, at its Reno Creek, Wyoming ISL facility. 

The facility will be located approximately 12 miles southwest of the town of Wright, in Campbell County, Wyoming.
The operation is anticipated to extract about 181,440 kilograms (400,000 pounds)  of  uranium  oxide

(U

3 

O

8

) per year, with a maximum quantity of 7000 kilograms (15,400 pounds) of source material on site at any one time. 

The applicant plans to use a series of injection wells, which will introduce hydrogen peroxide and sodium carbonate/bicarbonate
(lixiviant) into the ore zone; and extract the mobilized uranium through a series of pumping wells. The uranium-rich
water will be routed to an on-site processing building (satellite plant) where the uranium will be concentrated in
ion-exchange resin tanks. The uranium-depleted fluids will be recharged with lixiviant and recirculated into the
ore zone through the injection wells to mobilize more uranium. The loaded ion-exchange resin will be hydraulically
transferred to tank trucks and periodically shipped to another NRC-licensed facility for elution and further processing.
The designed production rate for total circulation of leaching solutions will be about 7570 liters per minute (2000
gallons per minute). 

Following the extraction of the uranium from the ore zone, the ground water affected by the mining operation will be
restored to a quality of use equal to or better than the water uses prior to extraction operations. The ground-water
restoration techniques will include pumping the well field without lixiviant injection (ground-water sweep),
followed by circulating and injecting water treated by reverse osmosis to achieve final restoration. Ground-water
quality will be monitored in perimeter monitoring wells during extraction operations and ground-water restoration
activities.

<DOCTITLE>Texas Utilities Electric Co.; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements
of 10 CFR 50.71(e)(3)(i) to Texas Utilities Electric Company (the licensee) for the Comanche Peak Steam Electric
Station, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, located in Somervell County, Texas.


Environmental Assessment


Identification of Proposed Action


Section 50.71(e)(3)(i) of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations requires the licensees of nuclear power reactors
to submit an Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). The UFSAR is defined as ``a revision of the original FSAR
[Final Safety Analysis Report] containing those original pages that are still applicable plus new replacement pages.''
By letter dated October 14, 1993, the licensee requested an exemption from 10 CFR 50.71(e) that would eliminate the
requirement to resubmit those original pages of the FSAR that are still applicable when submitting the UFSAR.
The licensee has maintained the FSAR current since the original FSAR submittal in 1978 to the present by issuing amendments
to the FSAR, which contain new replacement pages, approximately every three months. The licensee has committed to
maintain the FSAR using this process until the issuance of the UFSAR. The final amendment to the FSAR, containing only
replacement pages, would convert the FSAR to the UFSAR. The amendment to convert the FSAR to the UFSAR would be submitted
by February 2, 1995.


The Need for the Proposed Action


Section 50.71(e) requires that licensee submit, within two years of receiving an operating license, a UFSAR that
contains the original FSAR pages that are still applicable and new replacement pages. The purpose of this requirement
is to assure that the Final Safety Analysis Report is updated to contain the latest material developed.
The Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station FSAR is approximately 7,500 to 8,000 pages of text and tables, and 1,500 to
2,000 sheets of figures. As the licensee has maintained the FSAR current by frequent amendments, the vast majority
of this material does not require revision and the number of new replacement pages associated with the UFSAR submittal
would be relatively small. Thus, the CPSES FSAR meets the intent of 10 CFR 50.71(e) for issuance of the UFSAR because
it contains the latest material developed.
Therefore, an exemption is warranted since the licensee has maintained the FSAR in a manner that is consistent with
the underlying purpose of issuing the UFSAR in accordance with 10 CFR 50.71(e).


Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action


The proposed exemption affects only the size of the UFSAR submittal and does not affect the risk of facility accidents.
Thus, post-accident radiological releases will not differ from those determined previously, and the proposed exemption
does not otherwise affect facility radiological effluents, or any significant occupational exposures. With regard
to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed exemption does not affect plant nonradiological effluents
and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no measurable radiological
or nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption.


Alternatives to the Proposed Action


Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed exemption,
any alternatives either will have no environmental impact or will have a greater environmental impact. The principal
alternative to the exemption would be to require that the licensee submit the original FSAR pages that are still applicable
with the UFSAR replacement pages. Such an action would not enhance the protection of the environment.


Alternative Use of Resources


This action does not involve the use of resources not considered previously in the Final Environmental Statement
for Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station, Units 1 and 2, dated September 1981, and Supplement dated October 1989.


Agencies and Persons Contacted


The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request. The staff consulted with the State of Texas regarding the environmental
impact of the proposed action.


Finding of No Significant Impact


The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. On the
basis of the environmental assessment, we conclude that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on
the quality of the human environment.
For further details with respect to the proposed action, see the licensee's letter dated October 14, 1993, which is
available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555 and at the University of Texas at Arlington Library, Government Publications/Maps, 701 South
Cooper, P.O. Box 19297, Arlington, Texas 76019.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating
to Priority of Agency Orders to Cross Blocks of 25,000 Shares or More
 


March 30, 1994. 
 
 


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on November 23, 1992, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On March 30, 1994, the Exchange submitted to
the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change in order to increase the minimum size of agency crosses that
would be entitled to priority under this proposal from 10,000 to 25,000 shares.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

 




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 
 


The Amex proposes to add Commentary .02 to Rule 126(g) to provide for priority of agency orders to cross 25,000 shares
or more; and to amend existing Commentary .01 to Rule 126(g) (size precedence for orders to cross 25,000 shares or more)
to limit it to circumstances where one or both sides of a cross is for the account of a member or member organization.
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex, and at the Commission. 
 


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

 


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. 
 


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

 


1. Purpose 
 


The Exchange proposes to add new Commentary .02 to Rule 126(g), to allow a member who has an order to buy and an order to
sell 25,000 shares or more of the same security, where neither order is for the account of a member or a member organization,
to cross those orders at a price that is at or within the prevailing quotation without the transaction being broken
up at the cross price. Thus, the member's bid or offer would be entitled to priority at such cross price, irrespective
of pre-existing bids or offers at that price. The proposal, therefore, is intended to facilitate execution of agency
cross transactions on the Exchange. In addition, confining the proposed size priority threshold to block size orders
of 25,000 shares or more would limit the effects of the rule primarily to actively traded, liquid securities. 
 
The member would be required to follow the crossing procedures of Rule 151 and make a public bid and offer on behalf of
both sides of the cross. However, unlike existing block cross procedures under Rule 126(g), Commentary .01,
 such an order would not be required to be on parity with other orders on the Floor; that is, it would not be required that
the priority of earlier bids and offers first be removed, by means of a sale, before effecting the cross. 
 




The proposal furthers the important auction market principle of price improvement by allowing another member to
trade with either the bid or offer side of the cross transaction to provide a price that is better than the proposed cross
price; however, the other member could not trade with the cross bid or offer at a price which is the same as the cross price.
The member who is providing a better price to one side of the cross transaction would be required to trade with all other
market interest having priority at that price before trading with any part of the cross transaction. A transaction
effected at the cross price in reliance on Commentary .02 would be printed as ``stopped stock.'' 
 
To avoid conflict with the proposed agency cross rule, Commentary .01 of Rule 126(g) would be amended so as to afford
size precedence to orders to cross 25,000 shares or more only when members or member organizations are involved as
principal on one or both sides of the cross. As is currently the case, such orders to cross would be entitled to precedence
only when they are on parity with other orders on the Floor.
 
 




2. Statutory Basis 
 


The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objective(s) of Section
6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote
just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating,
clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, and,
in general, to protect investors and the public interest. 
 


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition 
 


The proposed rule change will impose no burden on competition. 



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others 
 


No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change. 
 


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action
 


Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:
 
(A) by order approve the proposed rule change, or 
 
(B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. 
 


IV. Solicitation of Comments 
 


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Amex-92-41
and should be submitted by April 27, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. Relating to Arbitration Surcharge on Members</DOCTITLE>



March 31, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on March 22, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), and amended on March 31, 1994
 the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The NASD
has designated this proposal as one establishing or changing a fee under section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act, which
renders the rule effective upon the Commission's receipt of this filing. The Commission is publishing this notice
to solicit comments on the proposed rule change, as amended, from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The NASD is proposing to amend section 45 of the Code of Arbitration Procedure to clarify that the member surcharge
of $200 is not subject to reimbursement under Subsections 43(c) and 44(c) of the Code. Below is the text of the proposed
rule change. Proposed new language is italicized.



PART III. UNIFORM CODE OF ARBITRATION



* * * * *



Member Surcharge



Sec. 45.



(a) Each member who is named as a party to an arbitration proceeding, whether in a Claim, Counterclaim, Crossclaim
or Third-Party claim, shall be assessed a $200 non-refundable surcharge when the Arbitration Department perfects
service of the claim naming the member on any party to the proceeding. For each associated person who is named, the surcharge
shall be assessed against the member or members which employed the associated person at the time of the events which
gave rise to the dispute, claim or controversy. No member shall be assessed more than a single surcharge in any arbitration
proceeding. The surcharge shall not be subject to reimbursement under Subsections 43(c) or 44(c) of the Code.

(b) For the purposes of this Section, service is perfected when the Director of Arbitration properly serves the Respondents
to such proceeding under Subsection 25(a) of the Code.



* * * * *



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



On February 25, 1994, the NASD filed SR-NASD-94-11 adopting section 45 to the Code of Arbitration
Procedure (``Code'') to impose a $200 non-refundable surcharge on any member named as a party to an arbitration proceeding.
The last line of section 45(a) stated that the surcharge would not be subject to reimbursement under Subsection 43(c)
of the Code, which references customer disputes.






Subsequently, the NASD determined that it had inadvertently omitted reference in the last sentence of new section
45(a) to Subsection 44(c), which provision relates to industry and clearing controversies. The NASD is, therefore,
proposing to amend Subsection 45(a) to the Code of Arbitration Procedure to clarify that the member surcharge is not
subject to reimbursement under Subsections 43(c) and 44(c) of the Code. Thus, the provision of Subsection 45(a) that
the member surcharge is not subject to reimbursement shall apply in cases involving customer disputes as well as industry
and clearing controversies.

The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of section 15A(b)(5) of the Act,
 which require that the rules of the Association provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and
other charges among members in that the proposed rule clarifies that the member surcharge will be assessed equitably
on each member who is named and for whom service is perfected in an arbitration proceeding.





(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others



Written comments were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The foregoing rule change has become effective upon filing pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act and subparagraph
(e) of rule 19b-4 thereunder in that it constitutes a due, fee or other charge.

At any time within 60 days of the filing of a rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act, the Commission may
summarily abrogate the rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in
the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the NASD. All submissions should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by April 27,
1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing of Proposed Rule Change by New York Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to Additions
to the ``List of Exchange Rule Violations and Fines Applicable Thereto Pursuant to Rule 476A''</DOCTITLE>


March 30, 1994.


Pursuant to sections 19 (b)(1) and (d)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s (b)(1) and
(d)(1), notice is hereby given that on March 2, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described
in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On March 21, 1994,
the NYSE submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change in order to clarify certain aspects
of the original filing.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


This proposal would revise the Rule 476A Violations List for imposition of fines for minor violations of rules and/or
policies by adding to the list Exchange policy regarding a two-week probationary period for execution of orders by
new members on the Exchange trading floor.
 As part of the proposed rule change, the NYSE is also seeking approval of the policy itself.






II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose


Rule 476A
 provides that the Exchange may impose a fine, not to exceed $5,000, on any member, member organization, allied member,
approved person, or registered or non-registered employee of a member or member organization for a minor violation
of certain specified Exchange rules.




The purpose of the Rule 476A procedure is to provide for a response to a rule violation when a meaningful sanction is
appropriate, but when initiation of a disciplinary proceeding under Rule 476 is not suitable because such a proceeding
would be more costly and time-consuming than would be warranted given the minor nature of the violation. Rule 476A
provides for an appropriate response to minor violations of certain Exchange rules or policies, while preserving
the due process rights of the party accused through specified, required procedures. Violations of these rules and
policies that are deemed by the Exchange not to be minor in nature are also subject to formal disciplinary proceedings
under Exchange Rule 476. The list of rules and policies which are eligible for the Rule 476A procedures specifies those
rule violations which may be the subject of fines under the rule and also includes a schedule of fines.

In File No. SR-NYSE-84-27, which initially set forth the provisions and procedures of Rule 476A,
 the Exchange indicated it would amend the list of rules from time to time, as it considered appropriate, in order to
phase in the implementation of Rule 476A as experience with it was gained.





The Exchange is seeking approval to add to the list of rules subject to possible imposition of fines under Rule 476A
its policy with respect to a requirement for new members of the Exchange to have their order executions observed by
another member for a period of two weeks.

As part of their training regimen, new Exchange members are required to participate in a New Member Orientation Program
(``Program''). The Program, consisting of six one-hour sessions over a two-week period, is designed to familiarize
the new members with regulations, systems and trading practices. Subsequent to the Program and passing the member
examination (Series 15), a new member is required to wear a temporary badge (called on the Exchange today an ``orange
badge'') for a minimum of two weeks, during which time the new member may execute orders only under the direct supervision
of another experienced member.






The purpose for the proposed rule change is to facilitate the Exchange's ability to ensure compliance with all aspects
of the above-named policy. New members would be informed that, if they are found to have executed an order during the
initial two-week period not under an experienced member's supervision, the requirement to wear the temporary badge
and have their executions observed by an experienced member would be extended for an additional week. A second violation
of the policy would result in a possible fine under the provisions of Rule 476A.






The Exchange believes failure to comply with the requirements of this policy should be addressed with an appropriate
sanction and seeks Commission approval to add violations of these requirements to the Rule 476A List.



2. Statutory Basis



The proposed rule change will advance the objectives of Section 6(b)(6) of the Act in that it will provide a procedure
whereby members and member organizations can be ``appropriately disciplined'' in those instances when a rule violation
is minor in nature, but a sanction more serious than a warning or cautionary letter is appropriate. The proposed rule
change provides a fair procedure for imposing such sanctions, in accordance with the requirements of Section 6(b)
(7) and 6(d) (1) of the Act.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others



The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or 

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-NYSE-94-05
and should be submitted by April 27, 1994.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Granting Accelerated Approval and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated
Approval of Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to a Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc., Amending the
Net Capital Requirements in Phlx Rule 703</DOCTITLE>




March 30, 1994.




On January 28, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to amend Rule 703 (Financial Responsibility and Reporting) to correspond to recent Commission
amendments to SEC Rule 15c3-1 (``SEC Net Capital Rule'').
 Notice of the proposed rule change appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on March 4, 1994.
 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. The Exchange subsequently filed Amendment Nos. 1 and
2 to the proposed rule change.
 This order approves the Exchange's proposal, as amended.










Pursuant to the amendments to the SEC Net Capital Rule, all specialists, except options market makers,
 who are currently exempt from the net capital requirements of Rule 703, will be subject to a minimum net capital requirement
of $100,000.
 As a result, the Exchange believes that these amendments require the deletion of Phlx Rule 703(a) (iii), (iv), and
(v). Currently, Rule 703(a) (iii), (iv), and (v) impose a minimum net liquid asset
 requirement of $50,000 for equity specialists, $75,000 for options specialists, and $100,000 for firms which are
both equity and options specialists.








The Exchange also proposes to amend Rule 703 to require each member organization and participant organization, including
each ROT, to notify the Exchange if it fails to maintain the minimum net capital required by the SEC Net Capital Rule
or it fails to maintain liquid assets in accordance with Phlx Rule 703. Specifically, the Exchange is proposing to
add a new paragraph (v) to Phlx Rule 703(a) which would require a member organization or foreign currency option participant
organization to promptly notify the Exchange if it ceases to be in compliance with the SEC Net Capital Rule or Phlx Rule
703(a) (iii) or (iv) (

i.e.

, former sections (a)(vi) or (a)(vii)).

Lastly, the Phlx proposes to amend paragraph (c)(vi) of Rule 703 to add the requirement that a floor broker's clearing
agent guarantee orders entrusted on the floor with that floor broker, in addition to transactions and balances carried
in the account.


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5),
 in that the proposal is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices, and to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, the amendments to the SEC Net
Capital Rule make all specialists, except options market makers, that previously were exempt from the SEC Net Capital
Rule under subparagraph (b)(1), subject to the rule. The amendments to the SEC Net Capital Rule, therefore, will have
the following effects on Phlx specialists: instead of the current minimum net liquid assets requirements under Phlx
Rule 703(a) of $50,000 for equity specialists, $75,000 for options specialists, and $100,000 for firms that act as
both equity and options specialists, the SEC's minimum net capital requirement of $100,000 for dealer's would apply.
 The Commission finds that the proposal will conform Rule 703 to the SEC Net Capital Rule, as amended, and is therefore
consistent with the Act.








The Commission believes that the notification portion of the proposed rule change may prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices and protect investors and the public interest by providing the Exchange with the ability to respond
promptly to such notification, especially respecting options market makers. Currently, Commission Rule 17a-11
requires, among other things, prompt telegraphic notice to a broker-dealer's designated examining authority,
as well as the SEC, when a broker-dealer falls below its minimum net capital requirement pursuant to the SEC Net Capital
Rule. This rule does not apply to options market makers, because they are exempt from the SEC Net Capital Rule. The Exchange's
proposed notification provision would apply to all member organizations and participant organizations, including
options market makers. As a result, the Commission finds that the proposed notification provision is consistent
with the Act, in general, and with SEC Rule 17a-11, in particular.


Finally, the Commission finds that the proposed requirement that a floor broker's clearing agent guarantee orders
entrusted on the floor with that floor broker may serve to protect investors and the public interest by promoting liquidity
and confidence in the credibility of floor broker orders, consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act.

The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed rule
change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

 in order to ensure that the amendments to Rule 703 are in place prior to the April 1, 1994, effective date of the Commission's
amendments to the SEC Net Capital Rule. The Commission believes that by granting accelerated approval, the potential
for any confusion between the current net capital standards provided in Rule 703 and those that will apply on April
1, 1994, pursuant to the SEC Net Capital Rule, will be adequately minimized. Finally, the original proposal was published
for the full 21-day comment period and no comments were received, and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 are simply clarifications
of the original proposal. As a result, the Commission finds good cause for accelerating approval of the proposed rule
change and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed rule change.


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment Nos. 1 and 2. Persons
making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission,
450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection
and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions should
refer to the File No. SR-Phlx-94-04 and should be submitted by April 27, 1994.



It is therefore ordered,

 pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-Phlx-94-04), as amended, is hereby approved on an accelerated
basis.







For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

NOFA for Intermediaries to Administer 
Preservation Technical Assistance Grants 

 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner, HUD.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of funding availability. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department requests applications from intermediaries seeking to administer grant funds as described in the
body of this NOFA. An intermediary that applies to cover an area smaller than one State must seek to administer grants
in a jurisdiction covering at least one HUD area office. Intermediaries will receive funding, to be used as processing
fees, from a portion of the $45 million funding that is available for technical assistance grants to promote the ability
of residents of eligible low-income housing to participate meaningfully in the preservation process established
by the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 (ELIHPA) and the Low-Income Housing Preservation and
Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 (LIHPRHA). The NOFA describes the technical assistance grants that will be made
available through intermediaries and the selection criteria that will be used for those grants; however, this is
not a request for applications for those direct technical assistance grants. 




Of the available funds, $13.5 million will be available for Resident Capacity Grants and $31.5 million will be available
for Predevelopment grants. Both of these grant categories are described in Appendix A of this NOFA. Dollar amounts
have been made available by State, utilizing the Department's estimates of preservation activity. Any additional
amounts made available from the termination of the September 3, 1992, NOFA, or by appropriation in future years, if
any, will be divided proportionately between the grant categories. 


In the body of this document is information concerning eligible intermediary applicants; the funding available
by State; HUD's processing of the intermediary applications; grant applicants eligible for technical assistance;
and the selection criteria for both the intermediary applicants and technical assistance grant applicants. Technical
assistance applicants should be aware that the determination of which regulatory requirements apply to an applicant's
purchase depends on the preservation program under which the owner has filed a Notice of Intent. Thus, applicants
must comply with 24 CFR part 248 and with either ELIHPA or LIHPRHA, as appropriate. (Applicants should note that part
248, as codified in the April 1, 1993, revision of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) was amended subsequently in
a rule published on July 13, 1993 (57 FR 3384), which reflects requirements of the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992.)



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 



The information collection requirements contained in this notice have been reviewed by the Office of Management
and Budget under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520). The OMB control
number is 2502-0502.

Background 


On July 13, 1993, the Department took the unusual step of publishing a draft Notice of Fund Availability (58 FR 37819),
specifically inviting public comments on the Department's proposed methodology for implementing the provisions
of section 312 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-550, approved October 28, 1992)
(1992 HCDA), which added sections 251-257 to the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership
Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-625, section 601 of the National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA), approved November 28,
1990) (LIHPRHA). The comment period expired on August 28, 1993. The Department received a total of 26 comments. Two
comments were from legal/advocacy organizations; eight were from low-income housing organizations that are involved
in development of and advocacy for affordable housing; nine were from tenant organizations; three were from community
development corporations; two were from community service organizations; one was from a local government agency;
and one was from an individual housing consultant. 
This NOFA implements sections 251, 252, 253, 255, 256, and 257 of LIHPRHA, as added by section 312 of the 1992 HCDA. This
NOFA does not implement section 254 of LIHPRHA, which will be implemented soon through a separate NOFA. Therefore,
the comments received on section 254 as a result of the draft NOFA published July 13, 1993, will not be addressed here,
but will be considered in that separate NOFA. 
The first section of this NOFA is a discussion of the public comments and modifications from the draft NOFA that were
made in response to the public comments and as a result of additional HUD consideration. The actual NOFA follows the
discussion of public comments and begins with the section designated ``II. Purpose and Substantive Description.''



I. Public Comments 


A. Direct Technical Assistance Grants 


1. Resident Notification 


The proposed NOFA required each applicant for a technical assistance grant to notify the residents of the property
of the application. Seventeen commenters requested that this requirement be clarified or strengthened. Six commenters
requested that the notification be in writing, and be required to include a summary of the proposed plan for the property
including items on the development team, budget, and proposed tasks. The Department has adopted this recommendation.

A number of commenters requested that the notification advise that residents themselves can also apply for grant
funds and can endorse an eligible organization of their choice. Several others said this information should be given,
not by the applicant, but by the Department, possibly as part of current resident notification forms under 24 CFR part
248. The Department has decided to require, as part of the applicant's resident notification, a statement that residents
may themselves become eligible grantees. One commenter said the notice must have a name and contact number for the
intermediary and the applicant. The Department has implemented this requirement. The same commenter suggested
that intermediaries be required to supply a copy of the application with translations. The Department has decided
that this requirement would be too burdensome on the intermediary and too costly to the Department. In general, however,
translation expenses would be considered a reimbursable expense under the grant. 
Three commenters expressed concern that owners may thwart access to buildings to prevent distribution of notices
and/or resident meetings. Therefore, HUD should require managers to provide addresses of tenants to intermediaries,
and any costs to owners would be reimbursable. The Department agrees that this could be a problem in certain cases.
If the applicant is having difficulties getting access to the building, it may contact the administering intermediary,
who will have the authority to contact the owner for access to the property and the names and addresses of residents.

Twelve commenters requested, as part of resident notification, an advance notification of application submission
for technical assistance, followed by a tenant comment period. Many of these commenters also requested the inclusion
of a requirement that the applicants meet with the residents prior to application submission. The comments ranged
from requiring a 15-day notice prior to application submission, to a 30-day comment period following a resident meeting,
with a seven-day notification that the meeting itself will take place. One commenter said at least two resident meetings
should be required, one informational and one for tenant comment. One commenter suggested that the tenant comment
period could partially overlap with the administering intermediary's review of the application so there would be
less delay in grant awards. Another said that the general requirement to notify all residents could be too burdensome
in large projects, and when owners are not cooperative, the applicant could simply certify that a public meeting was
held. 
The Department seeks to maximize resident participation, where appropriate, without unduly delaying the grant
award process. Therefore, the Department will require written notification that a resident meeting will take place.
This notification shall include summary information on the grant proposal and an indication that the residents will
be able to comment on the grant proposal subsequent to the resident meeting. The meeting shall occur at least 14 days
prior to application submission and resident comments may be submitted to the intermediary and the applicant during
that 14-day period. If there are substantive objections by the residents, the applicant must provide a response to
the residents and to the intermediary before the grant can be awarded. If necessary, the applicant will meet again
with the residents to resolve issues. In any case, if a majority of residents are opposed to the application, the application
will be rejected.

2. Applicant Eligibility 


Seven commenters were concerned with the requirement that, if the owner has not submitted a Notice of Intent to sell,
the applicant must have a binding commitment from the owner to sell to the applicant. Several suggested that a letter
of intent to sell should be adequate, others that a letter to work exclusively with the applicant should be sufficient.
The wording ``binding agreement to sell'' is statutory; however, the Department agrees that it would be impractical
to require a purchase and sale agreement before the applicant has become an eligible purchaser under the preservation
program and/or has become a sponsor with the capacity to purchase, own, and manage the property. Therefore, the Department
interprets the binding agreement to sell as an exclusive agreement to work with the applicant entity towards a sale
unless it subsequently becomes clear that the applicant is not moving towards that goal in a reasonable and timely
manner. If the owner seeks to work with another entity without the consent of the applicant, consultation with the
intermediary on what constitutes a timely manner would be required. 
Four commenters requested that HUD clarify what ``seeking to purchase with a majority of resident support'' means.
One suggested it should be clear that the intention of the applicant is to become an eligible purchaser in the first
six months of the sale period. Several thought applicants should be required to detail the method for securing support
and adhere to that method. One thought that to require a majority-supported preferred priority purchase in order
to receive later grant funds is not inconsistent with the statute. The application kit will require that each applicant
detail its method for securing resident support, and this will be reviewed by the intermediary in deciding whether
the plan to achieve a resident-supported purchase is reasonable and achievable. In general, applicants must adhere
to their grant plans to receive further funding. 
Seven commenters said documented resident opposition to a grantee should be sufficient to reject or terminate a grant;
four of these commenters also requested that resident withdrawal of support for a grantee stop all funding. Two commented
that HUD should be required to address the reasons for withdrawal of funding. One commented that residents should
be able to appeal the selection of a Community-Based Nonprofit Organization (CBO) applicant, and that termination
should be allowed for nonperformance. 
The Department reiterates that termination of a grant for nonperformance has always been the Department's practice.
The Department has included in the NOFA the provision that a majority of resident opposition to the applicant prior
to approval of an application would be sufficient for the intermediary to reject the application. In addition, a majority
of resident support for another eligible entity at any time would be sufficient for termination of the grant. 
One commenter stated that Resident Capacity grants should only be given to groups that will not seek to purchase and
recipients should be disqualified as a priority purchaser. Another, however, said that potential purchasers should
not be categorically prohibited from receiving Resident Capacity grant funds. One commenter said the NOFA should
maintain the Resident Capacity-applicant concept that RCs, Resident Groups and Community-Based Nonprofit Housing
Developers (CBDs) are equally eligible. 
The Department believes that the statute is clear on eligibility in this case. Nonprofit community-based housing
developers may receive Resident Capacity grants in order to educate and organize the residents and resident organizations.
However, in the case of competing applications for Resident Capacity grants, the intermediaries will give preference
to resident groups and resident organizations. 
A commenter said that grantees should be required to demonstrate fiscal standards or to use grant funds to establish
them. The Department has included this requirement in previous grant programs and will continue to include the requirement.

Four commenters suggested that the threshold for resident membership in resident groups should be raised to 10% of
the units. One suggested that all recipients should have this support. Another suggested that a committee structure
that involves residents by building or floor should be required. Another commenter, however, felt that the proposed
NOFA set a realistically low threshold for demonstrating resident support at an early stage and that, instead, the
requirement should be for ongoing progress toward gaining greater resident support. The Department has not increased
the minimum unit threshold, but will, through its guidance to intermediaries, require direct assistance grantees
to show continued effort towards gaining resident support. 
One commenter stated that resident groups that are not yet Resident Councils should not be able to apply for Resident
Capacity grants. Again, the statute is clear on this point_resident groups are eligible for these grants. Two commenters
felt that Resident Capacity grant applicants should be required to identify persons carrying out activities and
their qualifications. The Department has clarified this in the NOFA. 
One commenter suggested that joint venture applications should be permitted from any eligible applicants. The Department
has clarified this in the NOFA. 
Five commenters wanted clarification that a Notice of Election to Proceed under the provision of section 604 of LIHPRHA
(Form 9610) should count as a Notice of Intent for purposes of eligibility. The Department has made this clarification.
Two others suggested that the Form 9610 should make a property eligible regardless of whether or not the owner is currently
proceeding under the program. 
The Department will not allow applications in properties when the owner is not proceeding under the program at this
time. A Form 9610 will count as a Notice of Intent under this NOFA only if the owner has checked box B on that form and is
proceeding under the program. Not many owners have submitted a Form 9610 electing to proceed through the LIHPRHA appraisal
process, but have not subsequently submitted a Notice to the Department indicating their intent to proceed. 
Three commenters suggested expanding the definition of eligible applicants. One suggested including Community
Action Agencies, which have been servicing the low-income community in all areas for more than 25 years, and Community-Based
Nonprofit Organizations. One felt Statewide organizations should be eligible for Resident Capacity grants. The
third suggested that where there is no existing CBD (in rural or underserved areas), a new CBO should be able to align
itself with an existing nonprofit that has two years of experience. Again, the Department believes the statute is
clear: these are not eligible applicants. 
One commenter sought clarification that if the owner is not selling, residents can receive a Resident Capacity grant.
Two commenters sought further clarification that resident capacity grants are separate from Predevelopment grants
and can be awarded concurrently and to separate organizations. The Department has made both of these clarifications.

One commenter felt the word ``community'' was vaguely defined in the NOFA, and that even if an organization has not
been active throughout its entire region for some time, the organization should not be precluded from applying for
a grant. The Department has repeated the statutory requirement in this case, and believes it is clear.

One commenter requested that HOPE 2 grantees not be required to wait for notification of termination of HOPE 2 grant
before applying for a technical assistance (resident capacity or predevelopment) grant because there might be HUD
delays. Because an owner cannot file a Notice of Intent (NOI) until HOPE 2 is terminated, the criterion for previous
HOPE selectees should be an owner's filing of a NOI. The Department has adopted this suggestion. 

One commenter requested that existing owner/sellers (including nonprofits) should not be able to apply for Resident
Capacity grants. In general, this is the Department's requirement, with the exception of nonprofit general partners
seeking to buy out their limited partners. Substantive objections from residents in the case of an application from
a nonprofit general partner, however, will be considered by intermediaries. 

One commenter was concerned that grantees under the 1992 NOFA may not be eligible to apply for additional funds under
this NOFA because they are not Community-Based Nonprofit Housing Developers. The Department considers the statute
clear and finds no reason to change the statutory requirement or the NOFA. Community-Based Nonprofit Organizations
funded under the previous NOFA are not necessarily eligible under this NOFA. 



3. Eligible Activities 



Seven commenters sought clarification on eligible activities for Resident Capacity grants. Suggestions for additional
eligible activities included: providing training on rights and opportunities under LIHPRHA; training on resident
issues if an owner is not selling; hiring architect or other consultants to advise residents during the Preservation
Capital Needs Assessment (PCNA)/appraisal process; hiring a tenant coordinator or a project manager; expense to
cover phone and copying; and legal services to interpret preservation documentation. The Department has made these
clarifications. 

Seven commenters sought clarification on eligible activities for Predevelopment grants. Suggestions for additional
eligible activities included: obtaining a financial feasibility analysis; preparing a Plan of Action or Resident
Homeownership Plan; preparing a Transfer of Physical Assets package; tenant and board training on ``development''
and the preservation process; legal expenses; and hiring a project manager. The Department has made these clarifications.


Six commenters felt tenant-related expenses, such as child care, bus fare to meetings, and beverages at meetings,
should be allowable. The Department has made this clarification. However these expenses are only allowable to the
extent that they support residents in their ability to participate in resident meetings and in planning for the grant.


Two commenters suggested that newly formed resident groups should be required to ensure a democratic process developed
in conjunction with the National Alliance of HUD Tenants, that residents should have oversight authority over recipients,
and that tenant input should be a criterion in receiving additional funds. The Department decided that a requirement
to work with a specific national organization would be too burdensome on the grantees. The Department is clarifying
that residents should be notified of the progress of the grant, but requiring resident oversight will be too burdensome
on the grantee and the intermediaries. 

One commenter requested that HUD consider the administrative structure necessary for providing the grants, given
that the nonprofit grantees may not end up being purchasers/sponsors. The Department considered this issue and believes
the statutory intent is clear. The creation of an eligible Community-Based Nonprofit Organization (CBO) purchaser
is a requirement of a Community-Based Nonprofit Housing Developer (CBD) seeking a grant to purchase a property under
LIHPRHA. The Department will work with intermediaries to ensure that grant fund release is not delayed due to the creation
of a new entity. Funds for activities subsequent to a purchase offer may be released to the new entity. However, that
new entity is expected to continue working with the Community-Based Nonprofit Housing Developer through the term
of the grant. 

A commenter suggested that the requirement that grantees be in conformance with appropriate program regulations
and guidelines is too burdensome on grantees and, rather, should be a requirement of HUD or intermediaries as part
of monitoring. The Department believes this requirement is not too burdensome. A grantee may use the grant to fund
administrative activities in order to conform with the grant and the preservation programs. 

Three commenters felt HUD should spell out a clear priority to maximize grant funds to tenant-controlled coalitions.
Two others requested a requirement that all grantees obtain tenant group approval, to ensure maximum tenant control
over the eventual purchaser. While the Department has clarified that resident organizations have preference for
Resident Capacity grants, the Department believes that the other priorities listed by the commenters are contrary
to statutory intent. 



4. Conflicts of Interest 



The Department received six comments on the proposed NOFA's conflict of interest requirements. One commenter believed
that the requirements should be stronger. Another felt the requirement should involve disclosure rather than strict
guidelines, so groups could continue to work with current consultants. Three commenters believed that the conflict
of interest requirements should require grant recipients to certify that there is no violation of the Related Party
rule, as defined in 24 CFR 248.101. Further, to prevent ``straw'' buyers, the Related Party Rule should: apply to entities
other than individuals (e.g., corporations and partnerships); prohibit an identity of interest with a for-profit
owner; not prohibit use of consultants and attorneys who are arms length; and require all related parties to make disclosures.
One commenter felt the applicant should also disclose any intent to be involved in management, development, or provision
of services for money, but that continued use of architects, management agents, development consultants, etc.,
should not be prohibited after acquisition. Another felt there should not be a blanket prohibition on a grantee contracting
with owner consultants, as long as full disclosure is made and residents, through these disclosures, are able to have
a say in personnel decisions. One commenter suggested a requirement that the applicant submit: Forms 2530 for the
applicant and all board members; articles of incorporation; statements of officers and directors; financial statements
for the last five years; and a listing of properties owned and operated in the last ten years. This commenter felt that
conflicts with current management as well as the owner should be disclosed. 

The Department has decided to tighten the proposed NOFA's conflict of interest requirements. The required certification
will state that there has been no conflict of interest relationship during the previous five years, and it will include
a requirement that the applicant not seek any financial benefit from project ownership. The Department has further
clarified that nonprofit general partners seeking to buy out their limited partners are exempt from this rule. In
addition, the NOFA will require disclosure to tenants and to the intermediary to include any relationship with owners,
management, or any other parties to the sale. The Department will also require certification by the applicant that
it will not interfere with the tenants' right to organize.

5. Funding 



Six commenters requested that the Department allow funding for activities conducted prior to grant award. Two of
these specifically made this suggestion to prevent lack of assistance where there are delays in funding that are not
the fault of the grantee_suggesting funding of activities beginning at the earlier of award approval or 30 days after
application submission, which is the date by which funds should have been awarded. One suggestion was to allow funding
for activities conducted prior to the grant award and after NOI submission because this would be consistent with other
HUD programs_specifically the Department's Section 202 (12 U.S.C. 1701q) program. Under the Section 202 program,
previous expenses must be fully documented and fall within application budget.

The Department has decided to allow reimbursement of funds back to the time when the applicant became eligible for
grant funds. For Resident Capacity grants this will be the time the owner files any Notice of Intent to Proceed. For
Predevelopment grants this will be the time the owner has indicated an intent to sell the property. This decision was
based in part on the increased resident notification period, which will inherently delay the time which grant funds
are awarded and received by the recipient. While grantees may be reimbursed for eligible activities, they undertake
these activities at their own risk. If a grant is not subsequently awarded, there will be no mechanism for compensating
the applicant. To qualify for reimbursement, activities performed prior to the grant award must be eligible activities
under the NOFA and must be clearly identified in the application submission package. 

One commenter requested that residents be informed when grant is awarded. The Department has adopted this requirement.


The Department has rejected a suggestion that the grants be competitive with quarterly awards, rather than ongoing
awards, in order to give residents more time to get applications and formally comment. The statute allows applications
on a rolling basis, and requiring a grantee to wait several months for an award could hinder a resident-supported purchase
for the property. 

One commenter was concerned that $200,000 would not be enough to cover predevelopment costs for most projects. This
funding limit is statutory, and the Department has no discretion to alter the limit. 

Four commenters sought clarification on what terminating the current grant program means. In order to ensure continuity
of the program, they suggest that: awardees under the September 3, 1992, NOFA should be able to apply for new funds as
soon as old funds are obligated; grantees should not be able to receive grants over the total of this NOFA; and, because
it is an ongoing process, grantees should not be required to expend all funds awarded in the 1992 NOFA. In this NOFA the
Department is allowing applications from grantees with active grants under the September 3, 1992, NOFA; however,
as awards are made by the intermediary, the previous awards shall be terminated. It is impractical for grantees to
report to both the HUD field office and the intermediary on ongoing grant status. The total grant award from both NOFAs
must not be greater than the total allowed in this NOFA. 

There were ten comments on the Department's method for funding technical assistance grants on a State-by-State basis.
One concern was that basing fund allocation solely on active Notices of Intent, plus active Plans of Action, will be
skewed, because this does not directly correlate with preservation sales activity. The Department should not include
cases where owners have not yet indicated an intention to sell; rather, funding for predevelopment grants should
be tied to the number of NOIs to sell plus binding sales commitments. Another suggested that the same allocation formula
should not be used for both Resident Capacity and Predevelopment grants. Several commented that the formula should
remain flexible to reflect actual activity levels in States, and suggested a hold-back so that funds could be reallocated
according to actual participation levels. Several others suggested a reallocation method between States. The Department
seriously considered using only Notices of Intent to Sell as the criteria for a State breakdown of funding. The Department
cannot use binding commitments as an indicator, because it will not have these in advance of the State-by-State allocation.
However, experience from the September 3, 1992, NOFA shows that an owner's Initial Notice of Intent is only a partial
indication of what an owner will actually do. Therefore, the Department will not change its method for allocation
by State. The Department has also decided not to maintain a holdback, but will reallocate funds between intermediaries
if levels of grant activity justify a reallocation.

One commenter requested HUD to allocate unused funds from the 1992 NOFA using the 90/10 formula in the statute, rather
than giving all unused funds to technical assistance grants. The Department has decided to allocate unused funds
using the 90/10 formula. Another commenter sought clarification of the exact amount of funds available from 1992
NOFA and how these funds will be divided. Because the 1992 NOFA is active, and will be for several months, the Department
cannot know exactly how much will be available once the 1992 NOFA is terminated. 



6. Applicant Selection 



Several commenters felt that the application review should include review of the financial viability of the property
and an analysis of the development team, rather than a simple review of the applicant itself. One commenter was concerned
that resident support would override strong underwriting criteria. The Department has chosen not to amend this selection
criteria, but will also instruct intermediaries reviewing Predevelopment grant applications to conduct a review
on the feasibility of the purchase, including a review of the development team. 

One commenter requested that if any award is made by an intermediary or HUD, the procurement requirements of OMB Circular
A-110 should be deemed to have been met. This would permit continuity of service for consultants who were identified
by grantees prior to the availability of Federal funds. The Department finds it unnecessary to address this in the
NOFA. However, if the organization is currently meeting the OMB requirements, the Department anticipates that the
organization will continue to do so under another grant. 

A commenter pointed out that the NOFA says grants are awarded within 30 days, and that this should be specified as 30
calendar days. Another commenter requested that the NOFA specify the appeals process to HUD. The Department has adopted
both of these suggestions in this NOFA. 

Several commenters recommended requiring intermediaries to explain why an application was not funded or why items
within an application were not funded. The Department has adopted this recommendation. 

One commenter suggested that applicant resident groups should be able to request the intermediary to provide expertise
and assistance in grant activities. Because the Department does not wish to have intermediaries performing activities
inconsistently across the country, it has not made this a requirement of intermediaries. 

Eleven comments were received regarding the NOFA's guidance on competing applications. One area of concern was the
time by which another application could be received. Several commenters suggested allowing an applicant 30 days
to gain support, others suggested 20 days, another 14 days. Several commenters also suggested giving the intermediary
additional review time should two applications be received. Several commenters felt the intermediary should attempt
to resolve the situation or require that competing applicants meet and attempt to come to a resolution. Three commenters
suggested that in the case of dual applicants, a clear priority should be for resident groups and resident councils
over Community-Based Nonprofit Housing Developers. 

The Department has decided if a second application is received within 30 days of receipt of the first application,
the intermediary will have an additional 20 days to complete the review of both. If the applications are for a Resident
Capacity grant, the intermediary will give funding preference to a resident group or a Resident Council over another
applicant. If there are competing Predevelopment grant applicants and both are otherwise acceptable, the intermediary
will send back the applications and give applicants an opportunity to meet, explain differences to tenants, and come
to a resolution/compromise. If no compromise is reached the intermediary would fund the applicant that it found most
capable of performing grant and nonprofit sponsor activities. The fact that a nonprofit developer is receiving a
Predevelopment grant would not preclude a separate resident group from getting a Resident Capacity grant. 



B. Selection of Intermediaries 



1. Fee Structure 



Twelve commenters were concerned that the proposed fee structure for intermediaries would not yield sufficient
funds to cover the scope of services listed in the NOFA. The proposed NOFA contemplated a $5,000 start-up fee, plus
2 percent of the grant awards for the State or States in which the intermediary administered grants. Suggestions ranged
from 4 to 5 percent of the grant awards. One commenter suggested that the minimum start-up fee should be $15,000 so smaller
States will participate. Several others suggested that the fee should vary according to the level of activities that
the intermediary is performing. 

The Department considered seriously the appropriateness of the fee and awarding a different level of funding to intermediaries
performing a higher level of activities. The Department has chosen a processing fee structure through which each
intermediary will receive a $15,000 start-up fee and five percent of each technical assistance grant it administers,
which will be allocated as the grants are disbursed. Each intermediary will also receive a flat fee of $500 for each
grant application rejected. If a selected intermediary receives no grant applications, it will receive only the
start-up fee. 



2. Intermediary Selection 



At least one commenter felt that the Department should give preference to local intermediaries, then State and regional
intermediaries, over national intermediaries. The Department has decided to allow sub-State intermediaries in
areas where there appears to be enough preservation activity to justify a sub-State intermediary. However, any sub-State
intermediary must apply to administer grants in a geographic area covering at least one HUD area office. In most States,
any economies of scale would be lost if there was more than one intermediary. In its review of intermediaries the Department
will review and rate all local intermediaries before reviewing State and regional intermediaries. However, the
Department will consider the capacity, experience, and point scores of all local, State and regional intermediaries
before making final intermediary selection. National intermediaries will be chosen for those areas for which no
other acceptable intermediary has applied. 

Concern from eleven commenters lead to suggestions that outside parties, particularly resident groups, should
be able to comment on the applications and selections of intermediaries. Because the selection of intermediary grantees
is competitive, the disclosure of grant applications would be in violation of section 12 of the Department of Housing
and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537a), and, therefore, the Department cannot implement this suggestion.

<DOCNO> FR940406-2-00147 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

One commenter suggested that intermediaries be required to state in their proposals how they will deal with the problem
of monitoring unincorporated entities to ensure that they act with proper fiscal standards. The same commenter agreed
with the Department's preference for an intermediary handling both Resident Capacity and Predevelopment grants.
As part of its overall evaluation of each intermediary's application, the Department will evaluate proposals to
deal with the problem of monitoring fiscal standards. 

One commenter requested that Community Action Agencies, which have been the leader in services to the low-income
community in all areas for more than 25 years, be eligible intermediaries. The Department is adhering to the statutory
definition of intermediary, but to the extent such an agency has the capacity to become an eligible applicant under
the guidelines, a Community Action Agency could apply. 

Several commenters suggested that intermediaries receive preference if they have a structured plan that maximizes
resident participation in administrative policy issues. Another commenter requested that HUD require intermediaries
to work with a tenant-based coalition, and if an intermediary cannot develop this support, HUD should administer
the grants. The Department will not include this requirement because it would be too burdensome, particularly for
national intermediaries. However, four commenters suggested giving preference to intermediaries with demonstrated
resident/nonprofit accountability. The Department will give preference for such a demonstrated track record.


One commenter recommended deleting language that requires intermediaries to have a record of service in ``multiple
communities'' because the language is vague and confusing. The requirement is statutory and therefore the language
remains unchanged. The Department does not agree that it is confusing. The Department considers ``a record of service * * *
in multiple communities'' to mean the intermediary has worked with various types of organizations within varied
communities. Preferably these communities would include a cross-section of the geographic area for which the intermediary
is applying to administer grants. The definition would exclude an intermediary that has worked solely in one community
or neighborhood. 



3. Intermediary Tasks 



Seven commenters requested more detail in the NOFA of the Department's expectations to guide intermediaries, particularly
in their monitoring activities, with standards and timeframes. Several sought clarification of the legal responsibilities
of the intermediaries, others felt intermediary activities should be expanded and negotiated with HUD to include
underwriting, monitoring, servicing, site visits, and technical assistance provision. One commenter sought clarification
of whether an intermediary will act as a delegated processor with final grant authority, or whether it will function
under some other model. One commenter disagreed with negotiating the level of activities, arguing that HUD should
require specific tasks of all intermediaries to get all essential tasks covered. The Department has seriously considered
this issue and has provided a greater level of detail of its expectations of the intermediaries. 

The Department will not allow a variety of participation levels by intermediaries. However, if an intermediary seeks
to perform a higher level of activities, such as technical assistance, it may apply to perform these activities under
a separate HUD NOFA that will implement section 254 of LIHPRHA as added by section 312 of the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992. That NOFA is expected to be published soon. 

One commenter stated that intermediaries, in general, should not have say over who is selected as a priority purchaser,
which consultants are hired, what are the contract terms, etc. While the Department's regulations regarding priority
purchasers are separate from this NOFA, the intermediaries will have review authority over consultants hired and
terms of contracts under the technical assistance grants. 

One commenter suggested that some technical assistance grantees may want closer oversight and assistance, and intermediaries
should be required to provide to those grantees what is agreed upon in the grant. As discussed above, and in order to
provide consistency nationwide, the grantees cannot request a higher level of service from the intermediaries.




4. Accountability 



Three commenters suggested that resident groups should be able to formally monitor intermediaries prior to their
receipt of further funding, and to include standards that encourage intermediaries to have accountability to residents
and nonprofits without micromanagement by the intermediary. One of these commenters suggested that intermediaries
should show evidence of a commitment to tenant organizing; another suggested a stronger conflict of interest proviso
and performance benchmarks for the intermediary. However, a fourth commenter believed oversight of intermediaries
should not be by tenant groups or other prospective grantees; rather, HUD should provide this oversight. This commenter
recommended a selection of intermediaries when the track record indicates absence of abuse. As part of its monitoring
of intermediaries, the Department will accept comments from outside parties on intermediary performance after
intermediary grants are in place and active. However, the Department does not find it appropriate to include, nor
does it desire to delay intermediary funding by including, resident groups directly in the monitoring process. 



5. Other Comments 



One commenter recommended that the benchmarks for Technical Assistance Grantees be made by the Department, rather
than left up to the intermediary. The statute requires that HUD work with intermediaries to come up with the performance
benchmarks for the Predevelopment Grant phases. The Department intends these benchmarks to be consistent across
the country. 

One commenter requested clarification that intermediaries, at their own risk, may incur costs from the date they
are selected, as opposed to the date of contract execution. The Department agrees with this request; however, no actual
fees will be paid prior to the date of contract execution and the intermediary may not begin funding technical assistance
grantees prior to such execution.

II. Purpose and Substantive Description 



A. Authority and Background 



The funding made available under this NOFA is authorized by section 312 of the Housing and Community Development Act
of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-550, approved October 28, 1992) in order to provide assistance to resident groups and Community-Based
Nonprofit Housing Developers (CBDs) involved in projects proceeding under the provisions of the Emergency Low-Income
Housing Preservation Act of 1987 (Pub. L.100-242, section 201 of the Housing and Community Development Act
of 1987, approved Feb. 5, 1988) (ELIHPA) or the Low Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of
1990 (Pub. L. 101-625, section 601 of the National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA), approved November 28, 1990)
(LIHPRHA). 

The origins of LIHPRHA are in ELIHPA. The purpose of ELIHPA was to preserve low-income affordability restrictions
on certain HUD-insured or assisted multifamily projects. ELIHPA authorized the use of incentives to encourage owners
to retain low-income affordability restrictions or to transfer the property to purchasers who would agree to retain
those restrictions. The fundamental principles underlying ELIHPA were that the low-income housing should be preserved
for the intended beneficiaries and that owners should be guaranteed a fair and reasonable return on their investments.


ELIHPA was intended to be a temporary measure that would allow Congress time to fashion a permanent program for the
preservation of existing low-income housing projects. This permanent program is LIHPRHA, which replaced ELIHPA
except to the extent that section 604 of NAHA provides a transition option for certain owners. In addition, section
226 of LIHPRHA establishes the Resident Homeownership Program, under which tenants may become homeowners of eligible
low income housing. The Department's regulations implementing these statutory provisions are set out in 24 CFR part
248. (Applicants should note that part 248, as codified in the April 1, 1993, revision of the Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR) was amended subsequently in a rule published on July 13, 1993 (57 FR 3384). Most requirements under this NOFA
were imposed by title III of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 and are included in the July 13, 1993,
amendments to part 248.) 



B. Request for Applications 



Eligible intermediaries are invited to apply to administer funds under the provisions of this NOFA (see Section V.A,
``Obtaining Intermediary Applications'' of this NOFA). The Department will announce the selected intermediaries
and will publish the addresses of the intermediaries and the date on which applicants may apply to intermediaries
for technical assistance grant funds. Selected intermediaries will also announce the availability of technical
assistance grant funds as described in Section III of this NOFA. 



C. Allocation and Funding 



The purpose of this NOFA is to make available $45 million in funds to and through intermediaries for eligible resident
and community organizations. The dollar amounts will be made available on a State-by-State basis for two types of
grants: Resident Capacity grants and Predevelopment grants. The description of how funds will initially be divided
by State is listed in Appendix B of this NOFA. The Department will rate local intermediaries, then State intermediaries,
then regional intermediaries before making selections for each geographic area. Some States may be subdivided for
purposes of the NOFA activities if there are a sufficient number of eligible low-income housing projects in the State
to justify sub-State intermediaries. Local or sub-State intermediaries applying to perform grant administration
activities must apply to perform activities covering at least the jurisdiction of one HUD area office. The Department
will generally favor local or sub-State intermediaries over State intermediaries, and will favor State intermediaries
over regional intermediaries. 

However, before making the final intermediary selections, the Department will assess the overall capacity and experience
of intermediary applicants. If no intermediary applicant applies to administer grants in a particular State or area,
the Department will select a national intermediary to perform those activities in that State or area. If no acceptable
application is received from a national intermediary, the Department's field offices will administer the Resident
Capacity and Predevelopment grants for all areas not covered by local, State, or regional intermediaries.

The Preservation Technical Assistance Grant program that is currently being administered by the Department, in
accordance with a NOFA published on September 3, 1992, at 57 FR 40570 (as amended at 57 FR 56929 (December 1, 1992) and
58 FR 8766 (February 17, 1993)), will be terminated at intermediary selection. A portion of the unreserved funds from
that earlier NOFA will be made available under this NOFA through the intermediaries. Grantees active under the September
3, 1992, NOFA will continue under that grant program unless they apply for and receive funds under this NOFA. 

The two forms of technical assistance grants that will be made available through intermediaries are Resident Capacity
grants and Predevelopment grants. These are described in Appendix A to this NOFA. Of the $45 million available from
FY 1993 and 1994 appropriations, $13.5 million is available for Resident Capacity grants and $31.5 million is available
for Predevelopment grants. Of any additional funds made available under this program, 30 percent will be set aside
for Resident Capacity grants and 70 percent for Predevelopment grants. The dollar amounts available to the individual
resident and community organizations shall be limited to $30,000 for Resident Capacity grants and $200,000 for Predevelopment
grants. The Predevelopment grants will be funded in at least two phases. The performance benchmarks for these phases
will be negotiated between the Department and selected intermediaries prior to technical assistance application
submission. 



III. Intermediaries 



A. Eligible Intermediaries 



(1) 

General Definition 



An eligible intermediary applicant is a local, State, regional, or national nonprofit or quasi-public organization
or a State or local housing agency that has as a central purpose of its organization the preservation of low-income
housing and the prevention of displacement of low- and moderate-income residents. An eligible intermediary must
not receive direct Federal appropriations for operating support. All intermediaries must have a record of service
to low-income individuals or community-based nonprofit housing developers in multiple communities, and must meet
the standards of fiscal responsibilities established in OMB Circulars A-110 and A-122 or, if a State or
local agency, 24 CFR 85 and OMB Circular 87. In addition, intermediaries must have experience with the allocation
or administration of grant or loan funds. (Copies of OMB circulars are available from E.O.P. Publications, room 2200,
New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503, telephone (202) 395-7332. (This is not a toll-free number.)
There is a limit of two free copies.) 



(2) Intermediary Categories 



(a) A national nonprofit applicant 

must also have been in existence for at least five years and be classified as an exempt organization under section 501(c)(3)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

(b) 

A regional, State or local nonprofit applicant 

must also have been in existence for at least three years and either be classified as an exempt organization under section
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or be recognized otherwise as a tax-exempt entity. 

(c) 

A State or local agency. 

This category includes public housing agencies and State housing finance agencies. 



B. Fees 



Each selected intermediary will receive processing fees. The fees will include a start-up fee of $15,000 and an additional
fee of five percent of each technical assistance grant the intermediary administers, which will be allocated as the
grants are disbursed. These fees are based on the intermediary performing the following activities: Announcing
the availability of grant funds; producing and distributing application kits; accepting, reviewing and approving
and/or rejecting grant applications; executing grant agreements; disbursing grant funds; monitoring the grantees'
activities under the grant award; monitoring compliance with the grant agreement through the term of the grant; and
maintaining documentation of grant activities for the Department's monitoring of the intermediary. 

Intermediaries will be legally responsible to the Department for approving eligible applicants, activities, and
budgets, and shall maintain all correspondence with and documentation regarding the technical assistance grantees
for not less than five years. All intermediaries will receive the start-up fee when the intermediary contract is executed.
Intermediaries will draw down five percent of each technical assistance grant award at the time those awards are disbursed,
not to exceed five percent of the total funds available to the jurisdiction. If an intermediary reviews and rejects
a technical assistance application, it will receive an administrative fee of $500. If an intermediary receives no
technical assistance grant applications, it will receive only its start-up fee. On occasion, the Department will
review grant activity to determine if reallocation of funds between geographic regions is necessary. 



C. Eligible Tasks 



Intermediaries may apply for one or both parts of the intermediary tasks described in this NOFA. The two distinct tasks
are: 

 Administering Resident Capacity grants; and 

 Administering predevelopment grants. Through its application, an intermediary must describe the specific
jurisdiction in which it proposes to perform such tasks. 

There will be no duplication of geographic coverage for any administrative task. In States where there is sufficient
preservation activity to justify sub-State intermediaries, State or regional intermediaries may apply to perform
activities in areas that include the jurisdiction of one or more HUD field offices. In no case will a field office jurisdiction
be subdivided for purposes of intermediary selection for grant administration. To assure maximum geographic coverage
by intermediaries, HUD may negotiate geographic coverage with intermediaries as part of intermediary selection.


Specific tasks for all intermediaries will include the following: 

 Advertising fund availability for the jurisdiction overseen. 

 Producing and distributing grant application kits. (A sample kit will be provided by the Department.) 

 Accepting grant applications. 

 Reviewing and approving or rejecting grant applications. 

 Executing grant agreements. (A draft grant agreement will be provided by the Department.) 

 Vouchering for funds through the Department. 

 Disbursing grant funds. 

 Monitoring activities under the grant, including compliance under the grant agreement, throughout the term
of the grant. 

 Reporting to the Department at least quarterly on the status of applications, grant awards, grantee activities,
and funds expended. 

 Maintaining grant documentation for HUD monitoring and audits.

D. Ineligible Intermediary Activities 



Intermediaries may not receive payment, directly or indirectly, from the proceeds of grants they have approved.
In addition, intermediaries may not provide other services to grant recipients with respect to the specific properties
for which the grant has been awarded. 



E. Selection Criteria 



1. Threshold 



Intermediaries must meet minimum criteria described in Section III.A, ``Eligible Intermediaries,'' of this NOFA.
If in its review the Department determines that the applicant does not meet the threshold criteria, the application
will be rejected. If the application does meet the threshold criteria, then the Department will select intermediaries
through a rating and ranking competition described in Section III.E(2) of this NOFA. 



2. Preferences and Factors for Award 



The intermediary applications will be rated and ranked on a point system, with the maximum point score of 100. The Department
will first rate and rank any local or sub-State intermediary applications, then all State intermediary applications,
and then regional applications. In general, the Department will give preference to local intermediaries, as discussed
in Section II.C, ``Allocation and Funding'', of this NOFA; however, capacity, experience, and overall points for
these intermediaries will be considered before selection. The Department may establish a threshold score on capacity
and experience that local applicants must meet in order to qualify for funding. 

After selecting local, State, and regional intermediaries, the Department will rate and rank all national intermediary
applications to select an intermediary in States or regions for which no other eligible intermediary, acceptable
to the Secretary, has submitted a proposal to participate. If no such national intermediary applies to perform NOFA
activities, the Department, through its field offices, will administer technical assistance grant funds for all
areas without an acceptable intermediary. The Department will consider joint venture applications as long as one
eligible intermediary is identified in the application as the primary applicant. The rating points will be allocated
based on the categories below: 

(a) 

Preservation Experience.

 (30 points) The Secretary shall give rating points to applications from eligible intermediaries based on expertise
or experience with ELIHPA and LIHPRHA. Maximum points will be given to applicants with significant demonstrated
expertise or experience with ELIHPA or LIHPRHA. 

(b) 

Range of Activities.

 (10 points) These points will be given to organizations applying to administer both the Resident Capacity grants
and the Predevelopment grants, rather than applying to administer just one of those grant programs. 

(c) 

Direct Experience.

 (30 points) Rating points will be given to intermediaries based on their direct experience in performing the tasks
for which they have applied. This would include administration of grants to resident organizations, administration
of grants to nonprofit organizations and State or local agencies, and monitoring of nonprofit grantees. The Department
will not assign preference to intermediaries with experience in administering Federal grants, but may exclude applicants
that have failed to perform under prior contracts of a similar nature. 

(d) 

Organizational Capacity.

 (30 points) Each applicant will be rated on its organizational capacity to implement its plan to administer grants.
Each applicant should submit evidence that its organization can implement the proposed activities in an efficient
manner, based on demonstrated organizational capacity and staff expertise. 



IV. Responsibilities of Intermediaries 



A. General 



Intermediaries will be responsible for performing the tasks listed in Section III.C, ``Eligible Tasks,'' of this
NOFA. The technical assistance grant program that the intermediaries will be administering is described in detail
in Appendix A to this NOFA.

<TEXT>
 

B. Timeframes 



Once funding availability is advertised by the intermediary for its jurisdiction, technical assistance applications
will be submitted to the intermediaries on an ongoing basis. If the applications are acceptable, grants must be awarded
no later than 30 calendar days after a complete application is received by the intermediary. If the application is
found to be substantially complete (i.e., there are no missing exhibits), but technically deficient (i.e., an exhibit
does not adequately meet the application requirements), the intermediary shall send the applicant a deficiency
letter and allow 14 days for resubmission of deficient exhibits. The intermediary will have an additional 30 days
to review and approve an application, following receipt of application revisions. If the application is not substantially
complete, it will be rejected. 



C. Technical Assistance Grant Selection Criteria 



1. Resident Capacity Grants 



All Resident Capacity applicants will receive an application kit, which will be produced and distributed by the intermediary.
A sample application kit will be provided to the intermediaries from the Department. Applications will be accepted
on an ongoing basis, and all acceptable applications will be approved unless there are no funds available for Resident
Capacity grants. Intermediaries must review and approve or reject applications for Resident Capacity grants based
on the following threshold criteria: 

(a) The applicant meets the eligible applicant criteria listed in paragraph A of Appendix A to this NOFA. 

(b) The applicant is applying for funds for eligible activities listed in paragraph D(1) of Appendix A to this NOFA.

(c) The applicant has notified the residents of its application in accordance with paragraph B of Appendix A to this
NOFA. 

(d) The plan for promoting the ability of residents to participate meaningfully in the preservation process is reasonable
and feasible. 

(e) The budget submitted with the application reflects reasonable costs directly associated with the grant activities.


(f) The estimate of time necessary to achieve completion of activities and delivery of products is reasonable and
realistic and within the time frames set forth in the applicable program regulation. 



2. Predevelopment Grants 



All Predevelopment grant applicants will receive an application kit that will have been produced and distributed
by the intermediary. A sample application kit will be provided to the intermediaries from the Department. Applications
will be accepted on an ongoing basis, and all acceptable applications will be approved unless there are no funds available
for Predevelopment grants. Intermediaries must review and approve or reject applications for Predevelopment grants
based on the following threshold criteria: 

(a) The applicant meets the eligible applicant criteria listed in paragraph A of Appendix A to this NOFA; 

(b) The applicant is applying for eligible activities listed in paragraph D(2) of Appendix A to this NOFA; 

(c) The applicant has notified the residents of its application in accordance with paragraph B of Appendix A to this
NOFA; 

(d) The plan for promoting and achieving a resident supported purchase of the property must be reasonable and feasible
and in conformance with the appropriate program regulations and guidelines. This will include an evaluation of the
experience and capacity of the applicant's development team; 
(e) The budget submitted with the application reflects reasonable costs directly associated with the grant activities
that would result in the development of a feasible purchase; and 

(f) The estimate of time necessary to achieve completion of activities and delivery of products is reasonable and
realistic and within the time frames set forth in the applicable program regulation. 



3. Competing Grant Applications 



If a second technical assistance application is received within 30 days of receipt of the first application for any
property, and if that application is for the same grant category, the intermediary shall have an additional 20 days
to review both applications. The total review time for any grant cannot exceed 50 days. If the competing applications
are for Resident Capacity grants, resident groups and Resident Councils shall have priority over other applicants.
If the competing applications are for Predevelopment grants, and both are found technically acceptable, the Intermediary
will return the applications with instructions that the applicants meet together and with the residents to reach
a resolution for a final application. If no compromise is reached, the intermediary will approve the applicant that
the intermediary finds most capable of performing grant and nonprofit sponsor activities. In addition, in the case
of any application, if there is an indication that a majority of the residents oppose the applicant's selection, that
application shall be denied. 



4. Decision Not To Fund 



In any denial of award letter, the intermediary shall be required to explain the reasons for its determination. In
addition, if the intermediary makes a determination that results in a reduction of proposed grant funds, that determination
shall also be explained in writing.

5. Appeals 


If an application for either a Resident Capacity grant or a Predevelopment grant is denied, the applicant will have
the right to appeal that denial to the Department. The appeal must be made within 45 days of application rejection to:
Multifamily Preservation Division, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 7th Street, NW., room 6284,
Washington DC, 20410. The Department will make a binding determination within 45 days of the appeal. 


6. Award Notification 


If an applicant is awarded and accepts a Resident Capacity or Predevelopment grant, the applicant must inform the
residents of the property about the award, by posting a notice or through a resident meeting or both, within three weeks
of the applicant's acceptance of the award. 


V. Intermediary Application Process 


A. Obtaining Intermediary Applications 


Intermediary application kits are available from the Multifamily Preservation Division, Department of Housing
and Urban Development, room 6284, 451 7th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410; telephone (202) 708-2300; and
the Multifamily Housing Clearinghouse, P.O. Box 6424, Rockville, MD 20850, telephone 1-800-955-2232.



B. Submitting Applications 


Applications will be submitted to the Multifamily Preservation Division Department of Housing and Urban Development,
451 7th Street, SW., room 6284, Washington, DC 20410. Applications must be received no later than June 6, 1994. No facsimiled
(FAXed) applications will be accepted. Any application received after 5:00 p.m., E.D.T., on the due date will not
be accepted for processing and will be returned to the applicant. Any corrections to deficient applications made
in accordance with Section V.E of this NOFA may be transmitted by facsimile; however, the original subsequently must
be submitted by mail. 


C. Submission Requirements 


An intermediary must provide the following: 
(1) A completed application, including the following, as applicable: 
(a) OMB Standard Form 424; 
(b) Identification of proposed geographic area in which it will perform intermediary activities; 
(c) Information about how the applicant meets the Factors for Award listed in Section III.E(2) of this NOFA; 
(d) Information about the applicant, including its history, its staff and their qualifications, and its experience;

(e) Summary of plan to advertise grant availability, distribute applications, review applications, disburse funds,
and monitor activities under the grant; 
(f) Evidence of tax exempt status, if applicable; 
(g) Certification that the intermediary will not receive payment, directly or indirectly, from the proceeds of the
grants it has approved; 
(h) Certification that assistance provided under this NOFA will not be used to supplant or duplicate other resources
for the proposed activities. For purposes of this paragraph, ``other resources'' means resources provided from
any source other than under this NOFA;
(i) Other disclosures, certifications, and assurances (including Drug-Free Workplace and Anti-Lobbying certifications),
as required under the law and this NOFA; and 
(j) Other information and materials as may be described in the application kit. 


D. Intermediary Selection Process 


The selection process for intermediaries consists of a threshold screening to determine whether the application
meets the technical requirements for application submission contained in this NOFA and the application kit. If the
application meets the technical requirements, it will be reviewed and ranked by the Preservation Division in HUD
Headquarters according to the selection criteria in Section III.E of this NOFA. Within 60 days from the application
deadline, the Preservation Division will notify an intermediary of its selection or rejection. Selected intermediaries
will be required to sign a grant agreement. If no intermediary is selected for a particular State, the HUD field offices
will administer the grants directly. 


E. Corrections to Deficient Applications 


If an application submitted by an intermediary is found to be deficient in a nonsubstantive manner, the Department
will inform the applicant of such deficiency within 15 days after the application deadline and the applicant will
have seven days to submit revisions to its application. Nonsubstantive deficiencies are those that are not integral
to the application's review, such as a certification. If an application is substantively deficient at the time of
application deadline, the application will be rejected.

<TEXT>
 

F. Application Selection Timeframe 


The Department will complete its review and selection process within 60 days of the deadline date for intermediaries.
Once intermediaries are selected and agreements are executed, intermediaries will have 30 days to make grant funds
available to eligible technical assistance applicants. Grants from technical assistance applicants will be accepted
on a rolling basis by the intermediaries administering such grants. 


G. Intermediary Information 


The Department will publish in the 

Federal Register

 the list of selected Intermediaries within 30 days of the date that the Department's intermediary selection process
is completed. That publication will include information for potential technical assistance applicants on how to
obtain application kits and will list contact names at the Intermediary organizations selected to administer the
grants. 


VI. Other Matters 


Environmental Impact 


In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(b) of the
HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this notice relate only to technical assistance and, therefore,
are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. 


Federalism Impact 


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this notice will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions,
or the relationship between the federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. As a result, the notice is not subject to review under the Order. Specifically,
the funds available under this NOFA will be used to select intermediaries that will administer technical assistance
grants to eligible recipients. The grants to eligible recipients will be for technical assistance activities related
to the preservation of low-income housing. 


Family Executive Order 


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
notice does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being,
and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will
result from promulgation of this notice, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. 


Section 102 of the HUD Reform Act: Documentation and Public Access Requirements; Applicant/Recipient Disclosures




Documentation and Public Access Requirements


HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this
NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including
any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than
30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients
of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly 

Federal Register

 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b) for further
information on these documentation and public access requirements.) 


Disclosures 


HUD will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (HUD Form 2880) submitted in
connection with this NOFA. Update reports (also Form 2880) will be made available along with the applicant disclosure
reports, but in no case for a period generally less than three years. All reports_both applicant disclosures and updates_will
be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations
at 24 CFR part 15. (See 24 CFR part 12, subpart C, for further information on these disclosure requirements.) 


Section 103 HUD Reform Act 


HUD's regulation (24 CFR part 4) implementing section 103 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform
Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3537a) (Reform Act) applies to the funding competition announced today. The requirements of
the rule continue to apply until the announcement of selection of successful applicants. 
Both HUD and intermediary employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions
are limited by 24 CFR part 4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of
HUD) concerning funding decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons
who apply for assistance in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under
24 CFR part 4. 
Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708-3815 (voice/TDD). (This is
not a toll-free number.) The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature, as well. However, a HUD employee
who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can be discussed with persons outside
the Department, should contact his or her Regional or Field Office Counsel, or Headquarters counsel for the program
to which the question pertains.

Section 112 of the Reform Act 



Section 112 of the HUD Reform Act added a new section 13 to the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C.
3537b). Section 13 contains two provisions dealing with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial
assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those
who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action by the Department and those
who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the
award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance
received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. 

Section 13 was implemented by regulations codified in part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence
the Department in these ways, they are urged to read the regulations, particularly the examples contained in Appendix
A of part 86. 

Any questions about the rule should be directed to the Office of Ethics, room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban
Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410-3000. Telephone: (202) 708-3815 (voice/TDD).
(This is not a toll-free number.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD office.




Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities 



The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) (the ``Byrd
Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of Federal
contracts, grants, or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative branches of
the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding
of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification
regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000
must certify that no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance.

Appendix A: Technical Assistance Applications 



A. Eligible Applicants 



(1) 

General Definition.

 An eligible applicant must notify residents of all occupied units that it is applying for a grant. That notification
shall meet the specifications of paragraph B below. An eligible applicant is one of the entities described in the following
paragraphs (a) through (c) that complies with the applicable criteria: 

(a) 

Resident Group.

 Resident Groups are eligible for Resident Capacity grants only. For an applicant to be considered a resident group,
the following must be submitted: 

(i) Evidence that the greater of 5% of the occupied units or 10 units of the subject property have heads of households
that are members; 

(ii) A copy of a notice announcing an organizational meeting to discuss resident participation in decisions affecting

<TEXT>
 

(c) 

Community-Based Nonprofit Housing Developer.

 (CBD) For an applicant to be considered a CBD it must submit evidence that it: 

(i) Is classified as tax exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; 

(ii) Has been in existence for at least two years, and has at least two years of housing and community development experience,
prior to the date of grant application; 

(iii) Has a record of service to low- and moderate-income people in the community in which the project is located; 

(iv) Is organized at the neighborhood, city, county or a multi-county level; 

(v) In the case of an organization seeking to acquire eligible housing under LIHPRHA, agrees to form a purchasing entity
that conforms to the definition of a community-based nonprofit organization (CBO) in  248.101; 

(vi) Agrees to use its best efforts to secure majority tenant consent to the acquisition of the project for which grant
assistance is requested. Evidence of ``best efforts'' shall include a plan in the application which details method
for securing such support. In addition, continued evidence of ``best efforts,'' such as additional resident meetings
and notices, is required as a grantee moves towards a purchase. 

(2) 

Resident Capacity Grant Applicants.

 Applicants for Resident Capacity grants must meet the eligibility criteria listed in paragraph A of this Appendix.
In addition, these grants may be made only with respect to eligible low-income housing, as defined in  248.101,
for which the owner has filed a Notice of Intent under ELIHPA, an Initial Notice of Intent under LIHPRHA, or a Notice
of Election to Proceed under section 604 of NAHA and is proceeding under the LIHPRHA appraisal process. 

(3) 

Predevelopment Grant Applicants.

 Predevelopment grant applicants must be RCs or CBDs meeting the criteria listed in paragraph A of this Appendix. These
grants may be made only to organizations seeking to purchase the property with a majority of resident support for the
purchase. These grants may be made only with respect to eligible low-income housing projects for which: (i) the owner
has filed an initial or second Notice of Intent to transfer the housing to a qualified purchaser under LIHPRHA, or has
filed any Notice of Intent under LIHPRHA or ELIHPA and the owner has entered into a binding agreement to sell the housing
to the applicant organization, or (ii) the owner has filed a Notice of Election to Proceed under section 604 of NAHA
and is proceeding under the LIHPRHA appraisal process and has entered into a binding agreement to sell the housing
to the applicant organization. This binding agreement shall not necessarily be a formal sales contract; rather,
it may state that the owner will neither work with nor accept a purchase offer from any other entity during the term of
the grant, as long as the grantee is progressing towards a purchase offer, plan of action or resident homeownership
plan, and acquisition in a reasonable period of time. 

(4) 

Conflict of Interest.

 Each applicant must certify that its organization is not a ``Related Party'', as set forth in 24 CFR 248.101, and that
no individual that has, or has had within the last five years, a personal or professional relationship with the owner
entity will receive financial benefit from the grant funds. This certification shall prohibit using mutual consultants,
attorneys, etc. It shall not explicitly prohibit using architects or engineers that have worked with the owner or
in the property in the past, as long as there is no ongoing professional relationship with the owner that could be perceived
as a conflict of interest. A nonprofit general partner of an eligible property that is attempting to buy out its limited
distribution partners is exempt from this part of the conflict of interest requirement. A certification shall also
require disclosure, to the intermediary and the tenants of any relationship with ownership, management, or any other
parties to a sale, and will state that the applicant will not seek any financial benefit from project ownership or operations
other than those disclosed. 



B. Resident Notification 



Each applicant will be required to notify residents of the property of its application prior to submitting the application
package to the intermediary. That notification shall be in writing, be distributed to each resident of the property,
and include a summary of the applicant's plan for the property. The notification shall also include a statement that
residents can themselves become eligible applicants under the Preservation Technical Assistance grant program.
In addition, the applicant must meet with the residents of the property at least two weeks prior to application submission,
and give the residents at least two weeks notification of such meeting. In the meeting the applicant must provide the
following information to the residents: 

 A summary of the grant proposal; 
 A list of members of the board of directors, if known; 
 A list of the proposed development team and management company, if known; 
 A list of all proposed consultants and attorneys; 
 Disclosure of any relationship with ownership, management, or any other parties related to the owner or, if
applicable, related to the sale; and 
 Information on how the residents may comment to the intermediary on the applicant's proposal and that residents
shall have 14 days to submit comments to the applicant and to the intermediary on the proposal. This information shall
include a name and contact number for the intermediary and a name and phone number for a contact person in the applicant
organization. 

If the applicant is unable to make this notification due to lack of access to the property or lack of resident addresses,
the applicant may contact the intermediary for assistance. The intermediary may contact the owner to request access
or resident addresses for the applicant. If the owner is uncooperative, the intermediary may contact the HUD field
office for assistance. If residents make substantive comments to the intermediary, the applicant will be required
to address these comments prior to any grant award from the intermediary. 



C. Ineligible Technical Assistance Applicants 



(1) Entities that have applications pending for funds under the HOPE 2 program are not eligible to apply for funding
under this NOFA (because the owner would have already elected to proceed under the distinct requirements applicable
to HOPE 2 grants and is precluded from concurrently filing the prerequisite Notice of Intent under LIHPRHA or ELIHPA).
An entity that is receiving HOPE 2 funding for preservation-eligible property is ineligible to apply under this NOFA
for a grant for that property until the HOPE 2 grant has been terminated due to HUD's acceptance of the owner's filing
of a Notice of Intent under ELIHPA or LIHPRHA. 

(2) Entities that have been awarded grants under the Preservation NOFA (entitled ``Technical Assistance Planning
Grants for Resident Groups, Community Groups, and Community-Based Nonprofit Organizations and Resident Councils'')
issued September 3, 1992 (57 FR 40570), may not receive funds under this NOFA for any properties for which those grants
were funded either until all funds awarded to the grantee under the 1992 NOFA have been expended, or until the grant
under the September 3, 1992, NOFA has been terminated as a result of a new grant approval under this NOFA. The total funds
received from the September 3, 1992, NOFA plus the total grant award for this NOFA may not exceed the funding limits
of this NOFA. A grantee under the September 3, 1992, NOFA is eligible for funds under this NOFA only if it also meets the
eligibility criteria of this NOFA and meets the notification requirements of Paragraph B above.

Appendix B: Activity Level and State Allocation 



The allocation of funds by State will be determined according to the level of activity in that State as of the closing
date for intermediaries to submit applications to become intermediaries. If additional grant funds are made available,
the State allocations will be revised according to the activity levels at the time the new funding is made available.
The total funding under this NOFA has been divided by the number of active Notices of Intent submitted by owners for
properties in the State. Regional and national intermediaries may utilize funds for their entire geographical areas
on a first come first serve basis, rather than maintaining the State allocations in funding grants. Sub-State intermediaries
will be considered in the States of California, Texas, and Washington. The following is a breakdown of dollar amounts
by state based on activity level by State as of November 30, 1993. This will be updated prior to actual release of funds
based on activity levels at the time of intermediary selection, but provides a good estimate of expected funds available
by State. In addition, the Department will periodically assess activity levels and, if necessary, reallocate funds
among intermediaries.

Region X (Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Washington).


Statutory and Regulatory Background


Title X of the Public Health Service Act, enacted by Public Law 91-572, authorizes grants for projects to provide
family planning services to persons from low-income families and others. Section 1001 of the Act, as amended, authorizes
grants ``to assist in the establishment and operation of voluntary family planning projects which shall offer a broad
range of acceptable and effective family planning methods and services (including natural family planning methods,
infertility services, and services for adolescents).'' Section 1003 of the Act, as amended, authorizes the Secretary
to make grants to entities to provide the training for personnel to carry out the family planning services programs.
The regulations set out at 42 CFR part 59, subpart C, govern grants for family planning service training. Prospective
applicants should refer to the regulations in their entirety.


Role and Operation of the Training Program


The nurse practitioner is an integral part of the family planning system and performs a critical role in the delivery
of high quality family planning and women's health services. Nurse practitioner training programs are focused on
the preparation of registered professional nurses to function in an advanced nursing role as obstetric-gynecologic
or women's health nurse practitioners.
Successful applicants will be required to work closely with Central and Regional Office staffs and a network of agencies,
including Title X service delivery providers and nurse practitioner training advisory committees. Title X service
grantees from the regions serve on the nurse practitioner training advisory committees. Successful applicants
will be required to review and consider policy and program goals of both the Title X family planning training and services
programs, solicit advice from the regional training advisory committee, and consult with Title X service delivery
providers about training priorities, course content, and curriculum.
The nurse practitioner training curriculum must focus on preparation of obstetric-gynecologic or women's health
care nurse practitioners [hereafter referred to as nurse practitioner(s)] for advanced nursing practice. The nurse
practitioner training curriculum must include content sufficient to prepare graduates to perform the full range
of services required for nurse practitioners in the Title X family planning services program. The nurse practitioner
training program graduate should acquire, through the training program, special knowledge and skills in health
promotion and maintenance, disease prevention, psychosocial and physical assessment, and management of health-illness
needs in the primary care of women, provided predominantly in an ambulatory setting. The nurse practitioner will
provide such care in collaboration with the physician as well as with other members of the health-care team.
The design of the nurse practitioner training program, including the curriculum, must be consistent with national
and regional Title X goals. The program must be eligible for accreditation as a nurse practitioner program by a national
nursing accrediting body and must meet national or State recognition requirements as a provider of continuing education
through a national nursing organization or one of its constituents. Graduates of the nurse practitioner training
program must be eligible for State and/or national certification and meet State requirements for licensure or recognition.
The application should set out how the nurse practitioner training program will address the national health objectives
relating to family planning that are discussed in section 5 of the PHS document, Healthy People 2000, discussed below.
Specific attention should be given to training which would enable nurse practitioners to work more effectively to:
Reduce teen pregnancy; reduce unintended pregnancy among all women; reduce the initiation of sexual activity by
teenagers; increase the effectiveness of contraception, including barrier contraception, among all women; implement
pre-conception care; and reduce sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.
Successful applicants will be responsible for the overall management of a nurse practitioner training program within
the geographic area for which the grant is made. This responsibility includes:
 Developing an annual nurse practitioner training plan, which reflects national Title X program goals and
regional priorities and the training needs of local Title X services grantees;

<DOCNO> FR940406-2-00160 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940406-2-00091 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Developing and implementing a high quality curriculum for a certificate nurse practitioner program specific
to the education and role of the nurse practitioner;
 Developing criteria for selection of candidates for nurse practitioner training, including prerequisite
qualifications. Such criteria should reflect a sensitivity to the unique needs to grantees or trainees for certain
types of training, priority for recruitment of minority nurse practitioner trainees, priority for training nurses
serving in rural areas or Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSA's), or other relevant factors;
 Developing a process to review applications submitted by nurse practitioner training applicants from Title
X service grantees. The nurse practitioner training program will make the final decision about candidates' suitability
for training applying the criteria discussed above;
 Maintaining data on nurse practitioner training characteristics sufficient to allow evaluation by credentialing
bodies, and by the Office of Population Affairs, and to allow self-evaluation by the nurse practitioner training
grantee;
 Developing and implementing nurse practitioner training plans and continuing professional education programs
which include measurable objectives;
 Monitoring the preceptorship phase of the nurse practitioner training program based upon written criteria;
 Sharing materials developed with other training programs so as to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort.
All materials developed with Title X funds must be made available at cost to other Title X projects upon request;
 Facilitating nurse practitioner trainee receipt of continuing education units where appropriate; and 
 Planning an annual continuing education conference and attending at least one national training meeting
annually.

Statutory and Regulatory Background


Title X of the PHS Act, enacted by Public Law 91-572, authorizes grants for projects to provide family planning
services to persons from low-income families and others. Section 1001 of the Act, as amended, authorizes grants ``to
assist in the establishment and operation of voluntary family planning projects which shall offer a broad range of
acceptable and effective family planning methods and services, (including natural family planning methods, infertility
services, and services for adolescents).'' Section 1003 of the Act, as amended, authorizes the Secretary to make
grants to entities to provide the training for personnel to carry out the family planning services programs.
The regulations set out at 42 CFR part 59, subpart C, govern grants for family planning services training. Prospective
applicants should refer to the regulations in their entirety.


Role and Operation of the Training Program


Under the regulations, ``training'' means job-specific skill development. Continuing education activities that
are innovative or non-traditional are encouraged. The development or use of self-paced, self-instructional or
mediated training materials which utilize technological advancements in the learning field are also acceptable.
The purpose of the general training program is to provide short-term training, continuing education, inservice
education and staff development for personnel to improve or maintain at a high level the performance of Title X family
planning services providers.

Successful applicants will be required to work closely with a network of other PHS agencies, including the central
and regional office staffs, Title X service delivery providers, and regional training advisory committees which
provide representation from all service grantees. Successful applicants will be required to review and consider
policy and program goals of the Title X family planning program, solicit advice from the regional training advisory
committee, and consult with Title X service delivery providers about training priorities, course content, and curriculum.
Because of outcomes from the community planning process and emphasis on community involvement, successful applicants
should also stress mechanisms that solicit input from the ``customer,'' both clinician and client.


In developing their curricula and training schedules, general training programs supported under this announcement
should be sensitive to the importance of supporting the program priorities of the Title X services program, which
include:

 Expansion of current clinic sites and development of new clinics in high need areas;


 Outreach to low-income women, adolescents and persons at high risk of unintended pregnancy or infection with
STD (including HIV) not now receiving family planning services;


 Increased emphasis on services to adolescents, including enhanced counseling as well as new service arrangements
for providing services to teens;


 Increased focus on quality and comprehensiveness of services, including treatment of STD's, screening for
cervical cancer and prevention of breast cancer, substance abuse counseling, and counseling on avoidance of high
risk behavior which may place clients at risk for STD and HIV, and


 Increased emphasis on training and retention of Family Planning nurse practitioners, particularly minority
nurse practitioners and those working in clinics serving high risk populations.


Training programs should also be sensitive to the need to focus training on emerging priorities, such as the revised
Title X Guidelines (when issued), the requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act, health care reform, changes
in delivery of traditional family planning in nontraditional sites and program data reporting requirements currently
under revision.


The application should set out how the general training program will address the national health objectives relating
to family planning that are discussed in section 5 of the PHS document, Healthy People 2000. In the context of Healthy
People 2000, attention should be given to training which would enable trainees to: Work more effectively to reduce
teen pregnancy; reduce unintended pregnancy among all women; reduce the initiation of sexual activity by teenagers;
increase the effectiveness of contraception, including barrier contraception, among all women; implement pre-conception
care; and reduce sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.


Successful applicants will be responsible for the overall management of a general training program within the geographic
area for which the grant is made. This responsibility includes:


 Developing an annual training plan, which reflects national and regional goals and the training needs of local
Title X service grantees;


 Developing criteria for selection of staff for training, including prerequisite qualifications. Such criteria
should reflect a sensitivity to the unique needs of grantees for certain types of training, priority for trainees
serving rural areas or Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs), or other relevant factors;


 Developing a process to review training applications submitted by Title X services grantee personnel. Training
grantees will make the final decision about candidates' suitability for training, applying the criteria discussed
above;

(NASA).




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of request for a revision to an existing OMB clearance (9000-0006).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501), the Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR) Secretariat has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request to review and approve a revision
of a currently approved information collection requirement concerning Subcontracting Plans/Subcontracting
Report for Individual Contracts (Standard Form 294).




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Purpose



In accordance with the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631, 

et seq.

), contractors receiving a contract for more than $10,000 agree to have small and small disadvantaged business concerns
participate in the performance of the contract as far as practicable. Contractors receiving a contract or a modification
to a contract expected to exceed $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) must submit a subcontracting plan that provides
maximum practicable opportunities for small and small disadvantaged business concerns. Specific elements required
to be included in the plan are specified in section 8(d) of the Small Business Act and implemented in FAR subpart 19.7.

In conjunction with these plans, contractors must submit semiannual reports of their progress on Standard Form 294,
Subcontracting Report for Individual Contracts.

A satisfactory subcontracting plan is required before a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction)
can be awarded. The contracting officer must examine the information in the proposed plan to determine if the plan
is in compliance with the Small Business Act and the FAR. In addition, the information is used for policy and management
control purposes.

Information submitted on Standard Form 294 is used to assess contractors' compliance with their subcontracting
plans.



B. Annual Reporting Burden



The annual reporting burden is estimated as follows: Respondents, 1,625; responses per respondent, 36; total annual
responses, 58,500; preparation hours per response, 6; and total response burden hours, 351,000. This represents
an increase in the previously approved burden to reflect the number of subcontracting plans that may be required with
initial offers.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of new request for OMB clearance.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501), the Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR) Secretariat has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request to review and approve a new information
collection requirement concerning Contractors' Purchasing Systems Reviews.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


A. Purpose 



The proposed rule revises 44.302, Requirements, and 52.244-2, Subcontracts (Cost-Requirements, and Letter
Contracts), pertaining to performance of Contractors' Purchasing Systems Reviews (CPSR's) and subcontractor
consent requirements, respectively. The rule raises the threshold at (1) 44.302(a) for performing CPSR's from $10
million to $25 million to recognize the effects of inflation on this threshold; (2) 52.244-2(a)(4) to recognize
the increased costs of special test equipment and the effects of inflation since the threshold was established; and
(3) 52.244-2(b)(1) to recognize the effects of raising hourly wage rates and contract costs. 

No previous clearance for this requirement existed. The burden hours being requested take into consideration the
revised (raised) thresholds; i.e., a reduction in burden on contractors from the present requirement. 

The objective of a contractor purchasing system review (CPSR), as discussed in part 44 of the Federal Acquisition
Regulation, is to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness with which the contractor spends Government funds and
complies with Government policy when subcontracting. The review provides the administrative contracting officer
a basis for granting, withholding, or withdrawing approval of the contractor's purchasing system. These revisions
are a result of recommendations submitted by industry. The rule reduces burden on contractors by decreasing surveillance
and increasing dollar thresholds at which contractors are required to provide notification of intent to subcontract.




B. Annual Reporting Burden 



Total annual public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 26,860 hours, including
the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,
and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any
other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to General Services
Administration, FAR Secretariat, 18th & F Streets, NW., room 4035, Washington, DC 20405, and to the FAR Desk Officer,
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. 

The annual reporting burden is estimated as follows: Respondents, 1,580; responses per respondent, 1; total annual
responses, 1,580; preparation hours per response, 17; and total response burden hours, 26,860. 




Obtaining copies of proposals: 

Requester may obtain copies of OMB applications or justifications from the General Services Administration, FAR
Secretariat (VRS), room 4037, Washington, DC 20405, telephone (202) 501-4755. Please cite OMB clearance request
regarding Contractors' Purchasing Systems Reviews, FAR case 92-40, in all correspondence.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Proposed Funding Priorities for Fiscal Years 1994-1995 for the Knowledge Dissemination and Utilization
Program. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary proposes funding priorities for the Knowledge Dissemination and Utilization (D&U) Program under
the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) for fiscal years 1994-1995. The
Secretary takes this action to ensure that rehabilitation knowledge generated from projects and centers funded
by NIDRR and others is utilized fully to improve the lives of individuals with disabilities and their families. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This notice contains six proposed priorities under the D&U program. These proposed priorities would train persons
with rights and duties under the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). The six proposed priority areas are:



(1) Independent living centers;

(2) Family organizations; 
(3) School districts; 
(4) State and local ADA coordinators and policymakers;

(5) Hispanics with rights and duties under the ADA whose proficiency in English is limited; and

(6) Standards for accessible design. 
Authority for the D&U program is contained in sections 202(b)(2) and 204(a) and 204(b)(6) of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 760-762). Under this program the Secretary makes awards to public and private
organizations, including institutions of higher education and Indian tribes or tribal organizations. Under the
regulations for this program (see 34 CFR 355.32), the Secretary may establish priorities by reserving funds to support
particular activities. 
These proposed priorities support the National Education Goals. National Education Goal 5 calls for all Americans
to possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities
of citizenship. 
The Secretary will announce the final funding priorities in a notice in the 

Federal Register

. The final priorities will be determined by responses to this notice, available funds, and other considerations
of the Department. Funding of particular projects depends on the final priorities, the availability of funds, and
the quality of the applications received. The publication of these proposed priorities does not preclude the Secretary
from proposing additional priorities, nor does it limit the Secretary to funding only these priorities, subject
to meeting applicable rulemaking requirements. 






Note: 

This notice of proposed priorities does not solicit applications. A notice inviting applications under these competitions
will be published in the 

Federal Register

 concurrent with or following publication of the notice of final priorities. 


General 


Unless indicated otherwise in the proposed priority, the Secretary proposes that the following requirements apply
to the training projects: 
Applicants for the training projects must identify the target groups and organizations that will be selected for
training as specified in each of the priorities and describe in detail how the project will schedule and provide training
during national, regional, State, or local conferences and meetings of the selected organizations. Applicants
must demonstrate knowledge of the extent to which the target groups and organizations have received prior training
on the ADA. 
Applicants for training projects must describe how the project will utilize a variety of training methods and deliver
training in formats and styles that are accessible to individuals with a range of sensory, communication, cognitive,
and learning disabilities. 
Applicants for training projects must describe the training materials that the project will develop as well as identify
existing training materials that the project will use.

<TEXT>
 

Applicants must establish a timetable for beginning training activities and demonstrate that key staff and facilities
will be available in order to achieve a comprehensive nationwide program within the period of the project. 
The training project must consult with each of NIDRR's regional Disability and Business Technical Assistance Centers
(DBTACs) during the development of its schedule of training activities. To the maximum extent feasible, the training
project must conduct its training activities in collaboration with each of the DBTACs. 
The training project must develop two schedules of regional training activities. The first schedule of training
activities must be finalized and training must begin within six months after the award of the grant. The second schedule
must be finalized within eighteen months after the award of the grant. The training project must carry out its training
activities as equitably as possible across and within each region of the country. 
The training project must have a staff with expertise on the ADA and training, and carry out its training activities
using those staff persons. The training project must not rely primarily on subcontractors to carry out its training
activities. 
The training project must include individuals with disabilities or their family members or representatives to the
maximum extent possible in all phases of the project's activities. 
The training project must submit final drafts of the training materials it produces to NIDRR for review of their legal
sufficiency. The training project must submit monthly status reports on its training activities through NIDRR's
ADA Technical Assistance Coordination Contract to NIDRR. Each training project must submit its final report to the
National Rehabilitation Information Center clearinghouse. 
The training project must cooperate with other Federal agencies that provide technical assistance and training
on the ADA, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Architectural
and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (ATBCB). 


Priority 


Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) the Secretary proposes to give an absolute preference to applications that meet the following
priorities. The Secretary proposes to fund under this program only applications that meet these absolute priorities:



Proposed Priorities_Americans With Disabilities Act Training Projects 


Background 


Public Law 101-336, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which was enacted on July 26, 1990, prohibits
discrimination against individuals with disabilities in employment, public accommodations, transportation,
State and local government services, and telecommunications. In 1991 NIDRR established an ADA technical assistance
program made up of ten regional Disability and Business Technical Assistance Centers (DBTACs_previously, Disability
and Business Accommodation Centers), two national training projects, three materials development projects, and
an ADA technical assistance coordination contract. The two national training projects addressed the needs of persons
affiliated with independent living centers and peer and family networks. These training projects' which were awarded
for three years, will complete their activities in fiscal year (FY) 1994. 
For FY 1994 Congress provided NIDRR with additional funding which it directed be used ``for training activities related
to the implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act'' (1994 Senate Appropriations Committee Report, p.
207). In accordance with this congressional directive, NIDRR proposes to establish six new training projects that
will be supported by the additional funding that Congress provided as well as by existing NIDRR funds. The training
projects will enhance the capacity of those with rights and duties under the ADA to facilitate its implementation.

NIDRR has consulted with a range of relevant Federal agencies, including, but not limited to, DOJ, EEOC, the Architectural
and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (ATBCB), the Department of Transportation, and the National Council
on Disability, as well as representatives from disability organizations, to develop responsive and meaningful
training projects that will complement the planned efforts of other public and private agencies. These priorities
were developed on the basis of these consultations and relevant information from NIDRR projects, including the ADA
technical assistance projects. NIDRR intends to continue to coordinate activities under this program with other
Federal agencies and with other public and private initiatives to implement the ADA. 


Proposed Priority 1: ADA Training for Independent Living Centers 


Background 


The more than 400 Independent Living Centers (ILCs) in the United States emphasize consumer control and peer services.
These ILCs have a strong incentive to promote the successful implementation of the ADA. ILCs serve as resources not
only to persons with disabilities in their communities, but also to individuals and entities with responsibilities
under the Act. 
Preliminary results from a survey conducted by the Independent Living Research Utilization Program (ILRU) of persons
associated with ILCs from around the country indicate that knowledge concerning specific sections of the ADA is not
high, even among persons who have a direct interest in effective ADA implementation. Initial analysis of these data
suggests that a lack of training opportunities and high-turnover among the staff who are trained are factors in the
current level of knowledge of persons associated with ILCs. 
Some ILCs have had opportunities to participate in ADA training activities sponsored by Federal agencies, and many
ILCs have developed into sophisticated community resources on the ADA. Training projects for the ILCs have generally
taken the form of an ILC sending a representative to attend an intensive ADA training session over a number of days.
This approach has some limitations in terms of impact due to the high turnover of ILC staff and multiple or shifting
work responsibilities in the ILC. 
Other ILCs, due in large part to their size or location, have not had ADA training opportunities sponsored by Federal
agencies. This group of ILCs is the primary target audience for this training project. The secondary target group
for the training project is composed of those ILCs who have lost their ADA-trained staff person. The project is intended
to enable both of these groups of ILCs to become experts on the ADA so that their staff, associates and volunteers can
answer technical questions, advise individuals on their rights or responsibilities, make referrals, increase
awareness of the ADA in their community, and conduct ADA training activities for covered entities in their community.

Proposed Priority 

An ADA training project for ILCs shall_

 Identify and select for training, ILCs that have either not received training from a NIDRR, EEOC, or DOJ ADA
project, or lost their staff representative who was trained by a NIDRR, EEOC, or DOJ project;

 Develop a strategy and schedule for training as many of these ILCs as possible using a variety of approaches,
including, but not limited to, on-site training, regional, State, and local meetings, teleconferences, and audioconferences;

 Utilizing existing federally-approved materials to the maximum extent appropriate, develop an array of
training materials and activities that vary in length and content in order to accommodate the information and scheduling
needs of selected organizations; 
 Provide training to staff, associates, and volunteers from each selected ILC in order to enable them to answer
technical questions on the ADA, advise individuals or entities on their rights or responsibilities, make referrals,
increase awareness of the ADA in their community, and conduct ADA training activities for covered entities in their
community; 
 To the maximum extent possible, utilize as trainers those individuals with disabilities who are from the same
approximate area of the country as the selected ILC and who have been trained as trainers on the ADA by a NIDRR, EEOC,
or DOJ technical assistance or training project; and 
 For the length of the project, provide selected ILCs with quarterly ADA information updates, before and after
training, regarding legal and policy developments. 


Proposed Priority 2: ADA Training for Family Organizations 


Background 

The National Rehabilitation Information Center (NARIC) publishes a National Directory of Information Sources
on Disability that includes information on organizations serving the disability community. According to the NARIC
staff who are updating this directory, there are a minimum of 411 organizations providing information or direct services
to persons with disabilities and their families. These organizations disseminate information through national,
State, and local conferences, as well as publications such as newsletters and brochures. They also provide training,
using a variety of means and settings, to their professional staff as well as to their membership. According to representatives
of disability organizations, the extent to which national disability organizations, as well as their State and local
affiliate organizations, have provided training or information to their members about the ADA varies according
to the primary mission of the organization (e.g., provision of services or advocacy), resources available to the
organization, and the interest of the membership and its leaders. As a result, knowledge about the ADA among these
organizations can vary widely from one organization to another as well as from one affiliate to another within the
same organization. The purpose of this proposed priority is to provide training on the ADA to persons who are members
or staff of disability organizations that provide services and information primarily to persons with disabilities
and their families by utilizing the existing training and information systems of these organizations. 


Proposed Priority 


An ADA training project for family organizations shall_

 Placing special emphasis on those organizations that have had limited access to ADA training and information,
identify and select for training a range of disability organizations that provide services and information primarily
to persons with disabilities and their families, including those organizations focused on developmental, cognitive,
emotional, physical, or sensory disabilities; 
 Develop a strategy and schedule for training the membership and staff of these organizations using a variety
of approaches including, but not limited to, on-site training, regional, State, and local meetings, teleconferences,
and audioconferences; 
 Utilizing existing Federally approved materials to the maximum extent appropriate, develop an array of training
materials and activities that vary in length and content in order to accommodate the information and scheduling needs
of selected organizations; 
 Provide training to the membership and staff of selected organizations on the provisions of the ADA and the
resources available to them to facilitate the implementation of the ADA; 
 To the maximum extent possible, utilize as trainers those individuals with disabilities who have been trained
as trainers on the ADA by a NIDRR, EEOC, or DOJ technical assistance or training project; and 
 For the length of the project, provide selected organizations with quarterly ADA information updates, before
and after training, regarding legal and policy developments.

Proposed Priority 3: ADA Training for School Districts 

Background 

There are 15,173 regular school districts in the United States according to the U.S. Department of Education National
Center for Education Statistics (1993 Digest of Education Statistics in the United States). These school districts
are covered under Title II of the ADA. Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in all
services, programs, and activities of State and local governments. The Office for Civil Rights within the U.S. Department
of Education (OCR/ED) has been designated to enforce Title II in public elementary and secondary educational systems
and institutions, public institutions of higher education and vocational education (other than schools of medicine,
dentistry, nursing, and other health-related schools) and public libraries. Title II covers three major categories
of programs or activities: Employment; activities involving general public contact as part of an entity's ongoing
operation (e.g., telephone contacts, office walk-ins, interviews, and public use of the facilities); and activities
or programs directly administered by the entity for program beneficiaries and participants (e.g., programs that
provide State or local government services or benefits). School districts that have received Federal funds have
been covered by section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act since 1973. Title II is patterned after section 504, and many
school districts need information and training to understand not only their responsibilities under the ADA, but
also the relationship of section 504 to the ADA. OCR/ED and NIDRR have cooperated to produce a self-evaluation guide
for school districts that includes information addressing the relationship between section 504 and the ADA. One
of the primary purposes of this training project will be to assist school districts to conduct their self-evaluations
with this new self-evaluation guide and implement their plans to comply with the ADA. As part of this process, the project
will enable trainees to understand not only their responsibilities under the ADA, but also the relationship of section
504 to the ADA. The project will place special emphasis on school districts where a majority of the students are from
minority background because of their limited access to outside training opportunities. The project will train selected
educational organizations whose membership have responsibility for complying with the ADA in school districts
(e.g., superintendents, principals, special education directors, school boards, etc.), as well as selected individual
school district's staffs. 

Proposed Priority 

An ADA training project for school districts shall_

 Placing special emphasis on school districts where a majority of the students are from minority background,
identify and select for direct training a range of school districts, equitably distributed throughout the country,
including those from urban, rural, and suburban areas; 
 Identify and select for training the membership and staff of educational organizations whose members have
responsibility for complying with the ADA in school districts; 
 Develop a strategy and a schedule for directly training school districts as well as the membership and staff
of selected organizations using a variety of approaches including, but not limited to, on-site training, regional,
State, and local meetings, teleconferences, and audioconferences; 
 Utilizing the OCR/ED self-evaluation guide and other existing federally-approved materials to the maximum
extent appropriate, develop an array of training materials and activities that vary in length and content in order
to accommodate the information and scheduling needs of selected school districts and organizations; 
 Provide training to selected school districts and organizations on updating or conducting self-evaluations
using the new guide, understanding the responsibilities of school districts under the ADA, on implementing changes
to comply with the ADA, and on the resources available to them to facilitate the implementation of the ADA; 
 To the maximum extent possible, utilize as trainers those individuals with disabilities who have been trained
as trainers on the ADA by NIDRR, EEOC, or DOJ technical assistance or training project;

updates, before and after training, regarding legal and policy developments; and 
 Coordinate training activities with the regional offices of OCR/ED. 


Proposed Priority 4: ADA Training for State and Local ADA Coordinators and Policymakers 


Background 

Governors, mayors, city managers, city planners, county boards, agency directors, and other State and local government
officials bear responsibility for ensuring compliance with Title II of the ADA. In addition  35.107 of the ADA
regulations (28 CFR part 35) requires that a public entity that employs 50 or more persons shall designate at least
one employee to coordinate its efforts to comply with the ADA, including investigation of any complaint alleging
its noncompliance or alleging any prohibited actions. Such persons are frequently identified as ``ADA Coordinators''
by State or local governments. According to the most recent (1987) report of the U.S. Census Bureau, there are approximately
7,665 counties, municipalities, and townships that have 50 or more full-time employees. 
Title II requires public entities to evaluate their current services, policies, and practices to identify and correct
any that are not consistent with the requirements of Title II. State and local ADA Coordinators and government policymakers
are responsible for ensuring that the self-evaluations are carried out. To ensure that these self-evaluations are
appropriately carried out and the necessary changes made, State and local ADA Coordinators and government policymakers
need information and training about the requirements of the ADA and policy developments in the field. 


Proposed Priority 

An ADA training project for State and local ADA coordinators and policymakers shall_

 Identify and select for direct training State and local ADA coordinators and government policymakers from
every Federal Region of the country, including those from urban, rural, and suburban areas, and ensuring the broad
representation of local governments where a majority of the citizens are from minority backgrounds; 
 Identify and select for training organizations whose members are policymakers in State and local government
with responsibilities for complying with the ADA; 
 Develop a strategy and a schedule for directly training State and local ADA coordinators and policymakers
as well as the membership and staff of selected organizations using a variety of approaches including, but not limited
to, on-site training, regional, State, and local meetings, teleconferences, and audioconferences; 
 Utilizing existing federally-approved materials to the maximum extent appropriate, develop an array of
training materials and activities that vary in length and content in order to accommodate the information and scheduling
needs of selected coordinators and organizations; 
 Provide training to selected State and local ADA coordinators, policymakers and members of organizations
on the responsibilities of State and local governments under Title II of the ADA and in order to assist State and local
governments to undertake their self-evaluation plans and make the changes needed to comply with the ADA; 
 To the maximum extent possible, utilize as trainers those individuals with disabilities who have been trained
as trainers by a NIDRR, EEOC, or DOJ technical assistance or training project; 
 For the length of the project provide selected coordinators, policymakers and organizations with quarterly
ADA information updates, before and after training, regarding legal and policy developments. 


Proposed Priority 5: ADA Training for Hispanics With Rights and Duties Under the ADA Whose Proficiency in English
Is Limited 


Background 

The Hispanic population in the U.S. totals approximately 22 million people, or 9.0 percent of the population. By the
year 2010, the Hispanic population is expected to become the second-largest racial/ethnic group (National Council
of La Raza Census Information Center, Hispanic Population Factsheet, November 1993).

There are approximately 3,343,000 persons of Hispanic origin with a disability. In other words, one out of every fifteen
Americans with a disability is Hispanic (McNeil, Americans with Disabilities: 1991-1992, Current Population
Reports, U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1993). In 1990, 17.4 million persons reported that they spoke Spanish at home.
Of these persons, 8.3 million persons, or 50.8 percent, reported that they do not speak English ``very well'' (U.S.
Census Bureau, Language Spoken at Home and Ability to Speak English for U.S. Regions and States, 1993). Hispanics
with disabilities whose proficiency in English is limited, as well as Hispanic business owners and service providers
whose proficiency in English is limited, need to understand the requirements of the ADA. Federal agencies have made
a number of their ADA publications available in Spanish, and NIDRR has piloted an effort with its Region 6 Southwest
DBTAC to provide training and technical assistance to persons in the Spanish-speaking community. This pilot project
has included the publication of additional documents in Spanish as well as efforts to provide popular Hispanic media
with information about the ADA that is sensitive to cultural norms regarding disability. While these efforts have
made certain ADA materials and technical assistance available to persons whose proficiency in English is limited,
more needs to be done. Reaching a target population that is broadly dispersed and as diverse as Hispanics whose proficiency
in English is limited is particularly challenging. The Hispanic population includes people from different cultural
backgrounds and different countries and regions of the world, such as Mexico (63.6 percent), Puerto Rico (10.6 percent),
Cuba (4.7 percent), and Central and South America (14.0 percent) (National Council of La Raza Census Information
Center, Hispanic Population Factsheet, November 1993). For the purposes of this priority, ``Hispanics whose proficiency
in English is limited'' includes all persons from those countries and regions listed above who do not speak English
very well, if at all. In order to reach as wide an audience as possible a training project must collaborate with Hispanic
organizations that currently provide training and information to their members. It must also utilize TV, radio,
and print media that are popular in the targeted Hispanic community. Applicants for this project must demonstrate
Spanish fluency, knowledge, cultural understanding, and experience in providing training and technical assistance
to Hispanic organizations and individuals. Applicants must also include a substantial number of Hispanic individuals
with disabilities in all phases of the project's activities. 


Proposed Priority


An ADA training project for Hispanics with right or duties under the ADA whose proficiency in English is limited shall_

 Identify and select for training organizations that provide services and information to Hispanics with rights
and duties under the ADA whose proficiency in English is limited; 
 Develop a strategy and a schedule for training the membership and staff of selected organizations using a variety
of approaches including, but not limited to, on-site training, regional, State, and local meetings, teleconferences,
and audioconferences; 
 Utilizing existing federally-approved materials to the maximum extent appropriate, develop an array of
training materials and activities that vary in length and content in order to accommodate the information and scheduling
needs of selected organizations; 
 Provide training to the membership and staff of selected organizations on the provisions of the ADA and the
resources available to them to facilitate the implementation of the ADA; 
 To the maximum extent possible, utilize as trainers those individuals with disabilities who have been trained
as trainers on the ADA by a NIDRR, EEOC, or DOJ technical assistance or training project; 
 For the length of the project, provide selected organizations with quarterly ADA information updates, before
and after training, regarding legal and policy developments; and 
 Provide information about the ADA and technical assistance resources in areas with high concentrations of
persons who are Spanish-speaking utilizing popular mass media such as local Hispanic TV and radio programming as
well as Spanish print media.

Proposed Priority 6: ADA Training on Standards for Accessible Design 

Background


Titles II and III of the ADA require that new governmental and commercial facilities be built in an accessible manner
and require that, when existing governmental or commercial facilities are renovated or otherwise altered, the alterations
be made in an accessible manner. In their regulations implementing Titles II and III of the ADA, the U.S. Department
of Justice (DOJ) and the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) adopted Standards for Accessible Design for purposes
of enforcing the ADA's non- discrimination requirements in the built environment. For commercial facilities and
public transportation facilities, they adopted the ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities
(ADAAG), developed by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board. For government facilities
other than transportation facilities covered by DOT, DOJ currently permits the use of either the Uniform Federal
Accessibility Standards or ADAAG as the ``Standards for Accessible Design.'' These Standards must be followed in
new construction and alteration projects. They also serve as a guide for public accommodations undertaking to remove
barriers in inaccessible existing facilities, as required under Title III. These Standards are complex and made
up of scoping and technical provisions that contain many discrete requirements and necessitate referencing other
technical provisions in order to make an element or space accessible. NIDRR proposes a project to develop a series
of audio/visual and complementary training materials on the Standards for Accessible Design that can be used across
the country at the local level. Local organizations whose members include persons with disabilities, business owners,
building managers, employers, government agency officials, city planners, architects, designers, or other relevant
parties need access to reliable materials that explain the ADA Standards. NIDRR proposes to develop this series of
materials in short discrete segments that could be used in meetings normally scheduled by professional or business
organizations such as local chapters of the American Institute of Architects, local Chambers of Commerce, and other
groups. These materials could also be used by the DBTACs in carrying out ADA training activities. Grant applicants
must be able to demonstrate knowledge, understanding, and experience in the following areas: in-depth knowledge
of the ADA Standards for Accessible Design; thorough understanding of the rationale(s) underlying the Standards;
understanding of the ways in which persons with disabilities use, or are unable to use, the built environment; experience
in the development and dissemination of educational videos; and experience in using innovative and engaging video
techniques such as animation and fade-ins or transformations from actual scenes to diagrammatic or conceptual material.
Samples of an applicant's recent relevant work, including the use of animation or other innovative video techniques
and the development of training materials related to the ADA Standards or training materials on accessible design,
must be submitted with the grant application. Based on the estimated size of the award that will be published in the
notice inviting applications, applicants may propose to cover some, but not all of the topics. Grant applicants must
propose an order of production of the videos and identify the topics that will be addressed in each video. Applicants
must justify their order of production, based on the importance of the topic. Applicants must propose to group topics
on each of the videos and explain the rationale for the groupings. 

Proposed Priority 

An ADA training project on the ADA Standards for Accessible Design shall_

 Develop, test, and disseminate a series of short, broadcast quality videos and complementary training materials
that address the technical and scoping requirements of the ADA Standards for Accessible Design. These materials
shall cover 

as many of the following topics as possible

 (emphasis added) as set out in the current Standards as well as new provisions that will be adopted: New construction;
additions, alterations, and path of travel; historic buildings; parking and passenger loading zones; exterior
accessible routes and curb ramps; drinking fountains; telephones and TDDs; ramps and stairs; platform lifts; entrances
and exits (areas of rescue assistance); doors and gates; building lobbies and corridors (interior accessible routes);
elevators; rooms and spaces; assembly areas; toilet rooms and bathrooms; bathtubs and showers; dressing and fitting
rooms; signage; alarms; detectable warnings; automated teller machines; restaurants and cafeterias; medical
care facilities; mercantile facilities; libraries; hotels, motels, inns, boarding houses, dormitories, and similar
places; homeless shelters, halfway houses, transient group homes, and similar social services establishments;
bus stops; fixed transportation facilities, bus and train terminals and stations; and airports. The project shall
address the requirements of the standards from a Universal Design perspective;  The videos shall illustrate
how people with disabilities use the built environment and the rationale(s) that underlie specific technical and
scoping provisions of the Standards and how discrete provisions in the Standards fit together with each other to ensure
accessibility:  Use innovative techniques, including animation, fade-ins or transformations to transition
from footage showing a person using a space or element to footage showing design layouts and diagrams from the Standards
relevant to that kind of space or element;  Utilizing, as much as possible, materials that have been developed
by Federal agencies, develop readily reproducible complementary training materials in conjunction with each video
to supplement the video materials and to provide guidance on using the videos effectively;  Identify organizations
whose members include persons with disabilities, business owners, building managers, employers, government agency
officials, city planners, architects, designers, and other relevant parties who would be an appropriate audience
for the videos;  Develop and implement a plan to disseminate the videos and complementary training materials
to selected organizations; 

 Produce the first video and complementary training material of the series within six months of the grant award;
 Coordinate with the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation in the development and dissemination
of the videos and complementary training materials;  Ensure that the training videos and complementary training
material are available in formats that accommodate persons with hearing impairments and vision impairments;  Provide
four one-inch NCSC standard fully mixed and open captioned edited master video tapes, including two master tapes
and two safety dub tapes suitable for duplication, and four copies on VHS cassettes of each videotape produced, along
with four reproducible copies of each set of complementary training materials to NIDRR for use by the Federal government.

Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for Waste Management at the Savannah River Site


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Energy.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy (DOE) announces its intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for waste
management at the Savannah River Site, and to conduct a public scoping process pursuant to the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).


The purpose of the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS is to provide a basis for DOE to select a sitewide strategic
approach to managing present and future Savannah River Site waste generated as a result of ongoing operations, environmental
restoration activities, transition from nuclear production to other missions, and decontamination and decommissioning
programs. This EIS will support project-level decisions on the operation of specific treatment, storage, and disposal
facilities within the near term (10 years and less). In addition, this EIS will provide a baseline for analyses of future
waste management activities and a basis for the evaluation of the specific waste management alternatives. The preparation
of the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS will be in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act,
the Council on Environmental Quality National Environmental Policy Act Regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508),
and the DOE National Environmental Policy Act Regulations (10 CFR part 1021). Background information on the Savannah
River Site and issues proposed to be considered in this EIS are presented in the Supplementary Information below.
DOE is also announcing today its intent to prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement on the Defense Waste
Processing Facility at the Savannah River Site. (See the notice in this issue of the 

Federal Register

.)
DOE invites individuals, organizations, and agencies to comment on issues to be considered, alternatives to be analyzed,
and environmental impacts to be addressed in the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS. Written and oral comments
will be given equal weight. Written comments should be directed to Stephen R. Wright at the address below. Oral comments
may be presented by voice mail at the telephone number below. Interested parties are invited to present comments at
three public scoping meetings to be held at the dates and places indicated below. Additional notice will be given in
appropriate local media. At the scoping meetings and informal information sessions to be held one month earlier,
DOE also will provide the public with an opportunity to have information discussions with DOE representatives regarding
waste management at the Savannah River Site. The scoping process and procedures are described in the Supplementary
Information below.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 


The Savannah River Site occupies approximately 300 square miles adjacent to the Savannah River, principally in Aiken
and Barnwell Counties of South Carolina, approximately 25 miles southeast of Augusta, Georgia, and 20 miles south
of Aiken, South Carolina. Since its establishment, the mission of the Savannah River Site has been to produce nuclear
materials that support the defense, research, and medical programs of the United States. The Savannah River Site
production process facilities include fuel and target fabrication facilities, nuclear production reactors, separation
facilities, product preparation facilities, and waste management facilities. These facilities have generated
a variety of low-level radioactive, high-level radioactive, hazardous, mixed (hazardous and radioactive), and
transuranic wastes. 
 
At present, the Savannah River Site is in transition to other missions; the new missions include an increased emphasis
on waste management, environmental restoration, and decontamination and decommissioning. DOE is examining its
current integrated waste management program and the suitability of existing and planned facilities in light of these
recent mission changes. 
 
Two DOE-wide programmatic environmental impact statements, one for Environmental Restoration and Waste Management
(Notice of Intent published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 22, 1990; 55 FR 42693) and one for Reconfiguration of the Weapons Complex (Notice of Intent published in
the Federal Register on February 11, 1991; 56 FR 5590), may result in decisions to transfer certain waste management
activities to or from the Savannah River Site. The alternatives for the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS will
be coordinated with the alternatives for the Programmatic EISs. The alternatives for the Savannah River Site Waste
Management EIS will also bound the range of waste management activities resulting from the Federal Facility Compliance
Act Site Treatment Plan now under development. The Site Treatment Plan will describe the development of treatment
capacities and technologies for mixed (a combination of radioactive and hazardous) wastes. 
 
DOE prepared an Environmental Assessment and issued a subsequent Finding of No Significant Impact on the Consolidated
Incineration Facility in 1992. In response to a public request, DOE took a ``fresh look'' into the suitability of constructing
and operating the Consolidated Incineration Facility. DOE decided that while completing construction, DOE would
propose to include the operation of the Consolidated Incineration Facility within the scope of the Savannah River
Site Waste Management EIS. Under the proposed action, the Consolidated Incineration Facility would be the preferred
facility for the treatment of only those wastes for which under Environmental Protection Agency regulations incineration
is the specified technology or Best Demonstrated Available Technology. The proposed action also will evaluate incineration
and other treatment alternatives for wastes where incineration is not the specified technology or Best Demonstrated
Available Technology. In addition, the proposed action will include the incineration of low-level radioactive
waste for volume reduction and the EIS will consider other volume reduction and treatment alternatives. DOE will
not conduct any trial burns at the Consolidated Incineration Facility until DOE completes this EIS and issues a Record
of Decision. 
 
In 1982, DOE published an EIS and a Record of Decision for the design, construction, and operation of the Defense Waste
Processing Facility, which would immobilize liquid high-level radioactive waste in glass (vitrification). The
vitrified waste would then be encapsulated in stainless steel canisters and stored onsite until a geologic repository
is available for final disposal. DOE then modified the Defense Waste Processing Facility to improve facility efficiency
and safety. A Supplement Analysis was prepared to determine whether modifications as of 1990, primarily the introduction
of the In-Tank Precipitation process and manufacture and disposal of saltstone, required the preparation of a supplement
to the Defense Waste Processing Facility EIS. On the basis of the Supplement Analysis, DOE concluded in 1991 that a
Supplemental EIS was not needed.

Further modifications to the Defense Waste Processing Facility system have now been proposed and are in various stages
of implementation, including process safety enhancement and a Late-Wash Facility. In view of the accumulated changes
and the near-term (estimated 1996) initial operation of the facility, DOE believes that a focused EIS-level review
of the environmental impacts of the facility as now envisioned would be timely and appropriate.

DOE proposes to perform the Defense Waste Processing Facility review in a supplement to the 1982 EIS for the Defense
Waste Processing Facility. Although the analysis could be included in the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS,
DOE believes public review and DOE's decision making process would be facilitated by preparing a separate document
because the Defense Waste Processing Facility is a very specialized operation with limited connections to the activities
to be covered in the Waste Management EIS. Where there are interconnections, duplicate discussions within both documents
may be required or the documents may cross reference one another.
Activities at the Defense Waste Processing Facility have proceeded on the basis of the 1982 EIS and Record of Decision.
Construction of the Defense Waste Processing Facility is almost complete, testing of the system with cold chemicals
has begun and processing runs of simulated (non-radioactive) material will begin in the next few months. DOE committed
in an agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency and the state of South Carolina to adhere to a schedule that
provides for radionuclide testing at the Defense Waste Processing Facility to begin in December, 1995. In order to
support that schedule and to manage efficiently the high level radioactive wastes contained in the tank farms, in-tank
precipitation must begin in late 1994 or early 1995. A supplemental EIS focussing on the changes to the Defense Waste
Processing Facility can be completed in time to meet this schedule, while the Waste Management EIS is expected to take
several more months to prepare. These two EISs will be closely coordinated. Delay of start-up for the Defense Waste
Processing Facility would cost approximately $21,000,000 per month.
The Supplemental EIS will examine all reasonably foreseeable impacts of operating the Defense Waste Processing
Facility, including alternative methods of managing the waste streams from the facility. DOE believes that this
will provide sufficient information to decide whether to proceed with operation of the facility in advance of completion
of the Savannah River Waste Management EIS.
The proposed scope for the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS does not include management of spent nuclear fuel
and other materials that have historically been the feed materials for Savannah River Site materials production
and reprocessing programs. Such nuclear materials are being addressed in several National Environmental Policy
Act documents under preparation by DOE: (1) The Programmatic EIS for Spent Nuclear Fuel Management will include,
among other issues, a programmatic analysis of the transportation, receipt, processing, and storage of spent nuclear
fuel at DOE sites, including the Savannah River Site; (2) the Environmental Assessment for Urgent Relief Acceptance
of Foreign Research Reactor Nuclear Spent Fuel and a subsequent broader scope EIS (Notice of Intent published October
21, 1993; 58 FR 54336) will analyze the proposed adoption and implementation of a policy for the acceptance of as many
as 15,000 spent nuclear fuel elements from foreign research reactors; and (3) the EIS for the Interim Management of
Nuclear Materials at the Savannah River Site (Notice of Intent published March 17, 1994; 59 FR 12588), will evaluate
and determine materials that can safely remain in their current form for an interim period (approximately five years)
until disposition decisions can be made and materials that require near-term stabilization to help maintain the
health and safety of workers and the public and to maintain environmental quality. In addition, DOE will also evaluate
converting some material into a useable form.


Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Programmatic EIS


The Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS will be prepared at the same time as, and in close coordination with, the
DOE Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Programmitic EIS, which will address DOE complex-wide issues
and alternatives for environmental restoration and waste management policies and practices. Alternatives under
that Programmatic EIS will include decentralization, regionalization, and centralization of waste management
functions.
The alternatives analysis in the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS will be consistent with the DOE complex-wide
policies and practices that will be analyzed in the Programmatic EIS. The Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS
will be supplemented, as necessary, to maintain consistency with decisions reached on broader programmatic issues.

Site Treatment Plan




The Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS will also be coordinated with the development of the Savannah River Site
Treatment Plan that DOE is preparing in compliance with the Federal Facility Compliance Act of 1992. The Conceptual
Site Treatment Plan issued in October 1993 identifies waste treatment needs, capabilities, and options for Savannah
River Site mixed waste. The Draft Site Treatment Plan scheduled to be issued in August 1994 will identify DOE's preferred
options for treating the Savannah River Site mixed wastes and proposed schedules for constructing treatment capacity.
The preferred options will correspond to the proposed action in the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS.



Waste Types To Be Addressed in the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS




Solid low-level radioactive waste forms include operating and laboratory wastes (for example protective clothing,
plastic sheeting, gloves, analytical wastes, decontamination residues), contaminated equipment, reactor and
reactor fuel hardware, spent lithium-aluminum targets from which tritium has been extracted, and spent deionizer
resin from reactor areas. The Analytical Laboratories, Reactor Materials, Reactors, Separations, Savannah River
Technology Center, Tritium facilities, and waste management and environmental restoration activities generate
the Savannah River Site low-level radioactive waste.


High-level radioactive waste includes the highly radioactive material resulting from the reprocessing of spent
nuclear fuel, including the liquid waste that contains fission products in sufficient concentrations. In the production
of nuclear materials, DOE used the F- and H-Area chemical separations plants to separate and purify plutonium-238
and -239 produced in Savannah River Site reactors and to reclaim fissionable material (uranium-235) from onsite
and offsite sources (e.g., research reactor fuel and material from disassembled retired weapons) for recycling.
These processes dissolved target elements in nitric acid and separated them into (1) a solution of plutonium, uranium,
and neptunium, and (2) liquid high-level radioactive waste. Further processing separated and purified the metals
in solution, and converted the plutonium to solid form for shipment and the other materials for storage or reuse. The
liquid high-level radioactive waste is stored in steel tanks in the F- and H-Area Tank Farms.


Hazardous waste and mixed waste include materials such as lead, solvents, paints, tritiated mercury, tritiated
oil contaminated with mercury, other mercury-contaminated materials and equipment from the tritium facilities
in H-Area, filter paper takeup rolls from the Liquid Effluent Treatment Facility, cadmium-plated high-efficiency
particulate air filters, and contaminated soils. The Analytical Laboratories, Reactor materials, Reactors, and
Separations facilities and waste management and environmental restoration activities generate the Savannah River
Site hazardous and mixed waste.


Transuranic wastes include job control wastes (e.g., paper, wipes, cloth, rags, tools, instruments), sludges,
resins, filters, and various other miscellaneous wastes. Transuranic waste contains radioactive isotopes with
atomic numbers greater than 92 and half-lives longer than 20 years at concentrations exceeding 100 nanocuries per
gram. Savannah River Site also manages low-level radioactive waste with transuranic radionuclides at concentration
of 10 to 100 nanocuries per gram in a manner similar to transuranic waste. The Savannah River Technology Center, F-Area
laboratories, and F- and H-Area separations facilities generate the Savannah River Site transuranic waste.



Preliminary Description of Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS Alternatives



(1) The ``No-Action'' Alternative




DOE will analyze a no-action alternative that would assume continued waste generation and current waste management
practices. DOE would continue ongoing activities and implement planned actions, including high-level radioactive
waste management, for which National Environmental Policy Act review has been completed and decisions made. Further,
decisions reached through ongoing National Environmental Policy Act reviews that are completed before the issuance
of a Record of Decision for this EIS will be incorporated into the no-action alternative. Although the no-action alternative
may not be a reasonable alternative in all respects, its analysis will establish a baseline for comparison of the environment
impacts of the proposed action and its alternatives.


DOE would continue waste management practices that are now in effect, including packaging and disposal of low-level
radioactive waste in the Solid Waste Disposal Facility, storage of liquid high-level radioactive waste in the F-
and H-Area Tank Farm, disposal of salt solution at the Saltstone Facility, preparation for vitrification in the Defense
Waste Processing Facility, storage of liquid high-level radioactive waste in the F- and H-Area Tank Farm, disposal
of salt solution at the Saltstone Facility, preparation for vitrification in the Defense Waste Processing Facility,
storage of hazardous waste in hazardous waste storage buildings and the solid waste storage pads, and continued storage
of mixed waste. Drums of transuranic waste on mounded pads would be retrieved, overpacked, and stored with existing
transuranic waste drums on concrete pads; DOE would leave undisturbed the transuranic waste that is in stored in below-grade
culverts or in culverts on mounded pads.


Also included as part of the no-action alternative are operation of the already-constructed Solid Waste Disposal
Facility Expansion Vaults for disposal of low-level radioactive waste (E-Area) and continued construction, but
not operation, of the Consolidated Incineration Facility.



(2) The Proposed Action Alternative




The proposed action is comprised of the no-action alternative activities plus programmatic and project-level actions
to enhance waste management operations over the next 10 years, comply with regulatory requirements, protect human
health and the environment, and support Savannah River Site missions. Project specific National Environmental
Policy Act review that supplements this EIS might be required to reach final decisions on some of these activities.


DOE will consider various combinations of pollution prevention, waste minimization, treatment, storage and disposal
technologies, with pollution prevention and waste minimization as the highest priority. For each waste type, DOE
will identify the optimal mix of technologies for the protection of human health and the environment, cost-effectiveness,
and waste minimization. DOE will identify the preferred strategy for each waste type that will contain the optimum
approaches developed for specific individual waste streams at the Savannah River Site. Any potential shipments
to or from the Savannah River Site of DOE weapons complex waste and establishment of onsite waste treatment capabilities
would be examined in a manner that is consistent with the Site Treatment Plan for mixed waste and the two DOE-wide Programmatic
EISs.


Programmatic considerations regarding the Site Treatment Plan, land use planning, technology development, and
pollution prevention would be included in the proposed action alternative. DOE will ensure that these strategies
are consistent with those identified in the Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Programmatic EIS. Although
specific environmental restoration and decontamination and decommissioning activities would be subject to separate
National Environmental Policy Act review, as appropriate, DOE will provide its best current estimate of waste streams
anticipated from the environmental restoration of existing waste sites and the decontamination and decommissioning
of surplus facilities. Similarly, DOE will base the proposed action on this best current estimate of waste streams
that might be received from offsite under decisions resulting from the Environmental Restoration and Waste Management
and Reconfiguration Programmatic EISs and the Federal Facility Compliance Act/Site Treatment Plan process.

Low-Level Radioactive Waste



DOE proposes to reduce the volume of solid nonhazardous low-level radioactive waste. DOE would package the low-level
radioactive waste in accordance with the Waste Acceptance Criteria established for the Solid Waste Disposal Facility
(E-Area) Expansion Vaults (operation of the E-Area vaults is based on completed National Environmental Policy Act
reviews and is included in the no-action alternative). As part of the proposed action alternative, volume reduction
technology(ies) would replace existing Savannah River Site compactors, which are reaching the end of their useful
lives. The immediate requirement is to process contact-handled waste; the proposed facility(ies) would have limited
capability to volume-reduce equipment. Subsequently, DOE would develop the capability to volume-reduce remotely
handled waste. DOE would also develop treatment capabilities for liquid low-level radioactive waste (e.g., tritiated
oil).




Liquid High-Level Radioactive Waste



The management of liquid high-level radioactive waste including storage in the F- and H-Area Tank Farm, disposal
of salt solution at the Saltstone Facility, and preparation for vitrification in the Defense Waste Processing Facility
is the same for the proposed action as for the no-action alternative. The examination of the potential environmental
impacts of operating the Defense Waste Processing Facility and associated high-level radioactive waste facilities
at the Savannah River Site as they are presently designed will be done in the Defense Waste Processing Facility Supplemental
EIS. The cumulative impacts of liquid high-level radioactive waste management, including the results from the Defense
Waste Processing Facility Supplemental EIS, will be incorporated into the Savannah River Site Waste Management
EIS.




Hazardous Waste/Mixed Waste



The Draft Site Treatment Plan will consider the Consolidated Incineration Facility a ``planned'' facility for mixed
waste treatment. As part of the proposed action, this EIS will consider other alternatives for waste for which incineration
has not been established as the Best Demonstrated Available Technology or specified technology, including potential
offsite options and commercialization, for incinerable Savannah River Site hazardous and mixed wastes. For example,
DOE could construct and operate a new facility permitted under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act at the Savannah
River Site to receive, handle, treat, and repackage hazardous and mixed waste. This facility could also provide size
reduction and repackaging of hazardous and mixed wastes in preparation for treatment at the Consolidated Incineration
Facility. The proposed treatment building would be able to handle waste that DOE could not treat elsewhere on the Savannah
River Site or send such waste offsite for treatment and disposal. DOE would also evaluate treatment options for non-incinerable
hazardous and mixed wastes.




Transuranic Waste



Under the proposed action, DOE would prepare both currently-stored and newly-generated transuranic waste for certification
and disposal at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant or for reclassification and disposal as low-level radioactive waste.
Facilities would be provided to sort, characterize, and repackage drums of low-activity (less than a total of 0.5
curie per 55-gallon drum) transuranic waste in preparation for direct shipment to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant
or for storage until treatment to a final waste form. Portions of these activities are included in the no-action alternative
because they are covered in the completed Environmental Assessment for Management Activities for Retrieved and
Newly Generated Transuranic Waste (DOE/EA-0315).

DOE would provide treatment, such as vitrification or stabilization, for retrievably stored transuranic wastes
with activity greater than 0.5 curie per container if required to meet future criteria of the Waste Isolation Pilot
Plant or another Federal repository. The proposed action would provide the capability to treat high-activity waste
drums, boxes, etc., for shipment to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant or another repository. DOE would design treatment
facilities when it has a better understanding of Waste Isolation Pilot Plant acceptance requirements for the transuranic
waste stream.



(3) The ``Minimum Treatment, Storage, and Disposal'' Alternative



The alternative represents a lower-bound of waste management activities at the Savannah River Site. The quantities
and characteristics of the waste would be based on reasonable lower-bound estimates of ongoing operations, onsite
environmental restoration and decontamination and decommissioning waste, and wastes that DOE might receive from
offsite as a result of Federal Facility Compliance Act, Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Programmatic
EIS, and Reconfiguration Programmatic EIS decisions. Also consistent with alternatives being considered in the
Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Programmatic EIS, certain quantities of waste in storage and newly
generated waste would be shipped offsite.



(4) The ``Maximum Treatment, Storage, and Disposal'' Alternative 

This alternative represents a condition where the Savannah River Site would manage more waste than that anticipated
under the proposed action. The quantities and characteristics of the waste would be based on reasonable upper-bound
estimates of ongoing operations, on site environmental restoration and decontamination and decommissioning waste,
and wastes that DOE might receive from offsite as a result of Federal Facility Compliance Act, Environmental Restoration
and Waste Management Programmatic EIS, and Reconfiguration Programmatic EIS decisions. Under this alternative,
DOE would augment its waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities at the Savannah River Site. This increase
will be described and analyzed in terms of an increment above the current and projected quantities used in the analysis
of the proposed action.



Identification of Environmental and Other Issues




DOE has identified the following issues to be addressed in the analysis of proposed and alternative actions in the
EIS. Additional issues may be identified as a result of the scoping process.

1. Public and worker safety and health risk assessment: radiological and nonradiological impacts of the proposed
action and alternatives, including projected effects on workers and the public from construction, normal operation,
and potential accidents.

2. Impacts from releases to air, water, and soil.

3. Impacts to plants, animals, and habitat, including impacts to wetlands, and threatened or endangered species
and their habitat.

4. The consumption of natural resources and energy including water, natural gas, and electricity.

5. Impacts of the transportation of construction and operation supplies, materials, equipment, products, and wastes
to, from, and within the site. 

6. Socioeconomic impacts to affected communities from construction and operation labor forces and support services.

7. Environmental Justice: disproportionately high or adverse human health and environmental effects on minority
and low-income populations.

8. Impacts to cultural resources such as historic, archaeological, scientific, or culturally important sites.

9. Accuracy of projected waste volumes.

10. Status of compliance with applicable Federal, state, and local statutes and regulations.

11. Cumulative impacts from the proposed action and other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions at the
Savannah River Site.

12. Potential irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources.

13. Pollution prevention, waste minimization, and potential mitigative measures.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Intent To Prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, for the Defense Waste Processing Facility,
at the Savannah River Site, Aiken, SC</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Energy.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Intent to Prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy (DOE) announces its intent to prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
and to conduct a public scoping process pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended
(42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

), to examine the environmental impacts of the modifications made to the Defense Waste Processing Facility and associated
high-level waste facilities at the Savannah River Site. The Supplemental EIS will supplement the Final Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) that DOE issued in 1982 (DOE/EIS-0082), and will evaluate whether and how to proceed
with the Defense Waste Processing Facility in light of the changes in processes and facilities that have occurred
since the 1982 EIS was issued. That EIS, its Record of Decision, and a subsequent Environmental Assessment, 

Waste Form Selection for Savannah River Plant High-Level Waste 

(DOE/EA-0179), supported the preferred alternative for the construction and operation of the Defense Waste
Processing Facility. The specific process and facility modifications that have been introduced or are being implemented
in the Defense Waste Processing Facility system since the Record of Decision are discussed in the Supplementary Information
section of this Notice of Intent. Background information on the Savannah River Site and issues proposed to be considered
in this Supplemental EIS are presented in the Supplementary Information below as well. 



DOE also is announcing today its intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for Waste Management at the Savannah
River Site. (See the notice in this issue of the 

Federal Register

.) 

DOE invites individuals, organizations, and agencies to comment on issues to be considered, alternatives to be analyzed,
and environmental impacts to be addressed in the Supplemental EIS. Written and oral comments will be given equal weight.
Written comments should be directed to Stephen R. Wright at the address below. Oral comments may be presented by voice
mail at the telephone number below. Interested parties are invited to present comments at three public scoping meetings
to be held at the dates and places indicated below. Additional notice will be given in appropriate media. At the scoping
meetings and at informal information sessions held one month earlier, DOE also will provide the public with an opportunity
to engage in informal discussions with DOE representatives regarding the Defense Waste Processing Facility. The
scoping process and procedures are described in the Supplementary Information below.

DOE will then conduct public scoping meetings to assist in defining the appropriate scope of the Defense Waste Processing
Facility Supplemental EIS and identifying significant environmental issues to be addressed. DOE representatives
will be available at the meetings to discuss, in informal conversations, the Defense Waste Processing Facility.
These meetings are scheduled at the following times and locations:




May 12, 1994; 1-4 and 6-9 p.m.; Coastal Georgia Center for Continuing Education, 305 Martin Luther King
Boulevard (Battlefield Park), Savannah, Georgia.

May 17, 1994; 1-4 and 6-9 p.m.; North Augusta Community Center, 495 Brookside Avenue, North Augusta, South
Carolina.

May 19, 1994; 1-4 and 6-9 p.m.; Holiday Inn Coliseum at the University of South Carolina, 630 Assembly Street,
Columbia, South Carolina.




Scoping meetings on the Interim Management of Nuclear Materials at the Savannah River Site EIS and the Savannah River
Site Waste Management EIS will be held at the same dates and locations. DOE will publish additional notices of the information
sessions and scoping meetings in the local media in advance of the scheduled dates. 




<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


The Savannah River Site occupies approximately 300 square miles adjacent to the Savannah River, primarily in Aiken
and Barnwell Counties in South Carolina. The Site is approximately 25 miles southeast of Augusta, Georgia, and 20
miles south of Aiken, South Carolina. Since its establishment, the mission of the Savannah River Site has been to produce
nuclear materials that support the defense, research, and medical programs of the United States. 

At present, the Savannah River Site is in transition to other missions, which include increased emphasis on waste
management, environmental restoration, and decontamination and decommissioning. With these mission changes
in mind, DOE is examining its integrated waste management program and the suitability of existing and planned facilities.
The Defense Waste Processing Facility is one of the vital components of the waste management program at Savannah River
Site. 

In 1982 DOE published an EIS and a Record of Decision documenting its decision to construct and operate the Defense
Waste Processing Facility, which would immobilize liquid high-level radioactive waste in glass (vitrification).
The vitrified waste would then be encapsulated in stainless steel canisters and stored onsite until a geologic repository
is available for final disposal. DOE then modified the Defense Waste Processing Facility to improve facility efficiency
and safety. A Supplement Analysis was prepared to determine whether modifications as of 1990, primarily the introduction
of the In-Tank Precipitation process and manufacture and disposal of saltstone, required the preparation of a supplement
to the Defense Waste Processing Facility EIS. On the basis of the Supplement Analysis, DOE concluded in 1991 that a
Supplemental EIS was not needed. 

Further modifications to the Defense Waste Processing Facility system have now been proposed and are in various stages
of implementation, including process safety enhancement and a Late Wash Facility. In view of the accumulated changes
and the near-term (estimated 1996) initial operation of the facility, DOE believes that a focused EIS-level review
of the environmental impacts of the facility as now envisioned would be timely and appropriate. 

The specific process and facility modifications that are being implemented in the Defense Waste Processing Facility
system since the Record of Decision include: 

In-Tank Precipitation_The original Defense Waste Processing Facility design used ion exchange to separate soluble
radionuclides from salt solution. Research and development efforts indicated that an in-tank precipitation process
would remove more than 99.9 percent of the radioactivity in salt solution. DOE has incorporated the In-Tank Precipitation
process as a replacement for ion exchange as a Defense Waste Processing Facility modification. 

Saltstone Manufacturing and Disposal_The process of salt solution disposal originally involved dewatering decontaminated
salt solution, mixing it with concrete to form ``saltcrete,'' and burying it in an engineered trench. The present
design would blend decontaminated salt solution from the in-tank precipitation process with a waste concentrate
stream from the F- and H-Area Effluent Treatment Facility, mix it with cement-flyash grout to form ``saltstone,''
and dispose of it in reinforced concrete vaults. 

Late-Wash Facility_This new facility would give precipitate slurry from the In-Tank Precipitation process a final
wash to reduce the concentration of nitrite and radiolysis products. The result would be the ability to process precipitate
in the Defense Waste Processing Facility vitrification process. 

Nitric Acid Introduction_This process would add nitric rather than formic acid to the sludge in the Sludge Receipt
and Adjustment Tank to bring nitrate concentrations to the desired levels. 

Hydrogen Modifications_These modifications to the ventilation system would provide additional dilution air to
components in the vitrification facility to mitigate the potential formation of hydrogen gas in flammable concentrations.
