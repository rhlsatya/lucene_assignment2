Milk in the New England and New York-New Jersey Marketing Areas; Termination of Certain Provisions of the Orders 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule terminates the seasonal production incentive plans for paying producers under the New England and New York-New
Jersey Federal milk orders. This termination was requested by cooperative associations that represent producers
who supply about one-half of the milk regulated under the orders. The seasonal incentive plans have been suspended
during each of the last three years and are no longer effective in carrying out their intended purpose.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Prior document in this proceeding: 



Notice of Proposed Termination or Suspension: Issued February 15, 1994; published February 24, 1994 (59 FR 8873).


The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule lessens
the regulatory impact of the orders on dairy farmers and will not affect milk handlers. 

The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have
a retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of
an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After
a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in
any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the
date of the entry of the ruling. 

This order of termination is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and of
the orders regulating the handling of milk in the New England and New York-New Jersey marketing areas. 

Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 24,1994 (59 FR 8873) concerning a proposed termination or suspension of certain provisions of the orders.
Interested persons were afforded opportunity to file written data, views and arguments. Comments supporting the
proposed termination were received from Dairylea Cooperative, Inc, and Agri-Mark, two of the cooperatives who proposed
termination. One comment was received from a dairy farmer who opposed termination. 

After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal in the notice, the comments received and other
available information, it is hereby found and determined that the following provisions of the orders do not tend to
effectuate the declared policy of the Act:




1. In  1001.62, paragraphs (c) and (d); and 
2. In  1002.61, paragraphs (d) and (e).

Statement of Consideration


This rule terminates the seasonal plans for paying producers under the New England and New York-New Jersey Federal
orders. These seasonal payment plans provide for making deductions from prices paid to producers during the normal
flush-production months of March through June and returning to producers the deducted amounts during the normal
short-production months of August through November. The plans are intended to provide an incentive for dairy farmers
to level out their production during the year.
The termination of the payment plans was requested by cooperative associations that represent dairy farmers who
supply handlers regulated under the orders. Collectively, these cooperatives represent about 51 percent of the
producers associated with the New England marketing area and about 48 percent of the producers associated with the
New York-New Jersey marketing area. The cooperative associations proposing the terminations are Agri-Mark, Inc.;
Allied Federated Cooperatives, Inc.; Atlantic Dairy Cooperative, Inc.; Dairylea Cooperative, Inc., and its members
cooperatives: Cortland Bulk Milk Producers Cooperative, Oneida-Madison Milk Producers Cooperative Association,
Inc., and Steamburg Milk Producers Cooperative Association, Inc., and its affiliated cooperatives: Deer River
Bulk Milk Cooperative, Inc., and Jefferson Bulk Milk Cooperative, Inc.; Eastern Milk Producers Cooperative Association,
Inc., and its affiliated cooperatives: Chateaugay Co-operative Marketing Association, Inc., Konhokton Milk Producers
Co-operative Association, Inc., Middlebury Milk Producers Cooperative Association, Inc., and Sullivan County
Co-operative Dairy Association, Inc.; and Upstate Milk Cooperatives, Inc.
Proponents contend that the ``Louisville'' seasonal payment plans are no longer effective or necessary to reduce
the seasonal spring-to-fall swings in milk production as was intended when they were first provided for in these orders
some 25 years ago. Proponents indicated that the seasonal payment plans are largely ineffective because of a general
lack of awareness about the plans in the dairy farming community. They also contend that the price differentials are
too low relative to milk prices to provide an incentive for dairy farmers to modify their seasonal production patterns.
The proponents further indicated concern about the impact of reducing returns to producers during the spring months
when producer milk prices are already generally lower than during other times of the year.
In addition, it has been noted that the seasonal incentive payment plans are no longer necessary or effective since
they have been suspended for the past three years. The proponents point out that these past suspension actions were
supported by the need for dairy farmers to have additional monies available during the spring months during which
prices to producers decline precipitously. Proponents expect that milk prices will decline in the spring months
of 1994 and in the spring months of future years. They also maintain that retaining the payment plans will continue
to put cash flow pressures on dairy farmers during a time of increased cash needs for spring planting.
In the comments, Agri-Mark reiterated its support for the termination of the seasonal payment plans. The cooperative's
primary support for termination involves the volatility of milk prices at low levels for the past several years. Agri-Mark
maintains that if the Louisville seasonal payment plan had been in effect, about $20 million would have been removed
from producer payments in the spring planting months and would have resulted in cash flow difficulties for many farms.
Agri-Mark said that even those farmers who have contra-seasonal milk production would have reduced income during
the spring and summer months.
In further support for the termination of the seasonal payment plans, Agri-Mark indicated that actual seasonal price
movements in the marketplace, to some extent, accomplished the fall price incentives originally intended by the
Louisville payment plan. The cooperative noted that during the past three years, while the Louisville plans were
suspended, the blend price in the August-November period averaged slightly more that $1.00 above the March-June
period in both the New England and New York-New Jersey orders. Agri-Mark expects this pattern to generally continue.

One comment in opposition to this termination was received from a dairy farmer who supplies the New York-New Jersey
marketing area. This farmer expressed the view that the Louisville payment plan is still effective in reducing the
variability of milk production even though the Louisville plan differential levels are too low to be as meaningful
as they were in earlier years when the differential level represented a greater percentage of the price of milk. The
farmer also expressed the view that withholding money from a producer's milk check in the spring months when cash is
needed for meeting spring planting costs was not particularly burdensome.
The ``Louisville'' seasonal incentive payment plan has been in effect in the New England and New York-New Jersey orders
since the late 1960's when there was significant variability between milk production in the spring and fall months.
Market statistics reveal that this variability was as much as 30 percent when the plans were first implemented in the
orders, and there was considerable institutional and economic pressure to reduce this seasonality of production
because of the high costs of marketing seasonal surpluses of milk. It is reasonable to conclude from a review of current-day
statistics that the plans have played a role in reducing this variability, as commented upon by the producer in opposition
to the termination action. However, the seasonality of milk production has not changed much since 1980, and there
are certainly a number of other reasons for this in addition to the ``small'' Louisville differentials relative to
the per hundredweight price of milk from the 1960's and 1970's versus today. Without question, it is also reasonable
to attribute, in part, the narrowing of production seasonality to advances in production practices, including improvement
in feeding programs, breeding and other management practices.
One of the most important consideration in this termination action is the fact that the plans have not been operational
for the last three years and thus have had no impact on the seasonality of milk production. The prior suspension actions,
as well as this request to terminate the payment plans, were supported by a significant number of producers who were
concerned about their prices being reduced any more than what would normally occur because of seasonally lower prices
in the spring. The seasonal variability in the basic formula price for milk (the M-W price) in today's marketplace
already provides an incentive for producers to make their own individual production decisions in response to the
seasonal price changes. Since the payment plans have not been operational or effective, they should be terminated.
Therefore, the seasonal incentive payment plans of the two markets are hereby terminated.
It is hereby found and determined that thirty days' notice of the effective date hereof is impractical, unnecessary
and contrary to the public interest in that:
(a) The termination is necessary to reflect current marketing conditions and to assure orderly marketing conditions
in the marketing area;
(b) This termination does not require of persons affected substantial or extensive preparation prior to the effective
date; and
(c) Notice of proposed rulemaking was given interested parties and they were afforded opportunity to file written
data, views or arguments concerning this suspension.
Therefore, good cause exists for making this order effective upon publication in the 

Federal Register

Small Business Size Standards; Inflation Adjusted Size Standards


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Small Business Administration.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On September 2, 1993, the Small Business Administration (SBA) published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

, 58 FR 46573, re-proposing to streamline its size standards by reducing the current number of fixed size standard
levels from thirty to nine (retaining the five existing employee-based levels and establishing four new receipts-based
levels). As a part of the proposed rule, an inflation adjustment percentage of 45.8% was applied to most of SBA's receipts-based
size standard levels and then rounded to the nearest newly established four receipts-based levels. The SBA has decided
to further review the effectiveness of reducing the current number of fixed size standard levels in order to simplify
the size standards program. However, the SBA continues to believe that the application of an inflationary adjustment,
to account for the effects of inflation since the third quarter of 1982, to its receipts-based size standards is still
warranted. This final rule reflects the SBA's finding that the application of an inflation adjustment percentage
of 48.2% (based upon the latest inflation information) to the receipts-based size standard of each and every industry,
not otherwise prohibited for change by statute, is necessary.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On December 21, 1992, SBA published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

, 57 FR 62515, that sought to achieve the twin goals of adjusting SBA's receipt-based size standards for inflation
and streamlining the SBA size standards system. Following a withdrawal of that proposed rule on February 19, 1993
(58 FR 9131) and further review of the proposal by the Agency, SBA again published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 on September 2, 1993, 58 FR 46573, to accomplish those same dual purposes.


Pursuant to the September 2, 1993 proposed rule, SBA's current system of approximately thirty size standards would
first have been simplified by reducing the number of different size standards to nine. More specifically, SBA's twenty-one
different receipts-based size standards would have been reduced to only the four most common receipts-based size
standards_$3.5 million in average annual receipts, $7.0 million, $12.5 million, and $17.0 million. In addition,
SBA proposed to increase the receipts-based size standards for inflation. The inflation rate to be applied was then
calculated at 45.8 percent. This rate covered the period between the third quarter of 1982 (the last date for which
size standards were adjusted for inflation) and the first quarter of 1993 (the most recent data available at the time
of the publication of the proposed rule).
The 45.8 percent inflation rate would then have been applied to the four remaining receipts-based size standards.
This application would have in turn generated the four most common receipts-based size standards with an inflation
adjustment_$5 million, $10 million, $18 million and $25 million. The inflation adjustment then would have been calculated
for each of the existing receipts-based size standards, except where the Agency is legally prohibited from doing
so. Each of these standards, preliminarily adjusted for the full inflation rate, would have then been modified by
reducing or increasing them to the closest of the four inflation-adjusted simplified size standards. As a result,
many industries would have received a net inflation adjustment that would have been significantly larger or smaller
than the 45.8 percent inflator.
After further considering the proposed rule in light of comments received, the SBA has concluded that further study
is needed on the issue of how best to simplify its size standards. In addition, SBA feels that the manner in which size
standards would have been increased for inflation (that is, adjusting upward or downward from a full inflation increase
to one of the four newly created simplified size standards) may not have adequately taken into account the effects
of inflation on a significant number of industries. Indeed, it believes that the need to adjust current size standards
for inflation is an urgent one. Small business owners have requested quick action. In SBA's view, updating such standards
as soon as possible is necessary to make them more appropriate. Several commenters to the proposed rule maintained
that the proposed rule was inequitable in that certain industries would not have received a full inflationary adjustment.
These commenters recommended that SBA modify every size standard upward to the next highest of the four inflation-adjusted
simplified size standards, but never downward to give certain industries less than a full increase for inflation.
While SBA is not convinced that increasing each of these size standards upward to the next highest level is the appropriate
solution, SBA does believe that the concerns raised regarding the unequal inflation adjustments are valid.
Accordingly, the SBA has decided to finalize only that portion of the proposed rule that called for an increase in the
receipts-based size standards due to inflation. In other words, this final rule will adjust each of the current twenty-one
receipts-based size standards for inflation.

The SBA firmly believes that all possible alternatives should continue to be studied and analyzed to determine the
most effective means by which a true simplification of the numerical size standards, related size standard definitional
provisions, and the size determination process can be achieved. After this review has been completed, a new proposal
to simplify the size standards may be forthcoming with an opportunity for the public to express its views regarding
such a proposal.
In the interim, however, the SBA continues to believe in the necessity of adjusting the receipts-based size standards
to account for the effects of inflation since the Agency's last inflationary adjustment in 1984. This final rule adopts
increases to the receipts-based size standards to reflect the effects of inflation. As discussed in the proposed
rule, March 12, 1984 was the last time a general inflationary adjustment was applied to the receipts-based size standards.
The proposed rule took into account available data through the first quarter of 1993.
In an effort to establish receipts-based size standard levels reflective of current market conditions, the SBA,
based on the availability of the U.S. Department of Commerce's most recent inflation data, has re-calculated the
inflation adjustment percentage to be applied to the receipts-based size standards. Thus, taking into account available
data through the fourth quarter of 1993, SBA calculates the inflation adjustment to be 48.2 percent (as opposed to
the 45.8 percent adjustment calculated in the proposed rule based on the most current data available at that time,
the first quarter of 1993). As in the proposed rule, in determining the rate of inflation, SBA has utilized the U.S.
Department of Commerce's published Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Implicit Price Deflator.
The methodology used in determining the appropriate inflation adjustment is as follows:
1. Determine the base period used to establish the current size standard;
2. Determine the GDP deflator at the base period and at the most recent point in time for which the GDP deflator has been
published; and
3. Apply the calculated inflation adjustment percentage to the receipts-based size standard of each and every industry,
not otherwise prohibited from change by statute.
The inflation adjustment calculated in this final rule is based on the last index value used for the 1984 inflation
adjustment and the latest available index value. The 1984 adjustment accounted for inflation up to the third quarter
of 1982. For purposes of this rule, the third quarter of 1982 is, therefore, the base period for which SBA calculated
the amount of inflation that has occurred since the last adjustment. The U.S. Department of Commerce's latest data
show index values of 84.3 for the third quarter of 1982 and 124.9 for the fourth quarter of 1993. This change records
inflation of 48.2 percent for the time between these two periods. Thus, each and every industry having a receipts-based
size standard, not otherwise prohibited from change by statute, first receives an inflationary calculation percentage
of 48.2 percent in this final rule. Finally, where necessary, the inflated size standards are rounded to the nearest
half million dollar increment. This rounding method produces net increases to most industry size standards that
are slightly above or below the calculated inflation rate of 48.2 percent. This methods is selected because it results
in an increase to each size standard that is as close as possible to the calculated 48.2 percent inflationary increase,
and is consistent with the settled practice of establishing size standards at $0.5 million increments. Past inflationary
increases in SBA's receipt-based size standards have similarly been rounded to the nearest $0.5 million increment.
See, e.g., 49 FR 5024 (February 9, 1984). The SBA believes that this rounding methodology most closely reflects the
calculated inflation increase. The inflation adjustment adopted by this final rule is not intended to and can not
be a precise calculation of inflation experienced within each and every industry. This is because inflation will
vary from industry to industry, and measures of these cost and price increases are not generally calculated for specific
industries, as represented by individual Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code designations. SBA feels
that the rounding methodology is, therefore, the most reasonable application of an inflationary adjustment since
the inflation measure used for this final rule measures only the general rise of prices in the whole economy over an
extended period of time.
Three industry categories which SBA has revised since the 1984 inflation adjustment are being adjusted differently
in this final rule to correctly increase those industries for inflation through 1993. These are the chicken egg production
industry, SIC coded 0252; motor vehicles dealers (new and used), SIC code 5511; and the industries of computer services,
SIC codes 7371 through 7379. In developing the existing size standards for these industries, SBA used data on industry
revenues later than the third quarter of 1982. Thus, the existing standards take into account the effects of inflation
beyond the third quarter of 1982. To avoid double-counting for the effects of inflation on these size standards, the
size standards will be adjusted for inflation occurring from the year of the industry data (the base period) to the
fourth quarter of 1993. The data bases the SBA relied upon to establish the size standards for these three categories
reflect revenues generated during an entire calendar year. Accordingly, the average price deflator for the applicable
calendar year is used as the base period's deflator value for purposes of this inflation calculation.

The size standard for the Chicken Egg industry, SIC code 0252, was primarily based on industry data contained in the
SBA's 1986 Small Business Data Base (56 FR 55617) and became effective on November 29, 1991. Accordingly, the inflation
adjustment for this industry is calculated in this final rule based on the inflation between calendar year 1986 (the
base period) and the fourth quarter of 1993. Using the same methodology discussed above, the Implicit Price Deflator
for GDP increased 28.9 percent during this period based on deflators of 96.9 for calendar year 1986 and 124.9 for the
fourth quarter of 1993. The $7.0 million size standard for this industry will, therefore, increase to $9.0 million.

 
The 1987 Census of Service Industries and 1987 Census of Retail Trade Industries, published by the U.S. Department
of Commerce's Bureau of the Census, were primarily used to establish the size standards for Computer Services, SIC
codes 7371 through 7379 (57 FR 27907), and for Motor Vehicle Dealers (New and Used), SIC code 5511 (57 FR 4837). Their
size standards became effective on July 23, 1992 and March 11, 1992, respectively. Accordingly, the inflation adjustment
for these two industries will be calculated based on inflation between calendar year 1987 (the base period) and the
end of 1993 in this final rule. Using the same methodology discussed above, the Implicit Price Deflator for GDP increased
24.9 percent during this period based on deflators for calendar year 1987 (the base period) of 100.0 and for the fourth
quarter of 1993 of 124.9. Based on these calculations, the $14.5 million size standard for Computer Services will
increase to $18 million and the $17 million size standard for Motor Vehicle Dealers (New and Used) will increase to
$21 million. 
 
Two other industries had their size standards further changed after the general 1984 inflation adjustment, but these
changes were based on industry specific data for 1982 and 1984. These are the industries of Travel Agencies, SIC code
4724 (53 FR 18820) (1982 data), and Real Estate and Managers, SIC code 6531 (50 FR 27418) (1984 data). The SBA believes
no adjustment is needed to the real estate industry size standard to correct for the double-counting of inflation
since the increment of change in inflation between 1982 and 1984 is insufficient to cause a different size standard
than the one established in this rule. 
 
An additional issue which is addressed in this final rule is the resolution of an employee or revenue-based size standard
for industries in the computer services industries (SIC codes 7371-7379). On June 23, 1992, the SBA published
an interim final rule in the 

Federal Register

, 53 FR 27907, establishing a $14.5 million size standard for all nine industries in the computer service industries.
However, in that rule the SBA continued to seek information on the adoption of an employee-based size standard for
some or all of the computer service industries. After consideration of the comments received on that issue, the Agency
believes that it lacks sufficient information regarding procurement patterns among this group of industries to
justify such a significant change as shifting to an employee-based measure of size. 
 
As discussed above, the SBA is now establishing these industries' size standards at $18.0 million in this final rule.
In effect, the much larger issue of adjusting SBA's size standards for inflation has at least partially superseded
the issue of whether to use a revenue or employee-based size standard for this group of industries. Thus, the Agency
has decided to first implement an inflation adjusted revenue-based size standard for these industries and then review
its program results with these higher size standards in place. At that time, SBA may propose an appropriate rule change.
SBA believes that the higher revenue-based size standards for the computer services industries established in this
final rule may substantially meet many of the concerns of those seeking a employee-based size standard. 
 
As indicated in the proposed rule, four footnotes (footnotes 8, 12, 15 and 16) are adjusted to be consistent with the
inflationary adjustments. Size standards for Offshore Marine Services (part of SIC Major Groups 44 and 45), Retail
Sale of Aircraft (part of SIC code 5599), Leasing of Building Space to the Federal Government by Owners (part of SIC
Major Group 65) and industries without a specific size standard listed in SIC Division I-Services, are being established
at $20.5 million, $7.5 million, $15.0 million, and $5.0 million, respectively.

The SBA notes that the size standards for certain industries have either been established by statute or prohibited
by statute from change until after September 30, 1996. Thus, the size standards for these industries will remain at
their current levels and will not be increased for inflation in this final rule. Title VII of Public Law 100-656,
102 Stat. 3853, 3889, established the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program to test the competitiveness
of small business on Federal procurements. That program generally prohibits a change in size standards before September
30, 1996 for the Construction industries (SIC codes 1521-1799); the Engineering, Architecture, Surveying
and Mapmaking industries (SIC codes 8711, 8712, 8713, and part of SIC code 7389); and the Refuse Systems and Related
Services industries (SIC code 4953). A footnote is being added to the size standard for SIC code 7389, Business Services,
Not Elsewhere Classified, to comply with this statutory mandate to retain the $3.5 million size standard for any surveying
and mapping activities which may be included in this industry. The description of this industry in the Standard Industrial
Classification Manual, 1987 includes some surveying and mapping activities not included in SIC code 8713, Surveying
Services. This footnote was not part of the proposed rule due to an oversight as to the full impact of this statutory
requirement. However, the SBA is bound by statutory direction to retain the existing $3.5 million size standard for
surveying and mapping services whether included in SIC code 8713 or SIC code 7389.
While the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program generally requires the size standards of certain
industries to remain unchanged until 1996, the size standards relating to two of the three industries in the engineering
category may now be revised as a result of recent legislation. Section 850 of Public Law 103-160, the National
Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1994, 107 Stat. 1547, 1726, signed into law on November 30, 1993, modified
the application of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program as to SIC code 8711, Engineering Services,
to make clear that the subdivisions of Standard Industrial Classification code 8711 for (A) engineering services-military
and aerospace equipment and military weapons; and (B) engineering services-marine engineering and naval architecture
are not part of the Program and modifications to those size standards could be made by the SBA.
In recognition of this statutory change, this final rule gives an inflationary adjustment to the size standards for
engineering services for Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons, raising it from $13.5 million to
$20.0 million in average annual receipts, and to the size standard for engineering services related to Marine Engineering
and Naval Architecture, raising it from $9.0 million to $13.5 million in average annual receipts. Although the proposed
rule did not contain a similar proposal, it clearly stated that SBA intended to increase all receipt-based size standards
by inflation except where SBA was constrained from doing so by law. At the time of the publication of the proposed rule
on September 2, 1993, SBA interpreted the requirements relating to the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration
Program as prohibiting size standard increases in these two subdivisions of SIC code 8711. The size standards that
are adopted in this final rule reflect the release of these size standards from statutory constraints and adjustments
for inflation which, over time, has eroded the real value of these industries' size standards similar to other industries'
size standards.
The other statutory provision which constrains SBA from making inflationary adjustments for certain industries
is Section 18016 of the Comprehensive Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1986, Public Law 99-272, 100 Stat. 82, 371,
which amended SBA's authority regarding the setting of size standards contained in section 3(a) of the Small Business
Act, 15 U.S.C. 632(a). Specifically, pursuant to section 3(a) of the Small Business Act, as amended by Public Law 99-272,
an agricultural enterprise shall be deemed to be a small business concern if, including its affiliates, it has annual
receipts not in excess of $500,000. SBA has complied with that requirement by retaining the size standard for both
Agricultural Production-Crops (SIC codes 0111-0191), and Livestock and Animal Specialties (SIC codes 0212-0291,
except SIC code 0211 and 0252) at $500,000.


Comments to Proposed Rule


In response to the September 2, 1993 proposed rule, SBA received a total of one-hundred and thirty-five comments.
A thorough review of these comments revealed that out of the one-hundred and thirty-five comments received, ninety
seven were supportive (71.9%), with over fifty commenters citing the inflation adjustment of size standards as a
reason for supporting the proposal. In addition, about forty commenters generally supported the simplification
of size standards, but did not specifically agree or disagree with the SBA's proposed system for simplification.
This general support for simplification was not, however, the primary focus of any comment. A general supporting
statement was usually followed or preceded by a comment regarding some other specific aspect of the proposal.
The remaining thirty-eight comments included twenty-five which were non-supportive (18.5%) of the proposal, mainly
opposing the proposed size standard for the travel agencies industry. Thirteen comments discussed only issues not
included within the proposed rule. SBA's evaluation of the public comments yielded the following noteworthy issues:

Although the proposed rule discussed a revision to the size standards for over three hundred industries, the SBA received
thirty-three comments (nearly 25 percent of all comments received) specifically on the size standard relating to
Travel Agencies (SIC code 4724). The proposed rule would have increased the size standard for this industry from $500,000
to $5.0 million in commission-based income, or a 900 percent increase. The $5.0 million size standard was proposed
because it was the lowest of the four receipts-based size standards under the proposed simplification of size standards.
The majority of the comments received on the travel agencies size standard, nineteen or nearly 60 percent of the thirty-three
comments, opposed increasing the size standard by 900 percent. However, twenty-seven of the commenters (82 percent)
favored increasing the existing size standard by at least 100 percent.

The SBA believes that the fourteen comments that agreed with the proposed revision of the Travel Agencies size standard,
coupled with the alternatives recommended in the nineteen opposing comments, demonstrate an overwhelming consensus
that the existing size standard is too low. Most of the comments received opposing the $5 million proposed size standard
suggested an alternative size standard level that would qualify companies as small whose commission-based receipts
were between $1.0 and $2.0 million. SBA notes that none of those submitting opposing comments suggested that the size
standard should be increased beyond $2.5 million in commission-based income.

The commenters emphasized that since under the $5.0 million proposal all but 100 of the 35,000 travel companies would
be considered small, the result of increasing the size standard to the proposed level would virtually eliminate the
benefits provided to smaller companies because they would be unable to compete with companies that were from 10 to
50 times their size. The largest trade association of professional travel agents indicated that doubling the standard
to $1.0 million in receipts (commission plus other revenues) would sufficiently accommodate the growth in the size
of agencies and the need for some room to grow by travel agencies that are successful in their initial bids for government
procurement. 

The SBA fully agrees with the prevailing views of the commenters that the current size standard for the travel agency
industry is too low and that it does not reflect current market conditions within the industry. Data from the Louis
Harris & Associates 1992 U.S. Travel Agency Survey of market conditions indicate that the existing size standard
includes 89 percent of travel agencies and that the proposed size standard would result in the inclusion of 99.8 percent
of travel agencies. In consideration of the comments reviewed on this specific size standard, the SBA believes that
an inflationary adjustment of 48.2 percent coupled with a rounding upwards to the next $0.5 million increment establishes
the appropriate size standard for this industry. Therefore, this final rule establishes a $1.0 million commission-based
income size standard for the travel agencies industry, SIC code 4724.

A total of nineteen comments, two from firms involved in the construction industry, nine from firms involved in the
architectural and engineering industries, and eight from firms involved in various other industries, were received
concerning the SBA's decision not to increase the size standards of the construction and engineering industries.
As specifically stated in the proposed rule, the SBA is constrained by statute from increasing the size standards
in these industries.

Seventeen commenters requested the SBA to further adjust the size standard levels of their respective industries.
The most often cited industries were: Management Services & Consulting (SIC codes 7341 and 8742); Testing Laboratories
(SIC code 8734); Building Maintenance (SIC code 7349); Computer Services (SIC codes 7371-7379); and Security
Guard Services (SIC code 7381). Many of the reasons cited in support of an additional increase to one of these industries'
size standards raised issues not considered or evaluated by the SBA in proposing the fixed size standard levels for
purposes of simplification or in adjusting the current receipts-based size standards for inflation. The SBA's size
standards are generally established based on structural characteristics of an industry. In reviewing the appropriateness
of a size standard of a particular industry, the SBA utilizes five primary factors: Industry competition, average
firm size, start-up costs, distribution of firms by size and the impact on the SBA's programs. The SBA does not believe
that it has the discretion to make changes to size standards based on these considerations without first proposing
such changes and affording the public an opportunity to comment on the basis of such proposals. The SBA's proposed
rule discussed adjustments to size standards based on inflation in the economy as a whole and based on a further adjustment
to achieve simplicity overall. Neither component of the proposed rule discussed characteristics of specific industries.
For purposes of this rule, a straight inflationary adjustment of 48.2 percent has been applied to all industries,
with a small further adjustment for rounding purposes. With the elimination of the simplification component of the
proposed rule (whereby size standards would have been further adjusted to one of the four receipts-based size standards)
the size standards for the Building Maintenance industry, SIC code 7349, becomes $12 million rather than $10 million.
The size standards of the other industries cited by these commenters either remain at the same level as established
in the proposed rule or are adjusted slightly to achieve the rounding to the nearest $0.5 million. The SBA intends to
conduct a separate industry study on these industries on a priority basis, which may or may not lead to further changes
in their respective size standards.
Three commenters specifically expressed concern with the disproportionate changes within the size standards resulting
from the rounding methodology stipulated in the proposed rule to adjust the industry size standards to one of the four
newly established size standard levels. As indicated above, the SBA has decided to give further study to the best way
to simplify its size standards, and this rule does not reduce the number of receipts-based size standards to the four
proposed standards with their accompanying ``disproportionate'' changes as feared by these commenters.
Eight commenters specifically suggested that the SBA should establish a policy to review and adjust the receipts-based
size standards on a regular and recurring basis. Of the eight commenters, these recommended that the size standards
be reviewed and adjusted every four to six years, one recommended that they be reviewed and adjusted biennially, and
four suggested annual reviews and adjustments. The SBA is continuing its evaluation of a policy to review the impact
of inflation on a regular and recurring basis. This will be part of SBA's further review of the simplification of the
size standards.

As part of its proposal to simplify the size standards, SBA attempted to contact all 8(a) Program Participants in the
program at the time of the proposed rule and requested them to specifically address the potential impact of the proposed
size standards on smaller-sized 8(a) firms. Sixteen commenters addressed this issue. Eleven of the sixteen commenters
maintained that the proposed increase in the size standards would be beneficial to smaller-sized firms. Five of the
sixteen commenters believed that such increases would be adverse to smaller-sized firms in that the number of 8(a)
firms would increase, thus taxing available Federal procurement opportunities and the level of SBA assistance.
Overall, the prevailing view of all commenting 8(a) firms is that the increases in the size standards are necessary
and beneficial and should be adopted. The SBA believes that any possible adverse impact on the smaller-sized 8(a)
firms is out weighed by the desirability of recognizing the effects of inflation. 

Four commenters suggested that the SBA adopt employee-based standards in lieu of receipts-based standards for all
industries. However, only two commenters provided a rationale for the adoption of employee-based standards for
all industries. One of these commenters indicated that utilizing employee-based standards would eliminate the
need for periodic inflationary adjustments. The other commenter stated that equipment and material purchases required
by Federal agencies on certain contracts distorted the actual size of a concern by raising a concern's receipts without
an accompanying increase in actual business activity. The decision to use receipts or employees as the size standard
measure is based on which measure is viewed as the best measure of size for firms involved in that particular industry.
The SBA's policy is to evaluate the size standard measure of an industry on a case-by-case basis as part of the SBA's
continuing efforts to review industry size standards. However, the issue of whether all industries should be measured
by number of employees will be further explored along with other issues on simplifying size standards. 

In response to several comments, this rule publishes the entire set of size standards by SIC code designation and their
accompanying footnotes. The complete size standards table provides the public with one convenient set of size standards
and eliminates the need to have two tables of size standards, one for those size standards revised in this final rule
and one for those unaffected by this rule. 

Compliance with Executive Orders 12612, 12778, and 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.)
and the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Ch. 35). 



General 



SBA considers that this final rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. section 601, 

et seq.

). In addition, SBA believes that this final rule constitutes a significant rule for the purpose of Executive Order
12866. Immediately below, the SBA has set forth a summary regulatory impact analysis and a final regulatory flexibility
analysis of this final rule. 



(1) Description of Entities to Which the Rule Applies 



SBA estimates that approximately 20,000 additional firms will be considered small as a result of this rule. These
firms will be eligible to seek available SBA assistance, provided they meet other program requirements. Many of these
concerns probably had small business status in 1984, when the last comprehensive revision of size standards was issued
by SBA, but have since lost eligibility because of general price increases. The current changes, in fact, operate
roughly as adjustments for price changes (i.e., inflation) since that data. Approximately 11,000 of the firms gaining
eligibility operate in retail trade while approximately 9,000 operate in the services industries (Divisions G and
I, respectively, of the SIC systems of classifying industries). Other firms affected by this rule include service
firms within the agricultural or mining sectors, or firms in those transportation industries with receipt-based
size standards. Firms becoming eligible for SBA assistance as a result of this rule, cumulatively generate $95 billion
in annual sales. This figure is less than 5 percent of the total sales in those industries with higher size standards.
The new size standards would not impose a regulatory burden because they do not regulator or control business behavior.

<TEXT>
 

(2) Description of Potential Benefits of the Rule



The most significant areas of benefits to business obtaining small business status as a result of this final rule are
in the Federal government's procurement arena and the SBA's business loan program. The SBA estimates that businesses
gaining small business status could potentially obtain Federal contracts worth approximately $200 million under
the small business set-aside program or the 8(a) program. The additional competition for many of these procurements
may also result in a lower price to the government for its procurements which have been set aside, but the SBA is not able
to quantify this benefit. In the SBA's 7(a) Loan Program, it is estimated that 250 loans amounting to $100 million could
be made to the newly defined small businesses. The rule will also make various SBA programs available to business concerns
who would otherwise be eligible for such programs but for an increase in their revenues due to inflation. In other words,
the rule reinstates business concerns as small that lost their small business status due solely to inflation. As such,
those firms which would again be eligible for SBA assistance and for small business procurement preference programs
will benefit greatly from this rule.



(3) Description of Potential Costs of the Rule



The changes in size standards as they impact on government procurement should not add any element of cost to the government
and, in fact, as described above, may reduce the cost to a procuring Federal agency. Similarly, the rule should not
result in any extra costs with respect to the 7(a) loan program. The amount of lending authority SBA can make or guarantee
is established by appropriation. The competitive effects of size standards revisions differ from those normally
associated with regulations affecting key economic factors such as the price of goods and services, costs, profits,
growth, innovation, mergers, and foreign trade. The change to size standards is not anticipated to have any appreciable
effect on any of these factors, although smaller-sized small businesses or 8(a) firms may be unsuccessful in competing
for some Federal procurement opportunities due to the presence of larger, newly defined small businesses, some of
which may well be more competitive in winning Federal procurements.



(4) Description of the Potential Net Benefits from the Rule



From the above discussion, SBA believes that, because the potential costs of this rule are minimal, the potential
net benefits would approach fairly closely the total potential benefits. The impact of the new size standard will
appear predominantly in the Federal procurement area.



(5) Description of Reasons Why This Action is Being Taken and Objectives of Rule



SBA has provided above a statement of the reasons why the new size standards are established and a statement of the reasons
for and objectives of this rule.



(6) Legal Basis for Rule



The legal basis for this rule is sections 3(a) and 5(b)(6) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 632(a) and 634(b)(6).



(7) Federal Rules



There are no Federal rules which duplicate, overlap or conflict with this rule. SBA has statutorily been given exclusive
jurisdiction in establishing size standards.



(8) Significant Alternatives to the Rules



This final rule establishes the most appropriate individual size standard by which to define those small businesses
that are eligible for SBA's assistance programs. There are no significant alternatives to defining a small business.

The SBA certifies that this final rule will not have federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federal
Assessment in accordance with Executive Order 12612.

The SBA further certifies that this final rule will not add any new reporting or record keeping requirements under
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C., Chapter 35. For purposes of Executive Order 12778, the SBA certifies
that this final rule is drafted, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the standards set forth in section 2
of that order.

Standards for Electronic Bulletin Boards Required Under Part 284 of the Commission's Regulations 


Issued April 1, 1994.


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, DOE.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; order accepting data sets and implementation guide.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On December 23, 1993, the Commission issued a final rule in this proceeding requiring pipelines to implement standards
and protocols by June 1, 1994. The Commission is accepting standardized data sets providing information related
to released capacity and an implementation guide for downloading this information using Electronic Data Interchange
according to standards promulgated by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Accredited Standards Committee
(ASC) X12.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In addition to publishing the full text of this document in the 

Federal Register

, the Commission also provides all interested persons an opportunity to inspect or copy the contents of this document
during normal business hours in room 3104, 941 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426. 



The Commission Issuance Posting System (CIPS), an electronic bulletin board service, provides access to the texts
of formal documents issued by the Commission. CIPS is available at no charge to the user and may be accessed using a personal
computer with a modem by dialing (202) 208-1397. To access CIPS, set your communications software to use 300,
1200, or 2400 bps, full duplex, no parity, 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit. CIPS can also be accessed at 9600 bps by dialing
(202) 208-1781. The full text of this notice will be available on CIPS for 30 days from the date of issuance. The
complete text on diskette in WordPerfect format may also be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, La Dorn
Systems Corporation, also located in room 3104, 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. 



Order Accepting Data Sets and Implementation Guide
 


Issued April 1, 1994.



On December 23, 1993, the Commission issued a final rule in this proceeding requiring pipelines to implement standards
and protocols by June 1, 1994.

1

 The rule required pipelines to provide information included in standardized data sets on their Electronic Bulletin
Boards and to permit users to download this information using Electronic Data Interchange according to standards
promulgated by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X12. 





In the rule, the Commission recognized that as pipelines began the implementation process, they might discover that
changes or modifications to the standardized data sets were necessary. The Commission also recognized that an ASC
X12 implementation guide would need to be developed to correspond with the final data sets. The revisions to the data
sets and the implementation guide were to be developed by the industry Working Groups that had been working on these
standards, and the Working Groups were to provide the required documents to the Commission in sufficient time to permit
implementation by June 1, 1994. 

On March 4, 1994, Working Groups 1 & 2 filed revised capacity release data sets and an implementation guide for
downloading these data sets using Electronic Data Interchange according to ASC X12 standards. Public notice of this
filing was issued on March 7, 1994, with comments due by March 15, 1994. Only one comment was received, from the National
Registry of Capacity Rights, Inc., which supported acceptance of the data sets. 

The Commission is accepting the data sets and implementation guide to be implemented by the pipelines by June 1, 1994,
subject to the order on rehearing in this proceeding. Pipelines should not delay implementation of the data sets until
the Commission's rehearing order. Should the Commission grant rehearing and eliminate any data elements, those
fields simply would be left blank. If the Commission determines to add fields to the data sets, the Commission will
not require those fields to be implemented by June 1, 1994. The Working Groups would be given the opportunity to design
the new data fields for later implementation. The data sets will be made available at the Commission's Public Reference
and Files Maintenance Branch, 941 North Capitol Street as soon as is possible. 

In the final rule, the Commission required pipelines to provide downloads using a standard ASCII format. On March
10, 1994, public notice was given of an ASCII file structure submitted by Enron Gas Service, with comments due by March
17, 1994. On March 18, 1994, the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America (INGAA) filed a comment to clarify that
the ASCII file structure was not a consensus product of the Working Group. INGAA also asserts work is underway on an
alternative approach that would make ASCII files available to users without requiring the pipelines to maintain
two separate standards, ASC X12 and ASCII. Numerous parties also have sought rehearing of the requirement to provide
ASCII downloads. 

The Commission will determine whether to require an ASCII download, and the implementation date if it is required,
in the rehearing order. If the industry or Working Groups formulate an alternative approach, they should inform the
Commission of that approach as soon as possible. 



The Commission Orders



The data sets and implementation guide filed on March 4, 1994, in this proceeding are accepted to be implemented by
June 1, 1994, subject to the order on rehearing in this docket.

By letter dated September 17, 1992 (administrative record No. UT-782), Utah submitted to OSM, under SMCRA and
the Federal regulations implementing SMCRA at 30 CFR chapter VII (the Federal regulations), a proposed amendment
to the Utah program. Utah submitted the proposed amendment in response to a September 4, 1992, agreement (administrative
record No. UT-778) between Utah and OSM concerning the regulation of coal mine access and haul roads (mine roads)
in Utah and as required by OSM at 30 CFR 944.16 (n) and (o). The proposed amendment consists of revised definitions of
the terms ``affected area,'' ``road,'' and ``public road'' at Utah Administrative Rule (Utah Admin. R.) 645-100-200.
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the November 16, 1992, 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 54032), and, in the same notice, opened the public comment period and offered to hold a hearing on the substantive
adequacy of the proposed amendment (administrative record No. UT-800). The public comment period closed on
December 16, 1992.
Following the close of the comment period and during its review of the proposed amendment, OSM identified certain
concerns regarding whether the proposed amendment was, as required by 30 CFR 732.15(a), in accordance with SMCRA
and consistent with the Federal regulations. OSM notified Utah of these concerns by letter dated January 21, 1993
(administrative record No. UT-817).
By letter dated February 16, 1993, Utah submitted to OSM additional material, including a revision to the proposed
amendment (administrative record No. UT-824). However, OSM identified certain concerns with this revision
and notified Utah of these concerns by telephone on March 4, 1993 (administrative record No. UT-825).
By letter dated March 24, 1993, Utah submitted to OSM additional revisions to the proposed amendment (administrative
record No. UT-827).
OSM announced receipt of the March 24, 1993, revisions to the proposed amendment in the April 8, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 18187), and, in the same notice, reopened the public comment period on the revised proposed amendment (administrative
record No. UT-830). The comment period ended on April 23, 1993.
By letter to Utah dated May 19, 1993 (administrative record No. UT-842), OSM found that provision II.1 of the
September 4, 1992, agreement was not valid. In addition, OSM qualified the applicability of provision II.2 of the
same agreement.
By letter dated June 22, 1993 (administrative record No. UT-847), Utah responded to OSM's May 19, 1993, letter
and stated its interpretation of and intentions with respect to the September 4, 1992, agreement.
By letter dated July 1, 1993 (administrative record No. UT-845), the Joint National Coal Association/American
Mining Congress Committee on Surface Mining Regulations requested that OSM reopen the comment period for Utah's
proposed amendment to allow additional public comment on the effect of OSM's May 19, 1993, letter on the September
4, 1992, agreement and the proposed amendment.
OSM published a notice in the July 29, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 40608) reopening and extending the public comment period to allow the public the opportunity to comment on the
effect that the invalid part of the September 4, 1992, agreement would have on Utah's proposed amendment (administrative
record No. UT-850). The extended public comment period ended on August 13, 1993. The proposed amendment, as
revised on March 24, 1993, is the subject of this notice.

After a thorough review, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, the Director finds
that Utah's proposed amendment to its definitions of ``affected area,'' ``road,'' and ``public road,'' as submitted
by Utah on September 17, 1992, and as revised by it on March 24, 1993, is no less stringent than SMCRA and no less effective
than the Federal regulations.



A. Background on Proposed Amendment



On February 25, 1991, Utah adopted certain revisions to its definitions of ``road'' and ``public road'' at Utah Admin.
R. 645-100-200, along with a supplemental policy statement. On March 1, 1991, Utah, as required by 30 CFR
732.17, submitted those revisions and the supplemental policy statement to OSM for approval (administrative record
No. UT-610).

OSM did not approve in part the March 1, 1991, submittal in a final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 58846, November 22, 1991) (the final roads rule). In the final roads rule, OSM found that the definition of ``surface
coal mining operations'' at section 701(28) of SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1291(28), and its counterpart in the Utah program
require the regulation of certain public roads (56 FR 58846, 68847-49, November 22, 1991). OSM also found that,
when determining whether a road is subject to regulation under SMCRA and the Utah program, the regulatory authority
must consider the extent and effect of the mining-related use of the road (56 FR 58846, 58847-49, 58851-52,
58854-55, November 22, 1991). Based on these findings, OSM did not approve Utah's revision to its definition
of ``road'' and its supplemental policy statement because, when considered together, they would have exempted all
public roads from regulation, regardless of their mining-related use (56 FR 58846, 58847-49, November 22,
1991). OSM approved Utah's revision to its definition of ``public road,'' but only in the limited context of the rules
in the Utah program for designating lands unsuitable for mining (56 FR 58846, 58849-50, November 22, 1991).
OSM also required Utah to make certain amendments to its regulatory definitions of ``road'' and ``public road'' and
to withdraw its supplemental policy statement (56 FR 58846, 58857-58, November 22, 1992.) These required program
amendments are codified at 30 CFR 944.16 (n) and (o).

On January 17, 1992, Utah brought an action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, pursuant to section
526 of SMCRA, for judicial review of the final roads rule (

Utah

 v. 

Lujan,

 No. 92-C-063-G (D. Utah)). On September 4, 1992, OSM and Utah resolved 

Utah

 v. 

Lujan

 by entering into an agreement (the September 4, 1992, agreement). Under the September 4, 1992, agreement, Utah agreed,
among other things, to withdraw its claims in 

Utah

 v. 

Lujan,

 confirm the withdrawal, effective December 5, 1991, from the Utah program of its supplemental policy statement,
and to submit to OSM a proposed amendment to the Utah program that would revise the definitions of ``affected area,''
``road,'' and ``public road'' at Utah Admin. R. 645-100-200 to read the same as the corresponding definitions
in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 701.5 and 761.5. For its part, OSM agreed to a blanket exemption of certain Utah
mine roads from regulation under SMCRA and the Utah program.

Pursuant to the September 4, 1992, agreement, Utah filed a motion with the district court to dismiss 

Utah

 v. 

Lujan.

 However, Utah did not submit the agreement to the court for review or approval. On September 24, 1992, the court granted
Utah's motion and dismissed the case with prejudice. Also pursuant to the agreement, Utah submitted to OSM the proposed
amendment that is the subject of this notice. Subsequently, OSM sent to Utah a letter dated May 19, 1993, invalidating
the September 4, 1992, agreement to the extent that it exempted certain mine roads existing on September 4, 1992, from
regulation under SMCRA (administrative record No. UT-842).

As noted above, Utah proposed to revise its definitions of ``affected area,'' ``road,'' and ``public road'' at Utah
Admin. R. 645-100-200. Specifically, Utah proposed to revise its definition of ``affected area'' as
follows, with the italicized language to be added:







``Affected area'' means any land or water surface area which is used to facilitate, or is physically altered by, coal
mining and reclamation operations. The affected area includes the disturbed area; any area upon which coal mining
and reclamation operations are conducted; any adjacent lands the use of which is incidental to coal mining and reclamation
operations; all areas covered by new or existing roads used to gain access to, or for hauling coal to or from, coal mining
and reclamation operations,

 except as provided in this definition; 

any area covered by surface excavations, workings, impoundments, dams, ventilation shafts, entryways, refuse
banks, dumps, stockpiles, overburden piles, spoil banks, culm banks, tailings, holes or depressions, repair areas,
storage areas, shipping areas; any areas upon which are sited structures, facilities, or other property material
on the surface resulting from, or incident to, coal mining and reclamation operations; and the area located above
underground workings. 

The affected area shall include every road used for purposes of access to, or for hauling coal to or from, coal mining
and reclamation operations, unless the road (a) was designated as a public road pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction
in which it is located; (b) is maintained with public funds and constructed in a manner similar to other public roads
of the same classification within the jurisdiction; and (c) there is substantial (more than incidental) public use.
Editorial Note: The definition of Affected area, insofar as it excludes roads which are included in the definition
of Surface coal mining operations, was suspended at 51 FR 41960, Nov. 20, 1986. Accordingly, Utah suspends the definition
of Affected Area insofar as it excludes roads which are included in the definition of ``coal mining and reclamation
operations.''







Utah proposed to revise its definition of ``road'' as follows, with the capitalized language in brackets to be removed
and the italicized language to be added:






``Road'' means a surface right-of-way for purposes of travel by land vehicles used in [COAL EXPLORATION OR] coal mining
and reclamation operations or coal exploration. 

A road consists of the entire area within the right-of-way, including the roadbed, shoulders, parking and side areas,
approaches, structures, ditches, and surface. The term includes access and haulroads constructed, used, reconstructed,
improved, or maintained for use in [COAL EXPLORATION, OR WITHIN THE AFFECTED AREA OF] coal mining and reclamation
operations 

or coal exploration, 

including use by coal hauling vehicles [LEADING] to 

and from 

transfer, processing, or storage areas. The term does not include [ROADS] 

ramps and routes of travel 

within the immediate mining [PIT] area 

or within spoil or coal mine waste disposal areas.






Finally, Utah proposed to revise its definition of ``public road'' as follows, with the capitalized language in brackets
to be removed and the italicized language to be added:






 
``Public road'', for the purposes of part R645-103-200, R645-301-521.123, and R645-301-521.133


means a road (a) which has been designated as a public road pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is located
[,]; (b) which is maintained with public funds in a manner similar to other public roads of the same classification
within the jurisdiction [, AND]; (c) 

for which there is substantial (more than incidental) public use; and (d) which meets road classification standards
for other public roads of the same classification in the local jurisdiction.







C. Specific Findings





For the following reasons, OSM finds that Utah's proposed amendment to its definitions of ``affected area,'' ``road,''
and ``public road'' at Utah Admin. R. 645-100-200 is in accordance with SMCRA and consistent with the Federal
regulations. OSM finds that, except for some differences in wording, Utah's proposed amendment to its definitions
of ``affected area,'' ``road,'' and ``public road'' at Utah Admin. R. 645-100-200 is substantively identical
to the corresponding Federal definitions of ``affected area'' and ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5 and ``public road'' at
30 CFR 761.5. As discussed below, these differences in wording are necessary to maintain consistency throughout
Utah's regulations and make the proposed amendment conform to the Utah program.






1. Definition of ``Affected Area''





As noted above, Utah's proposed amendment to its definition of ``affected area'' at Utah Admin. R. 645-100-200
states, in part, as follows:









Editorial Note: 

The definition of 

Affected area, 

insofar as it excludes roads which are included in the definition of 

Surface coal mining operations, 

was suspended at 51 FR 41960, Nov. 20, 1986. Accordingly, Utah suspends the definition of Affected Area insofar as
it excludes roads which are included in the definition of ``coal mining and reclamation operations.''

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940407-0-00020 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940407-0-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In this note, Utah suspended its definition of ``affected area'' insofar as it excluded roads that were included in
the definition of ``coal mining and reclamation operations'' at Utah Admin. R. 645-100-200. This is consistent
with the November 20, 1986, partial suspension of the Federal definition of ``affected area'' (51 FR 41960).

A difference between Utah's proposed definition of ``affected area'' and its Federal regulatory counterpart is
that Utah's proposed definition of ``affected area'' uses the term ``coal mining and reclamation operations, ''
while the Federal definition of ``affected area'' uses the term ``surface coal mining and reclamation operations.''
This difference, however, is not substantive. The Utah regulatory term ``coal mining and reclamation operations,''
as defined at Utah Admin. R. 645-100-200, is substantively identical to the Federal regulatory term ``surface
coal mining operations,'' as defined at 30 CFR 700.5. In addition, the Utah regulatory term ``coal mining and reclamation
operations'' specifically incorporates the term ``surface coal mining and reclamation operations,'' which is
defined at Utah Code Annotated (U.C.A.) 40-10-3(17). The Utah statutory definition of ``surface coal
mining and reclamation operations'' is substantively identical to the corresponding Federal statutory definition
of ``surface coal mining and reclamation operations'' at section 701(27) of SMCRA and the Federal regulatory definition
of that term at 30 CFR 700.5. Furthermore, the term ``coal mining and reclamation operations'' is used throughout
Utah's regulations at Utah Admin. R. 645, which implement the provisions of the Utah Coal Mining and Reclamation Act
(the State Act) at Title 40, Chapter 10, of the U.C.A. Thus, the use of the term ``coal mining and reclamation operations''
in Utah's proposed definition of ``affected area'' is both consistent with Utah's regulations at Utah Admin. R. 645
and is consistent with and no less effective than the term ``surface coal mining and reclamation operations,'' as
used in the Federal definition of ``affected area.''

For the reasons stated above, the Director approves Utah's proposed amendment to the term ``affected area'' at Utah
Admin. R. 645-100-200.



2. Definition of ``Road''



The only difference between Utah's proposed definition of ``road'' at Utah Admin. R. 645-100-200 and
the Federal definition of ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5 is that Utah uses the term ``coal mining and reclamation operations''
in its definition, while the Federal definition of ``road'' uses the term ``surface coal mining and reclamation operations.''
As discussed in finding No. III.C.1. above, this difference is not substantive. Thus, Utah's use of the term ``coal
mining and reclamation operations'' in its proposed definition of ``road'' is consistent with and no less effective
than the Federal definition of ``road.'' In addition, as was discussed in item No. III.A. above, Utah agreed, as part
of the September 4, 1992, agreement (provision I.2.a.), to conform the withdrawal of its supplemental policy statement.
By letter dated June 10, 1992, Utah notified OSM that the Board of Oil, Gas and Mining did, in fact, withdraw the supplemental
policy statement, effective December 5, 1991 (administrative record No. UT-771). Accordingly, the Director
approves Utah's proposed amendment to the term ``road'' at Utah Admin. R. 645-100-200, accepts Utah's
withdrawal of the supplemental policy statement, and removes the required amendments codified at 30 CFR 944.16(n)(1)
and (2).



3. Definition of ``Public Road''



Utah's proposed definition of ``public road'' at Utah Admin. R. 645-100-200, among other things, adds
language that limits the use of this term to the purposes of parts Utah Admin. R. 645-103-200, 645-301-521.123,
and 645-301-521.133. These parts of the Utah program contain rules for designating lands unsuitable
for coal mining and reclamation operations. Thus, Utah's proposed definition of ``public road'' is applicable only
to the Utah rules for designating lands unsuitable for such mining. This limitation is consistent with the Federal
definition of ``public road'' at 30 CFR 761.5, which applies only in the limited context of areas designated by Act
of Congress as being unsuitable for surface coal mining operations (56 FR 58846, 58849, November 22, 1991). Thus,
Utah's proposed addition of the above-referenced language to its definition of ``public road'' at Utah Admin. R.
645-100-200 is consistent with and no less effective than the Federal definition of ``public road'' at
30 CFR 761.5. The Director approves Utah's proposed amendment to the term ``public road'' and removes the required
amendment at 30 CFR 944.16(o).

IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments



A. Public Comments



1. Support for Utah's Proposed Amendment: Processing of Amendments



Two commenters said they supported the proposed amendments and encouraged their approval as quickly as possible.
The commenters further noted that approval of these definitions, which are identical to the Federal definitions,
will remove any ambiguity recognized with respect to Utah's responsibilities to permit roads used primarily for
coal mining purposes. In addition, the commenters stated that, according to OSM regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(h)(7),
approval of the proposed amendments was required by January 15, 1993, 30 days after the close of the comment period
(December 16, 1992), and that in doing so, OSM must, as required by 30 CFR 732.17(h)(10), apply the criteria set forth
in 30 CFR 732.15 when determining whether to approve such amendment. Finally, the commenters said that because the
proposed amendments are identical to the existing Federal regulations, there should be no question that the amendments
should be approved within the mandatory 30-day time period. 

OSM concurs with the commenter's interpretation regarding the above-cited Federal regulations. However, OSM also
believes it necessary to provide clarification regarding the applicability of amendment processing procedures
and the comment that approval of the proposed amendments was required by January 15, 1993, 30 days after the close of
the comment period following publication of the proposed rule notice in the 

Federal Register

. 

Each State program amendment raises different legal and technical issues that require differing levels of analysis.
Therefore, unless a proposed amendment is a verbatim copy of the comparable Federal regulation, it may require extensive
review and analysis by Federal authorities in consultation with their State counterparts. The process involves
review of widely varying amendments that must comport with Federal and State laws and court cases. Rather than simply
disapprove a deficient proposal, OSM attempts to work with the State to bring the proposal up to a level where it is comparable
to and no less effective than the Federal regulations. This process can be time consuming. Thus, the potential for
delays in the process is a constant. 

With respect to Utah's September 17, 1992, proposed amendment, OSM identified deficiencies regarding Utah's definitions
of ``affected area,'' ``road,'' and ``public road.'' Accordingly, OSM notified Utah of the deficiencies by an issue
letter dated January 21, 1993. The issue letter provided Utah with an opportunity to correct the specified deficiencies.
Utah responded to the issue letter in a revised amendment dated March 24, 1993. OSM then announced receipt of the revised
proposed amendment in the April 8, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 18187), and, in the same notice, reopened and extended the public comment period for 15 days. The extended comment
period closed on April 23, 1993. Therefore, according to OSM regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(h)(7), approval or disapproval
of Utah's proposed amendment was required by May 24, 1993, the first work day 30 days after the close of the extended
comment period.

However, with respect to timely processing of amendments, the general rule is that a statutory or regulatory time
period for agency action is not mandatory unless it specifies a consequence for the agency's failure to meet the prescribed
deadline. Where no such consequence is specified, the time period is regarded as directory only, intended to guide
agency procedures but not to set inflexible requirements. (See, 

Brock

 v. 

Pierce County

, 476 U.S. 253, 259, 106 S. Ct. 1834, 1838, 90 L. Ed. 248, 255 (1986); 

In re Barr Laboratories, Inc.

, 930 F.2d 72, 74 (D.C. Cir. 1991); and, 1A N. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction  25.03 (5th ed. 1991)).

In the case of the State program amendment process, the regulation at 30 CFR 732.17(h)(7), which requires OSM to approve
or disapprove the proposed amendment within 30 days of the close of the comment period, and the regulation at 30 CFR
732.17(h)(13), which establishes the 6-month period for the completion of action on State program amendments, do
not impose any consequence in the event OSM fails to meet the deadlines. Thus, these deadlines are directory, rather
than mandatory.



2. Additional Support for Utah's Proposed Amendment



One commenter, who resides in a rural county in Utah that contains extensive coal reserves, responded with support
of Utah's proposed amendment. The commenter further noted that (1) because of the small population base and large
geographic parameters of the county, which contains mostly Federal lands, it is important to have Utah's proposed
definitions in place in order to develop the local economy and (2) the coal mining industry is a large part of the local
economy providing employment for the citizens of the area. OSM acknowledges these comments.



3. Terms of the September 4, 1992, Agreement



Several commenters expressed concerns about the September 4, 1992, agreement. That agreement provides in pertinent
part as follows:




I. The [Utah] Division [of Oil, Gas and Mining] agrees to:



* * * * *



2. In recognition of the direction of the Director of OSM as set forth in OSM's final rule published on November 22, 1991,
56 FR 58846 (the final rule):



* * * * *



b. Submit a program amendment of the Division's definition of the term ``Road'', to read the same as the corresponding
federal definition at 30 CFR 701.5;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940407-0-00023 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940407-0-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

c. Submit a program amendment of the Division's definition of the term ``Public Road'', to read the same as the corresponding
federal definition at 30 CFR 761.5 and, in addition, provide that the definition applies only in the context of Utah
Admin. R645-103-100, 

et seq.

, Areas unsuitable for Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations; and
d. Submit a program amendment of the Division's definition of the term ``Affected Area'' to read the same as the corresponding
federal definition at 30 CFR 701.5.
II. OSM and the Division agree that:
1. If a road in Utah has not previously been determined to be part of an existing surface coal mining operation, the road
will not be required to be included within a permit, based on current federal statute and regulations and the current
Utah statute and rules; and
2. With respect to any application for a permit to conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations under the
Utah Coal Regulatory Program, including any application pending at the time of this agreement, the state will apply
the Utah statute and rules existing on the date of permit approval.



One commenter asserted that the Federal regulatory definitions of ``road,'' ``public road,'' and ``affected area,''
and Utah's proposed amendment to its regulatory definitions of those terms, do not clearly define OSM's and Utah's
jurisdiction over public roads. The commenter stated that until OSM and Utah clarify their jurisdiction over public
roads, they must only impose on operators regulations that conform to the specific terms of the September 4, 1992,
agreement. The commenter noted that this agreement requires Utah to submit to OSM a program amendment to Utah's regulatory
definitions of ``road,'' ``public road,'' and ``affected area'' that ``reads the same as'' the corresponding Federal
regulatory definitions of those terms. In line with this position, the commenter stated that Utah's proposed amendment
must be changed because the proposed definitions of ``road,'' ``public road,'' and ``affected area'' use terms,
such as ``coal mining and reclamation operations,'' that are not contained in the corresponding Federal regulatory
definitions of ``road,'' ``public road,'' and ``affected area.'' Alternatively, the commenter stated that OSM
may approve Utah's proposed amendment, but only after OSM formally changes its own regulatory definitions of ``road,''
``public road,'' and ``affected area'' to use such terms as ``coal mining and reclamation operations.'' Also, the
facilitate this position, the commenter stated that OSM's and Utah's regulations must be modified to include the
specific terms of the September 4, 1992, agreement. Two additional commenters stated that, in accordance with the
September 4, 1992, agreement, all Utah mine roads existing as of that date were ``grandfathered,'' i.e., exempted
from regulation. The commenters further said that under that agreement, if a road had not been included within a permitted
surface coal mining operation prior to September 4, 1992, it will not be incorporated into a permit. The commenters
then requested that the Utah program be amended to specifically incorporate this grandfather provision.
OSM agrees with the comment that the Federal regulatory definitions of ``road,'' ``public road,'' and ``affected
area,'' and Utah's proposed amendment to its regulatory definitions of those terms, do not, respectively, clearly
define OSM's and Utah's jurisdiction over public roads. Those definitions, however, do not purport, in and of themselves,
to define jurisdiction over public roads. In the preamble to the final roads rule, OSM said that it currently relies
on the applicable language of the Federal definitions of ``surface coal mining operations'' at section 710(28) of
SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 700.5, and that Utah must, among other things, also rely on its statutory
definition of that term at U.C.A. 40-10-3(18) in determining jurisdiction over public roads (56 FR 58846,
58848-49, November 22, 1991). Also, in the final roads rule, as discussed under part III.A. of this notice, OSM
found that, when determining whether a public road is subject to regulation under SMCRA and the Utah program, the regulatory
authority must consider the extent and effect of the mining-related use of the road (56 FR 58846, 58847-49, 58851-52,
58854-55, November 22, 1991). Thus, OSM's and Utah's jurisdiction over public roads is determined, respectively,
under the Federal and Utah definitions of ``surface coal mining operations'' and other guidance such as the preamble
to the final roads rule.
OSM disagrees with the comment that the Federal and Utah regulatory definitions of ``road,'' ``public road,'' and
``affected area'' must literally ``read the same.'' Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.15(a), OSM may approve a proposed amendment
to a State program if, among other things, the proposed amendment is in accordance with SMCRA and consistent with the
Federal regulations implementing SMCRA. OSM interprets paragraphs I.2.b., c., and d. of the September 4, 1992, agreement
to only require Utah to submit to OSM a proposed amendment meeting those requirements. For the reasons discussed above
under part III of this notice, OSM finds that Utah's proposed amendment meets, upon the stated conditions, the requirements
of 30 CFR 732.15(a) and provisions I.2.b., c., and d. of the September 4, 1992, agreement.
OSM disagrees with the comment that the Federal and Utah regulations must be modified to include the specific terms
of the September 4, 1992, agreement. Nothing in SMCRA, the Federal regulations, the Utah program, or the September
4, 1992, agreement requires Utah or OSM to modify their respective regulations to include specific terms of that agreement.

In addition, OSM notified Utah, by letter dated May 19, 1993, of its determination that paragraph II.1. of the September
4, 1992, agreement, which would have exempted certain Utah mine roads from regulation under SMCRA and the Utah program,
is contrary to law and thus is not binding on OSM. The September 4, 1992, agreement was not reviewed, approved, or adopted
by the court in 

Utah 

v. 

Lujan. 

Thus, it is nothing more than a contract between OSM and Utah. Under general contract law, a Federal agency cannot contract
with a body it regulates in a manner contrary to its statutory authority or in a manner that does not give full effect
to the intent of the Congress (

Board of Directors and Officers, Forbes Federal Credit Union 

v. 

National Credit Union Admin., 

477 F.2d 777, 784 (10th Cir. 1973)). Contracts entered in violation of statutory or regulatory law are unenforceable
if enforcement would ``offend the essential purpose of the enactment'' (

United States 

v. 

Mississippi Valley Co., 

364 U.S. 520, 563 (1961). See also 

Quinn 

v. 

Gulf Western Corp., 

644 F.2d 89, 93-94 (2d Cir. 1981); 

D.M. Yates, 

74 IBLA 159, 161 (1983). See generally E. Farnsworth, Contracts sections 5.5-5.6 (2d ed. 1982); 15 S. Williston,
Contracts section 1763 (3d ed. 1972)). In other words, OSM is free to enter into contracts or agreements with other
parties, but when a provision of a contract or agreement conflicts with OSM's statutory responsibilities under SMCRA
such that its enforcement would offend an essential purpose of SMCRA, that provision is unenforceable.

Under paragraph II.1. of the September 4, 1992, agreement, Utah and OSM agreed to a blanket exemption from regulation
under SMCRA and the Utah program of all unpermitted mine roads existing prior to September 4, 1992. SMCRA jurisdiction
over mine roads derives from the statutory definition of the term ``surface coal mining operations'' at section 701(28).
SMCRA defines this term, in pertinent part, to mean:





(A) Activities conducted on the surface of lands in connection with a surface coal mine * * *; and

(B) the areas upon which such activities occur or where such activities disturb the natural land surface. Such areas
shall also include * * * 

all lands affected by the construction of new roads to gain access to the site of those activities and for haulage

 * * *





(emphasis added). This definition of ``surface coal mining operations'' is substantively identical to the Federal
regulatory definition of that term at 30 CFR 700.5 and Utah's statutory definition of that term at U.C.A. 40-10-3(18).

<DOCNO> FR940407-0-00025 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940407-0-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Under those definitions, OSM and Utah are required to regulate certain mine roads, based, in part, on the extent and
effect of mining-related use of the road (see 56 FR at 58847-49 (1991); 55 FR 13773, 13775 (1990); 53 FR 54190,
54192 (1988)). Nothing in SMCRA or the Utah program provides for a blanket exemption of mine roads from regulation.
To the contrary, jurisdiction over mine roads must be made on a case-by-case basis (see 56 FR at 58848 (1991); 55 FR 13773,
13775 (1990); 53 FR 54190, 54193 (1988)).

By granting a blanket exemption to existing, unpermitted mine roads without any consideration given to the amount
of their mining-related use, paragraph II.1. of the September 4, 1992, agreement would have exempted roads which,
under SMCRA and the Utah program, OSM and Utah are required to regulate. Thus, paragraph II.1. is contrary to SMCRA
and the Utah program.

Moreover, the enforcement of paragraph II.1. of the September 4, 1992, agreement offends an essential purpose of
SMCRA and the Utah program (See 

Mississippi Valley

, 364 U.S. at 563). One of SMCRA's essential purposes is ``to protect the environment and ensure the reclamation of
mined areas'' (

Daniel Brothers Coal Co.

, 2 IBSMA 45, 49 (1980); see also section 102(a) of SMCRA). Also, as U.C.A. 40-10-2(3) indicates, one of
the purposes of the Utah program is to ``[a]ssure that surface coal mining operations are conducted so as to protect
the environment.'' Given the significant environmental harm that can result from unregulated mine access and haul
roads, these statutory purposes cannot be fully met by an agreement, such as paragraph II.1., to grant an unauthorized
regulatory exemption.

For the reasons given above, paragraph II.1. of the September 4, 1992, agreement is contrary to SMCRA and the Utah program,
and because its enforcement would offend an essential purpose of these laws it is unenforceable. Accordingly, paragraph
II.1. must not be applied by OSM or Utah to any permitting or enforcement decisions in Utah.

Under paragraph II.2. of the September 4, 1992, agreement, Utah agreed to ``apply the Utah statute and rules existing
on the date of permit approval'' to any permit applications pending on September 4, 1992, and to any future permit applications.
In the aforementioned letter to Utah dated May 19, 1993, OSM stated that this provision is valid as long as (1) the phrase
``Utah statutes and rules'' is interpreted to mean the approved Utah State program; (2) any application of the Utah
statute and rules to a permitting decision is consistent with the Department of the Interior's actions in approving
or not approving such statutes and rules (see, 

e.g.

, 56 FR 58846, November 22, 1991); and (3) the provision is not interpreted to prevent Utah or OSM from taking action
subsequent to permit approval, where appropriate under the approved program (e.g., requiring a permit revision
to reflect changes in applicable law).

For these reasons, the Federal regulations and the Utah program must not be modified to include the specific terms
of paragraphs II.1. and II.2. of the September 4, 1992, agreement.



4. Basis for Submission of Utah's Proposed Amendment and the Effect of OSM's Invalidation of Provision II.1. of the
September 4, 1992, Agreement on Utah's Proposed Amendment



One commenter stated that OSM's May 19, 1993, letter, which notified Utah that a portion of the September 4, 1993, agreement
between Utah and OSM was contrary to law and therefore not binding on OSM, constitutes an abrupt reversal of position
and abdication of the agreement that forms the basis for the amendment addressed in this notice. Notwithstanding
OSM's action on the agreement, the commenter requested that OSM approve the amendment.

OSM disagrees with the commenter's inference that the agreement was the sole reason that Utah submitted the amendment
to OSM. When OSM and Utah drafted the agreement, they ensured that the required amendments of the Director's decision
in the November 22, 1991, 

Federal Register

 would be satisfied by Utah complying with provisions I.2. b., c., and d. of the agreement. Therefore, when Utah submitted
proposed definitions of ``road,'' ``public road,'' and ``affected area,'' it did so not only in accordance with provisions
I.2. b., c., and d. of the agreement, but also in response to required program amendments at 30 CFR 944.16 (n) and (o)
that OSM placed on the Utah program in the November 22, 1991, notice. Had OSM and Utah not entered into the agreement,
Utah still would have had to submit proposed definitions to satisfy the required amendments at 30 CFR 944.16 (n) and
(o).

OSM also disagrees with the commenter's assertion that OSM's approval of the amendment would be inconsistent with
OSM's notification to Utah that a part of the agreement was contrary to law and not binding on OSM. The agreement consisted
of two parts. The first part (provision I) addressed actions by Utah (1) to withdraw with prejudice its lawsuit on certain
roads violations that OSM issued in Utah (provision I.1.) and (2) to withdraw a policy statement and revise its definitions
of ``road,'' ``public road,'' and ``affected area'' in a manner consistent with the corresponding Federal definitions
at 30 CFR 701.5 and 761.5 (provisions I.2. a., b., c., and d.). The second part (provision II.) addressed the implementation
of the Federal and State statutes and regulations with respect to (1) existing roads that were not, as of September
4, 1992, previously determined to be part of an existing surface coal mining operation and required to be permitted
(provision II.1.) and (2) permit applications pending Utah's approval or disapproval as of September 4, 1992 (provision
II.2.). While OSM by its May 19, 1993, letter notified Utah that provision II.1. of the September 4, 1993, agreement
between Utah and OSM was not binding on OSM, provisions I.1., I.2. a., b., c., and d., and II.2. remained in effect. Therefore,
contrary to the commenter's statement, OSM could approve the amendment as long as Utah's proposed definitions of
``road,'' ``public road,'' and ``affected area,'' which are the subject of provisions I.2. a., b., c., and d., of the
agreement, were not inconsistent with the corresponding Federal definitions at 30 CFR 701.5 and 761.5.

In addition, the commenter raised several arguments concerning the legal validity of the reasons OSM set forth in
its May 19, 1993, notification to Utah that provision II.1. of the September 4, 1993, agreement between Utah and OSM
was contrary to law and therefore not binding on OSM. The Director notes these arguments but does not respond to them
because they are outside the scope of this rulemaking to the extent that Utah did not submit in this amendment proposed
rules incorporating provision II.1. of the agreement.


5. Jurisdiction


Two commenters expressed concerns that Utah's proposed definitions of ``road,'' ``public road,'' and ``affected
area,'' would inappropriately broaden the State's jurisdiction under the State Act to regulate ``public roads''
that service coal mining operations, coal exploration activities, and most haulage. The commenters noted that the
term ``public road'' would no longer be applied in determining areas that should be permitted under the State Act since
that term, as proposed, would be limited to defining areas unsuitable for mining. The commenters stated that, accordingly,
the definition of ``public road,'' which includes criterion (d) indicating that a public road must meet construction
standards for other public roads of the same classification in the local jurisdiction, will no longer be applied in
determining whether or not a road should be permitted under the State Act.
OSM disagrees with the comment that Utah's proposed definitions will inappropriately broaden the State's jurisdiction
under the State Act to regulate ``public roads.'' As discussed above under part III.A. of this notice, on February
25, 1991, Utah adopted certain revisions to its definitions of ``road'' and ``public road'' at Utah Admin. R. 645-100-200,
along with a supplemental policy statement that, considered together, would exempt all public roads from regulation
under the Utah program. That adoption by Utah, however, did not take effect because it was never approved by OSM, as
required by 30 CFR 732.17(g). Thus, the term ``public road,'' as adopted by Utah on February 25, 1991, was never effective
as a matter of law. Consequently, Utah's proposed amendment does not serve to broaden its jurisdiction to regulate
a ``public road.'' In addition, and more importantly, even if Utah's proposed definition of ``public road'' is mistakenly
interpreted as broadening jurisdiction, it is not inappropriate since it is no less effective than the corresponding
Federal definition of ``public road.''


6. Public Roads and the Phrase ``Substantial (More Than Incidental)'' Public Use


Two commenters stated that Utah's proposed definition of the term ``affected area'' appears to exclude public roads
and requested that Utah further defined the phrase ``substantial (more than incidental)'' public use, as used in
the definition of ``affected area.'' In addition, one of the commenters said the definition of ``affected area''
should be clarified to state a percentage of vehicle traffic other than mining that would constitute public use.
OSM acknowledges the comment that Utah's proposed definition of ``affected area'' appears to exclude public roads.
However, as discussed above under part III.C.1. of this notice, the editorial note in Utah's proposed definition
of ``affected area'' has the effect of including in the ``affected area'' all roads that are included in the definition
of ``coal mining and reclamation operations.''
OSM disagrees with the comments that Utah further define the phrase ``substantial (more than incidental)'' public
use and that Utah provide a percentage of vehicle traffic other than mining that would constitute public use. In the
preamble to a final rule establishing performance standards for roads associated with surface coal mining operations,
OSM said that:



State laws vary widely in their road classification systems. OSMRE [OSM] is concerned that roads constructed to serve
mining operations not avoid compliance with the performance standards by being deeded to public entities. However,
it is not OSMRE's intention automatically to extend jurisdiction over roads into the existing public road network.
Jurisdiction under the Act [SMCRA] and applicability of the performance standards are best determined on a case-by-case
basis by the regulatory authority.

<PARENT> FR940407-0-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(53 FR 45190, 45193, November 8, 1988). Thus, a case-by-case approach is necessary in determining the applicability
of the Utah program to public roads. Utah's proposed amendment, as discussed under part IV.A.3. of this notice, provides
guidance that is no less effective than that specified in the Federal definition of ``surface coal mining operations''
at 30 CFR 700.5 regarding which public roads are subject to Utah's jurisdiction.



Another commenter suggested that the Utah term ``public road'' additionally include roads to which the public has
access. As indicated in finding No. III.C.3., Utah adds language that limits the use of this term to parts R645-103-200,
R645-301-521.123, and R645-301-521.133 of Utah's rules, which pertain only to designating
lands unsuitable for coal mining and reclamation operations. While OSM appreciates the commenter's suggestion,
it cannot require Utah to amend its definition further because the proposed definition has been determined to be no
less effective than the corresponding Federal definition.



7. Definition of ``Road''



Two commenters stated that Utah's proposed definition of the term ``road'' is so broad that it includes almost any
road that carries coal in intrastate and interstate commerce, and should be amended to clarify that the term ``road''
does not include ``public roads'' or roads excluded under the term ``affected area.''

OSM disagrees with these comments. Utah's proposed definition of the term ``road'' is substantively identical to
the Federal regulatory definition of that term at 30 CFR 701.5. Both of those definitions of ``road'' are clear on their
respective terms as to which roads are to be regulated as surface coal mining operations. The determination as to whether
a particular road will be regulated as part of a surface coal mining operation must be made on a case-by-case basis by
the regulatory authority, and must be based upon the mining-related use of the road (53 FR 45190, 45192, November 8,
1988; 56 FR 58846, 58848-9, November 22, 1991).



8. Application of Mining-Related Use of Roads as Criteria To Determine Whether a Road Is Subject to SMCRA Permitting
Requirements



A commenter stated that OSM's application of the extent and effect of the mining-related use of roads as criteria in
determining whether a road is subject to SMCRA permitting requirements is contrary to OSM's announced deference
to State decision making, whereby States with primacy should be allowed to determine, on a case-by-case basis, which
roads must be included within the permit area. Specifically the commenter asserted that nothing in SMCRA or the Federal
regulations grants OSM the authority to make case-by-case determinations in primacy States of which roads must be
included within a permit area. The commenter next stated that OSM has no standards in place that define the point at
which mining-related use requires the inclusion of a road within a permit area. The commenter further stated that
there are no Federal standards defining what constitutes a 

de minimus

 use of a road. Instead, OSM has allowed States to determine the point at which jurisdiction begins and ends through
individual State permitting decisions. Thus, the commenter concluded that the Federal regulatory definition of
``affected area'' no longer provides relevant guidance in light of OSM's deference to State decision making.

With respect to the first comment that OSM relies on the extent and effect of the mining-related use of roads as criteria
in determining whether a road is subject to SMCRA permitting requirements, OSM wishes to emphasize that the regulation
of public roads as part of a surface coal mining operation is not solely dependent upon the use of a road. Factors such
as the purpose and time of its construction, the extent to which the road is directly part of a surface coal minng operation,
the degree to which the road is altered to accommodate mining operations, and the impact of mining operations on the
road and its surrounding environment may be major considerations in determining whether a road is subject to regulation
under SMCRA. In addition, under the Federal definition of ``surface coal mining operations'' at 30 CFR 700.5, a road
may be subject to regulation under SMCRA notwithstanding the lack of demonstrable impacts associated with its mining-related
construction, maintenance, and use. Therefore, even in the absence of such evidence, it may be appropriate to regulate
a road in order to ensure, through the SMCRA permitting, inspection, and enforcement processes, that the purposes
of SMCRA are achieved (56 FR 58846, 58852, November 22, 1991).

<TEXT>
 

With respect to the comments regarding the lack of Federal standards for determining when mining-related use requires
the inclusion of a road within the permit area, the definitions of ``affected area'' and ``surface coal mining and
reclamation operations'' provide guidance in these instances.

OSM has modified its regulations in accordance with court decisions to provide guidance to States and other interested
parties for determining when roads will be regulated as part of a surface coal mining operation. OSM, pursuant to court
order in 

In re Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation (In re Permanent), 

620 F. Supp. 1519, 1581-82 (D.D.C. 1985), 

modified sub. nom., National Wildlife Federation 

v. 

Hodel

, 839 F.2d 694 (DC Cir. 1988), modified its interpretation of the extent to which SMCRA applied to public roads. Specifically,
OSM suspended the Federal regulatory definition of ``affected area'' to the extent that it excluded public roads
that are included in the Federal regulatory definition of ``surface coal mining operations'' (51 FR 41952, November
20, 1986). OSM stated that ``[t]he suspension will have the effect of including in the `affected area' 

all lands affected by the construction of new roads or the improvement or use of existing roads to gain access to the
site of the regulated activities or for haulage

'' (51 FR 41952, 41953, emphasis added).

In determining which mining-related roads are subject to regulation, OSM currently relies on the applicable language
of the Federal definitions of ``surface coal mining operations'' at section 701(28) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 700.5. This
may require, in appropriate circumstances, that OSM and State regulatory authorities issue, and surface coal mine
operators obtain, permits for certain public roads (56 FR 58846, 58848, November 22,1991).

With respect to the comment on the scope of OSM's oversight authority in primacy States to review the States' case-by-case
determinations on roads, OSM will not respond here. This issue is pertinent to Utah's implementation of its statute
and rules and OSM's oversight of Utah's actions in accordance with section 201 of SMCRA, but is not pertinent to this
State program amendment.



9. Proper Interpretation of ``Affected Area''



A commenter asserted that OSM has failed to consider the extent to which a broad interpretation of the term ``affected
area'' may conflict with other regulations that define which public roads are entitled to environmental protection.
As an example, the commenter cited section 522(e)(4) of SMCRA, which states that no surface coal mining operations
shall be permitted within 100 feet of the outside right-of-way line of any public road, and the definition of ``public
road'' at 30 CFR 761.5, which implements section 522(e)(4) of SMCRA and lists the following criteria a road must meet
in order to qualify as a public road: the road has been designated as a public road by the State or local law, it is maintained
with public funds, there is substantial, or more than incidental, public use, and the road meets applicable road construction
standards. The commenter continued that OSM should not apply one definition of ``public road'' for the purpose of
implementing the SMCRA section 522(e) prohibitions and another definition for determining whether a road falls
within the scope of ``surface coal mining operations'' subject to permitting requirements. The commenter concluded
that OSM should avoid construing the definition of ``affected area'' in a manner that would conflict with other statutory
and regulatory requirements.

OSM does not agree with these comments. As discussed below, OSM is constrained by the court's decision in 

In re Permanent

 in how it regulates roads.

The Federal definition of ``affected area'' once included a ``substantial (more than incidental) public use'' criterion,
as the current definition of ``public roads'' also does. However, paragraph (c) of the Federal definition of ``affected
area'' at 30 CFR 701.5, in which OSM previously interpreted the term ``affected area'' as not applying to roads for
which `'there is substantial (more than incidental) public use,'' was successfully challenged in 

In re Permanent. 

As a result, and as stated above in response to comment IV.A.8., OSM modified its interpretation of the extent to which
SMCRA applied to public roads and suspended the definition of ``affected area'' ``to the extent that it excludes public
roads that are included in the definition of ``surface coal mining operations'' (51 FR 41952, 41953, November 20,
1986). The Federal definition of ``public road'' at 30 CFR 761.5 was not challenged and the ``substantial (more than
incidental) public use'' criterion in that definition remains in force in the context of lands unsuitable for mining.

<PARENT> FR940407-0-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The commenter addressed the editorial note that Utah proposes for the definition of ``affected area.'' This note
indicates that a portion of the definition is suspended insofar as it excludes roads that are included in the definition
of ``coal mining and reclamation operations'' at Utah Admin. R. 645-100-200. The commenter stated that
this clarification is not necessary because the State's proposed definition of ``affected area'' clearly delineates
the regulatory authority's jurisdiction.

OSM disagrees with this comment. As finding No. III.C.1. indicates, Utah's proposed definition of ``affected area''
and accompanying editorial note are, with only a few nonsubstantive differences, verbatim copies of the Federal
definition of ``affected area'' and accompanying editorial note. As discussed above, the editorial note accompanying
the Federal definition is necessary to bring the definition into compliance with the court decision In re Permanent.
The same is also the case with the State definition. Without the editorial note or other equivalent revision to Utah's
rules, the Utah program would not be consistent with the Federal regulations that were revised in response to the court
decision.



B. Agency Comments



Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on Utah's proposed amendment from the Administrator
of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the heads
of other Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Utah program.

By letter dated January 21, 1993, the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) commented that forest development roads (FDR'S)
are not public roads (23 U.S.C. 101(a)) in the same sense as roads that are under the jurisdiction of public agencies,
such as States or counties (administrative record No. UT-821) and are not intended to meet the transportation
needs of the public at large. Instead, they are authorized only for the administration and utilization of National
Forest System lands. Although FDR's are generally open and available for public use, that use is at the discretion
of the Secretary of Agriculture. Through authorities delegated by the Secretary, USFS may restrict or control use
to meet specific management direction. Commercial users, permittees, or contractors also may be required to share
in the cost of developing, improving, and maintaining FDR's.

USFS also stated that it may regulate use and restrict public travel on FDR's regardless of whether there is substantial
or incidental use. The USFS added that sometimes there are FDR's with seasonal adjusted daily traffic of less than
10 vehicles per day ``open to public travel'' when these roads serve large blocks of Forest lands, serve important
resources, or are the only access routes within the block of land.

USFS recommended that because it has the legal right to control or regulate FDR's, Utah Admin. R. 645-301-200
(defining ``public road'') should be modified to (1) include FDR's with those roads that have been designated public
roads pursuant to the jurisdiction in which it is located and (2) exclude FDR's from the use restriction that there
be substantial (more than incidental) public use of a road in order for it to qualify as a public road. USFS stated that
with these recommended changes, it could concur with the formal amendment.

By a second letter dated September 9, 1993 (administrative record No. UT-870), USFS restated its concern regarding
rules that attempt to dictate standards of development or maintenance relating to roads under the jurisdiction of
public road agencies or Federal agencies providing public access to lands of the United States. USFS further stated
that




SMCRA regulations must be limited to restrictions on coal hauling activities rather than orders to reclaim or otherwise
modify the transportation facility. The proposed amendment does not clarify this issue sufficiently to present
[sic] unilateral decisions by OSM and DOGM [(the Division)] on roads managed for public access.




OSM appreciates USFS's concerns as stated in its January 21, 19923, and September 9, 1993, letters. OSM cannot, however,
require the State to adopt the recommended changes to the proposed definition of ``public road'' at Utah Admin, R.
645-301-200 because the proposed definition is substantively identical to the Federal definition at
30 CFR 761.5 and is, therefore, no less effective than the corresponding Federal definition.

Further, as explained below, the existing Federal definition and proposed State definition of ``public road,''
will not interfere with USFS jurisdiction over FDR's and will protect FDR's from the adverse effects of surface mining
to the extent allowed under SMCRA and the State Act.

The term ``public road'' is defined at 30 CFR 761.5 and at proposed Utah Admin. R. 645-301-200 so that it
may be used in determining when a surface coal mining operation may be conducted within 100 feet of a road:




[No surface coal mining operations shall be conducted] within 100 feet, measured horizontally, of the outside right-of-way
line of any 

public

 road * * *




(30 CFR 761.11(d) and Utah Admin. R. 645-103-234, emphasis added).

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940407-0-00030 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940407-0-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In order to be considered a ``public road,'' a road must be one




(a) Which has been designated as a public road pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is located;

(b) Which is maintained with public funds in a manner similar to other public roads of the same classification within
the jurisdiction;

(c) For which there is substantial (more than incidental) public use; and

(d) Which meets road construction standards for other public roads of the same classification in the local jurisdiction.




(30 CFR 761.5 and proposed Utah Admin. R. 645-301-200).



In its comments, USFS implies that, although FDR's may not meet, in certain instances, the requirements of ``public
designation'' and ``substantial public use'' in subsections (a) and (c) above, FDR's should be treated as ``public
roads'' for purposes of determining when a surface coal mining operation may be conducted within 100 feet of a road.
As explained below, when appropriate, FDR's will constitute ``public roads'' under the existing Federal and proposed
State language. Changes to specifically add FDR's to these regulations are thus unnecessary.

The phrase, ``which has been designated as a public road pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is located,''
under subsection (a) of the definition of ``public road,'' is interpreted by OSM to include USFS jurisdiction over
FDR's. Therefore, FDR's that USFS designates as ``public'' meet the ``designation'' requirement of the definition.
There is no need to add specific language concerning FDR's to this requirement of the definition.

As for the ``public use'' requirement of the definition, if an FDR, like any other road, receives substantial public
use, the FDR will satisfy this requirement of the definition.

USFS, from its comments of September 9, 1993, also appears concerned that OSM's and Utah's definitions of ``public
road'' will improperly allow OSM's and Utah's regulatory authority to extend to the ``development'' and ``maintenance''
of FDR's. USFS further asserts that ``SMCRA regulations must be limited to restrictions on coal hauling activities
rather than orders to reclaim or otherwise modify the transportation facility.'' Again, these concerns are addressed
by the existing Federal and proposed State regulations.

With respect the USFS's first concern, except for a road that is part of a surface coal mining operation, neither OSM
nor Utah has the authority to regulate the ``development'' or ``maintenance'' of a road located on USFS lands. Moreover,
the Federal and State ``public road'' definition, rather than providing such authority, actually provides FDR's
with protection from the adverse effects of surface coal mining operations by prohibiting surface coal mining operations
from being conducted within 100 feet of any FDR that constitutes of ``public road.'' Finally, it should be noted that
surface coal mining operations may be conducted on USFS lands only if the operation in question meets the stringent
land conservation requirements of 30 CFR 761.11(b), which include the power of the Secretary of Agriculture, in certain
circumstances, to prohibit such mining.

With respect to USFS's second concern, even if OSM desired to limit its regulatory power to only coal hauling activities,
rather than to the transportation facility itself, it could not do so. OSM is required by section 515(b)(17) of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1265(b)(17)) to regulate the construction, maintenance, and reclamation of roads used in connection
with a surface coal mining operation. Such regulation, should it extend to FDR's, is not a usurping of USFS's authority
to control roads under its jurisdiction, but it rather OSM fulfilling its mandate, under SMCRA, to ensure that lands
disturbed by surface coal mining operations are not permanently damaged.

Therefore, on the basis of the above discussion, OSM does not required Utah to amend its program in response to USFS's
comments.

By letters dated October 29, 1992, and August 16, 1993, the Army Corps of Engineers responded that the proposed changes
to the Utah program were satisfactory to that agency (administrative record Nos. UT-796 and UT-859).

By letter dated November 2, 1992, the Bureau of Land Management said that it had no concerns regarding the proposed
amendment (administrative record No. UT-797).

By letter dated October 22, 1992, the U.S. Bureau of Mines (BOM) said that it had no comments in response to the proposed
amendment (administrative record No. UT-793). By additional letters dated April 12 and August 10, 1993, BOM
responded that because the revised definitions of the terms ``affected area,'' ``road,'' and ``public road'' do
not affect the production of mineral resources other than coal, it had no comment (administrative record Nos. UT-831
and UT-854).

By letters dated October 23, 1992, and May 3 and August 12, 1993, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) said that
it found nothing of significant concern and had no comments on the proposed amendment (administrative record Nos.
UT-795, 838, and 856).

By letters dated January 14, May 12, and August 18, 1993, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) stated that
the proposed amendment did not conflict with current MSHA regulations (administrative record Nos. UT-818,
UT-841, and UT-860).


By letters dated June 10 and August 11, 1993, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) responded that it had no comments
on the proposed amendment (administrative record Nos. UT-844 and UT-855).


By letter dated April 14, 1993, the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) commented that, with respect to Utah's proposed
definition of the term ``road,'' ``hydrologic and erosion control measures'' need to be included as part of the road
as described in the second sentence of the definition. SCS further stated that this addition is needed because such
measures may be needed to mitigate the effects of drainage areas and watersheds of road construction and use (administrative
record No. UT-832).


In response, OSM has found in finding No. III.C.2. that Utah's proposed definition of the term ``road'' is substantively
identical to the Federal regulatory definition of ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5. In addition, Utah's rules at Utah Admin.
R. 645-301-752.200, .210, .220, and .250 set performance standards for primary and ancillary roads that
include hydrologic measures that are no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.150(b)(1),
(3), and (5) and 817.150(b)(1), (3), and (5). These State rules read as follows:





752.200. Road Drainage. Roads will be located, designed, constructed, reconstructed, used, maintained, and reclaimed
in according to R645-301-732.400, R645-301-742-400 and R645-301-762
and to achieve the following:

R645-301-752.210. Control or prevent erosion, siltation, and the air pollution attendant to erosion
by vegetating or otherwise stabilizing all exposed surfaces in accordance with current, prudent engineering practices;

R645-301-752.220. Control or prevent additional contributions of suspended solids to stream flow or
runoff outside the permit area;



* * * * *



R645-301-752.250. Refrain from significantly altering the normal flow of water in streambeds or drainage
channels.






Therefore, although Utah's proposed definition of ``road'' at Utah Admin. R. 645-100-200 does not include
SCS's recommended term ``hydrologic and erosion control measures,'' the aforementioned State rules do include
performance standards that mitigate the effects on drainage areas and watersheds of road construction and use them
in a manner no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations. On this basis, OSM cannot require Utah to
revise its program in response to SCS's comment.



C. State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP)




Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4), OSM is required to solicit comments from the SHPO and ACHP for all amendments that
may have an effect on historic properties. By letters dated October 16, 1992, and March 31, 1993, OSM solicited comments
from these offices (administrative record Nos. UT-791 and UT-828). Neither the SHPO nor the ACHP commented
on the proposed amendment.

Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), OSM is required to obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator of EPA
with respect to those aspects of a State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated
under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 

et seq.

) and the Clean Air Act, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 7401 

et seq.

). EPA gave its written concurrence with the proposed amendment by letter dated February 17, 1993 (administrative
record No. UT-826).



V. Director's Decision



Based on the above findings, the Director approves Utah's proposed amendment as submitted on September 17, 1992,
and revised on March 24, 1993. As discussed in finding No. III.C.1., the Director approves Utah's proposed amendment
to the term ``affected area.'' As discussed in finding No. III.C.2., the Director approves Utah's proposed amendment
to the term ``road,'' accepts Utah's withdrawal of the supplemental policy statement, and removes the required program
amendments codified at 30 CFR 944.16(n) (1) and (2). As discussed in finding No. III.C.3., the Director approves Utah's
proposed amendment to the term ``public road'' and removes the required program amendment at 30 CFR 944.16(o). The
Director is approving these proposed rules with the provision that they be fully promulgated in identical form to
the rules submitted to and reviewed by OSM and the public.

In accordance with 30 CFR 732.17(f)(1), the Director is also taking this opportunity to clarify in the required amendment
section at 30 CFR 944.16 that, within 60 days of the publishing of this notice, Utah would have to either submit a proposed
written amendment, or a description of an amendment to be proposed that meets the requirements of SMCRA and 30 CFR chapter
VII and a timetable for enactment that is consistent with Utah's established administrative or legislative procedures.

The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 944, which codify decisions concerning the Utah program, are being amended
to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue
delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.



VI. Procedural Determinations



A. Executive Order 12866



This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).



B. Executive Order 12778



The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.



C. National Environmental Policy Act

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940407-0-00033 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940407-0-00004 </PARENT>

No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).



D. Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.

).



E. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Treasury Department is amending appendix A to the Haitian Transactions Regulations to add as section I of appendix
A the names of individuals whom the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control has determined are blocked individuals
of Haiti, either because they are included within the definition of the ``

de facto

 regime in Haiti'' as defined in Executive Order 12755, or because they meet criteria for blocking set forth in Executive
Orders 12853 and 12872. Property of these individuals that is located in the United States or within the possession
or control of U.S. persons, including their overseas branches, is blocked, and transactions with these persons are
prohibited.

Background


The Office of Foreign Assets Control (``FAC'') is amending appendix A to the Haitian Transactions Regulations, 31
CFR part 580 (the ``Regulations''), to add a list of blocked individuals of Haiti as new section I to appendix A. Section
I identifies individuals whose assets are blocked pursuant to Executive Order 12755 of October 4, 1991, Executive
Order 12853 of June 30, 1993, or Executive Order 12872 of October 18, 1993. It supplements the list of blocked entities
in section II of appendix A. 
On July 27, 1993, FAC published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 40043) appendix A to Part 580, establishing a list of persons and entities whose assets were blocked, based upon
a determination by the Director of FAC pursuant to  580.305(a) of the Regulations that they were included within
the definition of the ``

de facto

 regime in Haiti.'' Section I of appendix A identified individuals and section II identified entities of the 

de facto

 regime whose assets were blocked.
Effective August 31, 1993, section I of appendix A was revoked consistent with United Nations Security Council Resolution
(``UNSCR'') 841 calling for the suspension of certain sanctions against Haiti in light of the Governors Island Agreement.
See 58 FR 46540 (September 2, 1993). The assets of individuals identified in section I were unblocked, while the assets
of entities identified in section II were, and remain, blocked. On October 18, 1993, trade and other sanctions against
Haiti were reimposed pursuant to Executive Order 12853, consistent with UNSCR Resolution 873. Reimposition of U.S.
sanctions included the blocking of assets of certain classes of individuals.
This amendment incorporates in new section I to appendix A a list of individuals whose assets have been blocked subsequent
to the reimposition of sanctions against Haiti. Included in section I are individuals who were identified in a November
1, 1993 notice in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 58480) as blocked individuals of Haiti, as well as individuals whose assets were later blocked. The persons
identified in section I are included for one or more of the following reasons:
A. They are persons who seized power illegally from the democratically elected government of President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide on September 30, 1991, or who, since October 4, 1991 (the effective date of Executive Order 12775), have acted
or purported to act directly or indirectly on behalf of, or under the asserted authority of, such persons or of any agencies,
instrumentalities, or entities purporting to act on behalf of the 

de facto

 regime in Haiti, or under the asserted authority thereof, or any extraconstitutional successor thereto;
B. They are Haitian nationals (as defined in Executive Order 12853) who have provided substantial financial or material
contributions to the 

de facto

 regime in Haiti or done substantial business with the 

de facto

 regime in Haiti; or
C. They have (1) contributed to the obstruction of the implementation of UNSCR Resolution 841 and 873, the Governors
Island Agreement of July 3, 1993, or the activities of the United Nations Mission in Haiti, (2) perpetuated or contributed
to the violence in Haiti, or (3) materially or financially supported any of the activities described in items (1) or
(2) of this paragraph.
The designations in this amendment are made by FAC pursuant to the exercises of authority in Executive Orders 12775,
12779, 12853 and 12872, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701 through 1706, the United
Nations Participation Act, 11 U.S.C. 287c, and the Regulations. These provisions block all property and interests
in property of the blocked individuals that is located in the United States or within the possession or control of U.S.
persons, including their overseas branches. U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in transactions with these
individuals unless the transactions are licensed in advance by FAC.
Payments and transfers of funds owed to blocked individuals may be made, pursuant to a specific license issued by FAC,
into a blocked account held in the name of the blocked individual at a U.S. financial institution located in the United
States.
This list is not all-inclusive and will be updated from time to time. One cannot assume that an individual is not a blocked
person based solely on his or her non-inclusion in section I of appendix A. In particular, it should be noted that all
members of the Haitian armed forces are deemed to be blocked individuals of Haiti, as they are deemed to constitute
part of the 

de facto

 regime in Haiti within the meaning of   580.303 and 580.305(a) of the Regulations. Accordingly, all assets
in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons of these individuals are blocked, and U.S. persons
are prohibited from engaging in transactions with them unless licensed by FAC. Section II of appendix A, listing blocked
entities of the 

de facto

 regime in Haiti, remains in full effect and force.
Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and
delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, does not apply.

Note:

 Section I of appendix A lists the names of individuals whom the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control has
determined are blocked individuals of Haiti, either because they are included within the definition of the ``

de facto

 regime in Haiti'' as defined in Executive Order 12755, or because they meet criteria for blocking set forth in Executive
Orders 12853 and 12872. Section II of appendix A identifies entities of the 

de facto

 regime in Haiti whose assets are blocked. Property of these individuals and entities that is located in the United
States or within the possession or control of U.S. persons, including their overseas branches, is blocked, and transactions
with these individuals and entities are prohibited.


The information listed below is the most complete information now available to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
The absence of any particular person from appendix A is not to be construed as evidence that the person is not a part of,
or owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act directly or indirectly on behalf of, the 

de facto

 regime in Haiti, or is not otherwise a blocked individual or entity of Haiti pursuant to Executive Orders 12755, 12799,
12853 and 12872.

Simplified Alternative Procedure for Resolving Civil Penalty Cases



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is issuing an Interim Final Rule (IFR) to allow for greater delegation by the District Commander, and
to allow for a simplified alternative procedure for resolving civil penalty cases to be tested in three pilot ports
for a period of six months. This procedure should streamline the civil penalty process for certain oil discharge and
pollution prevention civil penalty cases by allowing a Coast Guard official to present a Notice of Violation and proposed
penalty to a party in the field. Results of the pilot program will be used in determining whether the program should
be implemented nationally and amending the final rule, if appropriate.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Request for Comments



The Coast Guard is encouraging comments on this interim rule in order to consider as many perspectives as possible
on the impacts of employing this process and to evaluate its use as an enforcement tool prior to national implementation.
Interested persons should submit written data, views, or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include
their names and addresses, identify this rulemaking (CGD 93-079) and the specific section of this interim rule
to which each comment applies, and give the reason for each comment. The Coast Guard requests that all comments and
attachments be submitted in an unbound format suitable for copying and electronic filing. If not practical, a second
copy of any bound materials is requested. Persons wanting acknowledgment of receipt of comments should enclose a
stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope.

The Coast Guard will consider all comments received during the comment period. This interim final rule may be changed
in view of the comments.


The Coast Guard plans no public hearing. Persons may request a public hearing by writing to the Marine Safety Council
at the address under ``ADDRESSES

.'' The request should include reasons why a hearing would be beneficial. If it determines that the opportunity for
oral presentations will aid this rulemaking, the Coast Guard will hold a public hearing in a time and place announced
by a later notice in the 

Federal Register

.



Drafting Information



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Lieutenant Commander Richard Gaudiosi, Project Manager,
Marine Environmental Protection Division, and C.G. Green, Project Counsel, Office of the Chief Counsel.

Background and Purpose



The current procedures for assessing civil penalties by the Coast Guard are contained in 33 CFR 1.07. Generally this
process begins when an alleged violation is detected by or reported to a Coast Guard official. The alleged violation
is investigated, and if it appears that the elements for a violation case exist, civil enforcement action is initiated
by preparing a case report with a recommended penalty and forwarding it with the case file to the appropriate Coast
Guard District office for review. The District office reviews the report to determine whether there is in fact evidence
of a prima facie case and whether the assessment of the recommended penalty by a Hearing Officer is appropriate. It
then transmits the case file with a recommended action to the Hearing Officer. Based on this case file, the Hearing
Officer makes an independent determination as to whether a violation appears to have been committed. If so, the Hearing
Officer sends a Letter of Notification to the alleged violator that specifies, among other matters, the alleged violation(s)
and a penalty amount that appears to be appropriate.

A party may pay the penalty amount specified as being appropriate by the Hearing Officer, request an in-person hearing,
or provide written evidence or arguments in lieu of a hearing. If the party pays the penalty, the case is closed and no
further action is required. If the party chooses either of the latter two options, the Hearing Officer either conducts
an in-person hearing or reviews the written evidence and arguments, and then issues a written decision assessing
a penalty or dismissing the case. The Hearing Officer's decision may be administratively appealed to the Commandant
of the Coast Guard.

As applied to small (under 100 gallons) oil discharges and pollution prevention violations, the current civil penalty
assessment process is not administratively efficient for many uncontested cases. Further, the time required to
process these violations minimizes the deterrent effect of the sanction. It is not uncommon for a party to have additional
violations before being notified of the initiation of action for the first violation.

There is a need for a process where notice of violation can be given in the field to allow for early resolution of apparent
small oil spill and pollution prevention violations. Such a process would save the time and cost of unnecessary internal
review, improve deterrence, and enable corrective action by providing a party with earlier notice of violations.
Each party would have the option of paying a proposed penalty or pursuing their right to a hearing.



Notice of Violation



This rule amends 33 CFR 1.07 to provide a simplified procedure to expedite processing of certain civil penalty violation
cases. An interim final rule is being published to test the simplified procedure. A pilot program will be conducted
in three ports, prior to a final rule which would be implemented nationwide. The pilot program will be conducted for
six months in the ports of Charleston, SC, Galveston, TX, and Los Angeles, CA.

The procedures will allow settlement of cases following the issuance by a Coast Guard issuing officer of a Notice of
Violation containing a proposed penalty. A Coast Guard issuing officer will be a commissioned, warrant, or petty
officer, with specific training and authority to issue a Notice of Violation.

A party will have the option of either paying the proposed penalty, requesting determination by a Hearing Officer,
or taking no action on the Notice of Violation. Where a party decides to pay the proposed penalty indicated on a Notice
of Violation, there will be no District Program Manager or Hearing Officer involved and the case will be closed. Where
a party requests a determination by a Hearing Officer or takes no action, a full case file will be sent to the District
Commander, in accordance with present procedure, for review prior to forwarding to the Hearing Officer. Upon receipt
by the Hearing Officer, the case will be processed under the current procedures. Any adverse action by the Hearing
Officer will be subject to administrative appeal under the current procedures. A party who takes no action on a Notice
of Violation or who requests determination by a Hearing Officer may find the preliminary assessment issued by the
Hearing Officer to be equal to or greater than that specified on the Notice of Violation.

<DOCNO> FR940407-0-00038 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940407-0-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Use of the simplified procedure will initially be limited, by internal guidance, to certain requirements and prohibitions
subject to Class I Administrative Civil Penalties under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) as amended.
A Notice of Violation can be issued for two types of violations: (1) Oil discharges in violation of the FWPCA, if they
are 100 gallons or less, and (2) pollution prevention violations (33 CFR parts 154, 155, 156).

Coast Guard issuing officers will issue a Notice of Violation with a proposed penalty only in clear-cut cases as determined
by applying specific written guidance. Proposed penalty amounts would be taken from a penalty schedule based on objective
criteria. Any case in which aggravating or extenuating circumstances are evidenced, or which concern violations
not included in specific guidance documents, may be referred to the Hearing Officer for processing under current
procedures.



Delegation by the District Commander



This rule will also allow more flexibility on the part of the District Commander to delegate authority for review of
alleged violations to any person under the District Commander's command. For example, the District Commander could
delegate review authority to the Captain of the Port for certain pollution prevention violations, thus eliminating
the need for review by the District Commander's staff, prior to the case being forwarded to a Hearing Officer. Such
a delegation would streamline the processing of a violation case and would be in the best interest of the public and
the party involved.



Regulatory Implementation



Based on the results of the pilot test and internal and external comments received on the IFR, the Coast Guard will determine
whether the procedure should be implemented nationally and will make revisions to the final rule and internal guidance,
if appropriate. This approach will facilitate implementation without disrupting the existing civil penalty process
for cases involving violations other than oil discharge or pollution prevention violations. However, the rule is
designed to allow extension of the simplified process to other Coast Guard programs without additional amendments
to 33 CFR 1.07.

Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), procedural rules are exempt from the notice and comment procedures
and, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), the promulgating agency may omit notice and comment. Further, under the alternative
simplified procedure established by this IFR, a party will continue to have the option of requesting a hearing, as
under current regulations. Therefore, the Coast Guard has determined that these regulations may be promulgated
without prior notice and opportunity for comment.

Since the public interest would not be served by delaying the date of the interim rule, and a party will continue to have
the option of requesting a hearing, as under current regulations, the Coast Guard has also determined that under 5
U.S.C. 533(d), these rules may be made effective upon publication.

Nonetheless, as previously discussed in this preamble, the Coast Guard is requesting comment on this interim rule
and its pilot implementation program.



Regulatory Evaluation 



This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, does not require an assessment
of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order, and has not been reviewed under that order. It
is not significant under the ``Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040;
February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this procedural rule to be so minimal that a full
Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary. The total annual cost to the public from civil penalties should not be changed
by this proposal. Savings to the government will be realized from the reduction in administrative costs to enforce
civil penalties by eliminating the need for review by the District Commander or action by the Hearing Officer in cases
where the penalty specified in a Notice of Violation is paid by the party within the allowed time.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this rulemaking
will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently
owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business
concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). Because it expects the impact of this proposal
to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rulemaking will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. If, however, you think that your business qualifies as a small entity
and that this rulemaking will have significant economic impact on your business, please submit a comment (see 

ADDRESSES

) explaining why you think your business qualifies and in what way and to what degree this rulemaking will economically
affect your business.

Collection of Information


This rulemaking contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 et seq.).


Federalism


The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has
determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment.


Environment


The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rulemaking and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of
Commandant Instruction M1645.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
Procedural rules do not require environmental impact studies. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available
in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under 

ADDRESSES.

Special Local Regulations: Key West Super Boat Race



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Temporary final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Special local regulations are being adopted for the Key West Super Boat Race sponsored by Super Boat Racing, Inc. This
event will be held on April 9, 1994, between 1 p.m. and 4 p.m. EST (Eastern Standard Time). The regulations are needed
to provide for the safety of life on navigable waters during the event.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for these regulations and good
cause exists for making them effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. Updated information regarding the date and time of the event was not received
until February and March 1993, respectively, and there was not sufficient time remaining to publish proposed rules
in advance of the event or to provide for a delayed effective date.



Drafting Information



The drafters of this regulation are QMC K.T. Coyne, project officer, USCG Group Key West, and LT J.M. Losego, project
attorney, Seventh Coast District Legal Office.



Discussion of Regulations



Approximately 30 to 40 power boats are expected to participate in the Key West Super Boat Race, with 100 spectator craft
expected. The power boats will be competing at high speeds and operating in close proximity to each other and to spectator
craft, creating an extra or unusual hazard in the navigable waters.



Federalism



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.



Environmental Assessment



The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposal consistent with section 2.B.2.08 of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, and this proposal has been determined to be categorically excluded. Specifically, the Coast
Guard has consulted with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service regarding the
environmental impact of this event, and it was determined that the event does not jeopardize the continued existence
of protected species. As a condition to this permit the applicant is required to educate the operators of spectator
craft and parade participants regarding the possible presence of manatees and the appropriate precautions to take
if the animals are sighted.

Drawbridge Operation Regulations, Unnecessary Openings



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The Coast Guard amends the regulations that govern the nation's drawbridges by clarifying the responsibilities
of vessel operators requesting drawbridge openings and prohibiting vessel operators from signalling for unnecessary
drawbridge openings. This action is intended to better accommodate the needs of vehicular traffic and reduce the
wear and tear on draw machinery while still providing for the reasonable needs of navigation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Drafting Information



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Mr. Larry R. Tyssens, Project Manager, and Ms. Helen
Boutrous, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel. 



Regulatory History



On July 8, 1993, the Coast Guard published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) entitled ``Drawbridge Operation
Regulations, Unnecessary Openings'' in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 36629). In addition, the Commander, Eighth Coast Guard District, published the proposal in a Public Notice
dated July 28, 1993. Opportunity for comment on the proposal was provided until August 23, 1993. The Coast Guard received
4 letters commenting on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested and one was not held. 



Background and Purpose



Currently, 33 CFR 117.11 specifies that no vessel owner or operator shall signal a drawbridge to open for any nonstructural
vessel appurtenance which is not essential to navigation or which is easily lowered. This section does not address
vessels that have no appurtenances and that can pass safely underneath the drawbridge in question in the closed position,
or vessels which signal for a drawbridge opening with no intention of passing through the bridge. Under  117.5,
drawtenders are required to open a drawbridge when a proper signal is given. Unnecessary drawbridge openings can
cause vehicular delays and inordinate wear and tear on draw machinery. Therefore, it has been determined that there
is a need for a regulation requiring that vessel owners and operators refrain from requesting such unnecessary drawbridge
openings. Also, it has been determined that defining the terms used in the regulation would provide mariners with
additional guidance concerning their responsibilities under the regulations when requesting the opening of a drawbridge.



Discussion of Comments



Four letters were received in response to the NPRM. The first comment was from a private towing company which stated
that their business had no problem with the proposed regulation and fully supported the change. The second response
was from a private statewide transportation agency which endorsed the proposed regulation. The third response was
from the New Jersey Department of Transportation which also supported the proposed amendment. The fourth response
was from the Governor's Office of the State of Florida which has determined that the proposed regulation will not significantly
affect the coastal water and adjacent shorelands of the State of Florida and is therefore consistent with the Florida
Coastal Management Program. No changes were made to the final rule as a result of these comments.

Regulatory Assessment



This rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under the ``Department
of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects
the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Assessment is unnecessary. This rule is operational
in nature and, if adopted, will result in no cost to the public.



Small Entities



This rule requires no new equipment and imposes no additional expense on small businesses. Additionally, this rule
will decrease vehicular delay. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under Section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This rulemaking contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

).



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this rulemaking in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612 and has determined that it does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment. The authority to regulate the nation's drawbridges across the navigable rivers and other
waters of the U.S. has been committed to the Coast Guard by Federal statutes. Therefore, the Coast Guard does not expect
this rule to raise any preemption issues with respect to State actions on the same subject matter.



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this final rule and concluded that under section 2.B.2. of
Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rulemaking is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation
because it is a Bridge Administration Program action involving the promulgation of operating requirements or procedures
for drawbridges. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for inspection or copying where
indicated under 

ADDRESSES.

2. Section 117.4 is added to read as follows:



 117.4 

Definitions.




Certain terms used in this part are defined in this section.




Appurtenance.

 The term ``appurtenance'' means an attachment or accessory extending beyond the hull or superstructure that is not
an integral part of the vessel and is not needed for a vessel's piloting, propelling, controlling, or collision avoidance
capabilities.




Lowerable.

 The term ``lowerable'' means the nonstructural vessel appurtenance can be mechanically or manually lowered and
raised again. The term ``lowerable'' also applies to a nonstructural vessel appurtenance which can be modified to
make the item flexible, hinged, collapsible, or telescopic such that it can be mechanically or manually lowered and
raised again. Failure to make the modification is considered equivalent to refusing to lower a lowerable nonstructural
appurtenance that is not essential to navigation. Examples of appurtenances which are considered to be lowerable
include, but are not limited to, fishing outriggers, radio antennae, television antennae, false stacks, and masts
purely for ornamental purposes. Examples of appurtenances which are not considered to be lowerable include, but
are not limited to, radar antennae, flying bridges, sailboat masts, piledriver leads, spud frames on hydraulic dredges,
drilling derricks' substructures and buildings, cranes on drilling or construction vessels, or other items of permanent
and fixed equipment.




Nonstructural.

 The term ``nonstructural'' means that the item is not rigidly fixed to the vessel and is thus susceptible to relocation
or alteration.




Not essential to navigation.

 The term ``not essential to navigation'' means the nonstructural vessel appurtenance does not adversely affect
the vessel's piloting, propulsion, control, or collision avoidance capabilities when in the lowered position.


3. Section 117.11 is revised to read as follows:



 117.11 

Unnecessary opening of the draw.




No vessel owner or operator shall_


(a) Signal a drawbridge to open if the vertical clearance is sufficient to allow the vessel, after all lowerable nonstructural
vessel appurtenances that are not essential to navigation have been lowered, to safely pass under the drawbridge
in the closed position; or

(b) Signal a drawbridge to open for any purpose other than to pass through the drawbridge opening.

Temporary Amendment to Inland Waterways Navigation Regulations Establishing Speed Limits on Connecting Waters
From Lake Huron to Lake Erie


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Temporary final rule; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commander of the Ninth Coast Guard District, in cooperation with Canadian authorities, is renewing, with minor
changes, a temporary, trial regulation previously in effect during the 1993 navigation season. This temporary regulation,
as before, amends the speed limits on connecting waters from Lake Huron to Lake Erie. The normal speed limits in this
area are determined in large part by concerns about wake damage. However, lesser wakes are created by nondisplacement
power vessels and it appears that the speed limits may unnecessarily impede their passage. The temporary regulation
allows nondisplacement power vessels, less than 100 gross tons, to exceed the normal speed limits subject to certain
restrictions. Generally, the minor changes in this version of the temporary regulation (in comparison to the previous
version of the temporary regulation) place more restrictions on the use of the higher speeds by the operators of the
nondisplacement vessels in order to better ensure safe, effectively regulated operations. The purpose of this temporary
regulation, as before, is to test the feasibility and safety of the operation of nondisplacement vessels in the connecting
waters from Lake Huron to Lake Erie. During this period of continued trial, the Commander of the Ninth Coast Guard District
invites further public comment on this regulation or future versions thereof for the purpose of either amendments
to this temporary regulation or for the purpose of considering a permanent change to the standing regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Request for Comments 



Comments on this regulation, including comments on the prior version in effect during the 1993 navigation season,
or future regulations of the same nature, on either a temporary or permanent basis, are all invited. All comments received
will be considered in any proposal for a final rulemaking at the end of the 1994 navigation season. The Coast Guard does
not currently plan to have a public hearing, but consideration will be given to holding such a hearing if it is requested.
Such a request should indicate how a public hearing would contribute substantial information or views which cannot
be received in written form. If it appears that a public hearing would substantially contribute to revisions or further
refinements of this rulemaking, the Coast Guard will announce such a hearing by a later notice in the 

Federal Register

. 



Discussion of Comment Period 



In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this 1994 regulation, and good
cause exists for making it effective less than 30 days after 

Federal Register

 publication. A notice of proposed rulemaking is unnecessary under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B) because this regulation
is simply a continuation, with minor amendments, of the 1993 regulation noticed on January 13, 1993 (58 FR 4130) and
promulgated on April 5, 1993 (58 FR 17526). The minor amendments made in this version of the regulation reduce rather
than expand the scope of the operating exemptions granted by the prior version. The Coast Guard published a Notice
of Proposed Rulemaking for the 1993 temporary rule and invited comments from the public. No adverse comments were
received. Repetition of the prior notice period would be contrary to the public interest as well as unnecessary under
5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B) because it would impede the further testing of a commercial innovation which so far has proved
to be safe without adding significantly to the opportunity to make public comments. Additional comments are invited
during the continuation of the test period in the 1994 navigation season and the Commander of the Ninth Coast Guard
District will consider all comments received before November 1, 1994. 

Finally, the requirement for 30 days notice before the effective date of the regulation is not applicable under 5 U.S.C.
553(d)(1) because this temporary action is a substantive action to ``relieve a restriction'' on commerce otherwise
imposed by the standing regulations. This temporary regulation will lessen the restrictiveness of the speed limits
otherwise applicable to nondisplacement vessels in the connecting waters from Lake Huron to Lake Erie in the absence
of any temporary regulation. 



Background and Purpose 



Current regulations in 33 CFR 162.138 which apply to connecting waters from Lake Huron to Lake Erie set maximum speed
for vessels 20 meters or more in length at limits ranging from 4 to 12 statute miles per hour in various areas. One of the
primary purposes of these speed regulations is to limit wake damage. The standing regulations were not written to
account for the substantially lesser wake-generating characteristics of nondisplacement vessels. In fact, certain
vessels designed for nondisplacement operation would generate larger wakes at the lower speeds now required because
they would be forced to operate in a displacement mode. During the 1993 navigation season, the Commander of the Ninth
Coast Guard District temporarily amended 33 CFR 162.138 in order to allow trial runs of nondisplacement vessels which
requested permission to operate in the nondisplacement mode in the area (33 CFR 162.T139, 58 FR 17526, April 5, 1993).
A corresponding exemption was granted by the Central Region of the Canadian Coast Guard, which has authority over
the Canadian waters in the same area. That trial period allowed nondisplacement vessels less than 100 gross tons to
operate in the nondisplacement mode at speeds not more than 40 statute miles per hour. During the 1993 trial period,
one complaint was received alleging excessive wake. Upon investigation, it appeared that the vessel gave the impression
of creating an excessive wake because of its relatively high rate of speed during a sharp turn. The Coast Guard was unable
to determine if in fact an excessive wake was generated in that one case. There was no damage, and the operator agreed
to modify similar maneuvers in the future in order to avoid any problem. Also, it should be noted that this amendment
of the speed limit for nondisplacement vessels does not in any way excuse the general obligation to exercise good seamanship
when maneuvering in close quarters or the responsibility for damage which might be caused by a wake which is excessive
in a location close to other vessels or shore structures. No subsequent complaints of any kind were received by the
Canadian Coast Guard or the U.S. Coast Guard. 

With concurrence from the Director General of the Canadian Coast Guard Central Region, the Commander of the Ninth
Coast Guard District considers it appropriate to institute another temporary test period during the 1994 navigation
season. This new period will extend from April 1, 1994 through November 30, 1994. During this time, the Commander of
the Ninth Coast Guard District will test the feasibility of some minor refinements to the prior version of the temporary
regulation. Generally, these refinements place more conditions on the use of the higher speeds by the operators of
the nondisplacement vessels in order to better ensure safe, effectively regulated operations. 

As before, the Commander of the Ninth Coast Guard District is setting an upper limit of 40 statute miles per hour for
nondisplacement vessels 20 meters or more in length but less than 100 gross tons, and is allowing such nondisplacement
vessels to overtake other vessels when otherwise safe. All other navigational regulations will remain in force.
This regulation specifically provides that it does not preempt any state or local law or regulation setting a lower
speed limit applicable to nondisplacement vessel in areas under the jurisdiction of such state or local authority.
(The Canadian Coast Guard Central Region is also stipulating that the higher speed limit will not be applicable to
certain harbors areas in Canada, particularly the harbor of Windsor, Ontario.) Each vessel operator shall submit
a schedule to the Captain of the Port Detroit at least thirty days in advance for each anticipated excursion. The schedule
shall contain an itinerary for each excursion including dates, arrival and departure times, all destination points,
and the nature of the excursion, i.e., passengers, no passengers, etc. The vessel operator must then confirm each
excursion with the Captain of the Port Detroit between three and seven working days prior to the intended date of the
departure. This will give the Captain of the Port time to anticipate potential conflicts with scheduled marine events,
and allow timely notice through a Broadcast Notice to Mariners. Any excursion schedule not submitted within the thirty
day time frame may be subject to Captain of the Port disapproval. These special provisions for nondisplacement vessels
will apply only during daylight hours, defined as sunrise to sunset. The Captain of the Port or Commander, Ninth Coast
Guard District may revoke approval of operations at the increased speed for the remainder of the navigation season
due to an operator's failure to comply with any of these requirements. 



Drafting Information 



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Lieutenant (junior grade) Katherine E. Weathers and
Commander M. Eric Reeves, Project Managers, and Commander Robert G. Blythe, Project Counsel. 



Environment 



The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this regulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c.
of Coast Guard Commandment Instruction M16475.1B, it is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.

Federalism


This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that this regulation does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment. This regulation does not impose any new regulatory requirements in an area not heretofore
regulated by the Federal Government, and does not impose any requirements or restrictions on State or local authorities.
This regulation specifically provided that it does not preempt any state or local law or regulation setting a lower
speed limit applicable to nondisplacement vessel in areas under the jurisdiction of such state or local authority.



Regulatory Evaluation


This temporary final rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not
significant under the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034 of February
26, 1979). 


Small Entities


The economic impact of this regulation is expected to be so minimal that a full evaluation is unnecessary. In fact,
the Coast Guard is making this amendment in part in order to avoid causing the existing regulations to have an unintended
economic impact on a new mode of commercial operation. Since the impact of this regulation is expected to be minimal,
the Coast Guard certifies that, if adopted, it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. 


Collection of Information


The regulation will impose no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C.
3501 et seq. 


List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 162


Navigation (water), Waterways.

North Dakota; Final Authorization of State Hazardous Waste Management Program 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency. 



Action: 

Immediate final rule. 



</AGENCY>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The State of North Dakota has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed North Dakota's
application and has made a decision, subject to public review and comment, that North Dakota's hazardous waste program
revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve
North Dakota's hazardous waste program revisions. North Dakota's application for program revision is available
for public review and comment.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Background 


States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or
the ``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6929 (b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent
to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. 
Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority
is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes
to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260-268 and 270. Modification to the Federal program, due to statutory
and regulatory changes, requires subsequent modifications to the State authorized program. Until the State is authorized
for such modifications, EPA is responsible for implementing and enforcing the modification in the State. Further,
if the State law which forms the basis of the federally authorized State program is amended, the State must promptly
seek revision authorization for those provisions. Until the amendments to State law are authorized by EPA, the regulated
community must ensure compliance with both the federally authorized State program and the non-authorized Federal
program. The regulated community may also need to comply with current State laws in the situation where State law has
been amended after Federal authorization has been granted. 


B. North Dakota 


North Dakota initially received final authorization in October 1984. North Dakota received authorization for revisions
to its program on August 24, 1990. On February 23, 1994, North Dakota submitted a final program revision application
for additional program approvals. Today, North Dakota is seeking approval of its program revision in accordance
with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). 
In the previous revision authorization published on August 24, 1990, EPA included authorization of the direct action
against insurers, HSWA section 3004(t) provision to North Dakota. It was later determined this provision is not delegable.
Therefore, EPA is clarifying with this notice that the direct action against insurers to North Dakota is withdrawn.
The Federal cause of action provided by RCRA 3004(t) remains in effect in authorized states. The State law equivalent
to 3004(t) operates separately from the Federal law and, in this situation, the North Dakota law which provides for
a direct cause of action against insurers operates as an additional authority to the Federal authority.

EPA has reviewed North Dakota's application, and has made an immediate final decision that North Dakota's hazardous
waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently,
EPA intends to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to North Dakota. The public may
submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until May 9, 1994. Copies of North Dakota's application
for program revision are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the Addresses 

section of this notice. 
Approval of North Dakota's program revision shall become effective in 60 days unless an adverse comment pertaining
to the State's revision discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. If an adverse comment
is received EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision; or (2) a notice containing a
response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision.

EPA's comments on the draft application were addressed in the final application. Thus, the North Dakota program is
only granted final authorization for those provisions specifically listed in Table 1.

North Dakota has not requested authorization to operate its hazardous waste program, as revised, in ``Indian Country''
as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151. Accordingly, EPA's decision to grant North Dakota final hazardous waste authorization,
as revised, does not extend to ``Indian Country''. The Environmental Protection Agency retains all hazardous waste
authority under RCRA which applies to Indian Country in North Dakota. 
Today, North Dakota is seeking approval of its program revision in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). Specific
provisions which are included in the North Dakota program authorization revision sought today are listed in Table
1 below.

C. Decision 


I conclude that North Dakota's application for program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements
established by RCRA. Accordingly, North Dakota is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program
as revised. 
North Dakota now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders
and carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program, subject to the limitation of its revised program application and
previously approved authorities. North Dakota also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains
the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement actions under sections 3008, 3013,
and 7003 of RCRA. The State of North Dakota will submit a draft application for Non-HSWA cluster 6 and HSWA cluster 2
by June 30, 1994. 


Compliance With Executive Order 12866 


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.



Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of North Dakota's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements
for handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

Colorado; Final Authorization of State Hazardous Waste Management Program Revisions


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Environmental Protection Agency.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Immediate final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The State of Colorado has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Colorado's application
and has made a decision, subject to public review and comment, that Colorado's hazardous waste program revision satisfies
all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve Colorado's hazardous
waste program revisions. Colorado's application for program revision is available for public review and comment.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Background


States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6929(b), have a continuing obligation to
maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the federal
hazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Public
Law 98-616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'') allows states to revise their programs to become substantially
equivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements promulgated under HSWA authority. States exercising the
latter option receive ``interim authorization'' for the HSWA requirements under section 3006(g), of RCRA, 42 U.S.C.
6926(g), and later apply for final authorization for the HSWA requirements.
Revisions to state hazardous waste programs are necessary when federal or state statutory or regulatory authority
is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, state program revisions are necessitated by changes
to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260-266, 268, 124 and 270.


B. Colorado


Colorado initially received final authorization on November 2, 1984. Colorado received authorization for revisions
to its program on November 7, 1986, on July 14, 1989, and on July 9, 1991. On February 28, 1991, Colorado submitted a draft
program revision application for additional revisions, and on October 1, 1993, Colorado submitted a final program
revision application. Today, Colorado is seeking approval of these program revisions in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3).
EPA has reviewed Colorado's draft and final applications, and has made an immediate final decision that Colorado's
hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization.
Consequently, EPA intends to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to Colorado. The
public may submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until May 9, 1994. Copies of Colorado's application
for program revision are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the Addresses 

section of this notice.

Approval of Colorado's program revision shall become effective in 60 days unless an adverse comment pertaining to
the State's revision discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. If an adverse comment is
received EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision; or (2) a notice containing a response
to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision.

In February 1991 Colorado submitted a draft application for EPA review. EPA provided comments on the draft application
to the State in May 1992 and additional comments in May 1993. EPA's comments on the draft application were fully addressed
in the final application submitted in October 1993. However, EPA has identified minor differences in the following
provisions of the State regulation as reflected in the final application: Colorado Code of Regulations 261.4(b)(7);
261.8; 262.11(c); 268.1(c)(2); 268.6; 268.7(b)(7); 268.35(d); 268.40(b); 268.41(a); 268.42(b); 268.44; 268.50(d);
and 100.22(c)(4). Colorado has committed to revising each of these regulatory provisions, and anticipates that
these revisions will be adopted by April 1994. Accordingly, EPA intends to proceed with authorization rather than
continue the dual regulatory scheme that presently exists. Thus, the Colorado program is granted immediate final
authorization for the provisions set forth in the following table.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940407-0-00058 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940407-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The program revisions addressed by Colorado's final application include the first, second, and third third land
disposal restrictions, mining waste exclusions, revisions to the Toxicity Characteristic, standards for incinerators,
tanks and miscellaneous units, and ground water monitoring. Certain of the land disposal restriction provisions
are not delegable to states. EPA is not authorizing Colorado for these non-delegable provisions, which include 40
CFR 268.5; 268.6; 268.42(b); and 268.44. Federal regulations allow exemptions to certain of the land disposal restrictions
for certain wastes that are disposed of in injection wells. Since Colorado does not allow the disposal of hazardous
waste in injection wells, their program is more stringent that the federal program for these provisions.

Some of the federal land disposal restrictions imposed time-limited prohibitions against land disposal of certain
wastes. Since Colorado's date of adoption of these regulatory provisions in many cases was after the time-limited
prohibition expired, the Colorado regulations do not include these prohibitions or impose a later effective date
for the prohibition than the date set forth in the corresponding federal regulation. These differing dates do not
affect the equivalency of Colorado's program, since prior violations of these prohibitions remains enforceable
by EPA under federal regulation.

Colorado has not requested hazardous waste program authority on Indian Country. EPA retains all hazardous waste
authority under RCRA which applies to Indian Country in Colorado.



C. Decision



I conclude that Colorado's application for program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements
established by RCRA. Accordingly, Colorado is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program
as revised.

Colorado now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders
and carrying out the aspects of the RCRA program described in its revised program application, subject to the limitations
of the HSWA. Colorado also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections
under section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement actions under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA.

In addition, Colorado has agreed to submit a draft application for remaining provisions from Non-HSWA Clusters III-VI,
HSWA Clusters I and II, and RCRA Cluster I and partial Cluster II in April 1994. The final application will be submitted
within 60 working days of receipt of EPA's comments on the draft application.



Compliance With Executive Order 12866



The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.



Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act



Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain federal regulations in favor of Colorado's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for
handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is closing the directed fishery for Pacific ocean perch in the Aleutian Islands subarea (AI) of the Bering Sea
and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the Pacific ocean perch
total allowable catch (TAC) in the AI. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI 
exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce 
according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish 
Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson
Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP
at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. 



In accordance with  675.20(a)(7)(ii) the Pacific ocean perch TAC for the AI was established by the final 1994
initial groundfish specifications (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) as 9,265 metric tons (mt). 

The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with  675.20(a)(8),
that the Pacific ocean perch TAC in the AI soon will be reached. Therefore, the Regional Director has established a
directed fishing allowance of 8,265 mt, with consideration that 1,000 mt will be taken as incidental catch in directed
fishing for other species in the AI. The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance has
been reached. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Pacific ocean perch in the AI, effective from
12 noon, A.l.t. April 4, 1994, through 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. 

Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be 
found in the regulations at  675.20(h).

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule and guidance.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action promulgates rules for economic incentive programs (EIP's) which either may or must be adopted by States
for certain ozone (O

3

) and carbon monoxide (CO) nonattainment areas upon the failure of a State to submit an adequate showing that an applicable
reasonable further progress (RFP) or a specific emissions reductions milestone has been met (in serious, severe,
and extreme O

3

 and serious CO nonattainment areas) or upon the failure of a serious CO nonattainment area to attain the national ambient
air quality standards (NAAQS) for CO. Under the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (Act), the EPA was required to promulgate
final EIP rules for stationary, area, and mobile sources by November 15, 1992; this action is that rulemaking. 



The provisions of today's rules are also guidance for discretionary EIP's that any State may choose to adopt for any
criteria pollutant, as explicitly allowed for in the Act. The Agency views this action as an opportunity to encourage
the development and early implementation of appropriate EIP's. In so doing, the Agency hopes these rules and guidance
will stimulate the adoption of incentive-based, innovative programs, where appropriate, that will assist States
in meeting air quality management goals through flexible approaches which benefit both the environment and the regulated
entities, allow for less costly control strategies, and provide stronger incentives for the development and implementation
of pollution prevention measures and innovative emissions reductions technology. 

The EPA intends that the portion of the preamble and rules published today that concern discretionary EIP's constitute
guidance, not final action. Final action with respect to discretionary EIP's will occur when the EPA approves or disapproves
State implementation plan (SIP) revisions containing discretionary EIP's.

I. Background and Purpose 



A. Introduction 



The Act, as amended in 1990, broadly encourages the use of incentive-based approaches to control air pollution. This
encouragement is reflected not only in the title IV acid rain program, but also in the title I general provisions for
State and Federal implementation plans for achieving the NAAQS for criteria pollutants, as well as in the provisions
for certain Federal O

3

 measures. In title I, incentive-based approaches are encouraged, and, in certain cases, mandated, through the use
of what has been termed an ``economic incentive program.'' Today's notice promulgates rules and guidance for EIP's
adopted by the States pursuant to title I of the Act. 

The Agency views this action as an opportunity to encourage and provide guidance on the early implementation of appropriate
discretionary EIP's, as well as to provide mandated rules for use by States after certain specific failures occur.
The Agency hopes that this guidance will stimulate the early adoption of innovative, incentive-based approaches,
where appropriate, that will assist the States in avoiding such failures, reaching attainment of the NAAQS faster
than might otherwise occur solely through the use of traditional regulatory strategies, and lowering the cost of
attaining and maintaining the NAAQS. Through this action, the Agency intends to encourage the development of EIP's
which benefit both the environment and the regulated entities by increasing flexibility and stimulating the use
of less costly strategies, as well as by providing stronger incentives for development and implementation of pollution
prevention measures, innovative emissions reductions technology, and strategies beyond those specifically mandated
through State and Federal standards and regulations. The Agency believes that these goals can be met by EIP's that
also meet the standards of accountability and enforceability currently found in traditional regulatory programs.

B. Overview



Today's notice promulgates rules for EIP's which may be adopted by an authorized governing body, including States,
local governments, and Indian governing bodies (henceforth State), for certain O

3

 and CO nonattainment areas pursuant to sections 182(g)(3), 182(g)(5), 187(d)(3), and 187(g) of the Act. These sections
mandate for certain areas, and identify as one of three options for certain other areas, the use of EIP's in certain
cases. An EIP is mandated upon the failure of a State to submit an adequate demonstration showing that the area has met
applicable milestones for RFP in extreme O

3

 nonattainment areas (section 182(g)(5)). An EIP is identified as one of three options upon such failure in serious
and severe O

3

 nonattainment areas (section 182(g)(3)).

1

 Further, an EIP is also mandated upon the failure of a State to submit a milestone demonstration showing adequately
that the area has met a required specific emissions reductions milestone or to attain the CO NAAQS in serious CO nonattainment
areas (section 187(d)(3), 187(g)).





Section 182(g)(4)(A) of the Act requires that EIP's adopted by States pursuant to the sections of the Act cited above,
characterized in today's notice as statutory EIP's, be consistent with the Agency's final rules for EIP's. This section
also requires that such EIP's be nondiscriminatory with regard to applicable laws regarding interstate commerce.
In addition, section 182(g)(4)(B) imposes constraints on how any revenues generated by such programs shall be used.
The scope of the EIP rules includes programs which may be adopted for ``reducing emissions from permitted stationary
sources, area sources, and mobile sources.''

Other sections of title I also explicitly allow for EIP's to be included as provisions in SIP's in general (section
110(a)(2)(A)), as well as specifically in nonattainment area SIP's (section 172(c)(6)). Economic incentives are
allowable in Federal implementation plans (FIP's) by definition (section 302(y)), and in Federal O

3

 measures through the system of regulations for control of emissions from consumer or commercial products (section
183(e)(4)). Today's notice serves as the Agency's final guidance for EIP's adopted by States pursuant to the sections
of the Act relating to general SIP provisions, characterized in today's notice as discretionary EIP's. Discretionary
EIP's may be adopted for any criteria pollutant in both nonattainment and attainment areas.



C. Principles and Regulatory Elements



The rules and guidance in today's notice are broadly applicable to any type of statutory or discretionary EIP, respectively.
This notice requires that EIP's submitted for approval to the EPA as part of a SIP for a nonattainment area contain design
features that will ensure that the program will not interfere with other requirements of the Act and that emissions
reductions credited to the program will be quantifiable; consistent with SIP attainment and RFP demonstrations;
surplus to reductions required by, and credited to, other implementation plan provisions to avoid double counting
of reductions; enforceable at both the State and Federal levels; and permanent over the entire duration of the program.

2

 The Agency does not intend to limit flexibility and innovation beyond those constraints that are necessary to meet
these requirements.





This notice identifies key program provisions which must generally be included to ensure that the above requirements
will be met. Adequate program designs will generally include the following elements: Clearly defined goals and an
incentive mechanism that can be rationally related to accomplishing the goals; a clearly defined scope, which identifies
affected sources and assures that the program will not interfere with any other applicable Federal regulatory requirements;
a program baseline from which projected program results (e.g., quantifiable emissions reductions) can be determined;
credible, workable, replicable procedures for quantifying emissions and/or emission-related parameters, as
appropriate; source requirements, including those for MRR, that are consistent with specified quantification
procedures and allow for compliance certification and enforcement; requirements for projecting program results
and dealing with uncertainty; and an implementation schedule, administrative system, and enforcement provisions
adequate for ensuring Federal and State enforceability of the program. All EIP's for which SIP credit is taken in attainment
and RFP demonstrations must include additional elements, such as audit procedures to evaluate program implementation
and track results, and, in certain cases, reconciliation procedures to trigger corrective or contingency measures
to make up any shortfall between projected emissions reductions and emissions reductions actually achieved in practice.

The rules are, of necessity, general in nature with regard to criteria for designing adequate program elements. This
generality arises due to the large variety of EIP types and designs which may be submitted, and the Agency's goal of
encouraging creativity and innovation on the part of the States developing such programs. There are three broad,
interrelated aspects of any program design that significantly affect the approvability of an EIP: How the EIP relates
to other SIP provisions, the level of certainty in quantifying emissions and projecting EIP results, and the nature
and extent of MRR requirements for enabling determinations of compliance. For example, today's notice reflects
the Agency's view that the scope and nature of MRR requirements, including the extent to which an EIP exceeds the minimum
requirements for such, would be among the factors to be considered in assessing the adequacy of any demonstration
of projected EIP program results. The Agency anticipates preparing additional guidance on specific aspects of program
design as it gains experience with EIP's, partly through participation in feasibility and demonstration projects.

Descriptions of a broad range of general types of incentive strategies which exemplify potential EIP's are appended
to the final rules. These descriptions identify key provisions which distinguish the different model program types.
These examples are general in nature so as to avoid limiting innovation on the part of the States in developing programs
tailored to individual State needs. The EPA has placed in the docket support documents which survey a wide range of
EIP's that have actually been implemented, as well as programs in the design stage. The EPA has also issued information
and guidance, as required by section 108(f)(1)(A) of the Act, regarding the formulation and emissions reductions
potential of various transportation control measures (TCM's).

3

 




The EPA also published interim guidance on the generation of emissions reductions credits (ERC's) from mobile source
control programs at the same time the EIP rule was proposed.

4

 The EPA intends to respond to comments received on this interim guidance and publish final guidance in conjunction
with other EIP-related guidance on ERC banking currently being developed. 




The EPA intends that today's notice be consistent with other related rules and policies, either in place or under development,
such as the title V operating permits rules, the title VII rules for enhanced monitoring, general guidance on the implementation
of title I, and policies on emission trading.

II. Summary of Rules and Guidance 



A. Applicability 



The rules promulgated in today's notice apply to any statutory EIP submitted to the EPA as a SIP revision to comply with
sections 182(g)(3), 182(g)(5), 187(d)(3), or 187(g) of the Act, which either may or must be adopted by States upon
the failure of a State either to meet or to submit an adequate showing that an applicable RFP or a specific emissions
reductions milestone has been met (in serious, severe, and extreme O

3

 nonattainment areas, and serious CO nonattainment areas), or upon the failure of a serious CO nonattainment area
to attain the NAAQS for CO. The provisions contained in these rules, except as explicitly exempted, also serve as the
Agency's policy guidance on any discretionary EIP's submitted as SIP revisions. 



B. Definitions 



The term ``EIP'' is defined to include State established emission fees, marketable permits, State fees on the sale
or manufacture of products the use of which contributes to O

3

 formation, TCM's, or any combination of such measures. 



C. State Program Election and Submittal 



Under today's rules, statutory EIP's submitted as SIP revisions, when applicable, must be sufficient, in combination
with other elements of the plan, to achieve the next applicable milestone (for serious, severe, and extreme O

3

 nonattainment areas), or to reduce the total tonnage of emissions of CO in the area by at least 5 percent per year until
attainment is achieved (for serious CO nonattainment areas). Discretionary EIP's must not interfere with any applicable
requirement concerning attainment and RFP, or any other applicable requirement of the Act (section 110(l)). 



D. State Program Requirements 



Today's rules and guidance establish as a goal for all EIP's that they be designed to benefit both the environment and
the regulated entities. In addition, EIP's must be State and federally enforceable, nondiscriminatory (with respect
to interstate commerce), and consistent with the timely attainment and maintenance of NAAQS, all applicable RFP
and visibility requirements, applicable prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) increments, and all other
applicable requirements of the Act. Programs in nonattainment areas for which credit is taken in attainment and RFP
demonstrations shall be designed to ensure that the effects of the program are quantifiable, and that the credit taken
is limited to that which is surplus to other SIP-credited requirements. Statutory EIP's must be designed to result
in quantifiable, significant reductions in actual emissions. 

A number of program elements are outlined in the rules which must be included, as applicable, as part of any EIP design.
These elements are required to delineate program scope, to specify credible, workable, replicable emission quantification
procedures and all affected source requirements, to project program results, to specify audit and, if appropriate,
reconciliation procedures (to evaluate program implementation, track results, and, as appropriate, trigger corrective
or contingency measures), and to define an implementation schedule, administrative procedures, and effective
enforcement mechanisms. 



E. Use of Program Revenues 



The rules incorporate statutory restrictions on the use of revenues generated by statutory EIP's. Specifically,
any such revenues may be used by a State for providing incentives for achieving emissions reductions, providing assistance
(up to 75 percent of the costs) for the development of innovative technologies for the control of O

3

 air pollution and for the development of lower-polluting solvents and surface coatings, and funding (with up to 50
percent of the revenues) administrative costs of State programs under this Act. These restrictions on the use of revenues
do not apply to discretionary EIP's. 



III. Discussion of Rules and Guidance 



This portion of the notice provides more detail on the provisions of the final rules and guidance. 



A. Applicability 



The rules published in today's notice apply to any statutory EIP submitted to the EPA as a SIP revision to comply with
sections 182(g)(3), 182(g)(5), 187(d)(3), or 187(g) of the Act, which either may or must be adopted by States upon
the failure of a State either to meet or to submit an adequate showing that an applicable RFP or a specific emissions
reductions milestone has been met (in serious, severe, and extreme O

3

 nonattainment areas, and serious CO nonattainment areas), or upon the failure of a serious CO nonattainment area
to attain the NAAQS for CO. The provisions contained in these rules, except as explicitly exempted, also serve as the
Agency's policy guidance on any discretionary EIP's submitted as SIP revisions. Further, the EPA will use the provisions
contained in these rules as guidance in preparing EIP's, when appropriate, for FIP's necessitated by State failures
and for other Federal measures.

The EPA intends to review EIP's submitted as plan revisions based on the general SIP review requirements contained
in sections 110(k), 110(l), 182, and 187 of the Act, as applicable, and associated Agency policies. For statutory
programs, the Agency intends to review the plan revision and either approve or disapprove all or part of the revision
within 9 months after the date of the State's submission of the plan revision, consistent with section 182(g)(3) and
182(g)(5) of the Act. For discretionary EIP's, Agency action on plan revisions submitted for review will be taken
according to the same schedule as is applicable to any other type of plan revision. An EIP submitted as a plan revision
will be deemed to be approved only upon an affirmative decision by the Agency. 



B. Definitions 



The definitions in today's notice include many terms drawn from the Act or other regulations or guidance documents,
as well as new terms relating to EIP's. Key new terms are discussed below. 



1. Economic Incentive Program 



Consistent with section 182(g)(4)(A) of the Act, for purposes of today's rulemaking, ``EIP'' is defined to mean a
program which may include ``State established emission fees or a system of marketable permits, or a system of State
fees on sale or manufacture of products, the use of which contributes to O

3

 formation, or any combination of the foregoing or other similar measures.'' In addition, the Act expands this definition
to include ``incentives and requirements to reduce vehicle emissions and vehicle miles traveled in the area, including
any of the transportation control measures identified in section 108(f).'' 

For purposes of this rulemaking, this notice classifies EIP's into three broad categories: emission limiting, market
response, and directionally-sound. This categorization is based on whether a quantifiable emission-related requirement
is directly specified as an integral element of the program or whether the program depends upon marketplace decisions,
in response to a program's incentive, to produce the intended emission-related objective of the program. Further,
the categorization is a function of whether the results of the program are quantifiable. 

Emission-limiting strategies directly specify limits on total mass emissions, emission-related parameters (e.g.,
emission rates per unit of production, product content limits), or levels of emissions reductions relative to a program
baseline that are required to be met by affected sources, while providing flexibility to sources to reduce the cost
of meeting such limits. A marketable permits program (i.e., emission trading with source-specific mass emissions
limitations, or caps) is a primary example of such a program. If every affected source in such a program complies with
its emissions cap (taking into account both emissions generated by the source as well as any emissions trading), the
program will necessarily achieve the specified emissions limits. 

A market-response strategy creates one or more incentives for affected sources to reduce emissions, without directly
mandating emission-related requirements for individual sources or even for all sources in the aggregate. An emission
fee program may be an example of a market-response strategy. In such a program, each source might be required to pay
a fee on each unit of emissions. The response to the incentive, in terms of actions which affect emissions levels, will
be determined by each source according to its abatement opportunities, costs, and other factors. Thus, each source
has flexibility in determining its ultimate level of emissions (within any constraints imposed by other regulatory
requirements). 

A consequence of programs based on market-response strategies is that actual emissions from affected sources may
differ from the pre-implementation projected emissions level even if every affected source is in full compliance
with the EIP requirements. This added degree of uncertainty in program results must be accounted for in designing
such a strategy (see paragraph III.D.6.). 

Directionally-sound strategies do not yield quantifiable emissions reductions creditable towards RFP or attainment
demonstrations. Such strategies may be included in an area's attainment plan, without credit, or in a maintenance
plan if the strategy contributes to the area coming into or maintaining attainment. Emissions reductions from such
programs are not creditable towards RFP or attainment demonstrations because the program lacks one or more of the
basic program elements, such as a quantifiable program baseline or adequate emissions quantification procedures.
However, a State may want to pursue such a strategy as a part of their overall program to attain and maintain the NAAQS.
Directionally-sound strategies must not be used as the primary basis for any statutory EIP submitted pursuant to
sections 182(g)(3), 182(g)(5), 187(d)(3), and 187(g) of the Act. 

A number of different types of incentive strategies have been identified upon which EIP's could be based. Appendix
X contains descriptions of different types of strategies, together with a listing of the TCM's included in section
108(f) of the Act. There is not, however, in all cases a direct correspondence between a type of strategy and the regulatory
categories described above, since program design details can in some cases make a difference in the extent to which
program results are quantifiable or dependent on market response.

2. Program Baseline 



The determination of a program baseline is the first step in projecting program results. Results from EIP's can be
projected in terms of quantifiable emissions reductions, or, in the case of directionally-sound programs, in terms
of other emission-related parameters. Further, some types of incentive strategies depend upon the establishment
of a program baseline, in terms of a level of mass emissions or emission-related parameter(s), for each affected source
or aggregated overall affected sources, as a starting point for the incentive program mechanism. For example, a marketable
emissions permit program could be initialized by a program baseline that allocates to each source a cap on mass emissions
that serves as its starting point for any emissions trading transactions or future emissions reductions requirements.
For other types of programs, this program baseline could be defined in terms of emission-related parameters, such
as average emission rates, solvent content, or vehicle ridership factors. 



3. Nondiscriminatory 



Section 182(g)(4) provides that statutory EIP's must be ``nondiscriminatory'' and must be ``consistent with applicable
law regarding interstate commerce.'' The EPA interprets these requirements to mean that a statutory EIP must not
discriminate in favor of intrastate commerce and against interstate commerce. In addition, an EIP must meet any other
applicable limitations under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. For example, State taxes must meet the
requirements, to the extent applicable to the tax, set out by the U.S. Supreme Court in 

Complete Auto Transit, Inc.

 v. 

Brady,

 430 U.S. 274 (1977). There, the Court stated that a State tax will pass scrutiny under the Commerce Clause only if ``the
tax is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate
against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to the services provided by the State.'' 

Id.

 at 279. Under the EPA's interpretation, Congress did not intend, by the provisions authorizing EIP's, either statutory
or discretionary, to delegate its authority under the Commerce Clause to the States, and thereby release State EIP's
from the limitations that would apply under the Commerce Clause had Congress not specifically authorized the EIP;
rather, Congress intended to maintain those limitations. 



C. State Program Election and Submittal 



The mandated schedules for the development, submittal, review/approval, and implementation of statutory EIP's,
submitted pursuant to sections 182(g)(3), 182(g)(5), 187(d)(3), and 187(g) of the Act, may leave as little as 6 months
for the EIP to be operational prior to the next milestone requirement. Thus, in these cases, the time available to develop,
implement, and achieve emissions reductions from an EIP will be extremely limited if a State waits until a milestone
failure occurs to initiate the selection and development of a statutory EIP. As a result, the EPA encourages States
to initiate development of an EIP as soon as they determine that a milestone failure is likely, or even sooner, as part
of their SIP. 

States are encouraged to consider inclusion of discretionary EIP's, where appropriate, in the SIP's (or SIP revisions)
due within the first 4 years after enactment of the amended Act (e.g., sections 182 (b)(1) and (c)(2), 187(a)(1)).
Submittal at that time would more likely allow sufficient time to develop, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness
of the program. If such an early EIP submittal is made, States must account for the effects of the EIP in any subsequent
required SIP submittals. Nothing in today's notice precludes a State from revisiting and amending its original EIP,
or any other pre-existing rules, as necessary, to ensure consistency with any subsequent required SIP submittals.


The requirements of section 182(g)(3) and 182(g)(5) of the Act apply any time that a State fails to submit an adequate
milestone compliance showing, or when the EPA determines that a milestone has been missed by an area covered by these
provisions. For example, if such a milestone is not met by a serious or severe O

3

 nonattainment area, the area may elect among three options, including an EIP. The Act does not provide any additional
or different requirements that would apply when a State that missed one milestone, and makes a proper election, misses
a subsequent milestone. Accordingly, if a subsequent milestone is missed, the same choices are available, including
the election of an EIP. Thus, the imposed requirements or specified options apply not only the first time that a milestone
is missed, but also if subsequent milestones are missed even if an EIP had previously been implemented. Similarly,
the EPA interprets section 187(g) (requiring serious CO nonattainment areas that fail to attain to adopt an EIP) as
applying even if the area previously missed a milestone and adopted an EIP pursuant to section 187(d)(3). A second
missed-milestone program must provide reductions beyond the reductions from a first statutory program. The second
EIP may either be a new program or a substantive revision of the first program. 



D. State Program Requirements 



Under today's rules, EIP's must be State and federally enforceable; nondiscriminatory (with respect to interstate
commerce); and consistent with the timely attainment and maintenance of NAAQS, all applicable RFP and visibility
requirements, applicable PSD increments, and all other applicable requirements of the Act. Programs in nonattainment
areas for which credit is taken in attainment and RFP demonstrations shall be designed to ensure that the effects of
the program are quantifiable and that the credit taken is limited to that which is surplus to other SIP-credited requirements.
Statutory EIP's must be designed to result in quantifiable, significant reductions in actual emissions.

<TEXT>
 

Each of the program elements that must be included, as applicable, in an EIP submitted to the EPA as a plan revision are
described below. For EIP's that allow trading to meet existing source requirements, the EPA will consider a two-step
process for State submittal and EPA review of the program elements outlined below. Under such a step-wise process,
the initial submittal shall include both a framework for all the general elements of program design, as well as all
the specific regulatory details for a source-specific trade or for an entire source category, which trade or source
category is representative, with respect to all program elements, of the types of trading to be allowed under the general
framework. For example, for an EIP designed to directly implement trading within source categories, the initial
submittal shall include the full details of all program elements for at least one source category. Alternatively,
for an EIP designed to implement trading on a source-by-source basis, with EPA review of each trade, the initial submittal
shall include the full details of all program elements for at least one source-specific trade. Thus, required specific
aspects of the emission quantification procedures and MRR requirements for additional sources and/or source categories
could be submitted at a later time to allow the State to phase-in the application of the program to other individual
sources or source categories. Because adequate enforceability elements_including emissions quantification
procedures, test methods, and MRR requirements_are integral to any SIP program, approval by the EPA of a framework
for trading would constitute approval only of the framework elements included as part of the initial submission and
of trading for those sources or within those source categories submitted with the framework and approved for trading
by the EPA. Trading involving other sources or source categories could not occur until all elements, including enforceability
elements, were approved by the EPA through a subsequent step in the process. The EPA will apply the same criteria in
reviewing step-wise submittals of emission quantification and MRR requirements as in reviewing such requirements
submitted together with the other program elements. Thus, a subsequent submittal must be fully compatible with all
the elements in the initial submittal, and, taken together, both submittals must meet all the requirements of the
EIP rules and guidance. The EPA does not intend to consider use of this step-wise process for EIP's that mandate new
requirements for affected sources (e.g., requiring mass emission caps on sources previously required to meet emission
rate limits). 



1. Program Goals and Rationale 



An acceptable EIP must clearly define the goals of the program and provide a rationale relating how the program design
will accomplish the goals. These final rules and guidance establish as a goal for all EIP's that they be designed to
benefit both the environment and the regulated entities. The final rules and guidance require States to design programs
that will meaningfully meet this goal, while providing flexibility to the States to determine how best to accomplish
such ``benefits sharing'' in the context of each specific program. 

The term ``benefits'' is broadly defined to include not only economic benefits, such as cost savings and compliance
flexibility for the regulated sources, but also environmental benefits that will result in States reaching attainment
of the NAAQS faster than might otherwise occur solely through the use of traditional strategies. Environmental benefits
can be created most directly by EIP's that require increased or more rapid emissions reductions beyond those that
would be achieved through a traditional regulatory program. Specifically, a 10 percent increase in emissions reductions
would presumptively meet this benefits sharing goal. Alternatively, environmental benefits can also be achieved
by programs that incorporate, for example, improved administrative mechanisms (e.g., that achieve emissions reductions
from sources not readily controllable through traditional regulation), reduced administrative burdens on regulatory
agencies that result in increased environmental benefits through other regulatory programs, improved emissions
inventories that enhance and lend increased certainty to State planning efforts, and the adoption of emission caps
which over time constrain or reduce growth-related emissions beyond traditional regulatory approaches. 

Statutory EIP's will benefit the environment as a result of the requirement that they be designed to result in significant
reductions in actual emissions. For discretionary EIP's, no standard formula for benefit sharing is specified,
although the EPA encourages States, to the extent practicable, to design such programs so as to create most directly
increased or more rapid emissions reductions (see paragraph IV.A.2). 

The EPA notes that any incentive-based program has the potential to create incentives for pollution prevention and
technological innovation. Such an inherent potential benefit can only meaningfully meet the goal of providing benefits
to the environment if the program is specifically designed to allocate some of the effects of such innovation to enhancing
environmental progress. Likewise, for the other ways listed above in which environmental benefits can be accomplished,
the EPA intends that these approaches be meaningfully implemented so as to produce real environmental benefits.

<PARENT> FR940407-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A well-designed EIP will achieve a number of different kinds of environmental benefits. For instance, a marketable
emissions permit program, with mass emissions caps declining over time, may achieve several results. The declining
cap aspect of the program can result in real emissions reductions creditable towards RFP milestones and attainment
(to the extent that actual emissions are reduced). The marketable aspect of the program allows emission sources facing
differing costs of further emission control to trade, lowering overall control costs. Such programs also encourage
sources already able to meet their mass emissions caps to find ways of further reducing emissions beyond what would
otherwise be required by traditional regulatory programs (e.g., through pollution prevention, technological
innovation, or changes in operational procedures). 

Statutory EIP's, submitted because of failures in achieving required emissions reductions, must make a significant
contribution to the required reductions, while not necessarily bearing the full burden of achieving all the required
reductions or mandating any specific percentage reduction. A program producing no additional emissions reductions
or one based solely on a directionally-sound strategy, without quantifiable benefits, would not satisfy these criteria
for an acceptable statutory EIP. For discretionary EIP's, the final guidance relies upon the new State planning,
quantitative progress, and attainment requirements in the Act to ensure expeditious attainment of the NAAQS, regardless
of the type of programs that States may choose to include in their SIP's. 

Any EIP should include a rationale for how the incentive mechanism(s) will achieve the stated goal(s). A State can
create a better overall program design by carefully examining and explaining the linkage between a program's provisions
and the desired outcome. The provisions of a program must be sufficient to ensure the program goals are successfully
achieved without creating unintended detrimental side effects. 



2. Program Scope 



As with any regulatory program, an EIP must identify the affected sources covered by the program. The affected sources
may be defined on the basis of source type (e.g., manufacturing operations), activity type (e.g., fuel storage tanks),
location, firm size, quantity of emissions, or other such characteristics. In addition, a State may choose to grant
exemptions from program requirements to sources meeting specified criteria. For example, States may consider exempting
zero-emitting vehicles from a new parking price program. In establishing the affected source criteria, a State must
assure that the resultant program is nondiscriminatory within the meaning given that term in these rules. 

The program must establish procedures for dealing with sources entering or exiting affected source categories.
In order to promote economic growth consistent with achieving environmental goals, a regulatory program should
not create unwarranted barriers to entry for new or expanding business entities. 

In addition, the program must establish criteria and procedures for sources voluntarily choosing to opt-in to or
to be exempted from the program, to the extent that the program design allows for such movement into or out of the universe
of affected sources. For example, the title IV acid rain allowance trading program includes provisions for sources
not originally in the program to opt-in to the program in order to sell sulfur dioxide (SO

2

) emission allowances to sources already in the program. Certain EIP's may also provide criteria for exempting sources
such that they can leave the program; such criteria must be described and the procedures for leaving the program must
be included in the EIP. Any such procedures must ensure that movement into or out of the program will not interfere with
other statutory requirements nor result in an increase in area-wide emissions that is not reflected in the plan's
attainment or RFP demonstrations. Finally, the opt-in program language must specify that it will not allow sources
to opt-in if the net result of the opt-in program as a whole is to increase area emissions, unless such increase has been
accounted for in the development of the EIP, and is consistent with attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS, RFP, and
all other SIP requirements. 

Affected sources in an EIP may also be covered by other Federal regulatory requirements. An EIP may not interfere with
applicable requirements concerning attainment and RFP, or any other applicable requirements of the Act. Thus, the
program scope must be defined so as not to interfere with any other Federal regulatory requirements which apply to
the affected sources. Such requirements for stationary sources may include, but are not limited to, reasonably available
control technology (RACT), PSD and new source review (NSR) offset requirements, lowest achievable emission rate
(LAER), best available control technology (BACT), new source performance standards (NSPS), national emissions
standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP's), acid deposition program requirements, reasonably available
control measures (RACM), and best available control measures (BACM). Such requirements for mobile sources may include,
but are not limited to, programs integral to vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M), clean-fueled fleets, reformulated
gasoline, oxygenated fuels, employee commute options (ECO), TCM's, and Federal motor vehicle controls. 

In general, sources subject to these statutory requirements may participate in emissions trades pursuant to an EIP
as long as, apart from their participation in such trades, they continue to meet the statutory requirements. Thus,
if these sources reduce their emissions below what the applicable statutory requirements call for, the reductions
beyond the requirements may furnish credits for the EIP.

 Following is a more specific discussion of the interplay of the EIP rules with several of the statutory provisions
listed above.

RFP Requirements. 

Credits for emissions reductions from stationary, mobile, or area sources may generally be used to meet the ``progress''
requirements of the nonattainment provisions of the Act. The SIP's for O

3

 nonattainment areas classified as moderate or higher under section 181(a)(1) are required to provide for reductions
in volatile organic compounds (VOC) of at least 15 percent from baseline emissions by 1996, and areas classified as
serious or higher are required to provide for reductions of at least 3 percent each year (averaged over a 3-year period)
thereafter until the attainment date (section 182(b)(1), 182(c)(2)(B)). Emissions reductions from all sources
may be used to meet these progress requirements, except for those reductions attributable to Federal motor vehicle
programs and RACT and NSR corrections (section 182(b)(1) (C)-(D)). 



RACT. 

An EIP may allow sources subject to the RACT requirement to attain RACT-level emissions reductions in the aggregate,
and thereby trade among themselves. In designing such RACT trading programs (to implement new and/or previously
existing RACT requirements), as with any EIP, States are encouraged, to the extent practicable, to meet the benefits
sharing goal directly, by requiring increased emissions reductions beyond those that would be achieved through
a traditional RACT program. 

In addition, today's rules and guidance authorize emissions trading between the stationary sources subject to the
RACT requirement (``RACT sources'') and any sources (i.e., stationary, mobile, and area sources) not subject to
the RACT requirement (``non-RACT sources'') when such trading results in an exceptional environmental benefit,
e.g., a level of reductions that is significantly greater than RACT-level amounts. With respect to the level of emissions
reductions required from the non-RACT sources, the appropriate amount of emissions reductions generally should
be set at a level that takes into account the severity of the nonattainment status in a given area. 

Today's rules establish the statutory offset ratios for nonattainment areas as the determinant of the amount of emissions
reductions that would be required from non-RACT sources generating credits for RACT sources. The offset ratios are
lower for lower-classified areas (e.g., compare section 182(a)(4), with a 1.1 to 1 offset ratio for marginal areas,
and section 182(d)(2), with a 1.3 to 1 offset ratio for severe areas). Looking to offset ratios is instructive because
offsets are an aspect of emissions trading that is directly addressed in the Act. The offset ratios provide a suitable
analogy because they represent the most substantial benefit to the environment for a given area that is required in
this statutory context of emissions trading.

However, today's rules authorize emissions trading between RACT and non-RACT sources at less than the offset ratios
if exceptional environmental benefits are otherwise demonstrated, such as, for example, an emissions trade that
promoted the market penetration of emissions reduction measures for non-RACT sources, such that future emissions
reductions from the universe of non-RACT sources would be expected to increase over time. Such measures could include
new vehicle technologies that utilize alternative fuels, provided that such technologies meet all relevant EPA
standards and guidelines. Where a lower trading ratio is authorized in order to promote the market penetration of
an environmentally-beneficial, new control measure, a lower bound for the trading ratio of 1.1 to 1 will assure that
in all events some additional benefit will accrue to the environment. In setting the appropriate ratio for trades
between RACT and non-RACT sources, States may also take into account additional State and federally-enforceable
emissions reductions that are achieved as a result of other exceptional environmental features of an EIP (such as
a separate ``environmental bonus'' provision, as discussed in EPA's Interim Guidance on the Generation of Mobile
Source Emissions Reduction Credits). In no case, however, can a trading ratio be lower than 1 to 1, and in no case can
the effective trading ratio be less than the appropriate offset ratio (or such ratio, as low as 1.1 to 1.0, as may be authorized
to promote the market penetration of environmentally-beneficial, new control measures). 


Offsets. 

Credits for emissions reductions generated by stationary, mobile, or area sources may be used for purposes of meeting
the offset requirement for major new and modified sources in nonattainment areas so long as they meet the restrictions
imposed on offsets by section 173 of the Act and the EPA's new source review regulations (40 CFR 51.165 and part 51, appendix
S). Under the nonattainment provisions, new or modified major stationary sources may not receive permits for construction
and operation in a nonattainment area unless, among other things, their new emissions are offset by reductions from
other sources in the area (section 172(c)(5), 173(a)(1)(A)). For O

3

 nonattainment areas, minimum offset ratios range from 1.1 to 1 for marginal areas to 1.5 to 1 for extreme areas (section
182(a)(4), 182(b)(5), 182(c)(10), 182(d)(2), 182(e)(1)). 
However, the Act does not require that offsets be secured by the new source. Rather, any portion of the necessary offsets
may be generated by the local air quality district or by the State. In other words, a jurisdiction may set up an offset
``bank'' to supply new sources with sufficient emissions reductions to satisfy their offset obligations. To satisfy
the requirements set forth in section 173, each time a new source commences operations, the jurisdiction must have
already generated the necessary emissions reductions to offset the new emissions. This means that the jurisdiction
must be able to demonstrate that the program has secured sufficient excess emissions reductions to offset all new
emissions at the proper ratio. If the source itself is only held responsible for securing emissions reductions in
an amount equal to its new emissions (i.e., a 1 to 1 ratio), the SIP must generate sufficient reductions to cover the
extra reductions required (e.g., 1.2 to 1 in serious O

3

 nonattainment areas). 
The Act limits offsets to emission reductions not ``otherwise required by this Act.'' As part of the ``General Preamble
for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990,'' the EPA described certain circumstances
under which reductions would not be creditable for offset purposes because those reductions are required by other
provisions of the Act (57 FR 13498, 13553 (April 16, 1992)). In addition, the EPA intends to provide additional guidance
regarding offsets in the near future.

BACT and LAER. 

Both the PSD program and the nonattainment NSR program contain technology-based emission limitations that are source
specific. The Act expressly requires that these emissions limitations (i.e., BACT in the case of PSD and LAER in the
case of NSR) be met by the proposed major new source or major modification itself as a condition of permit issuance.
Consequently, neither of these requirements can be met through emissions trading. 
Regarding BACT, section 165(a) of the Act provides that no major new source or major modification may be constructed
in a PSD area unless the requirements in section 165(a)(1)-(8) are met. Section 165(a)(1) specifies that among these
requirements is ``a permit * * * setting forth emission limitations for such facility which conform
to the requirements of this part.'' Section 165(a)(3)(C) further specifies that the proposed facility must demonstrate
that emissions from the facility will not exceed any applicable emission standard under the Act.

6

 The applicable emissions limitations are those provided in section 165(a)(4), which provides that the proposed
facility must ``be subject to the best available control technology for each pollutant subject to regulation under
this Act emitted from, or which results from, such facility.''

7

 





The Act sets forth a similar statutory scheme with respect to LAER. Section 173(a) provides that the permit program
applicable to major new sources or major modifications, which is required to be included in part D SIP's under section
172(b)(5),

8

 shall provide that permits to construct and operate may be issued only if the requirements set forth in section 173(a)(1)-(5)
are met. Among these enumerated requirements is section 173(a)(2), which specifies that ``the proposed source is
required to comply with the lowest achievable emission rate.''

9

 





The statutory provisions addressing both BACT and LAER clearly require the permitting authority to set, and the source
owner to comply with, the applicable technology-based emission limitation. There is no provision in the statute
for lawfully complying with BACT or LAER through obtaining emissions reductions at other sources that would result
in an equivalent reduction of emissions or ambient concentrations. 


Inspection and Maintenance Programs. 

The I/M provisions of the Act require a vehicle I/M program that meets specified performance standards. The requirements
of the I/M provisions cannot be met by obtaining ERC's from sources other than vehicles, or from vehicles through means
other than I/M of the vehicle. An EIP may not substitute entirely for an enhanced or basic periodic vehicle I/M program.

This view is based on the provisions of the Act that set forth requirements for a basic I/M program, as well as certain
provisions relating to enhanced I/M programs. Sections 182(a)(2)(B)(i) (I/M ``fix-ups'' for O

3

 nonattainment areas classified marginal and higher), 182(b)(4) (I/M ``catch-ups'' for O

3

 nonattainment areas classified moderate and higher), and 187(a)(4) (I/M ``fix-up'' requirement for CO nonattainment
areas classified moderate and higher) each require a SIP revision that includes provisions for a ``vehicle inspection
and maintenance program'' that meets a specified performance standard. 
The provision for an enhanced I/M program for CO nonattainment areas classified as moderate and with a design value
higher than 12.7 ppm, or classified as serious, requires the SIP to include provisions for ``an enhanced vehicle inspection
and maintenance program as required in section 182(c)(3) (concerning serious O

3

 nonattainment areas)'' (section 187(a)(6)). This provision confirms that the required I/M program is in fact a vehicle
I/M program. The primary provision for an enhanced I/M program for O

3

 nonattainment areas classified as serious or higher does not include a comparable ``inspection and maintenance''
phrase (i.e., requires the SIP ``to provide for an enhanced program to reduce hydrocarbon emissions and nitrogen
oxides (NO

X

) emissions from in-use motor vehicles''), but it further includes specific requirements for various types of testing,
inspections, etc., that make clear that the program must obtain reductions from vehicle I/M (section 182(c)(3)).
Nevertheless, both the basic I/M program and the enhanced I/M program requirements authorize a substantial degree
of flexibility in program design. The Act directs the EPA to require a specific amount of emissions reductions, but
also authorizes the State to design the program in a manner that meets the EPA established performance standard through
different means. The EPA's final rule on I/M programs describes the EPA's performance standards and the ways that
States can meet those standards (57 FR 52950-53014). In so doing, the State can take advantage of economic efficiencies
(e.g., have a better test on more older cars to get greater performance, in exchange for some relaxation in another
element). In addition, States could address mal-maintenance in the vehicle fleet in part by including an old car scrappage
program as an element of the overall package used to meet the performance standard. However, the SIP must include a
program obtaining the required reductions through vehicle inspections.

3. Program Baseline 



An EIP baseline must be fully defined within the EIP, and used as a basis for projecting program results and, if applicable,
for initializing the incentive mechanism. States have flexibility in defining the program baseline for EIP's that
implement new RACT requirements for previously unregulated source categories through trading programs, as long
as the new RACT requirements reflect, to the extent practicable, increased emissions reductions beyond those that
would be achieved through a traditional RACT program. States may also use a flexible baseline for EIP's that allow
trading with respect to newly imposed RACT requirements on previously unregulated sources in a previously regulated
source category (e.g., sources newly covered by lower applicability cut-offs), as long as the EIP, in the aggregate,
yields reductions in actual emissions at least equivalent to those which would result from source-by-source compliance
with the existing RACT limit for that source category. This requirement can be satisfied by using existing data on
actual and allowable emissions from the previously regulated sources in the affected source category (see paragraph
IV.C.). 

A State also has flexibility in defining the program baseline for any EIP submitted in conjunction with, or subsequent
to, the submission of any complete areawide progress plan due at the time of EIP submittal (e.g., the 15 percent RFP
plan (section 182(b)(1)) and subsequent 3 percent plans (section 182(c)(2))), and/or an attainment demonstration.


In all such cases, the flexible program baseline may be based on actual, allowable, or some other intermediate

10

 or lower level of emissions, provided the State demonstrates that the program baseline is consistent with and reflected
in the associated RACT rule, progress plans, or attainment demonstration. Further, for EIP's submitted prior to
the submittal of a required progress or attainment demonstration, the State must include with its EIP submittal a
commitment that its subsequent attainment demonstration and all future progress plans will be consistent with the
EIP baseline in effect at that time, as well as a discussion of how the baseline will be integrated into the State's attainment
demonstration. Further, in this discussion, the State should take into account the potential that emission reduction
credits issued prior to the attainment demonstration may no longer be surplus relative to the attainment demonstration.

11

 






Conversely, for EIP's that do not meet the above conditions relating to RACT and progress requirements, the program
baseline must be set no higher than the lower of actual or allowable emissions. Actual emissions are to be taken from
the most appropriate inventory, such as the 1990 actual emission inventory (which was due for submission in November
1992), and allowable emissions are the lower of SIP allowable emissions or the level of emissions consistent with
source compliance with all Federal requirements related to attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS. 

In addition, following submission of an EIP that incorporates a flexible baseline, if the State fails to submit a complete
attainment demonstration, or if the EPA disapproves the attainment demonstration on the grounds that it does not
provide for attainment of the NAAQS, the EPA may require the State to incorporate in the EIP a program baseline set no
higher than the lower of actual or allowable emissions. 

The baseline for an EIP submitted in conjunction with an attainment demonstration must be consistent with the assumptions
employed in the attainment demonstration, including the location of emissions assumed in the photochemical grid
modelling, if applicable. 

In considering emissions trading, the EPA continues to focus on the aspect of trading that involves the relaxation
of a control requirement on a particular emissions-producing unit (the credit-receiving unit). Under trading programs,
this relaxation is offset by tightening the control requirements on another emissions-producing unit (the credit-generating
unit). Under section 110(l), this relaxation is authorized only if it, taken in conjunction with the tighter control
requirements, does not interfere with the ability of the SIP to meet the various requirements of the Act_most importantly,
for present purposes, the RACT requirement and the requirements for progress (e.g., for RFP in O

3

 nonattainment areas, 15 percent reductions in VOC emissions by 1996; and 3 percent-per-year over each 3-year period
until the attainment date), as well as attainment requirements. It is understood that when the credit-generating
unit's actual emissions are below the level mandated by the applicable control requirement, relaxing a control requirement
on the credit-receiving unit in exchange for tightening the requirement on the credit-generating unit may result
in an increase in aggregate actual emissions. Under these circumstances (i.e., trading from an allowables baseline),
the relaxation and its resulting increase in actual emissions could, in some circumstances, jeopardize RFP and attainment.

As described above, notwithstanding the chance of actual emissions increases, EIP's may authorize trading from
an allowables baseline when the EIP is submitted in conjunction with, or following, the submission of the applicable
progress plans, and the allowables baseline is consistent with those plans. Under these circumstances, trading
on the basis of allowables would not jeopardize the progress requirements. In some cases, the EPA will permit trading
to occur on the basis of allowables prior to submission of the attainment demonstration SIP. However, once the State
has submitted any applicable progress plans due at the time of EIP submission, the State has made significant progress
towards attainment. This significant progress, coupled with the sanctions provisions that provide strong safeguards
that the State will develop a SIP requiring any subsequent progress plans and an attainment demonstration, provide,
in the EPA's judgment, sufficient evidence that an EIP authorizing an allowables baseline submitted in conjunction
with an applicable progress plan will not jeopardize continued progress or attainment. In addition, States and sources
should be aware that any emission limit relaxations approved through an EIP may be subject to ongoing scrutiny, and
further tightening, if it is unexpectedly necessary to do so as part of an attainment demonstration. 

In addition, as described above, the EPA will permit EIP's that authorize trading from an allowables baseline in the
case of source categories, or portions of source categories, that are newly subjected to the RACT requirement under
the RACT ``catch-up'' provisions of section 182(b)(2). Under these circumstances, the imposition of RACT-level
controls meets the RACT requirement, as described above, and is expected to result in emissions reductions with respect
to the affected source categories or sources taken as a whole, even if some of the affected sources conduct emissions
trades based on allowables. The fact that overall emissions from these source categories or sources will be reduced
indicates that with respect to these source categories, progress is being made towards attainment. This progress
provides adequate assurance that any such trades on an allowables basis will not jeopardize progress or attainment
requirements. 

If a SIP does not include a required RACT emission limit for a source, that source may not participate in an EIP until
an appropriate RACT limit is determined. 

The provisions described above apply as well in the case of a statutory EIP. That is, under the circumstances described
above, a statutory EIP may incorporate a flexible baseline as long as the EIP as a whole provides the required reductions.


A State may define a program baseline to address a variety of equity considerations, such as differing degrees of emission
control among affected sources prior to the start of the EIP. While emissions reductions creditable towards a specific
required demonstration will be calculated according to the requirements for that demonstration, the EIP may use
a different baseline. For example, a declining value marketable permits program, submitted in conjunction with
an areawide RFP or attainment plan, could initially allocate mass emissions caps on the basis of allowable emissions.
However, to the extent that such a program baseline exceeds the aggregate actual emissions for the sources covered
by the program, the EIP baseline allocation would be required to decline at a rate consistent with achieving the areawide
RFP milestone as measured against the RFP baseline. 

The EIP must clearly specify whether the program baseline applies to aggregate emissions from all affected sources
(similar to the RFP baseline) or to individual sources (similar to source-specific LAER requirements, for example).
If historic emissions are relevant in setting the program baseline, the time period must be specified in the program.
Provisions must be made for determining baselines for sources not active during the specified baseline time period.
Also, the averaging time associated with a program baseline for emissions must be specified. 



4. Quantification Procedures 



An EIP must describe how emissions and changes in emissions will be quantified for SIP credit. If other measurable
factors are essential to an EIP, the quantification procedures for those must be specified in the program. For instance,
if emissions reductions are generated by reducing total usage of a type of solvent, procedures for measuring solvent
usage are critical. The program must specify the minimum required credible, workable, replicable procedures for
quantifying emissions, which could include emission factor calculations, direct emission monitoring, calculation
procedures which are a function of process parameters, production practices or volume, or inventory usage, or other
procedures, as appropriate. Criteria for selecting quantification methods and time-averaging considerations
are discussed below. 

States must carefully consider matching their environmental goals with various aspects of the program when determining
adequate quantification procedures. For example, a procedure wholly adequate for determining compliance with
long-term mass emissions caps may be clearly inadequate for a program aimed at limiting peak daily emissions.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940407-0-00074 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940407-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

An EIP must establish procedures for quantifying emissions reductions arising from sources that shut down or curtail
production. A State may not take credit for such emissions reductions as part of an EIP if the same reductions have already
received credit in the SIP's attainment or RFP demonstrations. For example, SIP demonstrations may include assumptions
about equipment turnover rates and normal operating levels which may already credit some assumed rate of source shutdowns
and curtailments. Credit also cannot be taken for shutdowns or curtailments that do not result in a decrease in an area's
aggregate emissions. Changes in emissions at one source may merely increase emissions at another. For example, if
one retail operation goes out of business, the total level of retail business will not necessarily change. Instead,
customers may shift their business to other merchants in the area. The effect on aggregate emissions of such ``demand
shifting'' will depend upon the nature of the business, and should be considered in the design of the EIP. 
An EIP also must establish procedures for quantifying emissions from sources with uneven emission patterns due to
batch, seasonal or cyclical operations. The appropriate procedure for handling these expected fluctuations in
emissions will depend in part on the emissions averaging time upon which the EIP is based. 
The EPA recognizes that the development of quantitative procedures for mobile sources can present significant challenges.
Such procedures must consider, as appropriate, the factors which will affect or determine the level of participation
in a transportation program, as well as how much and where vehicles are driven. Such procedures should clearly address
how double-counting will be avoided across various mobile source programs (e.g., not double-counting I/M program
reductions in quantifying credits from an accelerated vehicle scrappage program). Any assumptions or models which
States may use to predict behavioral modifications as a result of the implementation of an economic incentive strategy
must be presented as support information with the EIP submittal. The EPA views the development of sound incentive-based
mobile source programs as an opportunity for the design of better, more rigorous tools for accounting for and encouraging
mobile source emissions reductions beyond those required by traditional programs. 
The final rules allow for long-term averaging, while requiring that States make statistical showings that any such
averaging is consistent with applicable RACT, RFP, and short-term NAAQS. Any State that wishes to use long-term averaging
must include, with the plan revision submittal, a statistical showing that the aggregate effect of the specified
averaging time is consistent with attaining the O

3

 NAAQS and satisfying applicable RFP requirements on the basis of typical summer day emissions; and, if applicable,
a statistical showing that aggregate daily emissions from all affected sources covered by a Federal RACT requirement
(net of any RACT/non-RACT trades) are no greater than the aggregate daily emissions from such sources that would result
from the implementation of all applicable source-specific RACT requirements (see paragraph IV.D.2.). 


5. Monitoring, Recordkeeping and Reporting 


Each affected source in an EIP must comply with requirements imposed by the program, and must implement the MRR procedures
necessary to assure compliance with such requirements and to provide State and Federal enforceability. Requirements
imposed by an EIP could include meeting mass emissions limits (either directly or through trading marketable permits),
paying an emission fee, using specified products or procedures, providing product content labeling, or other measures
specified by the program. Thus, the final rules allow for a wide range of alternative MRR procedures that provide sufficiently
reliable and timely information for determining compliance. Criteria to be considered in the development of such
procedures include representativeness, accuracy, precision, reliability, frequency, and timeliness. 
All source-specific program requirements must be structured in such a way that both inspectors and facility owners
can judge the compliance status of a facility at any time, or, in the case of long-term emissions limits, at the end of
the compliance period. This will require an authoritative, reliable repository of all relevant information at each
facility.

6. SIP Creditability and Audit/Reconciliation Procedures 


A SIP revision that contains an EIP must include projections of the emissions reductions the State expects to achieve
through the implementation of the program. The projections may be based on federally-enforceable limits on mass
emissions or on other emission-related parameters, estimates of market response, economic modelling, or other
relevant information. The State does not have to project emission changes for each source, unless that is how the State
chooses to estimate the emissions reduction from the program. All EIP submittals must include documentation which
clearly states how sources in an EIP are or will be addressed in the emissions inventory, RFP plan, and attainment or
maintenance plan, as applicable. This documentation should include a description of the assumptions used in measuring
emissions and emissions reductions from affected sources. 
Credit in a nonattainment SIP may be taken for emission limiting programs (e.g., emissions trading) and market-response
programs (e.g., emissions fees). Credit may not be taken for directionally-sound programs until experience with
such programs makes quantification possible, at which time the program could be reclassified into one of the other
categories for which credit may be taken. 
For determining SIP credit, the projected emissions reductions must be adjusted to reflect the uncertainties inherent
in EIP's. This adjustment is currently done for traditional stationary source control measures through the use of
a rule effectiveness factor, developed from experience with traditional regulatory control programs. For EIP's,
the State must use two uncertainty adjustment factors, as appropriate, to calculate creditable emissions reductions.
The sources of uncertainty that must be separately addressed are compliance uncertainty (i.e., the extent to which
sources will actually comply with program requirements) and programmatic uncertainties (e.g., the extent to which
voluntary market responses to incentives actually occur and/or the use of various quantification methods with differing
confidence levels). These sources of uncertainty must be accounted for through the use of a rule compliance factor
and a program uncertainty factor, respectively. 
The State must specify values for rule compliance and program uncertainty factors, based on program elements such
as the quantification and enforcement procedures, and on the predictive quality of the information used by the State
to develop the projected emissions reductions. Inherent in the way in which these factors are defined, the value of
either factor must be less than or equal to one. The State must include with its EIP submittal a justification for the
values assigned to these factors. The State must use these factors in determining the SIP credit for the program as
a whole, or for each source-specific trade, if appropriate, to ensure that quantification uncertainties not lessen
a source's emissions reductions requirements. The uncertainty factors should be developed and justified by the
State by taking into account various aspects of the design of the EIP, including but not limited to, the type of incentive
mechanism upon which the program is based; the variability in emissions from affected sources and the nature and extent
of uncertainty in the emissions quantification procedures required by the program; the frequency and type of MRR
required by the program; sanctions for noncompliance; the frequency, scope and committed responses to program audits;
and the nature of administrative procedures to be used by the State in implementing and enforcing the program (see
paragraph IV.F.). 
Unless otherwise provided in program-specific guidance issued by the EPA, EIP's for which SIP credit is taken must
also contain program audit procedures designed to evaluate program implementation and track program results in
terms of both actual emissions reductions and, to the extent practicable, cost savings realized during program implementation.
The auditing methods and the timing of the audits must be specified in the EIP. The maximum time interval for conducting
such audits is 3 years, although States are encouraged to consider more frequent audits. Further, the State must provide
timely post-audit reports to the EPA. For emission-limiting EIP's, program audit provisions must include a State
commitment to ensure timely implementation of programmatic revisions or other measures which the State, in response
to the audit, deems necessary for the successful operation of the program (see paragraph IV.G.).

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940407-0-00076 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940407-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Program audit provisions for market-response EIP's must be accompanied by reconciliation procedures, designed
to compare credited emissions (i.e., adjusted projected emissions) with actual emissions achieved through the
implementation of the program. The reconciliation procedures must specify a range of appropriate actions (e.g.,
invoke part of a general SIP contingency plan or a program-specific contingency), revisions to the program requirements
(e.g., increase the fee, include more sources) that will make up for any shortfall between credited and actual emissions
revealed by the audit, or reductions in the credit taken for the EIP in the SIP (provided that RFP and attainment requirements
continue to be satisfied area-wide based on such reduced EIP credits in combination with the effects of all other SIP
programs). Such measures must be automatically executing to the extent necessary to make up the shortfall, with State
action required only to identify which of the specified actions are necessary to make up the shortfall. Such measures
must not require a revision to the implementation plan to be effectuated once identified by the State; rather, the
measures must be built into the original EIP design (or incorporated by reference). 
Greater burdens should not necessarily be imposed on EIP's, compared to traditional regulatory programs, by virtue
of the audit and reconciliation requirements. These audit and reconciliation procedures are consistent with the
general approach to implementing the Act being taken by the EPA, as illustrated in the Agency's rules for vehicle I/M

12

 and for reformulated gasoline,

13

 and in the Agency's general guidance on the implementation of title I dealing with the rule effectiveness of stationary
source control measures.

14

 Further, in appropriate cases, routine ongoing air program management procedures may be sufficient to fulfill the
audit and reconciliation requirements. In designing audit procedures, the State should consider the relative uncertainty
associated with the EIP and specify the scope and extent of the audit procedures to be commensurate with that level
of uncertainty. 







7. Implementation Schedule 


An EIP must contain a schedule for implementing the program. The schedule must include dates for notifying potentially
affected sources, as early as possible, about the impending EIP; program initialization and start-up procedures;
compliance and submittal requirements for affected sources; and audit and reconciliation processes, including
subsequent actions required to make up for any shortfall that occurs. 


8. Administrative Procedures 


As part of any EIP design, the State must establish appropriate administrative procedures, specific to the type of
incentive strategy, necessary to implement all of the elements of the EIP. For example, in a fee program a State must
assure the proper administration of the fee collection process, and if rebate provisions are included, the administration
of the rebate distribution process. 
Administrative procedures specific to marketable emissions permit programs which the State must address in a program
design are the mechanisms required for conducting, approving, verifying, recording, and tracking trades. The EIP
must clearly describe the administrative system, and any State commitments to implement and maintain the system,
that enables market participants to conduct valid and legally protected transactions. The State must design the
program to ensure that all program requirements are met by sources involved in trades, such that the trades result
in enforceable changes in allowable emissions levels. A well-designed EIP will include the minimum amount of transactional
oversight, approval, recording, and tracking provisions necessary to create a verifiable and enforceable system.
Unnecessary or excessive administrative requirements in a trading system increase the cost of the program and inhibit
trading. An active trading market increases the opportunities for cost-savings. However, a State must establish
sufficient administrative procedures to ensure that the environmental goals of the EIP are met, and that the program
is adequately enforceable (see paragraph IV.J.2. and the discussion of emissions trading markets in Appendix X).



9. Enforcement Mechanisms 


An EIP must include adequate enforcement consequences for noncompliance with any source requirements, including
MRR requirements. Each program must include provisions ensuring that State/local and Federal statutory maximum
penalties preserve the deterrent effect of traditional regulatory programs. Enforcement provisions should preserve
the criminal sanctions (for knowing violations) authorized in the Act for violations of SIP requirements per se.

Traditional regulatory programs provide for enforcement against noncompliance with emissions limits at both the
Federal and State/local levels. The statutory maximum Federal penalties under the Act are $25,000 per day, per source
in violation. To preserve the existing level of deterrence under the Act, an EIP that imposes multiday and/or multisource
emission limits must define violations of those limits in such a way that the violations will translate into some combination
of sufficient numbers of violations, sources in violation, and days of violation. One possible approach would be
for the EIP to authorize predetermined penalties based on the amount of an exceedance of such a cap, provided the predetermined
amounts are sufficiently large (see paragraph IV.H.). 
The EIP's that impose multisource emissions limits must require facilities to develop enforceable plans for remedying
noncompliance in those cases where facilities have exceeded emissions limits for the specified averaging period.
Such plans must identify appropriate and enforceable control measures or other procedures or strategies sufficient
to achieve and maintain compliance with applicable emissions limits. Further, for sources subject to title V requirements,
the elements of such plans must, at a minimum, be consistent with any applicable title V permit requirements concerning
compliance plans. 

Compliance with MRR requirements is critical to the integrity and success of EIP's. Thus, an EIP must include enforcement
provisions that establish a regulatory structure which clearly and effectively deters inadequate or improper MRR,
providing for both State/local and Federal penalties. Further, the enforcement provisions must include methods
for determining required data when MRR violations result in missing, inadequate, or erroneous monitoring and recordkeeping
data. These methods must ensure that sources have a sufficiently strong incentive to properly perform monitoring
and recordkeeping in the first place.

E. Use of Program Revenues 


Today's rules incorporate statutory restrictions on the use of revenues generated by statutory EIP's. These restrictions
are mandated by section 182(g)(4)(B) of the Act on the use of revenues generated by statutory EIP's submitted pursuant
to sections 182(g)(3), 182(g)(5), 187(d)(3), and 187(g) of the Act. Revenues may be generated by an EIP from a wide
variety of fees or charges, including emission or permit fees, fees associated with approving and recording trades,
application fees associated with labelling or sources opting into an EIP, and fees or charges associated with TCM's.
Specifically, any such revenues may be used by a State for providing incentives for achieving emissions reductions,
providing assistance (up to 75 percent of costs) for the development of innovative technologies for the control of
O

3

 air pollution and for the development of lower-polluting solvents and surface coatings, and funding (with up to 50
percent of the revenues) administrative costs of State programs under the Act. These restrictions on the use of revenues
do not apply to discretionary EIP's. 
Because the use of revenues from discretionary programs is not constrained, some or all of the revenues generated
by discretionary EIP's may be rebated in order to create a revenue-neutral program, or one with less revenue retained
by the State. Rebate provisions of revenue-generating EIP's can be designed to reduce the total cost to the affected
sources without diminishing the incentive to reduce emissions created by the EIP. For example, an emission fee program
could place a fee on total emissions from affected sources, and rebate an amount based on average emissions or percentage
emissions reductions of the affected sources. In a program with a large number of sources, each source would only have
a minor influence on the average emissions. Thus, the rebate is not dependent on a source's own actions, and would not
distort the incentive of the fee on every unit of emissions created by the source. 


IV. Discussion of Comments and Regulatory Changes 


This portion of the preamble is organized according to the ``Discussion of Issues'' section in the proposal, with
additional discussion of general issues raised in public comments. The following discussion highlights the changes
and clarifications made in the final rules in response to the public comments on these issues. 


A. Program Goals 


1. Statutory Programs 


Statutory EIP's are those programs submitted pursuant to sections 182(g)(3), 182(g)(5), 187(d)(3), and 187(g)
of the Act, generally because of failures in achieving required emissions reductions. The Act does not specify the
extent to which the EIP must, in and of itself, make up for the specific failure in achieving the emissions reductions
necessary to meet the next milestone requirement. Rather, the provisions specify only that the EIP ``shall be sufficient,
in combination with other elements'' of the plan, or together with a ``transportation control plan,'' to achieve
the necessary reductions. 
In the proposal, the EPA solicited comments on whether to require that some specified minimum percentage of the required
reductions be met by a statutory EIP. Most commenters, including State and local agencies, industry, and an environmental
group, felt that EIP's should not be required to meet a specified minimum percentage of emission reductions. These
comments were generally based on the premise that opportunities for such reductions will vary because of potential
differences between nonattainment areas that may implement EIP's. A specified minimum percentage would not provide
recognition of these differences nor the flexibility that needs to be an inherent part of EIP's. On the other hand,
an environmental group commented that a specified minimum percentage of required reductions should be met by a statutory
EIP, equivalent to the percentage difference between what the SIP is achieving and what the next milestone requires.

The final rules retain the requirement that a statutory EIP make a significant contribution to the required emissions
reductions, without mandating any percentage reduction requirement or that the EIP assume the entire burden of making
up for the shortfall. This position is most consistent with statutory intent that the States have flexibility in determining
how best to combine an EIP with other emission reduction programs to achieve the necessary emissions reductions.
Further, this position is consistent with meeting the benefits sharing goal established for all EIP's. 


2. Discretionary Programs 


In explicitly allowing for discretionary (i.e., nonstatutory) EIP's to be included as SIP provisions, the Act does
not impose any specific emissions reductions requirements on such programs (sections 110(a)(2)(A) and 172(c)(6)).
Thus, the proposed rules imposed no specific emissions reductions requirements on discretionary EIP's. The proposal
relied upon the new State planning, quantitative progress, and attainment requirements in the Act to ensure expeditious
attainment of the NAAQS, regardless of the type of emissions reductions programs that States may choose to include
in their SIP's.

Comments were received from an environmental group in support of an alternative view outlined in the proposal. The
alternative view is that any savings in compliance costs resulting from discretionary EIP's (relative to nonincentive-based
programs) should be shared between two accounts: the regulated sources should retain only as much savings as is sufficient
to maintain the incentive to participate in the EIP, with the remainder of the savings being used by the State to reach
attainment more quickly than would be practicable under a nonincentive-based plan. This alternative view is based
on the statutory requirement that States should attain the NAAQS as expeditiously as practicable.
In contrast, other commenters from State and local agencies, industry, and a joint environmental/industry work
group agreed with the proposal that the EPA should not require discretionary EIP's to achieve more rapid progress
than other regulations. A joint environmental/industry work group emphasized that EIP's should be designed to increase
flexibility and cost effectiveness, and should not be held to any stricter standard than traditional programs. Several
industry commenters felt that requiring more rapid progress towards attainment in exchange for a more flexible program
appears to be a penalty provision. These commenters felt that, while EIP's should be structured to produce reductions
equivalent to traditional SIP rules that the EIP's replace, the addition of further reductions as the price for entry
into an EIP will discourage participation and reduce benefits that might otherwise result from broad participation.
A State agency disagreed with requiring greater emission reductions from discretionary EIP's since different types
of environmental benefits can be achieved by EIP's, such as technological innovation, more available capital for
other control measures, conservation of natural resources, and increased commitment from the regulated sources.
Another State agency believes that EIP's which replace traditional SIP requirements should be equally effective,
equitable, and enforceable as the program it replaces.
The final rules take into account the broad array of benefits that can result from the use of discretionary EIP's, the
statutory requirement for expeditious attainment, and the fact that EIP's are relatively new and controversial
in principle as well as in practice. Further, current experience with EIP's makes clear that successful adoption
and implementation of EIP's requires some degree of consensus among the interested groups that both the regulated
entities and the environment will benefit from such programs. Thus, the final rules and guidance establish as a goal
for all EIP's that they be designed to benefit both the environment and the regulated entities. In so doing, the final
rules and guidance require States to meet this benefits sharing goal, while providing flexibility to the States to
determine how best to do so. As a result, EIP's will increase flexibility, lower the cost of attaining and maintaining
the NAAQS, and provide stronger incentives for the development and implementation of pollution prevention measures
and innovative technologies.
Benefits from discretionary EIP's can be defined in various terms, as discussed in paragraph III.D.1. While the EPA
encourages that discretionary EIP's be designed to produce environmental benefits directly, through increased
or more rapid emissions reductions, States should consider these and other benefits in designing a program to meet
the goal of sharing benefits between the regulated entities and the environment. In many cases, benefits in terms
of cost savings will not be quantifiable prior to program implementation, due to the complex market decisions that
sources participating in an EIP will need to make and changes in market conditions during the course of the program.
Thus, the final rules and guidance include analysis of control cost savings, to the extent practicable, as a part of
the required program audit.
However, the difficulty of quantifying cost savings and the extent to which those cost savings constitute an incentive
to trade leads the EPA to conclude that it is not practicable to require that all EIP's discount trades or otherwise
require increased or more rapid emissions reductions that directly benefit the environment. The authorization
for discretionary EIP's in sections 110(a)(2)(A) and 172(c)(6) may be interpreted to indicate Congress' view that
such programs may help achieve emissions reductions more effectively or efficiently, but not necessarily more expeditiously,
than traditional regulatory requirements.

The final rules reflect that it most appropriately falls to the States to determine the type and extent of benefits
sharing that is practicable and appropriate, given the unique circumstances that any particular discretionary
EIP is designed to address. Therefore, the final rules do not require any specific formula for benefit sharing. However,
the final rules do recognize that the issue of benefits sharing will be part of the political consensus building process
associated with designing a discretionary EIP. In assessing this issue, States should not confuse this sharing with
accounting for uncertainty in an EIP. Since uncertainty is to be accounted for through compliance and programmatic
uncertainty factors (see paragraph III.F.), determining a degree of sharing based on weighing the uncertainty in
an EIP would in essence be accounting twice for the same uncertainty.
One commenter also argued that the requirements for attainment as expeditiously as practicable [section 181(a)(1)]
and for imposition of reasonably available control measures [section 172(c)(1)] mandate the inclusion of emission
fees in EIP's. The EPA encourages States to consider emissions fees, but does not believe that, at present, their impacts
are sufficiently well understood in all cases to conclude that, for all EIP's, they are either practicable or reasonably
available.


B. Interface With Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) and Other Statutory Requirements


1. RACT


The proposal was based on an interpretation of the statutory RACT requirements that authorizes sources subject to
the statutory RACT requirements (RACT sources) to meet their RACT obligations in the aggregate (i.e., through trading
among themselves), and, when such trading results in an exceptional environmental benefit, by acquiring emissions
reductions from non-RACT sources (as discussed in paragraph II.D.2.). Further, the proposal defined exceptional
environmental benefits in terms of the statutory offset ratios for nonattainment areas and other demonstrations
of exceptional long-term environmental benefits.
With regard to meeting RACT in the aggregate, all but one commenter agreed with the proposed position that trading
be allowed among all RACT sources. Further, these commenters generally felt that such RACT trading should produce
emissions reductions that are equivalent to those that would be obtained if each source met its source category-specific
RACT limit. On the other hand, one environmental group disagreed with the proposed position allowing all sources
covered by RACT requirements to trade among themselves. This commenter stated that nothing in the Act specifically
authorizes substituting any trading regime for source-specific RACT requirements. However, if the EPA allows trading
to meet RACT requirements, only trading within a given RACT source category should be allowed since section 182(b)(2)
addresses RACT by source categories. Further, this commenter stated that since RACT limits have historically been
set based on source-specific economic and technical constraints, ``tradeable'' RACT limits must be based on an analysis
of the cost savings achievable by meeting RACT through whatever trading approach is permitted in the RACT rule. Since
trading approaches provide increased compliance flexibility and cost savings, the commenter believes that any
``tradeable'' RACT limits should be lower than source-specific RACT limits.
With regard to RACT/non-RACT trading in general, most commenters, including industry, State and local agencies,
and an environmental group, supported such trading. Some stated that any regulation which requires certain reductions
to be obtained at specified sources, and nowhere else, contradicts a ``market-based'' approach. They felt that the
broadest possible participation in a trading market should be encouraged so as to achieve the most benefits from the
program. Some commenters felt that allowing RACT/non-RACT trading encourages the development of new technologies
and facilitates obtaining controls on previously unregulated sources and source categories. Limiting trades to
particular source categories was thought by some to substantially reduce both the incentives and savings available.
Such comments were premised on the belief that trading between different source categories (involving both RACT
and non-RACT categories) can have sufficient controls and safeguards built in to ensure compliance.
On the other hand, other environmental groups opposed RACT/non-RACT trading. One such commenter asserted that statutory
language regarding RACT ``sources'' only refers to stationary sources, such that trading between RACT sources and
mobile sources would violate the Act. Further, this commenter asserted that such trading would make it impossible
for States to manage mobile source and stationary source budgets properly for purposes of demonstrating RFP and attainment.
The other environmental group commended the EPA's objectives, and approved its means in theory, of allowing trades
between mobile and stationary sources, but concluded that the time for trading between stationary and mobile sources
has not arrived. This conclusion was premised in part on the belief that trading between RACT sources and mobile sources
violates the Act, because it is impossible to determine whether a given mobile source emission reduction is truly
surplus. Further, both commenters felt that mobile source emissions reductions could not be reliably quantified.

<TEXT>
 

As to the conditions under which RACT/non-RACT trading may occur, many commenters from industry expressed the view
that such trading should be allowed at a 1-to-1 ratio, i.e., that no exceptional environmental benefit was required
to justify RACT/non-RACT trading. These commenters felt that any trading ratio greater than 1 to 1 would limit the
economic, technological, and environmental benefits that could be derived from innovations brought about by RACT/non-RACT
trading. Other commenters, including State and local agencies and some industries and environmental groups, supported
the concept of requiring RACT/non-RACT trades to achieve an exceptional environmental benefit in general, and the
use of the proposed statutory offset ratios in particular. However, some of these commenters expressed concern that
the offset ratios may have a chilling effect on such trading, and encouraged the EPA to identify justifiable circumstances
under which trading ratios could be lower than the offset ratios.

The final rules continue to allow RACT to be met in the aggregate. In addition, the final rules continue to allow RACT/non-RACT
trading, provided that an exceptional environmental benefit is achieved.

Under the 1977 Act, the requirements specific to nonattainment SIP's were found in part D of title I of the Act. Section
172 specified the attainment date and the required SIP measures. Subsection (a) of section 172 required that nonattainment
SIP's provide for attainment by specified dates; subsection (b)(2) required that those SIP's ``provide for the implementation
of all reasonably available control measures (RACM) as expeditiously as practicable.'' Subsection (b)(3) required
that the SIP's provide for RFP, including RACT:




(Nonattainment SIP's must) require, in the interim (prior to the attainment date) reasonable further progress * * *
including such reduction in emissions from existing sources as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum,
of reasonably available control technology.




The EPA took the position that RACT requirements do not require each affected emissions unit to achieve a prescribed
amount of reductions in emissions from its own processes, but rather require the affected sources to achieve in the
aggregate the reductions that would be achieved if each applied RACT controls to itself. Under the EPA's interpretation,
the application of the requirement to impose RACT upon ``existing sources'' meant that RACT applied in the aggregate,
as opposed to source by source. This interpretation, which is reflected in the Emissions Trading Policy Statement
(51 FR 43814 (December 4, 1986), the ``Bubble Policy''), was upheld in 

NRDC 

v. 

EPA,

 33 ERC 1657 (4th Cir. 1991), an unpublished decision. There, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld as reasonable
EPA's approval of a Maryland SIP revision for the American Cyanamid Company relaxing the SIP limit on several lines
in exchange for tighter limits on other lines. The EPA reasoned that the RACT requirement was met by the subject lines
in the aggregate.

The Act revamped part D of title I by updating the general requirements applicable to all nonattainment SIP's, placing
those requirements in subpart 1 of part D, and adding subparts 2-5 to cover pollutant-specific nonattainment
SIP's. Subpart 2 concerns ozone SIP's.

Under the 1990 Amendments, the 1977 Act's requirements for nonattainment SIP's were generally retained in subpart
1, but were combined differently_the RACM and attainment date requirements were consolidated into one provision
and the RACT requirement was shifted to the RACM provision. Those provisions (section 172(c)(1)-(2)) now read:






(1) In General_Such (nonattainment SIP) provisions shall provide for the implementation of all reasonably available
control measures as expeditiously as practicable (including such reductions in emissions from existing sources
in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology) and
shall provide for attainment of the national primary ambient air quality standards.

(2) RFP_Such plan provisions shall require reasonable further progress.









In addition, subpart 2 contains several RACT provisions. Most importantly, section 182(b)(2) sets out the RACT requirement
for areas classified moderate or higher, as follows:




The State shall submit a revision to the applicable implementation plan to include provisions to require the implementation
of reasonably available control technology under section 172(c)(1) with respect to each of the following:

(A) Each category of VOC sources in the area covered by a CTG document issued by the Administrator between the date of
enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and the date of attainment.

(B) All VOC sources in the area covered by any CTG issued before the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990.

(C) All other major stationary sources of VOC's that are located in the area.

Each revision described in subparagraph (A) shall be submitted within the period set forth by the Administrator in
issuing the relevant CTG document. The revisions with respect to sources described in subparagraphs (B) and (C) shall
be submitted by 2 years after the date of the enactment of the Act, and shall provide for the implementation of the required
measures as expeditiously as practicable but no later than May 31, 1995.




Under the 1990 Act, the EPA continues to take the position established under the 1977 Act that RACT applies in the aggregate
because the RACT requirement of section 172(c)(1) of the Act is phrased identically to the RACT requirement of the
1977 Act (vis., ``existing sources''). EPA does not read section 182(b)(2) to indicate to the contrary. Rather, the
cross-reference to section 172(c)(1) contained in section 182(b)(2) indicates that RACT is to be interpreted in
the same manner under section 182(b)(2) as under section 172(c)(1).

In addition, the EPA interprets the RACT requirement to authorize emissions trading among the stationary sources
subject to the RACT requirement (``RACT sources'') and those not subject (``non-RACT sources'') when emissions
reductions result in an amount that provides an exceptional environmental benefit, e.g., a level of reductions that
is significantly greater than RACT-level amounts. This interpretation entails viewing the RACT requirement as
generally requiring a specified level of reduction of emissions from stationary sources subject to RACT, but as authorizing
those sources to substitute significantly greater emissions reductions credits from non-RACT sources in lieu of
putting controls on themselves.

The EPA acknowledges that the statute permits different interpretations, including the interpretation that the
universe of sources subject to RACT must themselves implement RACT-level controls, and therefore may not trade with
non-RACT sources. However, the EPA believes that its interpretation allowing such trading is permissible, based
on the language of section 172(c)(1). The EPA's interpretation emphasizes that the RACT requirement is an emissions
reduction requirement for stationary sources that is designed to yield reductions to facilitate the ultimate attainment
of the NAAQS and, in the interim, RFP towards attainment (sections 172(c)(1)-(2)).

Section 172(c)(1), as quoted above, requires SIP provisions to provide ``such reductions in emissions from existing
sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology.
This provision requires an amount of emissions reductions that equates to the amount that would result from the imposition
of ``RACT'', but does not require the imposition of any particular set of controls or technologies. Further, the term
``RACT'' is not defined in the statute. In light of the function of this term_to identify the level of required emissions
reductions_the EPA believes the term may be defined either as a specified level of emissions to be reduced from the
RACT source itself, or as little as a zero level of reductions from the RACT source, coupled with the acquisition by
the RACT source of emissions reductions from sources other than RACT sources in an amount that will yield an exceptional
environmental benefit. 


With respect to the level of emissions reductions required from the RACT source itself, the EPA believes that if the
RACT source acquires an appropriate amount of emissions reductions ``credits'' from non-RACT sources, it is not
reasonable to require additional reductions from the source itself. Under these circumstances, control technology
needed to produce such reductions from the source itself is not ``reasonably available''.

With respect to the level of emissions reductions required from the non-RACT sources, the final rules retain the proposed
approach to define such a benefit in terms of the statutory offset ratios in general, although flexibility is provided
if exceptional environmental benefits are otherwise demonstrated, with a lower bound for the trading ratio of 1.1
to 1 in such cases. EPA believes that these additional amounts of reductions are required because it is ``reasonable''_within
the meaning of the amount of reductions required through ``RACT''_to forego reductions that could be obtained at
the RACT source itself only when the trading program will result in an exceptionally strong benefit to the environment.
In addition, requiring substantial additional emissions reductions credits from non-RACT sources is consistent
with the underlying purpose of the RACT requirement_to assure reductions that result in an important step towards
fulfilling the RFP and attainment requirements. 
The EPA incorporated statutory offset ratios because offsets are an aspect of emissions trading, and thus provide
an indication of Congress' view of benefits to the environment to be required in this context of emissions trading.

Section 182(b)(2), quoted above, does not alter EPA's analysis. Section 182(b)(2) mandates ``the implementation
of reasonably available control technology under section 172(c)(1) with respect to (three categories of stationary
sources).'' The EPA interprets the cross-reference to section 172(c)(1) to incorporate into section 182(b)(2)
the definition of the phrase ``reasonably available control technology'' and the RACT requirement generally under
section 172(c)(1). In addition, the EPA interprets the phrase ``with respect to'' to authorize RACT sources to acquire
emissions reductions credits in the manner described above, and not to mandate the imposition of controls directly
on the RACT sources. The EPA believes that this provision may be interpreted to identify the source categories responsible
for securing RACT-level reductions, and to mandate the time-frame for them to do so; but does not mandate that those
sources themselves implement the emissions reductions measures. 
The EPA believes that its interpretation is permissible under 

Chevron U.S.A. Inc.

 v. 

Natural Resources Defense Council

, 467 U.S. 837 (1984), because the relevant statutory provisions are not defined in the statute in a manner that makes
clear whether sources subject to RACT may acquire the necessary emissions reductions from other sources in lieu of
imposing the controls themselves. As a result, the EPA may proceed to interpret the provision in a manner that is reasonable
and consistent with the purpose of the statute. (See generally sections 110(a)(2)(A) and 172(c)(6) (authorizing
SIP measures to include ``economic incentives such as * * * marketable permits'').) 
As discussed above in paragraph IV.A.2., the final rules and guidance require that EIP's be designed to meet the goal
of sharing benefits between the environment and the regulated entities. For EIP's that allow trading or other types
of compliance flexibility to meet RACT requirements, as with any EIP, the EPA encourages States, to the extent practicable,
to meet this benefits sharing goal most directly by requiring increased emissions reductions beyond those that would
be achieved through a traditional RACT program. Increased reductions could be created in a number of ways, such as
by including more sources in the program or requiring a greater than 1-to-1 trading ratio. Depending on the scope and
nature of an EIP, compliance flexibility might include not only emissions trading between sources, but also alternative
compliance methods such as pollution prevention, energy conservation, and fuel switching. 
RACT/non-RACT trading programs must, of course, also meet the other requirements in the final rules, such as those
that relate to credible, workable, and replicable quantification methods and to monitoring, recordkeeping, and
reporting that allow for compliance determinations and State and Federal enforceability. The EPA recognizes that
several commenters raised concerns about the technical workability of emissions trades involving mobile sources.
Congress arguably contemplated that EIP's could incorporate trades involving mobile sources, as indicated by the
definition of an EIP in section 182(g)(4)(A) to include ``incentives and requirements to reduce vehicle emissions
and vehicle miles traveled in the area, including any of the transportation control measures identified in section
108(f).'' The EPA will address technical concerns raised by commenters when it finalizes guidance on the generation
of ERC's from mobile source control programs. 
Beyond the requirements in the final rules, the EPA is developing more specific guidance on the use of emissions trading
to implement new NO

X

 RACT requirements. This guidance will address issues such as setting tradeable NO

X

 RACT limits and baselines, and is consistent with the general RACT trading principles set out in paragraphs III.D.2.
and III.D.3. The EPA intends to work with States who want to develop trading-based RACT programs to incorporate the
requirements of the EIP rules and related guidance into EIP's that are environmentally sound and administratively
efficient.

2. Offsets 


The EPA received a number of comments specifically dealing with NSR offset issues. These covered a range of issues,
but focused primarily on offsets banking. Such issues are beyond the scope of this EIP rulemaking, but the EPA intends
to address them in the near future in guidance on ERC banking currently being developed. In the interim, the EPA intends
to work with States who want to develop offset banking programs. 


3. ECO Programs 


The EPA received a number of comments dealing with ECO programs which are beyond the scope of this EIP rulemaking. The
EPA has previously issued guidance on ECO programs and anticipates the development of additional guidance. Final
action with respect to ECO programs will occur when the EPA acts on SIP revisions concerning ECO programs. 


C. Program Baseline 


The proposed rules were based on the premise that a State can only take credit in attainment and RFP demonstrations
for emissions reductions from EIP's that are surplus to what is otherwise required and credited to other elements
of a federally-approved SIP. This restriction is necessary to ensure that a State does not double count emissions
reductions in SIP demonstrations. The general requirements for program baselines are intended to ensure that such
double counting does not occur, while still providing as much flexibility as possible. 
The proposal solicited comments on the conditions under which States should have the flexibility to use an ``allowable''
baseline. In particular, comments were solicited on the proposed approach to accept an ``allowable'' baseline in
an EIP submitted in conjunction with the submission of an applicable progress plan (e.g., 15 percent RFP plan and/or
subsequent 3 percent-per-year plans), prior to the submission of an attainment demonstration. Further, comments
were solicited on approaches for achieving consistency between EIP's with ``allowable'' program baselines and
statutory RACT, RFP, and attainment requirements.

There were many comments from industry and State and local agencies in support of the proposed flexibility in setting
baselines. These comments generally supported the concept of considering the use of allowable emissions in setting
EIP baselines, provided the EIP is consistent with RFP and attainment demonstrations. The commenters did not, however,
address how such consistency could be achieved or demonstrated. Some State agencies commented that if allowable
emissions baselines are used, they should not lead to more actual emissions, in the aggregate area-wide, than allowed
under a traditional plan. The commenters felt that this flexibility would allow States to select baselines that were
the most practicable and equitable to all sources involved. 

An alternative view was expressed by an environmental group which advocated that the final rules should require an
actual emissions baseline for all EIP's until the attainment demonstration is approved. This comment was premised
on the belief that an allowable emissions baseline would violate the requirements for attainment as expeditiously
as possible and for noninterference with attainment. The commenter asserted that relying only on a RFP demonstration
and a commitment by the State that a future attainment demonstration would be consistent with the EIP baseline was
a wholly inadequate constraint to ensure expeditious as practicable attainment. Further, this commenter expressed
the view that ``surplus'' reductions should be defined relative to those reductions which are necessary to achieve
attainment. As a result, the commenter concluded that the EPA should not approve any EIP's based on emissions trading
prior to approval of an attainment demonstration. 
 
The final rules and guidance focus on consistency between progress plans and EIP baselines. The rules recognize that
RFP requirements are defined in terms of actual areawide emissions reductions and annual progress. Although such
consistency and requirements may be made more difficult by the use of an EIP baseline which incorporates allowable
emissions, the final rules provide States flexibility in designing an EIP to achieve these requirements. Further,
the final rules encourage the development of EIP's as part of an overall attainment strategy that lowers the cost of
attainment. The final rules recognize that attainment strategies that incorporate EIP's can reflect both environmentally
and economically sound policy choices. Therefore, the final rules retain the proposed baseline flexibility and
definition of surplus, while requiring States to demonstrate in their EIP submittal that the EIP baseline is consistent
with their progress plans

15

 and RACT requirements, when applicable, and to commit that such consistency will be reflected in any subsequent progress
plans and attainment demonstrations. The State should describe how the EIP baseline will be integrated into a subsequent
attainment demonstration. The EPA takes the position that an allowables baseline, when consistent with a submitted,
complete, and potentially approvable RFP plan generally is permissible. It is true, as one commenter emphasized,
that consistency with RFP does not automatically assure consistency with attainment when additional reductions
are needed for attainment. However, the EPA takes the position that an allowables baseline that is consistent with
an RFP submittal does not specifically interfere with attainment under section 110(l). The State's commitment that
the attainment demonstration, when submitted, will be consistent with the allowables baseline lends additional
support to the EPA's position. The inducement to States to complete the attainment demonstration that is presented
by the sanctions/FIP requirement, as well as the fact that emissions limits allowed under the EIP may be tightened
if they unexpectedly develop into impediments to attainment, further support the EPA's positions. 





As stated above in paragraph IV.B.1., the EPA is developing guidance that addresses baselines for EIP's implementing
new NO

X

 RACT requirements. Further, the EPA intends to work with States who want to develop trading-based RACT programs to
incorporate the requirements of the EIP rules and related guidance into EIP's that are environmentally sound and
administratively efficient. 
 


D. Emission Quantification 
 


1. Criteria for Adequacy of Approach 
 


The proposed rules and guidance were based on the premise that the development and use of credible, workable, and replicable
methods to quantify emissions are necessary elements of any quantifiable EIP. The proposed rules require EIP quantification
methods to have a level of certainty comparable to that for source-specific standards and traditional methods of
control strategy development. The proposal explicitly allowed States to develop alternative approaches to meet
these emissions quantification requirements. The proposal solicited comments on adequacy criteria for various
types of source categories, recognizing that no one approach is the most appropriate, or even technically feasible,
for all source categories.

<TEXT>
 

Most comments received on this issue were supportive of the general requirements in the proposal. Of those supporting
the general requirements, no commenters offered any specific criteria for levels of certainty or accuracy by which
quantification approaches should be evaluated. On the other hand, an environmental group commented that, for trading
programs, the EPA should require the use of the most accurate available continuous emissions monitors (CEM's) on
every source in an emissions trading program, and, where such direct emissions quantification is not possible, no
emissions trading should be allowed. 
 
The final rules reflect the importance of both ensuring environmental protection with an adequate degree of accountability
and fostering the development of innovative and flexible programs. Innovation and flexibility would be unduly restricted
if the use of the most accurate available CEM's were a prerequisite for all sources to be included in any emissions trading
program. The final rules recognize that other approaches may be more appropriate for various source categories.
The final rules reflect that credible approaches necessarily entail levels of accuracy and precision sufficient
to determine compliance and allow for effective enforcement of all emission limits in any EIP. Subject to these enforceability
considerations, the final rules address uncertainty in emission quantification in determining SIP credit through
the use of a programmatic uncertainty factor. 
 
A commenter stressed that the need to assure accuracy in trading would further burden State agencies, and argued that
EPA could not approve an EIP absent a demonstration that the State agency has adequate resources to handle the additional
workload. Many of the additional requirements Congress imposed on States through the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990 would place additional burdens on State agencies_EPA intends to implement the Act's requirements that States
have sufficient resources (e.g., section 110(a)(2)(E)) in the context of EIP submissions in the same manner as EPA
implements these requirements in the context of other SIP submissions. 
 


2. Extended Averaging Times 
 


The proposed rules recognize that long-term averaging by individual sources can significantly relax standards
that require compliance on a short-term basis and jeopardize RFP and attainment demonstrations that are based on
``typical summer day'' emissions. The proposal also recognized that EIP's which require a number of sources to comply
with total emissions caps or average emission rate limits could potentially mitigate this type of rule relaxation.
In such programs, random daily positive fluctuations in emissions that are likely to occur from any given source (i.e.,
emission ``spikes'' that could jeopardize attainment) may tend to be compensated for by random daily negative fluctuations
from other sources. Thus, the proposal allowed long-term averaging, provided a statistical showing is made that
the long-term caps or limits are consistent with applicable demonstrations of RFP on the basis of typical summer day
emissions, demonstrations of attainment of short-term NAAQS, and RACT requirements. The proposed approach provided
increased flexibility to sources and to States in their plan development without undermining the EPA's traditional
control programs or the validity of RFP or attainment demonstrations. 
 
The proposal recognized the need for additional guidance on such statistical ``equivalency'' showings. The proposal
also solicited comments on specific approaches for RACT equivalency showings, including the use of a presumptive
norm discount factor of 70 percent to be applied to a RACT limit averaged over 30 days, other rule-specific discount
factors determined by States to represent RACT equivalency, and the use of short-term caps in conjunction with long-term
caps or limits. 
 
Many commenters supported the proposed flexibility to allow for long-term averaging. One State commenter strongly
supported the provision to allow States to relate long-term averaging to daily emissions by statistical analysis.
Another State agreed that the use of long-term averaging should not come at the expense of attaining short-term standards
or demonstrations of compliance. Other States noted the need for consistency in the EPA's RACT guidance on averaging
times. Industry commenters endorsed the allowance of long-term averaging, although they expressed differing views
about the need for statistical showings to demonstrate consistency with RACT and short-term standards. Some felt
that any such showing should not be burdensome, while others disagreed that any such showing was necessary. An environmental
group agreed that increasing averaging periods can significantly relax standards and threaten RFP and attainment.
This group commented, however, that the proposal understated the difficulties which would flow from such a relaxation,
and felt that discount factors would not provide adequate protection against spikes in emissions which could prevent
attainment of short-term NAAQS. 
 
With regard to long-term averaging and RACT equivalency, many commenters disagreed with the use of a presumptive
30-day RACT equivalency factor, such as the 70 percent factor mentioned in the proposal. One commenter felt that a
RACT equivalency showing should not be required if some statistical information was provided showing that long-term
averaging would not interfere with RFP or the attainment demonstration. Many regulatory agency and industry commenters
supported allowing States flexibility in determining RACT equivalency factors.

The final rules retain the proposed allowance for long-term emissions averaging, as well as requirements that States
make statistical showings that any such emissions averaging is consistent with applicable RACT, RFP, and short-term
NAAQS. These statistical showings are necessary to show equivalency to, or noninterference with, each of these statutory
requirements, although as a practical matter the same showing may suffice to assure consistency with more than one
of the requirements. The statistical showings should take into account the extent to which emissions variations
from an individual source or from all sources are random or systematic and, thus, the extent to which the variations
can be considered to be independent. The showings must demonstrate that the pattern of emissions resulting from relaxed
averaging periods would approximate the pattern of emissions that would occur without relaxed averaging periods
to an extent sufficient to reasonably conclude that the relaxed averaging periods would not interfere with the statutory
requirements. 

The final rules do not include any presumptive RACT discount factor, on the basis that no one factor can adequately
account for the variations that may occur across different programs. However, the EPA remains open-minded to discount
factors, especially for specific industries, that are substantiated by State analyses. The EPA will work with States
that want to develop EIP's that incorporate long-term averaging requirements to ensure that such a program does not
interfere with RFP and the attainment of short-term standards. The EPA anticipates that more general guidance will
be developed in the course of working with States on statistical approaches for such equivalency demonstrations.
In the case of EIP's implementing RACT requirements, the guidance referenced above in paragraph IV.B.1. addresses
long-term averaging for NO

X

 RACT.

E. Monitoring, Recordkeeping, Reporting (MRR) 



The proposed rules were based on the premise that EIP's depend more strongly than traditional control programs on
MRR to ensure compliance and to allow for adequate enforcement because they are inherently more flexible and less
prescriptive than traditional technology or performance standards. The proposal recognized that while a wide range
of MRR approaches are available that can be used to show compliance for different types of sources, no one approach
is necessarily the most appropriate, or even technically feasible, for all types of sources that may be included in
an EIP. Thus, the proposal explicitly allowed for alternative monitoring methods, while soliciting comments on
criteria for adequate MRR requirements for EIP's. 

Public comments focused on whether EIP's do depend more strongly on MRR and on whether CEM's should be required for
any or all sources covered by an EIP. Several industry commenters disagreed with the premise that EIP's depend more
strongly on MRR to ensure compliance, and, therefore, felt that no more stringent MRR requirements should be required
in EIP's than those required in traditional programs. These commenters supported the provision allowing a range
of MRR requirements to be used in EIP's. 

One State commented that EIP's should be limited to source categories for which emission quantification and compliance
methods are available and reasonably accurate. This State felt that the use of CEM's was the optimal monitoring method,
although it recognized that other unit-specific field monitoring methods could be acceptable. An environmental
group commented that the rules should require use of the most accurate available CEM's on every source involved in
any emissions trading program. Further, this group felt that the maximum amount of CEM measurement inaccuracy should
be reflected in a program discount factor. On the other hand, some industry commenters urged that EIP's not require
the use of CEM's for any sources. 

The final rules retain the proposed flexibility for alternative monitoring approaches that allow for adequate compliance
determinations and provide for effective State and Federal enforcement. As discussed above (see paragraph IV.D.1.),
innovation and flexibility would be unduly restricted if CEM's were a prerequisite for all sources in any emissions
trading program. In the development of adequate MRR requirements, criteria should be considered to assure that quality-assured,
representative monitoring data will be obtained that can be used to determine compliance. 

The EPA recognizes that special consideration should be given to developing MRR requirements for small sources to
avoid undue burdens, consistent with assuring that all EIP sources are required to comply with adequate and effective
MRR requirements. For mobile source programs, the State should refer to program-specific guidance from EPA, if applicable.




F. State Implementation Plan (SIP) Creditability 



The proposed rules identify various types of uncertainties associated with different categories of EIP's, and required
that States apply discount factors in calculating SIP credit based on the uncertainties inherent in the design of
any given EIP. The proposal separately addressed compliance-related uncertainty, through a rule compliance factor,
and programmatic uncertainties associated with quantification methods and projected market responses, through
a program uncertainty factor. The proposal compared the need for a rule compliance factor to the historical use of
a rule effectiveness factor, generally set at 80 percent for traditional stationary source SIP programs. The proposal
identified an option of setting presumptive norms for these factors in lieu of the requirement that the State develop
and justify program-specific factors. The proposal solicited comments on criteria for the development of such factors.


Many commenters expressed different concerns with the proposed approach to dealing with uncertainty. Some commenters
interpreted the proposal as allowing credit only for emission-limiting programs (e.g., emission trading), and
argued that credit should be allowed for market-response programs (e.g., emission fees) and even directionally-sound
programs (e.g., those that benefit the environment but cannot be quantified). One such commenter, an environmental
group, urged not only that credit be given for emission fee programs, but that they must be encouraged since they offer
the most attractive opportunity for environmental progress. In fact, the proposed and final rules allow credit for
market-response as well as emission limiting programs, and encourage States to consider all such types of programs.
The proposed and final rules also encourage the use of directionally-sound programs, but specify that SIP credit
cannot be taken until sufficient experience with the program results in the ability to adequately quantify the results.


Some State commenters expressed general concern with the use of any up-front discounting of SIP credit, urging instead
that alternative approaches be allowed to account for uncertainty. In particular, some State commenters recommended
that the program audit procedures be used to provide information on actual emissions reductions resulting from program
implementation. Such audit results would feed back into updated emissions inventories, be compared to initially
projected program results, and if appropriate, result in additional credit or the need for additional reductions
if the audited results differ from those credited to the EIP in the SIP. One State commenter recommended that the State
be allowed to adopt various back-up provisions in an EIP instead of applying up-front discount factors.

<PARENT> FR940407-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Some industry commenters disagreed with the use of two discount factors, on the basis that such an approach would double
count uncertainty. These commenters also expressed the view that a presumptive norm of 80 percent for a rule compliance
factor is too low. On the other hand, an environmental group commented that a presumptive norm of 80 percent was too
high. This commenter also urged that credit not be given for prior reductions or for plant shutdowns and slowdowns
which would have occurred in the absence of a control program. 

The final rules generally retain the proposed approach of requiring the State to develop and apply discount factors
to account for compliance-related and programmatic design uncertainties. In addition, however, the final rules
also include further guidance and criteria for developing and justifying such factors. In particular, various aspects
of program design should be considered in developing such factors, including but not limited to the type of incentive
mechanism upon which the program is based; the variability in emissions from affected sources and the nature and extent
of uncertainty in the emissions quantification procedures required by the program; the type and frequency of MRR
required by the program; sanctions for noncompliance; the frequency, scope, and committed responses to program
audits; and the nature of administrative procedures to be used by the State in implementing and enforcing the program.



G. Audit/Reconciliation Procedures 



The proposed rules specify that program audits be made at least every 3 years, consistent with intervals associated
with RFP milestones and emission inventory requirements. Alternatively, the State could specify a shorter period,
so as to allow time to make programmatic corrections or adjustments (in either direction) to SIP credited emissions
reductions, before an RFP milestone is reached. The proposal solicited comments on the appropriate audit frequency.


Several comments were received on the general issue of programs audits. Most such comments were generally supportive
of a requirement for ongoing program tracking and feedback, although the commenters differed on the role that the
audit should have relative to other EIP requirements. Some State commenters felt that ongoing audits should serve
as an alternative to many of the proposed regulatory requirements for up-front technical analyses. Another State
supported the use of audits to assess EIP adequacy and the need to take corrective actions. An environmental group
recommended that the EPA require for all EIP's contingency measures to compensate for shortfalls revealed through
the audits. Other State, environmental, and industry commenters felt that requiring audits was reasonable, but
expressed varying degrees of concern that audits not become so burdensome as to serve as a disincentive for developing
an EIP. On the other hand, one industry commenter felt that EIP's ought not be subject to any special audit requirements
different from those applicable to traditional programs. 

On the issue of audit frequency, most commenters generally agreed with the proposed 3-year interval. One State commenter
felt that annual audits should be conducted to assess progress, with a summary of such audits to be incorporated in
triennial SIP RFP reports. 

The final rules and guidance retain the proposed requirements for program audit and reconciliation procedures,
and establish 3 years as the maximum time interval for conducting such audits. The final rules recognize that the State
has flexibility in establishing the frequency (within the 3-year constraint) and scope of audit provisions. Further,
the final rules recognize that there is an interplay between the frequency, scope, and other design features of the
audit provisions and the nature and scope of other program design elements (such as the justification for uncertainty
factors). In addition, to better define the benefits from EIP's, the final rules include analysis of control cost
savings, to the extent practicable, as a part of the required program audit. 



H. Penalties for Noncompliance 



The proposed rules recognize that determination of statutory maximum penalties for noncompliance is significantly
complicated in the case of EIP's that incorporate multisource emissions caps and/or long-term averaging times,
since Federal statutory maximum penalty authority is specified on a per-day, per-source basis. While establishing
the principle that such penalty provisions must create a deterrent effect comparable to that of traditional programs,
the proposal solicited comment on criteria for the development of such penalty provisions. 

Commenters generally agreed with the principle of equivalent deterrence. Several industry commenters opposed
any criteria that would suggest that any multisource emissions cap violation should be considered to have occurred
at each source. Some commenters recommended that penalty provisions be based on the amount of the exceedence of a cap,
and one commenter suggested that the final rules should recommend predetermined minimum penalties. Another commenter
recommended that penalty provisions differentiate between violations that are willful or negligent and those that
are determined not to be willful or negligent.

<DOCNO> FR940407-0-00089 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940407-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The final rules and guidance continue to allow for a variety of approaches to specifying statutory maximum penalties,
although exceedance-based approaches are encouraged. Thus, for example, where emission limits are specified in
units of mass emissions, statutory maximum penalties can be specified as a function of the degree to which the limits
are exceeded, as measured in terms of some increment of mass emissions. Alternatively, statutory maximum penalties
could be specified as a function of the cost of credits or allowances in trading programs. The final rules and guidance
require that EIP's be structured in conjunction with applicable enforcement authorities, in such a way that violations
of multisource and/or multiday emission limits translate into sufficient numbers of some combination of violations,
sources in violation, and days of violation. There are no criteria that suggest that this requirement should necessarily
be met by considering that the violation occurred at each such source. The final rules further identify supplemental
provisions that may enhance deterrence, such as mandatory minimum penalties, or address uncertainties inherent
in the design of a program, such as penalty triggers linked to measures of compliance tracked through the program audit.


The following criteria have been established for assessing the adequacy of the deterrent effect of EIP penalty provisions.
The primary focus is on an assessment of the adequacy of the statutory maximum penalties in the EIP, through an evaluation
of deterrence ratios (i.e., the ratio of the maximum penalty per violation to the cost of compliance). In a program
with tradeable emission allowances or ERC's, the cost of compliance will be related to the market value of allowances
or credits. Under a range of foreseeable noncompliance circumstances, this deterrence ratio must be high enough
to deter noncompliance to a degree comparable to traditional programs. 

Other aspects of deterrence should also be considered in evaluating the adequacy of penalty provisions. These aspects
include the likelihood that noncompliance will be detected and the credibility and predictability of responses
to noncompliance. These aspects should be considered in light of administrative procedures and resources established
within the EIP, as well as other program design elements related to emission quantification and monitoring, recordkeeping,
and reporting. 



I. Interface With Existing Emission Trading Policies 



The EIP rules and guidance, being broadly applicable to any kind of EIP, generally cover the same type of emission trading
programs that have historically been addressed by the EPA's previously released guidance on emission trading, primarily
contained in the Emissions Trading Policy Statement (ETPS) and its appendices (51 FR 43831, Dec. 4, 1986). Although
based upon the same general principles, the EIP rules and guidance provide both greater flexibility and more comprehensive
programmatic requirements for such programs. The proposal defined the relationship between the EIP rules and the
ETPS such that the provisions of the ETPS which apply to trading between existing sources (i.e., the bubble and generic
bubble provisions) would represent one particular model for how States could choose to design such a program that
would be approvable under the EIP rules. The proposal, however, in no way constrained EIP's involving emission trading
to the specific provisions of the ETPS. The proposal solicited comments on this proposed relationship. 

Only a few commenters addressed this issue. Two commenters agreed with the proposed approach. Another commenter
disagreed with retaining the elements of the ETPS that are now addressed by the EIP rules, on the basis that such ETPS
provisions are rendered obsolete by the new rules, and the EPA should not encourage the use of less flexible policies.
Another commenter recommended that the ETPS should be updated to include the flexibility contained in the EIP rules
and that it should then continue to be applied to trading done for the purpose of meeting other statutory requirements
(e.g., RACT/non-RACT trading). 

The final rules retain the proposed relationship between the ETPS and the EIP rules. The final rules do not encourage
States to limit their design of EIP's to meet the specific provisions in the ETPS. However, the final rules recognize
that States may want to implement emission trading without embarking on the design of new approaches to emission trading.
Retaining the ETPS provides a known regulatory option for those States that want to apply it.

J. General Issues 

 

1. Detailed vs. General Guidance 

 

Some commenters felt that the EIP proposal was overly specific and limited flexibility. These commenters contended
that it would be difficult for EPA guidance to anticipate and identify all of the specific elements of proposed programs
that might be approvable until actual programs are developed and adopted. They felt that the final EIP rules should
be limited to a detailed policy statement and discussion of principles and criteria to which EIP's must adhere rather
than specific guidance on how EIP programs should be designed and administered. 
 
Other commenters, including a State and an environmental group, felt that the final rules should include more detailed
guidance. One such commenter felt that without more detailed guidance, technical questions such as how to calculate
emissions reductions or to establish baselines might be so daunting as to discourage attempts to develop EIP's. This
commenter felt that the need for such guidance is particularly great for EIP's relying on area and mobile source emissions
reductions. Another such commenter felt that without more detailed guidance spelling out appropriate design criteria
and policy and legal limitations, States will succumb to pressures to develop EIP's that do not effectively implement
the requirements of the Act. 

Some commenters on both sides of this issue recommended that the EPA provide examples of successful, appropriate
EIP's. Such commenters recommended that such information be provided through supplemental documentation or through
an EPA-established EIP information clearinghouse. 
 
Just as an individual State EIP rule should balance flexibility with specificity, the EPA's final EIP rules should
do the same. Thus, the final rules retain the balance between general statements of principles and criteria and specific
detailed guidance on technical requirements that was reflected in the proposal. The final rules provide sufficient
detail to allow States to design and implement EIP's that will effectively implement the requirements of the Act without
defeating the purpose of capturing the benefits of market-based regulatory approaches. 
 
Although the final rules do not include specific examples of EIP's that have been successfully implemented, the EPA
agrees that such information is a useful and important aspect of encouraging the development of such programs. For
the last 3 years, the EPA has funded grants to support market-based initiatives by State, regional and local agencies.

16

 All such initiatives have included strong involvement from the State, affected local interests, and the relevant
EPA Regional Office(s). Final reports from these projects are available from the States to further the EPA's goal
of disseminating information about the design and implementation of EIP's. 





Beyond this grant program, the EPA is committed to working with individual States as they develop EIP's. In addition
to the program survey documents which have been placed in the docket, the EPA is developing plans for future outreach
activities to make information about successful EIP initiatives as broadly available as possible. 
 


2. Administrative Simplicity 
 


Several commenters agreed that administrative complexity can be one of the greatest impediments to a regulation
and urged the EPA to simplify the terms and processes of these rules. Such commenters felt that undue administrative
complexity would stifle the development of EIP's and provide a significant disincentive for participation in trading
programs. These commenters generally felt that the EIP rules should minimize regulatory barriers because they interfere
with the functioning of desirable market mechanisms which are necessary for the success of the EIP. 
 
One type of complexity cited by two State commenters related to excessive government process, and the associated
lack of timeliness, in the review of individual emissions trades. These commenters recommended that individual
emissions trading transactions not be required to be submitted to the EPA for review once a State's generic trading
rule has been approved by the EPA. Further, one such commenter recommended more focus on the audit and evaluation of
an EIP program, rather than on administrative burdens upfront in implementing emissions trades. This commenter
felt that the EPA should have the authority to conduct periodic audits of emissions trading transactions approved
by the States to assure the integrity of the program. 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940407-0-00091 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940407-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In seeking to provide States with the flexibility to implement emissions trading programs effectively, the final
EIP rules retain the proposed requirement for the State to establish appropriate administrative procedures for
conducting, approving, verifying, recording, and tracking trades. As part of an EIP program, these procedures would
then be reviewed by the EPA in the course of EPA review of the SIP revision incorporating the EIP into the SIP. Thus, the
EIP does not necessarily envision single-source SIP revisions for each trade conducted in the context of an EPA-approved
generic emissions trading program. Of course, EPA approval of such programs is predicated on the program containing
all the appropriate environmental safeguards that are required by the EIP rules. One such safeguard is the inclusion
of program audits, to be conducted by the State, to evaluate program implementation and track program results. The
EIP rules require that the State provide post-audit reports to the EPA, and that the State commits to implement timely
programmatic revisions or other measures necessary for the successful operation of the program. Additionally,
the rules require that State and Federal enforceability must be preserved, such that when ERC's generated within
an emissions trading program are used to offset increases in emissions from other sources, the EIP must contain a mechanism
for ensuring State and Federal enforceability of the measures taken to generate the credits. 
 
The EPA is currently developing additional guidance on such issues associated with banking of ERC's. The EPA intends
to complete this additional guidance as quickly as possible, and, in the interim, to work with States developing EIP's
involving banking of ERC's. 
 


3. Regional and Interstate Trading 

 

Neither the proposal nor final rules specifically address the issue of regional and interstate emissions trading.
Several commenters raised this issue, however, particularly in the context of trading of emissions offsets. Most
such commenters felt that the EPA should encourage interstate trading by establishing consistent rules and prohibiting
States from creating interstate barriers. One State group felt that the final rules should provide for the fullest
possible implementation of trading strategies on a regional basis within the Northeast Ozone Transport Region.
One environmental group urged that the final rules remind States of the statutory geographical constraints on trading.

 
The EPA has developed some preliminary guidance on this issue as it relates to NO

x

 offsets in the Northeast Ozone Transport Region.

17

 Additional guidance on interstate or regional trading will be developed in the context of the EPA's working with interested
States in program development activities. 





V. Administrative Requirements 
 


A. Executive Order 12866 
 


Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
 
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; 

(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another Agency; 
 
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
 
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order.'' 
 
It has been determined that these rules are not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order
12866. This action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations
will be documented in the public record. 
 


B. Paperwork Reduction Act 
 


These rules do not contain any information collection requirements subject to review by the OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq. 



C. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
 


The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 and applicable EPA guidelines revised in 1992 require Federal agencies to
identify potentially adverse impacts of Federal rules upon small entities. Small entities include small businesses,
organizations, and governmental jurisdictions. In instances where significant impacts are possible on a substantial
number of these entities, agencies are required to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA). 

This rule does not of itself impose any requirements on small entities, nor require or exclude small entities from
any EIP's which may be implemented in the future. As a result, the EPA has determined that these rules will not 
have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
 
Therefore, as required under section 605 of the RFA, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., 

I certify that these rules do not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

on discretionary EIP's submitted as implementation plan revisions for any purpose other than to comply with the statutory
requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section. 


 51.491 


Definitions. 




Act 

means the Clean Air Act as amended November 15, 1990. 


Actual emissions 

means the emissions of a pollutant from an affected source determined by taking into account actual emission rates
associated with normal source operation and actual or representative production rates (i.e., capacity utilization
and hours of operation).



Affected source 

means any stationary, area, or mobile source of a criteria pollutant(s) to which an EIP applies. This term applies
to sources explicitly included at the start of a program, as well as sources that voluntarily enter (i.e., opt into)
the program.



Allowable emissions 

means the emissions of a pollutant from an affected source determined by taking into account the most stringent of
all applicable SIP emissions limits and the level of emissions consistent with source compliance with all Federal
requirements related to attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS and the production rate associated with the maximum
rated capacity and hours of operation (unless the source is subject to federally enforceable limits which restrict
the operating rate, or hours of operation, or both).



Area sources 

means stationary and nonroad sources that are too small and/or too numerous to be individually included in a stationary
source emissions inventory.



Attainment area 

means any area of the country designated or redesignated by the EPA at 40 CFR part 81 in accordance with section 107(d)
as having attained the relevant NAAQS for a given criteria pollutant. An area can be an attainment area for some pollutants
and a nonattainment area for other pollutants.



Attainment demonstration 

means the requirement in section 182(b)(1)(A) of the Act to demonstrate that the specific annual emissions reductions
included in a SIP are sufficient to attain the primary NAAQS by the date applicable to the area.



Directionally-sound strategies

 are strategies for which adequate procedures to quantify emissions reductions or specify a program baseline are
not defined as part of the EIP.



Discretionary economic incentive program 

means any EIP submitted to the EPA as an implementation plan revision for purposes other than to comply with the statutory
requirements of sections 182(g)(3), 182(g)(5), 187(d)(3), or 187(g) of the Act.

Economic incentive program (EIP) 

means a program which may include State established emission fees or a system of marketable permits, or a system of
State fees on sale or manufacture of products the use of which contributes to O

3

 formation, or any combination of the foregoing or other similar measures, as well as incentives and requirements
to reduce vehicle emissions and vehicle miles traveled in the area, including any of the transportation control measures
identified in section 108(f). Such programs may be directed toward stationary, area, and/or mobile sources, to achieve
emissions reductions milestones, to attain and maintain ambient air quality standards, and/or to provide more flexible,
lower-cost approaches to meeting environmental goals. Such programs are categorized into the following three categories:
Emission-limiting, market-response, and directionally-sound strategies.



Emission-limiting strategies 

are strategies that directly specify limits on total mass emissions, emission-related parameters (e.g., emission
rates per unit of production, product content limits), or levels of emissions reductions relative to a program baseline
that are required to be met by affected sources, while providing flexibility to sources to reduce the cost of meeting
program requirements.



Indian governing body 

means the governing body of any tribe, band, or group of Indians subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. and recognized
by the U.S. as possessing power of self-government.



Maintenance plan 

means an implementation plan for an area for which the State is currently seeking designation or has previously sought
redesignation to attainment, under section 107(d) of the Act, which provides for the continued attainment of the
NAAQS.



Market-response strategies 

are strategies that create one or more incentives for affected sources to reduce emissions, without directly specifying
limits on emissions or emission-related parameters that individual sources or even all sources in the aggregate
are required to meet.



Milestones 

means the reductions in emissions required to be achieved pursuant to section 182(b)(1) and the corresponding requirements
in section 182(c)(2) (B) and (C), 182(d), and 182(e) of the Act for O

3

 nonattainment areas, as well as the reduction in emissions of CO equivalent to the total of the specified annual emissions
reductions required by December 31, 1995, pursuant to section 187(d)(1).



Mobile sources 

means on-road (highway) vehicles (e.g., automobiles, trucks and motorcycles) and nonroad vehicles (e.g., trains,
airplanes, agricultural equipment, industrial equipment, construction vehicles, off-road motorcycles, and
marine vessels).



National ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) 

means a standard set by the EPA at 40 CFR part 50 under section 109 of the Act.



Nonattainment area 

means any area of the country designated by the EPA at 40 CFR part 81 in accordance with 
section 107(d) of the Act as nonattainment for one or more criteria pollutants. An area could be a nonattainment area
for some pollutants and an attainment area for other pollutants.



Nondiscriminatory 

means that a program in one State does not result in discriminatory effects on other States or sources outside the State
with regard to interstate commerce.



Program baseline 

means the level of emissions, or emission-related parameter(s), for each affected source or group of affected sources,
from which program results (e.g., quantifiable emissions reductions) shall be determined.



Program uncertainty factor 

means a factor applied to discount the amount of emissions reductions credited in an implementation plan demonstration
to account for any strategy-specific uncertainties in an EIP.



Reasonable further progress (RFP) plan 

means any incremental emissions reductions required by the CAA 
(e.g., section 182(b)) and approved by the EPA as meeting these requirements.

RFP baseline 

means the total of actual volatile organic compounds or nitrogen oxides emissions from all anthropogenic sources
in an O

3

 nonattainment area during the calendar year 1990 (net of growth and adjusted pursuant to section 182(b)(1)(B) of
the Act), expressed as typical O

3

 season, weekday emissions.



Replicable 

refers to methods which are sufficiently unambiguous such that the same or equivalent results would be obtained by
the application of the methods by different users.



Rule compliance factor 

means a factor applied to discount the amount of emissions reductions credited in an implementation plan demonstration
to account for less-than-complete compliance by the affected sources in an EIP.



Shortfall 

means the difference between the amount of emissions reductions credited in an implementation plan for a particular
EIP and those that are actually achieved by that EIP, as determined through an approved reconciliation process.



State 

means State, local government, or Indian-governing body.



State implementation plan (SIP) 

means a plan developed by an authorized governing body, including States, local governments, and Indian-governing
bodies, in a nonattainment area, as required under titles I & II of the Clean Air Act, and approved by the EPA as meeting
these same requirements. 


Stationary source 

means any building, structure, facility or installation, other than an area or mobile source, which emits or may emit
any criteria air pollutant or precursor subject to regulation under the Act.



Statutory economic incentive program 

means any EIP submitted to the EPA as an implementation plan revision to comply with sections 182(g)(3), 182(g)(5),
187(d)(3), or 187(g) of the Act.



Surplus 

means, at a minimum, emissions reductions in excess of an established program baseline which are not required by SIP
requirements or State regulations, relied upon in any applicable attainment plan or demonstration, or credited
in any RFP or milestone demonstration, so as to prevent the double-counting of emissions reductions.



Transportation control measure (TCM) 

is any measure of the types listed in section 108(F) of the Act, or any measure in an applicable implementation plan
directed toward reducing emissions of air pollutants from transportation sources by a reduction in vehicle use or
changes in traffic conditions.

(i) A required milestone compliance demonstration is not submitted within the required period. 

(ii) The Administrator determines that the area has not met any applicable milestone. 

(2) The plan revision in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be submitted within 9 months after such failure or determination,
and shall be sufficient, in combination with other elements of the SIP, to achieve the next milestone. 

(b) 

Serious CO nonattainment areas.

 (1) A State or authorized governing body for any serious CO nonattainment area shall submit a plan revision to implement
an EIP, in accordance with the requirements of this part, if: 

(i) A milestone demonstration is not submitted within the required period, pursuant to section 187(d) of the Act.


(ii) The Administrator notifies the State, pursuant to section 187(d) of the Act, that a milestone has not been met.


(iii) The Administrator determines, pursuant to section 186(b)(2) of the Act that the NAAQS for CO has not been attained
by the applicable date for that area. Such revision shall be submitted within 9 months after such failure or determination.


(2) Submittals made pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section shall be sufficient, together with
a transportation control program, to achieve the specific annual reductions in CO emissions set forth in the implementation
plan by the attainment date. Submittals made pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section shall be adequate,
in combination with other elements of the revised plan, to reduce the total tonnage of emissions of CO in the area by
at least 5 percent per year in each year after approval of the plan revision and before attainment of the NAAQS for CO.


(c)

 nonattainment area, elects to implement an EIP in the circumstances set out in section 182(g)(3) of the Act, the State
shall submit a plan revision to implement the program in accordance with the requirements of this part. If the option
to implement an EIP is elected, a plan revision shall be submitted within 12 months after the date required for election,
and shall be sufficient, in combination with other elements of the SIP, to achieve the next milestone. 

(d) 

Any nonattainment or attainment area.

 Any State may at any time submit a plan or plan revision to implement a discretionary EIP, in accordance with the requirements
of this part, pursuant to sections 110(a)(2)(A) and 172(c)(6) and other applicable provisions of the Act concerning
SIP submittals. The plan revision shall not interfere with any applicable requirement concerning attainment and
RFP, or any other applicable requirements of the Act. 



 51.493 

State program requirements. 



Economic incentive programs shall be State and federally enforceable, nondiscriminatory, and consistent with
the timely attainment of NAAQS, all applicable RFP and visibility requirements, applicable PSD increments, and
all other applicable requirements of the Act. Programs in nonattainment areas for which credit is taken in attainment
and RFP demonstrations shall be designed to ensure that the effects of the program are quantifiable and permanent
over the entire duration of the program, and that the credit taken is limited to that which is surplus. Statutory programs
shall be designed to result in quantifiable, significant reductions in actual emissions. The EIP's shall include
the following elements, as applicable: 

(a) 

Statement of goals and rationale.

 This element shall include a clear statement as to the environmental problem being addressed, the intended environmental
and economic goals of the program, and the rationale relating the incentive-based strategy to the program goals.


(1) The statement of goals must include the goal that the program will benefit both the environment and the regulated
entities. The program shall be designed so as to meaningfully meet this goal either directly, through increased or
more rapid emissions reductions beyond those that would be achieved through a traditional regulatory program, or,
alternatively, through other approaches that will result in real environmental benefits. Such alternative approaches
include, but are not limited to, improved administrative mechanisms, reduced administrative burdens on regulatory
agencies, improved emissions inventories, and the adoption of emission caps which over time constrain or reduce
growth-related emissions beyond traditional regulatory approaches. 

(2) The incentive-based strategy shall be described in terms of one of the following three strategies: 

(i) Emission-limiting strategies, which directly specify limits on total mass emissions, emission-related parameters
(e.g., emission rates per unit of production, product content limits), or levels of emissions reductions relative
to a program baseline that affected sources are required to meet, while providing flexibility to sources to reduce
the cost of meeting program requirements. 

(ii) Market-response strategies, which create one or more incentives for affected sources to reduce emissions,
without directly specifying limits on emissions or emission-related parameters that individual sources or even
all sources in the aggregate are required to meet. 

(iii) Directionally-sound strategies, for which adequate procedures to quantify emissions reductions are not
defined.

<TEXT>
 

(b) 

Program scope.

 (1) This element shall contain a clear definition of the sources affected by the program. This definition shall address:


(i) The extent to which the program is mandatory or voluntary for the affected sources. 

(ii) Provisions, if any, by which sources that are not required to be in the program may voluntarily enter the program.


(iii) Provisions, if any, by which sources covered by the program may voluntarily leave the program. 

(2) Any opt-in or opt-out provisions in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be designed to provide mechanisms by
which such program changes are reflected in an area's attainment and RFP demonstrations, thus ensuring that there
will not be an increase in the emissions inventory for the area caused by voluntary entry or exit from the program. 

(3) The program scope shall be defined so as not to interfere with any other Federal requirements which apply to the
affected sources. 

(c) 

Program baseline.

 A program baseline shall be defined as a basis for projecting program results and, if applicable, for initializing
the incentive mechanism (e.g., for marketable permits programs). The program baseline shall be consistent with,
and adequately reflected in, the assumptions and inputs used to develop an area's RFP plans and attainment and maintenance
demonstrations, as applicable. The State shall provide sufficient supporting information from the areawide emissions
inventory and other sources to justify the baseline used in the EIP. 

(1) For EIP's submitted in conjunction with, or subsequent to, the submission of any areawide progress plan due at
the time of EIP submission (e.g., the 15 percent RFP plan and/or subsequent 3 percent plans) or an attainment demonstration,
a State may exercise flexibility in setting a program baseline provided the program baseline is consistent with and
reflected in all relevant progress plans or attainment demonstration. A flexible program baseline may be based on
the lower of actual, allowable, or some other intermediate or lower level of emissions. For any EIP submitted prior
to the submittal of an attainment demonstration, the State shall include the following with its EIP submittal: 

(i) A commitment that its subsequent attainment demonstration and all future progress plans, if applicable, will
be consistent with the EIP baseline. 

(ii) A discussion of how the baseline will be integrated into the subsequent attainment demonstration, taking into
account the potential that credit issued prior to the attainment demonstration may no longer be surplus relative
to the attainment demonstration.

(2) Except as provided for in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, for EIP's submitted during a time period when any progress
plans are required but not yet submitted (e.g., the 15 percent RFP plan and/or the subsequent 3 percent plans), the
program baseline shall be based on the lower-of-actual-or-allowable emissions. In such cases, actual emissions
shall be taken from the most appropriate inventory, such as the 1990 actual emission inventory (due for submission
in November 1992), and allowable emissions are the lower of SIP-allowable emissions or the level of emissions consistent
with source compliance with all Federal requirements related to attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS. 
(3) For EIP's that are designed to implement new and/or previously existing RACT requirements through emissions
trading and are submitted in conjunction with, or subsequent to, the submission of an associated RACT rule, a State
may exercise flexibility in setting a program baseline provided the program baseline is consistent with and reflected
in the associated RACT rule, and any applicable progress plans and attainment demonstrations. 
(4) For EIP's that are designed to implement new and/or previously existing RACT requirements through emissions
trading and are submitted prior to the submission of a required RFP plan or attainment demonstration, States also
have flexibility in determining the program baseline, provided the following conditions are met. 
(i) For EIP's that implement new RACT requirements for previously unregulated source categories through emissions
trading, the new RACT requirements must reflect, to the extent practicable, increased emissions reductions beyond
those that would be achieved through a traditional RACT program. 
(ii) For EIP's that impose new RACT requirements on previously unregulated sources in a previously regulated source
category (e.g., RACT ``catch-up'' programs), the new incentive-based RACT rule shall, in the aggregate, yield reductions
in actual emissions at least equivalent to that which would result from source-by-source compliance with the existing
RACT limit for that source category. 
(5) A program baseline for individual sources shall, as appropriate, be contained or incorporated by reference in
federally-enforceable operating permits or a federally-enforceable SIP. 
(6) An initial baseline for TCM's shall be calculated by establishing the preexisting conditions in the areas of interest.
This may include establishing to what extent TCM's have already been implemented, what average vehicle occupancy
(AVO) levels have been achieved during peak and off-peak periods, what types of trips occur in the region, and what
mode choices have been made in making these trips. In addition, the extent to which travel options are currently available
within the region of interest shall be determined. These travel options may include, but are not limited to, the degree
of dispersion of transit services, the current ridership rates, and the availability and usage of parking facilities.

(7) Information used in setting a program baseline shall be of sufficient quality to provide for at least as high a degree
of accountability as currently exists for traditional control requirements for the categories of sources affected
by the program. 
(d) 

Replicable emission quantification methods. 

This program element, for programs other than those which are categorized as directionally-sound, shall include
credible, workable, and replicable methods for projecting program results from affected sources and, where necessary,
for quantifying emissions from individual sources subject to the EIP. Such methods, if used to determine credit taken
in attainment, RFP, and maintenance demonstrations, as applicable, shall yield results which can be shown to have
a level of certainty comparable to that for source-specific standards and traditional methods of control strategy
development. Such methods include, as applicable, the following elements: 
(1) Specification of quantification methods. This element shall specify the approach or the combination or range
of approaches that are acceptable for each source category affected by the program. Acceptable approaches may include,
but are not limited to: 
(i) Test methods for the direct measurement of emissions, either continuously or periodically. 
(ii) Calculation equations which are a function of process or control system parameters, ambient conditions, activity
levels, and/or throughput or production rates. 
(iii) Mass balance calculations which are a function of inventory, usage, and/or disposal records. 
(iv) EPA-approved emission factors, where appropriate and adequate. 
(v) Any combination of these approaches. 
(2) Specification of averaging times.

(i) The averaging time for any specified mass emissions caps or emission rate limits shall be consistent with: attaining
and maintaining all applicable NAAQS, meeting RFP requirements, and ensuring equivalency with all applicable RACT
requirements. 
(ii) If the averaging time for any specified VOC or NO

X

 mass emissions caps or emission rate limits for stationary sources (and for other sources, as appropriate) is longer
than 24 hours, the State shall provide, in support of the SIP submittal, a statistical showing that the specified averaging
time is consistent with attaining the O

3

 NAAQS and satisfying RFP requirements, as applicable, on the basis of typical summer day emissions; and, if applicable,
a statistical showing that the longer averaging time will produce emissions reductions that are equivalent on a daily
basis to source-specific RACT requirements. 
(3) Accounting for shutdowns and production curtailments. This accounting shall include provisions which ensure
that: 
(i) Emissions reductions associated with shutdowns and production curtailments are not double-counted in attainment
or RFP demonstrations. 
(ii) Any resultant ``shifting demand'' which increases emissions from other sources is accounted for in such demonstrations.

(4) Accounting for batch, seasonal, and cyclical operations. This accounting shall include provisions which ensure
that the approaches used to account for such variable operations are consistent with attainment and RFP plans. 
(5) Accounting for travel mode choice options, as appropriate, for TCM's. This accounting shall consider the factors
or attributes of the different forms of travel modes (e.g., bus, ridesharing) which determine which type of travel
an individual will choose. Such factors include, but are not limited to, time, cost, reliability, and convenience
of the mode. 
(e) 

Source requirements. 

This program element shall include all source-specific requirements that constitute compliance with the program.
Such requirements shall be appropriate, readily ascertainable, and State and federally enforceable, including,
as applicable: 
(1) Emission limits. 
(i) For programs that impose limits on total mass emissions, emission rates, or other emission-related parameter(s),
there must be an appropriate tracking system so that a facility's limits are readily ascertainable at all times. 
(ii) For emission-limiting EIP's that authorize RACT sources to meet their RACT requirements through RACT/non-RACT
trading, such trading shall result in an exceptional environmental benefit. Demonstration of an exceptional environmental
benefit shall require either the use of the statutory offset ratios for nonattainment areas as the determinant of
the amount of emissions reductions that would be required from non-RACT sources generating credits for RACT sources
or, alternatively, a trading ratio of 1.1 to 1, at a minimum, may be authorized, provided exceptional environmental
benefits are otherwise demonstrated. 
(2) Monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements. 
(i) An EIP (or the SIP as a whole) must contain test methods and, where necessary, emission quantification methodologies,
appropriate to the emission limits established in the SIP. EIP sources must be subject to clearly specified MRR requirements
appropriate to the test methods and any applicable quantification methodologies, and consistent with the EPA's
title V rules, where applicable. Such MRR requirements shall provide sufficiently reliable and timely information
to determine compliance with emission limits and other applicable strategy-specific requirements, and to provide
for State and Federal enforceability of such limits and requirements. Methods for MRR may include, but are not limited
to: 
(A) The continuous monitoring of mass emissions, emission rates, or process or control parameters. 
(B) In situ or portable measurement devices to verify control system operating conditions. 
(C) Periodic measurement of mass emissions or emission rates using reference test methods.

(D) Operation and maintenance procedures and/or other work practices designed to prevent, identify, or remedy noncomplying
conditions.
(E) Manual or automated recordkeeping of material usage, inventories, throughput, production, or levels of required
activities.
(F) Any combination of these methods. EIP's shall require that responsible parties at each facility in the EIP program
certify reported information.
(ii) Procedures for determining required data, including the emissions contribution from affected sources, for
periods for which required data monitoring is not performed, data are otherwise missing, or data have been demonstrated
to have been inaccurately determined.
(3) Any other applicable strategy-specific requirements.
(f) 

Projected results and audit/reconciliation procedures. 

(1) The SIP submittal shall include projections of the emissions reductions associated with the implementation
of the program. These projected results shall be related to and consistent with the assumptions used to develop the
area's attainment demonstration and maintenance plan, as applicable. For programs designed to produce emissions
reductions creditable towards RFP milestones, projected emissions reductions shall be related to the RFP baseline
and consistent with the area's RFP compliance demonstration. The State shall provide sufficient supporting information
that shows how affected sources are or will be addressed in the emissions inventory, RFP plan, and attainment demonstration
or maintenance plan, as applicable.
(i) For emission-limiting programs, the projected results shall be consistent with the reductions in mass emissions
or emissions-related parameters specified in the program design.
(ii) For market-response programs, the projected results shall be based on market analyses relating levels of targeted
emissions and/or emission-related activities to program design parameters.
(iii) For directionally-sound programs, the projected results may be descriptive and shall be consistent with the
area's attainment demonstration or maintenance plan.
(2) Quantitative projected results shall be adjusted through the use of two uncertainty factors, as appropriate,
to reflect uncertainties inherent in both the extent to which sources will comply with program requirements and the
overall program design.
(i) Uncertainty resulting from incomplete compliance shall be addressed through the use of a rule compliance factor.
(ii) Programmatic uncertainty shall be addressed through the use of a program uncertainty factor. Any presumptive
norms set by the EPA shall be used unless an adequate justification for an alternative factor is included in supporting
information to be supplied with the SIP submittal. In the absence of any EPA-specified presumptive norms, the State
shall provide an adequate justification for the selected factors as part of the supporting information to be supplied
with the SIP submittal.
(3) Unless otherwise provided in program-specific guidance issued by the EPA, EIP's for which SIP credit is taken
shall include audit procedures to evaluate program implementation and track program results in terms of both actual
emissions reductions, and, to the extent practicable, cost savings relative to traditional regulatory program
requirements realized during program implementation. Such audits shall be conducted at specified time intervals,
not to exceed three years. The State shall provide timely post-audit reports to the EPA.
(i) For emission-limiting EIP's, the State shall commit to ensure the timely implementation of programmatic revisions
or other measures which the State, in response to the audit, deems necessary for the successful operation of the program
in the context of overall RFP and attainment requirements.
(ii) For market-response EIP's, reconciliation procedures that identify a range of appropriate actions or revisions
to program requirements that will make up for any shortfall between credited results (i.e., projected results, as
adjusted by the two uncertainty factors described above) and actual results obtained during program implementation
shall be submitted together with the program audit provisions. Such measures must be federally enforceable, as appropriate,
and automatically executing to the extent necessary to make up the shortfall within a specified period of time, consistent
with relevant RFP and attainment requirements.

(g) 

Implementation schedule. 

The program shall contain a schedule for the adoption and implementation of all State commitments and source requirements
included in the program design.
(h) 

Administrative procedures. 

The program shall contain a description of State commitments which are integral to the implementation of the program,
and the administrative system to be used to implement the program, addressing the adequacy of the personnel, funding,
and legislative authority.
(1) States shall furnish adequate documentation of existing legal authority and demonstrated administrative capacity
to implement and enforce the provisions of the EIP.
(2) For programs which require private and/or public entities to establish emission-related economic incentives
(e.g., programs requiring employers to exempt carpoolers/multiple occupancy vehicles from paying for parking),
States shall furnish adequate documentation of State authority and administrative capacity to implement and enforce
the underlying program.
(i) 

Enforcement mechanisms. 

The program shall contain a compliance instrument(s) for all program requirements, which is legally binding and
State and federally enforceable. This program element shall also include a State enforcement program which defines
violations, and specifies auditing and inspections plans and provisions for enforcement actions. The program shall
contain effective penalties for noncompliance which preserve the level of deterrence in traditional programs.
For all such programs, the manner of collection of penalties must be specified.
(1) Emission limit violations. (i) Programs imposing limits on mass emissions or emission rates that provide for
extended averaging times and/or compliance on a multisource basis shall include procedures for determining the
number of violations, the number of days of violation, and sources in violation, for statutory maximum penalty purposes,
when the limits are exceeded. The State shall demonstrate that such procedures shall not lessen the incentive for
source compliance as compared to a program applied on a source-by-source, daily basis.
(ii) Programs shall require plans for remedying noncompliance at any facility that exceeds a multisource emissions
limit for a given averaging period. These plans shall be enforceable both federally and by the State.
(2) Violations of MRR requirements. The MRR requirements shall apply on a daily basis, as appropriate, and violations
thereof shall be subject to State enforcement sanctions and to the Federal penalty of up to $25,000 for each day a violation
occurs or continues. In addition, where the requisite scienter conditions are met, violations of such requirements
shall be subject to the Act's criminal penalty sanctions of section 113(c)(2), which provides for fines and imprisonment
of up to 2 years.


 51.494 

Use of program revenues.


Any revenues generated from statutory EIP's shall be used by the State for any of the following:
(a) Providing incentives for achieving emissions reductions.
(b) Providing assistance for the development of innovative technologies for the control of O

3

 air pollution and for the development of lower-polluting solvents and surface coatings. Such assistance shall not

3. Part 51 is amended by adding a new appendix X to read 
as follows: 


Appendix X to Part 51_Examples of Economic Incentive Programs


I. Introduction and Purpose 


This appendix contains examples of EIP's which are covered by the EIP rules. Program descriptions identify key provisions
which distinguish the different model program types. The examples provide additional information and guidance
on various types of regulatory programs collectively referred to as EIP's. The examples include programs involving
stationary, area, and mobile sources. The definition section at 40 CFR 51.491 defines an EIP as a program which may
include State established emission fees or a system of marketable permits, or a system of State fees on sale or manufacture
of products the use of which contributes to O

 formation, or any combination of the foregoing or other similar measures, as well as incentives and requirements
to reduce vehicle emissions and vehicle miles traveled in the area, including any of the transportation control measures
identified in section 108(f). Such programs span a wide spectrum of program designs. 
The EIP's are comprised of several elements that, in combination with each other, must insure that the fundamental
principles of any regulatory program (including accountability, enforceability and noninterference with other
requirements of the Act) are met. There are many possible combinations of program elements that would be acceptable.
Also, it is important to emphasize that the effectiveness of an EIP is dependent upon the particular area in which it
is implemented. No two areas face the same air quality circumstances and, therefore, effective strategies and programs
will differ among areas. 
Because of these considerations, the EPA is not specifying one particular design or type of strategy as acceptable
for any given EIP. Such specific guidance would potentially discourage States (or other entities with delegated
authority to administer parts of an implementation plan) from utilizing other equally viable program designs that
may be more appropriate for their situation. Thus, the examples given in this Appendix are general in nature so as to
avoid limiting innovation on the part of the States in developing programs tailored to individual State needs. 
Another important consideration in designing effective EIP's is the extent to which different strategies, or programs
targeted at different types of sources, can complement one another when implemented together as an EIP ``package.''
The EPA encourages States to consider packaging different measures together when such a strategy is likely to increase
the overall benefits from the program as a whole. Furthermore, some activities, such as information distribution
or public awareness programs, while not EIP's in and of themselves, are often critical to the success of other measures
and, therefore, would be appropriate complementary components of a program package. All SIP emissions reductions
credits should reflect a consideration of the effectiveness of the entire package. 


II. Examples of Stationary and Mobile Source Economic Incentive Strategies 


There is a wide variety of programs that fall under the general heading of EIP's. Further, within each general type
of program are several different basic program designs. This section describes common types of EIP's that have been
implemented, designed, or discussed in the literature for stationary and mobile sources. The program types discussed
below do not include all of the possible types of EIP's. Innovative approaches incorporating new ideas in existing
programs, different combinations of existing program elements, or wholly new incentive systems provide additional
opportunities for States to find ways to meet environmental goals at lower total cost. 


A. Emissions Trading Markets 


One prominent class of EIP's is based upon the creation of a market in which trading of source-specific emissions requirements
may occur. Such programs may include traditional rate-based emissions limits (generally referred to as emissions
averaging) or overall limits on a source's total mass emissions per unit of time (generally referred to as an emissions
cap). The emissions limits, which may be placed on individual emitting units or on facilities as a whole, may decline
over time. The common feature of such programs is that sources have an ongoing incentive to reduce pollution and increased
flexibility in meeting their regulatory requirements. A source may meet its own requirements either by directly
preventing or controlling emissions or by trading or averaging with another source. Trading or averaging may occur
within the same facility, within the same firm, or between different firms. Sources with lower cost abatement alternatives
may provide the necessary emissions reductions to sources facing more expensive alternatives. These programs can
lower the overall cost of meeting a given total level of abatement. All sources eligible to trade in an emissions market
are faced with continuing incentives to find better ways of reducing emissions at the lowest possible cost, even if
they are already meeting their own emissions requirements.

Stationary, area, and mobile sources could be allowed to participate in a common emissions trading market. Programs
involving emissions trading markets are particularly effective at reducing overall costs when individual affected
sources face significantly different emissions control costs. A wider range in control costs among affected sources
creates greater opportunities for cost-reducing trades. Thus, for example, areas which face relatively high stationary
source control costs relative to mobile source control costs benefit most by including both stationary and mobile
sources in a single emissions trading market. 
Programs involving emissions trading markets have generally been designated as either emission allowance or emission
reduction credit (ERC) trading programs. 
The Federal Acid Rain Program is an example of an emission allowance trading program, while ``bubbles'' and ``generic
bubbles'' created under the EPA's 1986 Emission Trading Policy Statement are examples of ERC trading. Allowance
trading programs can establish emission allocations to be effective at the start of a program, at some specific time
in the future, or at varying levels over time. An ERC trading program requires ERC's to be measured against a pre-established
emission baseline. Allowance allocations or emission baselines can be established either directly by the EIP rules
or by reference to traditional regulations (e.g., RACT requirements). In either type of program, sources can either
meet their EIP requirements by maintaining their own emissions within the limits established by the program, or by
buying surplus allowances or ERC's from other sources. 
In any case, the State will need to establish adequate enforceable procedures for certifying and tracking trades,
and for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the EIP. 
The definition of the commodity to be traded and the design of the administrative procedures the buyer and seller must
follow to complete a trade are obvious elements that must be carefully selected to help ensure a successful trading
market that achieves the desired environmental goal at the lowest cost. An emissions market is defined as efficient
if it achieves the environmental goal at the lowest possible total cost. Any feature of a program that unnecessarily
increases the total cost without helping achieve the environmental goals causes market inefficiency. Thus, the
design of an emission trading program should be evaluated not only in terms of the likelihood that the program design
will ensure that the environmental goals of the program will be met, but also in terms of the costs that the design imposes
upon market transactions and the impact of those costs on market efficiency. 
Transaction costs are the investment in time and resources to acquire information about the price and availability
of allowances or ERC's, to negotiate a trade, and to assure the trade is properly recorded and legally enforceable.
All trading markets impose some level of transaction costs. The level of transaction costs in an emissions trading
market are affected by various aspects of the design of the market, such as the nature of the procedures for reviewing,
approving, and recording trades, the timing of such procedures (i.e., before or after the trade is made), uncertainties
in the value of the allowance or credit being traded, the legitimacy of the allowance or credit being offered for sale,
and the long-term integrity of the market itself. Emissions trading programs in which every transaction is different,
such as programs requiring significant consideration of the differences in the chemical properties or geographic
location of the emissions, can result in higher transaction costs than programs with a standardized trading commodity
and well-defined rules for acceptable trades. Transaction costs are also affected by the relative ease with which
information can be obtained about the availability and price of allowances or credits. 
While the market considerations discussed above are clearly important in designing an efficient market to minimize
the transaction costs of such a program, other considerations, such as regulatory certainty, enforcement issues,
and public acceptance, also clearly need to be factored into the design of any emissions trading program.

B. Fee Programs 
 


A fee on each unit of emissions is a strategy that can provide a direct incentive for sources to reduce emissions. Ideally,
fees should be set so as to result in emissions being reduced to the socially optimal level considering the costs of
control and the benefits of the emissions reductions. In order to motivate a change in emissions, the fees must be high
enough that sources will actively seek to reduce emissions. It is important to note that not all emission fee programs
are designed to motivate sources to lower emissions. Fee programs using small fees are designed primarily to generate
revenue, often to cover some of the administrative costs of a regulatory program. 
 
There can be significant variations in emission fee programs. For example, potential emissions could be targeted
by placing a fee on an input (e.g., a fee on the quantity and BTU content of fuel used in an industrial boiler) rather than
on actual emissions. Sources paying a fee on potential emissions could be eligible for a fee waiver or rebate by demonstrating
that potential emissions are not actually emitted, such as through a carbon absorber system on a coating operation.

 
Some fee program variations are designed to mitigate the potentially large amount of revenue that a fee program could
generate. Although more complex than a simple fee program, programs that reduce or eliminate the total revenues may
be more readily adopted in a SIP than a simple emission fee. Some programs lower the amount of total revenues generated
by waiving the fee on some emissions. These programs reduce the total amount of revenue generated, while providing
an incentive to decrease emissions. Alternatively, a program may impose higher per-unit fees on a portion of the emissions
stream, providing a more powerful but targeted incentive at the same revenue levels. For example, fees could be collected
on all emissions in excess of some fixed level. The level could be set as a percentage of a baseline (e.g., fees on emissions
above some percentage of historical emissions), or as the lowest emissions possible (e.g., fees on emissions in excess
of the lowest demonstrated emissions from the source category). 
 
Other fee programs are ``revenue neutral,'' meaning that the pollution control agency does not receive any net revenues.
One way to design a revenue-neutral program is to have both a fee provision and a rebate provision. Rebates must be carefully
designed to avoid lessening the incentive provided by the emission fee. For example, a rebate based on comparing a
source's actual emissions and the average emissions for the source category can be designed to be revenue neutral
and not diminish the incentive. 
 
Other types of fee programs collect a fee in relation to particular activities or types of products to encourage the
use of alternatives. While these fees are not necessarily directly linked to the total amount of emissions from the
activity or product, the relative simplicity of a usage fee may make such programs an effective way to lower emissions.
An area source example is a construction permit fee for wood stoves. Such a permit fee is directly related to the potential
to emit inherent in a wood stove, and not to the actual emissions from each wood stove in use. Fees on raw materials to
a manufacturing process can encourage product reformulation (e.g., fees on solvent sold to makers of architectural
coatings) or changes in work practices (e.g., fees on specialty solvents and degreasing compounds used in manufacturing).

 
Road pricing mechanisms are fee programs that are available to curtail low occupancy vehicle use, fund transportation
system improvements and control measures, spatially and temporally shift driving patterns, and attempt to effect
land usage changes. Primary examples include increased peak period roadway, bridge, or tunnel tolls (this could
also be accomplished with automated vehicle identification systems as well), and toll discounts for pooling arrangements
and zero-emitting/low-emitting vehicles.

C. Tax Code and Zoning Provisions 
 


Modifications to existing State or local tax codes, zoning provisions, and land use planning can provide effective
economic incentives. Possible modifications to encourage emissions reductions cover a broad span of programs,
such as accelerated depreciation of capital equipment used for emissions reductions, corporate income tax deductions
or credits for emission abatement costs, property tax waivers based on decreasing emissions, exempting low-emitting
products from sales tax, and limitations on parking spaces for office facilities. Mobile source strategies include
waiving or lowering any of the following for zero- or low-emitting vehicles: vehicle registration fees, vehicle
property tax, sales tax, taxicab license fees, and parking taxes. 



D. Subsidies 
 


A State may create incentives for reducing emissions by offering direct subsidies, grants or low-interest loans
to encourage the purchase of lower-emitting capital equipment, or a switch to less polluting operating practices.
Examples of such programs include clean vehicle conversions, starting shuttle bus or van pool programs, and mass
transit fare subsidies. Subsidy programs often suffer from a variety of ``free rider'' problems. For instance, subsidies
for people or firms who were going to switch to the cleaner alternative anyway lower the effectiveness of the subsidy
program, or drive up the cost of achieving a targeted level of emissions reductions. 



E. Transportation Control Measures 
 


The following measures are the TCM's listed in section 108(f): 

(i) Programs for improved public transit; 

(ii) Restriction of certain roads or lanes to, or construction of such roads or lanes for use by, passenger buses or
high occupancy vehicles; 

(iii) Employer-based transportation management plans, including incentives; 

(iv) Trip-reduction ordinances; 

(v) Traffic flow improvement programs that achieve emission reductions; 

(vi) Fringe and transportation corridor parking facilities serving multiple-occupancy vehicle programs or transit
service; 

(vii) Programs to limit or restrict vehicle use in downtown areas or other areas of emission concentration particularly
during periods of peak use; 

(viii) Programs for the provision of all forms of high-occupancy, shared-ride services; 

(ix) Programs to limit portions of road surfaces or certain sections of the metropolitan area to the use of non
