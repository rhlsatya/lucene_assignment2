Lime Research, Promotion, and Consumer Information Order; Proposed Amendments 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule gives notice of proposed amendments to the Lime Research, Promotion, and Consumer Information Order. These
amendments would revise the definition of the term ``lime'' in order to cover seedless rather than seeded limes; increase
the exemption level from less than 35,000 pounds annually to less than 200,000; alter the size, composition, and term
of office of the Lime Board; and make necessary conforming changes. This action is necessary to implement amendments
to the Lime Research, Promotion, and Consumer Information Act of 1990.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This proposed rule would amend the Lime Research, Promotion, and Consumer Information Order 
(7 CFR part 1212), herein referred to as the Order. The Order is effective under the Lime Research, Promotion, and Consumer
Information Act of 1990 (1990 Act) (Pub. L. 101-624, 7 U.S.C. 6201-6212), as amended by the Lime Research,
Promotion, and Consumer Information Improvement Act (1993 Act) (Pub. L. 103-194, Dec. 14, 1993). 



This rule has been determined to be non-significant for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not
been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). 

This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
1957 of the Act, a person subject to the Order may file a petition with the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) stating
that the Order or any provision of the Order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the Order, is not in accordance
with law and requesting a modification of the Order or an exemption from the Order. The petitioner is afforded the opportunity
for a hearing on the petition. After such hearing, the Secretary will make a ruling on the petition. The Act provides
that the district courts of the United States in any district in which a person who is a petitioner resides or carries
on business are vested with jurisdiction to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint for that
purpose is filed within 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 



Regulatory Impact Analysis 



Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. 

The 1990 Act exempted lime producers who produce less than 35,000 pounds annually for the fresh market from being subject
to the Order. When the 1990 Act was enacted, there were an estimated 325 producers who produced at least 35,000 pounds
annually and were subject to the Order. When the 1993 Act was enacted, the exemption level was increased to less than
200,000 pounds annually. At this exemption level, there are an estimated 50 producers who produce at least 200,000
pounds and would be subject to the Order. Despite this increase in exemption level, the majority of producers subject
to the Order would still be classified as small entities. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small
Business Administration (SBA) 
(13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. 

The increase in exemption level is not expected to significantly affect the number of first handlers who are responsible
for collecting and remitting producer assessments to the Lime Board (Board). The number of first handlers remains
at approximately 25. The increase in exemption level, which also applies to imports, is not expected to significantly
affect the number of importers of fresh market limes. The number of importers subject to the Order would increase from
5 to 35. However, this increase in importers is not primarily due to the increase in the exemption level but rather to
the changing character of the lime industry. As in the case of producers, the majority of first handlers and importers
subject to the Order would still be classified as small entities. Small agricultural service firms, which include
handlers and importers, have been defined by the SBA as those having annual receipts of less than $3,500,000.

Since the enactment of the 1990 Act, the character of the lime industry has significantly changed. As a result of the
extensive damage to lime orchards in Florida by Hurricane Andrew in August 1992, domestic production has plummeted
and the volume of imports has increased dramatically. Domestic production is not expected to reach pre-Hurricane
Andrew levels for possibly two to three years because Florida accounted for a majority of domestic production. 
Shipment reports of domestic limes, from January 1, 1993, through December 31, 1993, indicate truck shipments of
8.71 million pounds from Florida and 8.24 million pounds from California, for a total of 16.95 million pounds. In contrast,
shipment reports of imported limes for this period indicate truck shipments of 248.22 million pounds from Mexico
plus an additional 8.78 million pounds from 12 other countries. Imports currently represent roughly 93 percent of
lime shipments in the United States. 
The Order currently requires lime producers, producer-handlers, and importers who produce or import 35,000 pounds
or more annually for fresh market to pay an assessment not to exceed one cent per pound of limes. This proposal would
limit assessment obligations to producers, producer-handlers, and importers of 200,000 pounds or more annually.
The expected results of this amendment would significantly decrease the number of persons subject to the Order and
decrease the amount of assessments collected. 
This proposal would also alter the size and composition of the Board, the administrative body appointed by the Secretary
to operate the Order, from 11 members to seven. Further, this proposal would reduce the number of producer members
serving on the Board from seven to three. The number of importer members would remain at three. The seventh member would
be the public member. These changes to the Board's size and membership are reflective of the current structure of the
lime industry. 
Accordingly, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the changes reflected in this action would not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Paperwork Reduction 


In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35) the information collection requirements
contained in the Order have been approved by the OMB and were assigned OMB number 0581-0093, except for the Board
nominee background statement form which was assigned OMB number 
0505-0001. This action would generally reduce the number of information collections, and hence the reporting
burden. The information collection requirements of the Order are as follows: 
(1) 

A periodic report by each first handler who handles limes for fresh market. 

When the amended Order is implemented, the estimated number of respondents required to complete this report would
be 25, each submitting a maximum of 12 responses per year, with an estimated average reporting burden of 30 minutes
per response. The change in exemption level, from less than 35,000 pounds to less than 200,000 pounds, should not affect
the number of first handlers. However, this change could reduce their reporting burden because less information
may be required from persons who previously would not be exempt from the Order. First handlers may alternatively prepay
assessments annually, requiring only an initial report of anticipated assessments and a final annual report of actual
handling; 
(2) 

A periodic report by each importer who imports 200,000 or more pounds annually for fresh market. 

The estimated number of respondents completing this report would be 35, each submitting a maximum of 12 responses
per year, with an estimated average reporting burden of 15 minutes per response. The change in character of the lime
industry due to increased imports since 1992 would raise the number of respondents filing this report from 5 to 35;

(3) 

A refund application form for persons who desire a refund of their assessments. 

The estimated number of respondents completing this application would be five, each submitting two responses per
year, with an estimated average reporting burden of 15 minutes per response. The change in exemption level would reduce
the number of respondents filing this application from 200 to 5; 
(4) 

An importer reimbursement application for persons who import less than 200,000 pounds annually and desire to be reimbursed
for assessments collected by the U.S. Customs Service. 

The estimated number of respondents completing this application would be 20, each submitting one response per year,
with an estimated average reporting burden of 15 minutes per response. Because this is a new form, no comparative data
regarding an increase or decrease in reporting burden is available;

(5) 

An exemption application for persons who produce or import less than 200,000 pounds annually for fresh market to be
exempt from assessments and recordkeeping requirements. 

The estimated number of respondents completing this application would be 600, each submitting one response per year,
with an estimated average burden of 15 minutes per response. The changes in exemption level and character of the lime
industry would reduce the number of respondents filing this application from 680 to 600; 
(6) 

A referendum ballot to be used not later than 30 months after assessments begin under the amended Order and periodically
thereafter to indicate whether producers and importers favor continuance of the Order. 

The estimated number of respondents completing this ballot would be 85, each submitting one response approximately
every five years, or an annual average of 10 respondents, with an estimated average reporting burden of 15 minutes
per response. The change in exemption level would reduce the number of respondents completing this ballot from 325
to 85; 
(7) 

A nominee background statement form for Board member and alternate positions. 

Two nominees would be nominated for each open position on the Board. The estimated number of respondents completing
this form would be 28 during the first year of Order operations, and approximately eight per year thereafter, with
an estimated average reporting burden of 30 minutes per response. The change in the composition of the Board would
reduce the number of respondents completing this form from 44 to 28; and 
(8) 

A requirement to maintain records sufficient to verify reports submitted under the Order. 

The estimated number of persons required to comply with this requirement would be 70, each of whom will have an estimated
annual burden of seven minutes. The change in exemption level would reduce the number of recordkeepers from 350 to
70. 


Background 


The 1990 Act was enacted on November 28, 1990, for the purpose of establishing an orderly procedure for the development
and financing of an effective and coordinated program of research, promotion, and consumer information to strengthen
the domestic and foreign markets for limes. The Order required by the 1990 Act became effective on January 27, 1992
(57 FR 2985), after notice and comment rulemaking. 
In March 1992 the Department of Agriculture (Department) conducted nomination meetings to nominate lime producers
and importers for appointment to the Board. The Board members were appointed by the Secretary in September 1992, and
the Board conducted its first meeting at the Department in Washington, DC in October 1992. During the course of this
meeting, the Board and the Department concluded that a technical amendment was needed to cover seedless rather than
seeded limes. Consequently, full implementation of the Order was delayed until the enactment of such technical amendment.

The 1993 Act contained the necessary technical amendment to cover seedless limes (

citrus latifolia

) rather than seeded limes (

citrus aurantifolia

) under the Order. The 1993 Act also provided for (1) increasing the exemption level from less than 35,000 pounds annually
to less than 200,000; (2) terminating the initial Board; (3) changing the size and composition of the Board; and (4)
delaying the initial referendum date. 
This proposed rule invites comments on amending the Order to reflect the provisions of the 1993 Act. The Act, as amended,
will (1) revise the definition of the term ``lime'' from 

citrus aurantifolia

 to 

citrus latifolia

; (2) increase the exemption level from less than 35,000 pounds annually to less than 200,000; (3) alter the size, composition,
and term of office of the Board; and (4) make conforming changes. 
This rule would change the definition of the ``lime'' from 

citrus aurantifolia 

(seeded lime) to 

citrus latifolia 

(seedless lime) in  1212.5 of the Order. Although the intent of the Act was to cover seedless limes, the definition
of ``lime'' in  1953(6) of the 1990 applied only to seeded limes. 
This rule would increase the producer and importer exemption level from less than 35,000 pounds annually to less than
200,000 pounds annually. This revised exemption level was reached through industry consensus. Therefore, this
rule would change references to 35,000 pounds in   1212.65, 1212.68, and 1212.69 of the Order to 200,000
pounds. In addition, a new paragraph (d) has been added to  1212.68 of the Order whereby exempt importers may
obtain a refund of assessments collected by the U.S. Customs Service. 
Moreover, this rule would change the size of the Board from 11 members to seven. The Board is currently composed of seven
producer members, three importer members, and their alternates. The public member position is currently vacant.
This action would decrease the number of producer members from seven to three, which would more fairly reflect the
current structure of the lime industry. Therefore,   1212.30, 1212.32, and 1212.34 of the Order would
be revised to make these changes in the Board's composition. 
This rule would also change the Board's composition in  1212.30(b) relative to representation of producer
and importer members within the two districts established under the Order. District 1 includes the States east of
the Mississippi River, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. District 2 includes the States west of the Mississippi
River. Currently, the Order provides for six producer members and one importer member and their alternates from District
1, and one producer member and two importer members and their alternates from District 2. This action would reduce
the number of producer members from District 1 from six to two by revising section 1212.30 of the Order.

Further, as a result of this allocation of Board membership, the realignment of districts or reapportionment of membership
between Districts 1 and 2 on the basis of changes in production and importation would no longer be necessary. Such realignment
or reapportionment would be inconsistent with the 1993 Act. Therefore, any references to such realignment or reapportionment
would be removed from   1212.18, 1212.30, and 1212.40 of the Order. 
Reducing the size of the Board affects the current requirements for a quorum and the number of trustees which would
be designated if the program were to be terminated. Therefore, this action would revise  1212.37 of the Order
to decrease from six to four the number of members needed to constitute a quorum at Board meetings and change the number
of trustees designated in  1212.84 of the Order from five to four. 
The 1993 Act requires the appointments of the current Board members to be terminated. New appointments would then
be made by the Secretary. The 1993 Act also specifies that the initial Board members under the amended Order would serve
initial terms of office of 30 months. This change is directly related to the provision of the 1993 Act which delays the
deadline for the initial referendum until 30 months after the date on which the collection of assessments begin under
the amended Order. We are also proposing a conforming change in  1212.67 of the Order pursuant to the 1993 provision.

In order to provide administrative continuity during the 
30 months prior to the initial continuance referendum, the 1993 Act provides that the initial Board members under
the amended Order serve 30-month concurrent terms of office. The 1990 Act provided for the staggering of the terms
of office of the initial Board members. Although staggered terms of office are generally desirable, this created
a situation where 30 percent or more of the Board's membership could change prior to the initial referendum. In contrast,
the 1993 Act provides that the initial Board members under the amended Order serve 30-month concurrent terms of office
and that staggered terms be reinstituted after the referendum if the program continues. The purpose of this change
is to minimize the organizational uncertainties associated with Board member turnover and to facilitate organizational
continuity during the period prior to the initial referendum. Therefore, this action would also amend section 1212.34
of the Order. 
All written comments received in response to this publication by the date specified herein will be considered prior
to any finalization of the proposed amendments.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain de Havilland
Model DHC-8-100 series airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the potentiometer lever
stops on the nose wheel steering. This proposal is prompted by a report that the potentiometer stops installed currently
on these airplanes are too short to limit excessive uncontrolled potentiometer movement in the event of a mechanical
link failure. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent the airplane from departing the runway
during takeoff or landing in the event of the failure of the mechanical link between the rudder pedals and the potentiometer.

Discussion 



Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe
condition may exist on certain de Havilland Model DHC-8-100 series airplanes. Transport Canada Aviation
advises that when a Model DHC-8 series airplane is in the high speed taxi mode during takeoff or landing, nose
gear steering is limited to 7 degrees left or right of center and is controlled through rudder pedal movement. Rotary
movement of the rudder input quadrant is transmitted to a dual potentiometer via a mechanical link and fork lever.
The potentiometer converts this movement into electrical signals, which are sent to an electronic control unit (ECU)
located in the nose of the airplane. Subsequently, the ECU signals the electro-hydraulic actuator on the nose gear,
thereby rotating the nose gear in the required direction. 

If the mechanical link connecting the potentiometer to the rudder input quadrant fails, excessive uncontrolled
potentiometer lever movement is restricted by small metal stops located outside the normal angular travel of the
fork lever. These ``potentiometer stops'' limit the size of the signal sent to the ECU only in the event of a mechanical
link failure. On certain Model DHC-8-100 series airplanes, the currently installed potentiometer stops
are too short to restrict excessive fork lever movement in the event of a mechanical link failure. In this case, a signal
that is too large would be sent to the ECU, which could cause the nose gear to exceed its 7-degree limitation. This condition,
if not corrected, could result in the airplane departing the runway during takeoff or landing.

Bombardier Inc. has issued de Havilland Service Bulletin S.B. 8-32-99, Revision `A,' dated July 26, 1993,
that describes procedures for modification of the potentiometer lever stops on the nose wheel steering (Modification
8/1809) on certain Model DHC-8-100 and -300 series airplanes. Accomplishment of this modification
will restore overtravel protection by relocating the potentiometer lever stops. Relocation of the stops will ensure
that excessive fork lever movement is restricted in the event of a mechanical link failure. Transport Canada Aviation
classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive (AD) No. CF-93-24,
dated September 29, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada. 

Although the effectivity of the service bulletin includes certain Model DHC-8-100 and -300 series
airplanes, Canadian AD No. CF-93-24 is applicable only to certain Model DHC-8-100 series
airplanes. The service bulletin states that the potentiometer stops on certain Model DHC-8-300 series
airplanes are contacted by the lever prematurely, resulting in deformation of the stops. However, the FAA has been
advised that, although deformation of the potentiometer stops on these airplanes can occur, excessive potentiometer
lever movement would still be restricted in the event of failure of a mechanical link. In light of this information,
the FAA finds that Model DHC-8-300 series airplanes are not subject to the addressed unsafe condition.


This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of  21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require modification of the potentiometer lever stops
on the nose wheel steering. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin
described previously. 

The FAA estimates that 48 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. The
cost for required parts would be minimal. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $7,920, or $165 per airplane. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule and form amendments; extension of comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Securities and Exchange Commission is extending from April 6, 1994 to May 6, 1994 the comment period for Release
Nos. 33-7038 and IC-19959, which proposed amendments to rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company
Act of 1940 and related rules and forms regarding money market funds.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On December 17, 1993, the Commission issued Rel. Nos. 33-7038 and IC-19959 (Dec. 17, 1993) [58 FR 68585
(Dec. 28, 1993)] (``Release No. 19959''), which proposed amendments to rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 and related rules and forms. The proposed amendments would tighten the risk-limiting conditions imposed
on tax exempt money market funds by rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940; impose additional disclosure
requirements on tax exempt funds; and make certain other changes to the Commission rules and forms applicable to all
money market funds. The amendments are designed both to reduce the likelihood that a tax exempt fund will not be able
to maintain a stable net asset value and to increase investor awareness of the risks of investment in a money market
fund.




Since Release No. 19959 was published, the Commission has received two requests from interested persons for an extension
of the comment period. In light of the importance of the amendments to money market funds and the short-term tax exempt
securities markets and the benefits to the Commission of receiving carefully considered comments, the Commission
believes a one month extension of the comment period is appropriate.

The comment period for responding to Release No. 19959 is extended to May 6, 1994.






By the Commission.

Dietary Fiber and Cancer and Coronary Heart Disease; Notice of Public Conference


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of public conference.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that it is cosponsoring, with other health research organizations,
a public conference to update and summarize the scientific information available on the association between dietary
fiber and cancer and dietary fiber and coronary heart disease. The conference will also provide an opportunity to
discuss the criteria that should be used in determining whether significant scientific agreement on the validity
of a dietary fiber-cancer or a dietary fiber-coronary heart disease relationship exists. The conference will include
invited summary presentations and panel discussions by expert scientists and public discussions of the scientific
evidence. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (the 1990 amendments) required that FDA consider health claims on
food labels for 10 nutrient-disease relationships and determine, based on the totality of the publicly available
scientific evidence, whether there is significant scientific agreement among qualified experts regarding the
validity of these relationships. In the 

Federal Register

 of January 6, 1993, FDA issued final rules announcing its decision not to authorize the use on the label or labeling
of foods of health claims relating to an association between dietary fiber and cancer (58 FR 2537) or dietary fiber
and coronary heart disease (58 FR 2552). 


The agency concluded that there was not significant scientific agreement among qualified experts that a claim relating
dietary fiber to reduced risk of cancer was adequately supported by the totality of publicly available scientific
evidence. FDA concluded that the role for dietary fiber itself was not supported by the available data, but that consumption
of diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables may be associated with reduced
risk of some cancers (58 FR 2537 at 2548). 
The agency also concluded that there was not significant scientific agreement among qualified experts that a claim
relating dietary fiber to reduced risk of coronary heart disease was adequately supported by the totality of publicly
available scientific evidence. As was the case with respect to dietary fiber and cancer, FDA concluded that the role
of fiber itself was not supported by the available data, but that consumption of diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol
and high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain fiber, particularly soluble fiber, may be associated
with reduced risk of coronary heart disease (58 FR 2552 at 2578).
In the 

Federal Register

 of October 14, 1993 (58 FR 53296), FDA published a proposed rule not to authorize health claims on five nutrient-disease
relationships, including dietary fiber and cancer and dietary fiber and coronary heart disease, for dietary supplements
of vitamins, minerals, herbs, or other similar nutritional substances. In that proposal, FDA reviewed the available
evidence on the relationship of dietary fiber and cancer and on the relationship of dietary fiber and coronary heart
disease. Based on its tentative conclusion that there is not significant scientific agreement among qualified experts
that the totality of publicly available scientific evidence supported these nutrient-disease relationships,
FDA proposed not to authorize claims on these relationships. On January 4, 1994, in a new statutorily-mandated rulemaking,
changes in the agency's regulations (21 CFR 101.71(a) and (b)) reflecting those that FDA had proposed in October 1993,
became final by operation of law (see 59 FR 436, January 4, 1994). However, the rulemakings that FDA instituted in October
1993 continue (59 FR 436).
On May 12 and 13, 1994, FDA will cosponsor a public conference with other units of the Department of Health and Human
Services, including the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American
Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the Institute of Medicine, the American Medical Association, the
Federal Trade Commission, and the Congressional Research Service to review the publicly available evidence on the
relationship of dietary fiber and cancer and the relationship of dietary fiber and coronary heart disease with particular
emphasis on refining the issues relative to dietary fiber definition and levels to disease risk. The purpose of this
public conference is to update and summarize the scientific information available on these associations and to discuss
criteria that should be used to determine whether a significant scientific agreement on the validity of these nutrient-disease
relationships exists. FDA is taking this action because it is aware, based on its review of the evidence on these nutrients-disease
relationships, that at least some promising evidence exists. The agency believes that the conference will help elucidate
whether recent developments have provided the basis for significant scientific agreement. The agency notes that
the review of the issues regarding dietary fiber/disease claims on dietary supplements is ongoing. FDA solicits
the input of all segments of the food industry and of other interested persons on these issues, however, because the
agency intends, if the evidence justifies, to authorize any claims that are warranted for foods in conventional food
form as well as for dietary supplements.
FDA has invited experts in medicine, nutrition, epidemiology, pathology, and other disciplines related to dietary
fiber and cancer and dietary fiber and coronary heart disease to serve as speakers and panelists. They will summarize
and update the publicly available evidence, react to any evidence that is presented, and provide additional comment
based on their individual expertise. Others may submit data from new research and will be given the opportunity to
participate during the open discussions. Cancer and coronary heart disease will be the focus of the conference because
they are the diseases that were highlighted by the 1990 amendments. 
The conference will be divided into four major parts as follows: (1) Opening and overview of dietary fiber; (2) dietary
fiber and coronary heart disease; (3) dietary fiber and cancer; and (4) the criteria for determining whether significant
scientific agreement on dietary fiber and cancer or dietary fiber and coronary heart disease exits.
Interested persons may, on or before May 9, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this notice. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading
of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Proposal To Establish Procedures for the Safe Processing and Importing of Fish and Fishery Products; Extension of
Comment Period


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; extension of comment period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is extending to May 31, 1994, the comment period for a proposed rule that appeared
in the 

Federal Register

 of January 28, 1994 (59 FR 4142). The document proposed to adopt regulations to ensure the safe processing and importing
of fish and fishery products, including procedures for the monitoring of selected processes in accordance with Hazard
Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles. HACCP is a preventive system of hazard control that can be used
by food processors and importers. FDA is taking this action in response to several requests for an extension of the
comment period.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of January 28, 1994 (59 FR 4142), FDA issued a proposed rule to adopt regulations to ensure the safe processing and importing
of fish and fishery products, including procedures for the monitoring of selected processes in accordance with HACCP
principles. Interested persons were given until April 28, 1994, to comment on the proposal. However, because of an
inadvertent error, the date for submission of comments was incorrectly given as March 29, 1994. In the 

Federal Register

 of March 3, 1994 (59 FR 10085), FDA published a proposed rule to correct the comment period to April 28, 1994.



FDA has received several requests from trade associations, State agencies, and university officials for an extension
of the comment period in order to better review the proposal and prepare comments. Most requests ask for a 90-day extension,
although one request is for an unspecified length and another is for about 120 days. FDA also received a request from
a public advocacy organization that the comment period either not be extended at all or that it be extended no more than
30 days.

After careful review of these requests, FDA has concluded that it is in the public interest to allow an additional 30
days for comment. With the additional period, the agency is providing a total of 120 days for comment. FDA considers
that this amount of time should be more than ample for interested persons to complete and submit their comments. Accordingly,
the agency is extending the comment period to May 31, 1994. Elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, FDA is publishing a notice extending the comment period of the ``Fish and Fish Products Hazards and Controls Guide''
until May 31, 1994. That guide has been developed to serve, among other things, as an adjunct to the proposed regulations.

Interested persons may, on or before May 31, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this proposal. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; public comment period and opportunity for public hearing on proposed amendment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSM is announcing receipt of a proposed amendment to the Colorado permanent regulatory program (hereinafter, the
``Colorado program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed amendment
consists of changes to a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Division of Minerals and Geology (DMG) of the
Colorado Department of Natural Resources and the Water Quality Control Division (WQCD) of the Colorado Department
of Health that addresses water quality management at coal mines. The revised MOU provides for the collection of water
quality samples by DMG for analysis when DMG suspects an unpermitted discharge, clarifies that WQCD is solely responsible
for enforcement of the Colorado Discharge Permit System (CDPS) program, and provides for the issuance of a cessation
order by DMG in those instances of imminent danger to health or safety or significant environmental harm. The amendment
is intended to revise the Colorado program to be consistent with the Federal regulations and SMCRA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

II. Proposed Amendment

III. Public Comment Procedures

IV. Procedural Determinations



I. Background on the Colorado Program





On December 15, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Colorado program. General background
information on the Colorado program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and an explanation
of the conditions of approval of the Colorado program can be found in the December 15, 1980, 

Federal Register

 (45 FR 82173). Actions taken subsequent to approval of the Colorado program are codified at 30 CFR 906.15, 906.16,
and 906.30.

By letter dated March 18, 1994, Colorado submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative
record No. CO-604). Colorado submitted the proposed amendment in response to a letter dated April 7, 1993 (administrative
record No. CO-539), that OSM sent to Colorado in accordance with 30 CFR 732.17(c). The concerns raised by OSM
in its 30 CFR part 732 letter pertained to a January 1985 MOU between the Colorado Department of Natural Resources (DNR)
and the Colorado Department of Health (DOH) which Colorado intended to supersede a December 15, 1980, MOU between
the two agencies. Whereas, OSM had approved the 1980 MOU, Colorado had not submitted the 1985 MOU to OSM, and OSM had
not approved it in accordance with 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17. The 1980 MOU provided that both DOH and DNR would inspect
coal mines for compliance with effluent limitations and specified that should either agency determine that a water
quality violation existed, either agency could take the appropriate enforcement action in accordance with its own
regulations. The 1985 MOU stated that, ``as a matter of general practice, DNR will be responsible for enforcing water
quality protection pertaining to the requirements for design and maintenance of structures and the requirements
to minimize disturbance to the hydrologic balance from sources other than the point of discharge,'' while DOH ``will
be responsible for enforcing water quality control standards at the point of discharge.''

In its 30 CFR part 732 letter, OSM notified Colorado that the revised MOU was inconsistent with both SMCRA and the approved
Colorado program because under the division of responsibilities in the revised MOU, only DOH has the authority to
enforce effluent limitations, and that if and when DOH decides to exercise that authority, enforcement action is
taken only under the provisions of the Colorado Discharge Elimination System (CDES). The CDES is the State's water
pollution control program approved pursuant to the Federal Clean Water Act and is not the coal mining regulatory program
approved pursuant to SMCRA. Since the enforcement provisions of the CDES program do not require the citation of all
violations and do not include sanctions and procedures similar to those set forth in SMCRA, the Colorado program is
not in compliance with section 512(d) of SMCRA, which requires that a State program incorporate sanctions no less
stringent than SMCRA and contain the same or similar procedural requirements.

Colorado proposes to add new language to the section titled ``Inspections, Monitoring and Sample Analysis'' to provide
that in those instances where DMG suspects an unpermitted discharge, DMG shall collect a water quality sample for
analysis. Colorado proposes to add new language in the section titled ``Enforcement'' to provide that: (1) WQCD shall
be solely responsible for enforcement of the CDPS permit program against point source discharges of pollutants into
the State's surface waters that are conducted without an effective CDPS permit and for the enforcement of CDPS permit
conditions and (2) DMG will issue a cessation order if during a coal mine inspection, DMG determines that there is imminent
danger to the health or safety of the public or significant environmental harm to land, air or water resources.



III. Public Comment Procedures



In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies
the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part
of the Colorado program.



1. Written Comments



Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under 

DATES

 or at locations other than the Albuquerque Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking
or included in the administrative record.

2. Public Hearing


Persons wishing to testify at the public hearing should contact the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

 by 4 p.m., m.d.t. on April 22, 1994. The location and time of the hearing will be arranged with those persons requesting
the hearing. If no one requests an opportunity to testify at the public hearing, the hearing will not be held.
Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission
of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate
questions.
The public hearing will continue on the specified date until all persons scheduled to testify have been heard. Persons
in the audience who have not been scheduled to testify, and who wish to do so, will be heard following those who have been
scheduled. The hearing will end after all persons scheduled to testify and persons present in the audience who wish
to testify have been heard.


3. Public Meeting


If only one person requests an opportunity to testify at a hearing, a public meeting, rather than a public hearing,
may be held. Persons wishing to meet with OSM representatives to discuss the proposed amendment may request a meeting
by contacting the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.

 All such meetings will be open to the public and, if possible, notices of meetings will be posted at the locations listed
under 

ADDRESSES.

 A written summary of each meeting will be made a part of the administrative record.


IV. Procedural Determinations


1. Executive Order 12866


This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).


2. Executive Order 12778


The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.


3. National Environmental Policy Act


No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).


4. Paperwork Reduction Act


This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq

.).


5. Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans: California State Implementation Plan Revision, South Coast
Air Quality Management District, Ventura County Air Pollution Control District


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) which concern the control
of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from barbecue charcoal ignition, municipal sewage plants, and municipal
landfills.


The intended effect of proposing approval of these revisions is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the
requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). EPA's final action on this notice of proposed
rulemaking (NPR) will incorporate these revisions into the federally approved SIP. EPA has evaluated each of these
revisions and is proposing to approve them under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs
for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


Applicability


The rules being proposed for approval into the California SIP include: South Coast Air Quality Management District
(SCAQMD) Rule 1174, ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from the Ignition of Barbecue Charcoal;''
SCAQMD Rule 1179, ``Publicly Owned Treatment Works Operations;'' and Ventura County Air Pollution Control District
(VCAPCD) Rule 74.17, ``Waste Disposal Sites.'' These rules were submitted by the California Air Resources Board
(CARB) to EPA on May 13, 1991, September 14, 1992, and January 28, 1992 respectively. 


Background


On March 3, 1978, EPA promulgated a list of ozone nonattainment areas under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended
in 1977 (1977 CAA or pre-amended Act), that included the Los Angeles Area and the Ventura County Area. 43 FR 8964; 40
CFR 81.305. Because these areas were unable to meet the statutory attainment date of December 31, 1982, California
requested under section 172(a)(2), and EPA approved, an extension of the attainment date to December 31, 1987. 40
CFR 52.222. On May 26, 1988, EPA notified the Governor of California, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the pre-amended
Act, that the above districts' portions of the California SIP were inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard
and requested that deficiencies in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). On November 15, 1990, the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q.
In amended section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that nonattainment areas
fix their deficient reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone and established a deadline of
May 15, 1991 for states to submit corrections of those deficiencies. 
Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of the amendments and classified
as marginal or above as of the date of enactment. It requires such areas to adopt and correct RACT rules pursuant to pre-amended
section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amendment guidance.

1

 EPA's SIP-Call used that guidance to indicate the necessary corrections for specific nonattainment areas. The Los
Angeles Area is classified as extreme, and the Ventura County Area is classified as severe;

2

 therefore, these areas were subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline. 






The State of California submitted many revised RACT rules for incorporation into its SIP on May 13, 1991, September
14, 1992, and January 28, 1992, including the rules being acted on in this document. This document addresses EPA's
proposed action for SCAQMD Rule 1174, ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from the Ignition of Barbecue
Charcoal;'' SCAQMD Rule 1179 ``Publicly Owned Treatment Works Operations;'' and VCAPCD Rule 74.17 ``Waste Disposal
Sites.'' These submitted rules were found to be complete on July 10, 1991, April 3, 1992, and November 20, 1992 pursuant
to EPA's completeness criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V

3

 and are being proposed for approval into the SIP. 





SCAQMD Rule 1174, ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from the Ignition of Barbecue Charcoal,'' is
intended to reduce the emission of VOCs from the ignition of charcoal in residential barbecue grills. SCAQMD Rule
1179, ``Publicly Owned Treatment Works Operations,'' is designed to inventory the sources of VOCs and odoriferous
compounds from municipal wastewater treatment facilities. VCAPCD Rule 74.17, ``Waste Disposal Sites,'' is designed
to control emissions of non-methane organic compounds, including VOCs, from solid waste landfills through the use
of flares and other control technology. VOCs contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. These rules
were adopted as part of each district's efforts to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone
and in response to EPA's SIP-Call and the section 182(a)(2)(A) CAA requirement. The following is EPA's evaluation
and proposed action for these rules.


EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action


In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of
the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation,
Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the
basis for today's action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 1. Among those provisions
is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources
of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act.
For the purpose of assisting state and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared a series of Control Technique
Guideline (CTG) documents which specify the minimum requirements that a rule must contain in order to be approved
into the SIP. The CTG's are based on the underlying requirements of the Act and specify the presumptive norms for what
is RACT for specific source categories. Under the CAA, Congress ratified EPA's use of these documents, as well as other
Agency policy, for requiring States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182 (a) (2) (A).
SCAQMD Rules 1174 and 1179, and VCAPCD Rule 74.17 control emissions from source categories for which EPA has not issued
a CTG. Accordingly these rules were evaluated against the general RACT requirements of the Clean Air Act (section
110 and part D), 40 CFR part 51, EPA's ``Blue Book'' referred to in footnote 1, and against other EPA policy including
the EPA Region 9_CARB document entitled ``Guidance Document for Correcting VOC Rule Deficiencies'' (published
April, 1991). In general, these guidance documents have been set forth to ensure that VOC rules are fully enforceable
and strengthen or maintain the SIP.
SCAQMD Rule 1174, ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from the Ignition of Barbecue Charcoal,'' is
a new rule which was adopted to reduce the emission of VOCs from the use of flammable materials to ignite barbecue charcoal.
SCAQMD Rule 1179, ``Publicly Owned Treatment Works Operations,'' is a new rule which was adopted to inventory VOC
and odoriferous compound emissions from municipal wastewater treatment facilities. VCAPCD Rule 74.17, ``Solid
Waste Disposal Sites,'' is a new rule which was adopted to control emissions of VOCs from solid waste landfills.
EPA has evaluated the submitted rules and has determined that they are consistent with the CAA, EPA regulations, and
EPA policy. Therefore, SCAQMD Rule 1174, ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from the Ignition of Barbecue
Charcoal'', Rule 1179 ``Publicly Owned Treatment Works Operations'', and Ventura County Air Pollution Control
District Rule 74.17 ``Solid Waste Disposal Sites'' are being proposed for approval under section 110(k)(3) of the
CAA as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and part D. 
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.


Regulatory Process 


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose
any new requirements, it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature
of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute
Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning
SIPs on such grounds.

U.S. E.P.A.

, 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).
This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 222) from
the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver
for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request.
This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September
30, 1993.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plan: Louisiana Emission Statement 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action proposes to approve a revision to the Louisiana State Implementation Plan (SIP) to include revisions
to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) Regulation Title 33, Part III, Chapter 9, General Regulations
on Control of Emissions and Emission Standards, Section 919, Emission Inventory. These revisions are for the purpose
of implementing an emission statement program for stationary sources within the ozone nonattainment areas. The
implementation plan was submitted by the State to satisfy the Federal requirements for an emission statement program
as part of the SIP for Louisiana.


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The air quality planning and SIP requirements for ozone nonattainment and transport areas are set out in subparts
I and II of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act (CAA or ``the Act''), as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA)
of 1990. The EPA has published a ``General Preamble'' describing the EPA's preliminary views on how the EPA intends
to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under Title I of the CAA, including those State submittals for ozone transport
areas within the States (see 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) (``SIP: General Preamble for the Implementation of title
I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990''), 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992) (``Appendices to the General Preamble''),
and 57 FR 55620 (November 25, 1992) (``SIP: NO

X

 Supplement to the General Preamble'')). 



The EPA has also issued a draft guidance document describing the requirements for the emission statement programs
discussed in this notice, entitled ``Guidance on the Implementation of an Emission Statement Program'' (July 1992).
The Agency is also conducting a rulemaking process to modify 40 CFR part 40 to reflect the requirements of the emission
statement program. 

Section 182 of the Act sets out a graduated control program for ozone nonattainment areas. Section 182(a) sets out
requirements applicable in marginal nonattainment areas, which are also made applicable in subsections (b), (c),
(d), and (e) to all other ozone nonattainment areas. Among the requirements in section 182(a) is a program in paragraph
(3) of that subsection for stationary sources to prepare and submit to the State each year emission statements showing
actual emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NO

X

). This paragraph provides that the States are to submit a revision to their SIPs by November 15, 1992, establishing
this emission statement program. Whatever minimum reporting level is established in a State emission statement
program, if either VOC or NO

X

 is emitted at or above the designated level, the other pollutant should be included in the emission statement, even
if it is emitted at levels below the specified cutoffs.

The CAA requires facilities to submit the first emission statement to the State within three years after November
15, 1990, and annually thereafter. The EPA requests that the States submit the emission data to the EPA through the
Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS). The minimum emission statement data should include: certification
of data accuracy, source identification information, operating schedule, emissions information (to include annual
and typical ozone season day emissions), control equipment information, and process data. The EPA developed emission
statements data elements to be consistent with other source and State reporting requirements. This consistency
is essential to assist States with quality assurance for emission estimates and to facilitate consolidation of all
EPA reporting requirements. 

In addition to the submission of the emission statement data to AIRS, States should provide the EPA with a status report
that outlines the degree of compliance with the emissions statement program. Beginning July 1, 1993, States should
report quarterly to the EPA the total number of sources affected by the emission statement provisions, the number
that have complied with the provisions, and the number that have not. This status report should also include the total
annual and typical ozone season day emissions from all reporting sources, both corrected and 
noncorrected for rule-effectiveness. States should include in their status report a list of sources that are delinquent
in submitting their emission statement and that emit 500 tons per year (TPY) or more of VOC or 2500 TPY or more of NO

X

. This report should be a quarterly submittal until all the regulated sources have complied for the reporting year.
Suggested submittal dates for the quarterly status reports are July 1, October 1, January 1, and April 1. 


Analysis of State Submission 



1. Procedural Background 



The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing its SIP, of which the emission statement
program will become a part. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by a State
must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing.

1

 Section 110(l) similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under the CAAA
must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing. 





The EPA must at the outset determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and
action (see section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). The EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40
CFR part 51, Appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The EPA attempts to make completeness determinations
within 60 days of receiving a submission. However, under section 110(k)(1)(B), a submittal is deemed complete by
operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by the EPA six months after receipt of the submission.


The State passed an emergency regulation after following all applicable State Administrative Procedures Act requirements
for submittal to the EPA by November 15, 1992, to satisfy CAA requirements. The State subsequently entered into State
rulemaking for a permanent regulation. It was submitted to public hearing on December 30, 1992. The State addressed
public comments and made minor adjustments. Following the public hearing, the final rule was adopted by the State
and submitted to the EPA as a proposed revision to the SIP on March 3, 1993. The permanent emission statement regulations
were then codified at LAC 33:III.919. 

The March 3, 1993, SIP revision was reviewed by the EPA to determine completeness in accordance with the completeness
criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The submittal was found
to be complete, and a letter dated August 3, 1993, was forwarded to the Governor indicating the completeness of the
submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review process. The provisions of the regulation are outlined under
the analysis of the State's submission below.

2. Components of Emission Statement Program 


There are several key general and specific components of an acceptable emission statement program. Specifically,
the State must submit a revision to its SIP, and the emission statement program must meet the minimum requirements
for reporting by the sources and the State. In general, the program must include, at a minimum, provisions for applicability,
definitions, compliance, and specific source requirements detailed below. 



A. SIP Revision Submission. Required within two years 
of enactment of the CAAA of 1990 (November 15, 1990). 
B. Program Elements. The State emission statement program must, at a minimum, include provisions covering applicability
of the regulations, definitions for key terms used in the regulations, a compliance schedule for sources covered
by the regulations, and the specific reporting requirements for sources. The emission statement submitted by the
source should contain, at a minimum, a certification that the information is accurate to the best knowledge of the
individual certifying the statement, source identification information, operating information, process rate
data, control equipment information, and emissions information. These elements are described in greater detail
in section D of this document. The EPA recommends that the State program require the submission of the data from the
sources no later than April 15 of each year to insure that the State can meet the July 1 deadline for the submission of
data into AIRS each year. The guidance document prepared by the EPA provides a draft model State rule which can be used
as the basis for the States to develop their program. The guidance document also provides suggested language for the
specific program elements. 


C. Sources Covered. Section 182(a)(3)(B) requires that States with areas designated as nonattainment for ozone
require emission statement data from sources of VOC or NO

X

 in the nonattainment areas. This requirement applies to all ozone nonattainment areas, regardless of the classification
(marginal, moderate, etc.).


 

The States may waive, with EPA approval, the requirement for emission statements for classes or categories of sources
with less than 25 tons per year of actual plant-wide NO

X

 or VOC emissions in nonattainment areas if the class or category is included in the base year and periodic inventories
and emissions are calculated using emission factors established by the EPA (such as those found in EPA publication
AP-42) or other methods acceptable to the EPA. States should get clearance from the appropriate EPA Regional
Office to waive the emission statement requirement for these smaller sources. 



D. Reporting Requirements for Sources. The State requires facilities to report on a form supplied by the State. Sources
covered by the State emission statement program should submit, at a minimum, the following data elements:

 


1. Source identification information 
2. Operating information 
3. Process rate data 
4. Control equipment information 
5. Emissions information 


3. Review of the State's Emission Statement Regulations


Applicability 


The applicability of the regulation to ozone nonattainment areas is documented in subsection A.1. The rule applies
to the owner or operator of facilities in the State in an ozone nonattainment area emitting a minimum of 10 TPY of VOC,
25 TPY of NO

X

, or 100 TPY of carbon monoxide (CO), or any facility that has the potential to emit (``allowables'' in a facility's
permit) 50 TPY or more of VOC in an area designated as an ozone adjoining area. If either VOC or NO

X

 is emitted at or above the minimum required reporting level, the other pollutant must be included even if it is emitted
at levels below the specified cutoff. 


Types of Inventories 


The Annual Emission Statement (AES) requirement for ozone nonattainment areas is documented in subsection B.1.
This subsection requires stationary sources identified in 
subsection A. to submit an AES for all criteria pollutant including VOC. The AES shall consist of an inventory of actual
emissions of VOC, NO

X

, and CO, and the certifying statement.

<TEXT>
 

Ozone Nonattainment Area Statement 


The requirement for ozone nonattainment area's statements is documented in subsection B.3. This subsection requires
stationary sources in ozone nonattainment areas emitting a minimum of 10 TPY of VOC, 25 TPY of NO

X

, or 100 TPY of CO to submit an annual statement. The statement shall consist of actual annual emissions and typical
weekday emissions that occur during the three-month period of greatest or most frequent ozone exceedences as published
by the Department in the Enforcement and Regulatory Compliance notice that is mailed out monthly from the Division
of Legal Affairs and Enforcement. ``Typical weekday'' emissions are defined as an ``average'' of two actual daily
emissions rates (one at the lowest emission rate and one at the highest emission rate) during a seven-day period. 


Minimum Data Requirements 


The minimum data requirements are documented in 
subsection B.5. The data requirements include a certifying statement, facility identification information, operating
information, process rate data, control equipment information, and emissions information. 
A statement is required from the owner or operator to accompany the emission statement certifying that the information
is true and accurate to the best knowledge of the certifying official. The certification will include the name, title,
signature, date of signature, and telephone number of the certifying official (subsection B.5.a.). 
Source data elements required by the Louisiana regulation are: 



1. Facility identification information (subsection B.5.b.) 


a. Full name, physical location, and mailing address of facility. 
b. Universal Transverse Mercator horizontal and vertical coordinates. 
c. Standard Industrial Classification code(s). 


2. Operating information (subsection B.5.c.) 


a. Percentage annual throughput by season. 
b. Days per week during the normal operating schedule. 
c. Hours per day during the normal operating schedule. 
d. Hours per year during the normal operating schedule. 


3. Process rate data (subsection B.5.d.) 


a. Annual process rate (annual throughput). 
b. Peak ozone season daily process rate (in nonattainment areas. 


4. Control equipment information (subsection B.5.e.) 


a. Current primary and secondary AIRS Facility Subsystem (AFS) control equipment identification codes. 
b. Current control equipment efficiency (percent). 


5. Emissions information (subsection B.5.f.) 






a. Estimated actual VOC and/or NO

X 

emissions at the segment level, in TPY for an annual emission rate and pounds per day for a typical ozone season day (defined
as the average or typical operating day during the peak ozone season). Actual emission estimates must include upsets,
downtime, and fugitive emissions, and must follow an ``emission estimation method''. Emissions will be reported
as one number. 
b. AFS estimated emissions method code. 
c. Emission factor (if emissions were calculated using an emissions factor). 


Calculations 


Calculations of emissions are documented in subsection C. The subsection specifies actual measurement with continuous
monitoring systems (CEMS) is the desired method of calculating emissions from a point source. In lieu of CEMS data,
emissions may be calculated using methods found in the most recent edition of the Compilation of Air Pollution Emission
Factors (AP-42), or calculations published in Engineering Journals with prior administrative approval from
the Assistant Secretary. 


Reporting Requirements 


The reporting requirements are documented in subsection E. The reporting deadline for the 1992 ozone nonattainment
area is March 31, 1993, unless otherwise directed by the Secretary of the LDEQ. Subsequent emission statements are
due on March 31 of each year, unless otherwise directed by the Secretary of the LDEQ, and will contain data for the previous
year. 


Enforcement 


The enforcement requirements are documented in subsection F. The State of Louisiana has included language in its
regulation that permits the State to enforce the provisions of the regulation under all pertinent State enforcement
authorities. 
All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the State and EPA. The EPA criteria addressing the
enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated in a September 23, 1987, memorandum (with attachments) from
J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et al. (see 57 FR 13541). SIP provisions must also
contain a program that provides for enforcement of the control measures and other elements in the SIP (see section
110(a)(2)(C)). 


Technical Correction 


In reviewing the State's submitted permanent regulation, a technical error was discovered in subsection B.2.a.
This subsection contains a reference to subsection B.2.d., when it should refer to subsection B.2.c. This appears
to be a typographical error and is not substantive since it is unlikely that it would lead to a misinterpretation of
the regulation. This error has been discussed with the State, and the State has agreed to amend the regulation to correct
the error through the State's rulemaking process. Final EPA rulemaking will not occur until the State has made the
correction and submitted documentation of evidence that the error has been corrected. The EPA expects the correction
will be made by June 30, 1994.

In today's action, the EPA is proposing final approval of the Louisiana emission statement program SIP submittal
and invites public comment on the action. 

The analysis of the Louisiana regulation shows that it adequately addresses all components of an emission statement
program. 

In addition, the State has agreed to provide the EPA with emission statement data for the EPA AIRS through the State's
grants commitments and to provide quarterly status reports. 

The EPA has reviewed this request for revision of the Federally-approved SIP for conformance with the provisions
of the 1990 CAAA of November 15, 1990. The EPA has determined that this action conforms with those requirements. 

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economical, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 



Regulatory Process 



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq., 

the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities 
(5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 

The SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, 
part D, of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing.
Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have
a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship
under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic
reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids the EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (

Executive Order 12866 



This action has been classified as a Table Two action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published
in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from 
Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general
public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table Two and Table Three

Fellowship Program Requirements

AGENCY: 

James Madison Memorial Fellowship Foundation.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The following are proposed revised regulations governing the annual competition for James Madison Fellowships
and the obligations of James Madison Fellows. They propose alterations and additions to the existing regulations
implementing the James Madison Memorial Fellowship Act of 1986. These regulations govern the qualifications and
applications of candidates for fellowships; the selection of Fellows by the Foundation; the graduate programs Fellows
must pursue; the conditions attached to awards; the Foundation's annual Summer Institute on the Constitution; and
related requirements and expectations regarding fellowships.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This proposed revised rule indicates changes in various activities of the James Madison Memorial Fellowship Foundation
warranted by experience gained during the Foundation's first two annual fellowship competitions. While representing
no alteration in the Foundation's mission, nor any major changes in the original rule governing the Foundation's
operations, the proposed revisions embody some changes in eligibility requirements and application procedures
whose intended consequences are to enlarge the pool of potential fellowship applicants, reduce complications attendant
upon applying for fellowships, and make clearer certain matters under the previous rule. The principal ones of these
revisions are: (1) The elimination of procedures for the nomination of candidates for fellowships; (2) the enlargement
of the pool of eligible applicants to include experienced teachers in grades 7 and 8 as well as in grades 9-12;
(3) a reduction in the teaching experience required of applicants for senior fellowships; (4) the elimination of
the limit on the number of years following receipt of the baccalaureate degree in which candidates for junior fellowships
may apply; and (5) a change in the closing date for applications to March 1 annually. In addition, this proposed revised
rule sets forth for the first time information regarding the Foundation's annual Summer Institute on the Constitution.



The James Madison Memorial Fellowship Act authorizes fellowship support for graduate study by teachers of American
history and social studies and by college seniors or college graduates who wish to become teachers of the same subjects.
However, in order not to exclude from consideration for James Madison Fellowships those teachers or would-be teachers
whose current or future secondary school instruction, while concerning the usual subjects covered by courses in
American history and social studies, may be carried on in courses entitled ``government'' or similar names, this
rule, like the former rule, goes beyond the Act to apply to those teachers and would-be teachers who do or will offer
secondary school instruction in American government.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., does not apply to this rule because it will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses. Consequently, an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
need not be performed. Section 610 of the Act provides for periodic review of rules which have or will have a significant
economic impact upon a substantial number of small businesses. In accordance with this provision, comments from
small entities concerning these rules will be considered. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite 5 U.S.C.
601 et seq. in correspondence.

Sections 2400.11, 2400.21, 2400.53-54, and 2400.61-63 contain information collection requirements.
As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the James Madison Memorial Fellowship Foundation has submitted
a copy of forms required under these sections to the Office of Management and Budget for its review (40 U.S.C. 3540(h)).
Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on these information collection requirements should
direct them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington,
DC 20503; 

Attention:

 Daniel J. Chenok. The annual public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 5
hours per response for an anticipated 750 applicants.

Subpart A_General





 2400.1

Purposes.






(a) The purposes of the James Madison Memorial Fellowship Program are to: (1) Provide incentives for master's degree
level graduate study of the history, principles, and development of the United States Constitution by outstanding
in-service teachers of American history, American government, and social studies in grades 7-12 and by outstanding
college graduates who plan to become teachers of the same subjects; and thereby to (2) Strengthen teaching in the nation's
secondary schools about the principles, framing, ratification, and subsequent history of the United States Constitution.



(b) The Foundation may from time to time operate its own programs and undertake other closely related activities to
fulfill these goals.






 2400.2

Annual competition.




To achieve its principal purposes, the Foundation holds an annual competition to select teachers in grades 7-12,
college seniors, and college graduates to be James Madison Fellows.




 2400.3

Eligibility.




Individuals eligible to apply for and hold James Madison Fellowships are United States citizens, United States nationals,
or permanent residents of the Northern Mariana Islands who are: (a) Teachers of American history, American government,
or social studies in grades 7-12 who: (1) Are teaching full time during the year in which they apply for a fellowship;


(2) Are under contract, or can provide evidence of being under prospective contract, to teach full time as teachers
of American history, American government, or social studies in grades 7-12;


(3) Have demonstrated records of willingness to devote themselves to civic responsibilities and to professional
and collegial activities within their schools and school districts;





(4) Are highly recommended by their department heads, school heads, school district superintendents, or other supervisors;



(5) Qualify for admission with graduate standing at accredited universities of their choice that offer master's
degree programs allowing at least 12 hours or their equivalent of study of the origins, principles, and development
of the Constitution of the United States and of its comparison with the constitutions of other forms of government;




(6) Are able to complete their proposed courses of graduate study within five calendar years from the commencement
of study under their fellowships, normally through part-time study during summers or in evening or weekend programs;



(7) Agree to attend the Foundation's four-week Summer Institute on the Constitution, normally during the summer
following the commencement of study under their fellowships; and




(8) Sign agreements that, after completing the education for which the fellowship is awarded, they will teach American
history, American government, or social studies full time in secondary schools for a period of not less than one year
for each full academic year of study for which assistance was received, preferably in the state listed as their legal
residence at the time of their fellowship award. For the purposes of this provision, a full academic year of study is
the number of credit hours determined by each university at which Fellows are studying as constituting a full year
of study at that university. Fellows' teaching obligations will be figured at full academic years of study; and when
Fellows have studies for partial academic years, those years will be rounded upward to the nearest one-half year to
determine Fellows' total teaching obligations.

for each full academic year of study for which assistance was received, preferably in the state listed as their legal
residence at the time of their fellowship award. For the purposes of this provision, a fully academic year of study
is the number of credit hours determined by each university at which Fellows are studying as constituting a full year
of study at that university. Fellows' teaching obligations will be figured at full academic years of study; and when
Fellows have studies for partial academic years, those years will be rounded upward to the nearest one-half year to
determine Fellows' total teaching obligations.

 2400.41 

Degree programs.



(a) Fellows may pursue a master's degree in history or political science (including government or politics), the
degree of Master of Arts in Teaching in history or political science (including government or politics), or a related
master's degree in education that permits a concentration in American history, American government, or social studies.
Graduate degrees under which study is excluded from fellowship support are indicated in  2400.64.

(b) A master's degree pursued under a James Madison Fellowship may entail either one or two years or their equivalent
of study, according to the requirements of the university at which a Fellow is enrolled.



 2400.42 

Approval of programs.



The Foundation must approve each Fellow's program of graduate study. To be approved, the program must

(a) On a part-time or full-time basis lead to a master's degree in history or political science, the degree of Master
of Arts in Teaching in history or political science, or a related master's degree in education that permits a concentration
in American history, American government, or social studies;

(b) Include courses, graduate seminars, or opportunities for independent study in topics directly related to the
framing and history of the constitution of the United States;

(c) Be pursued at a university that assures a willingness to accept up to 6 semester hours of accredited transfer credits
from another graduate institution for a Fellow's satisfactory completion of the Foundation's Summer Institute
on the Constitution. For the Foundation's purposes, these 6 semester hours may be included in the required minimum
of 12 semester hours or their equivalent of study of the United States Constitution; and

(d) Be pursued at a university that encourages the Fellow to enhance his or her capacities as a teacher of American history,
American government, or social studies and to continue his or her career as a secondary school teacher. The Foundation
reserves the right to refuse to approve a Fellow's degree program at a university that will not accept on transfer the
6 credits for the Institute.



 2400.43 

Required courses of graduate study.



(a) To be acceptable to the Foundation, those courses related to the Constitution referred to in  2400.43(b)
must amount to at least 12 semester hours or their equivalent of study of topics directly related to the United States
Constitution. More than 12 hours or their equivalent of such study is strongly encouraged.

(b) The courses that fulfill the required minimum of 12 semester hours or their equivalent of study of the United States
Constitution must cover one or more of the following subject areas:

(1) The history of colonial America leading up to the framing of the Constitution;

(2) The Constitution itself, its framing, the history and principles upon which it is based, its ratification, the
Federalist Papers, Anti-Federalist writings, and the Bill of Rights;

(3) The historical development of political theory, constitutional law, and civil liberties as related to the Constitution;

(4) Interpretations of the Constitution by the Supreme Court and other branches of the federal government;

(5) Debates about the Constitution in other forums and about the effects of constitutional norms and decisions upon
American society and culture; and

(6) Any other subject clearly related to the framing, history, and principles of the Constitution.

(c) If a master's degree program in which a Fellow is enrolled offers the option of a master's thesis in place of a course
or courses, the Fellow will be strongly urged to write a thesis. If the preparation of a master's thesis adds additional
required credits to the minimum number of credits required for the master's degree, the Foundation will pay for these
additional credits. In all programs in which a master's degree thesis is required or elected as an option, a Fellow
must write the thesis in a subject concerning the framing, principles, or history of the United States Constitution.

 2400.44

Commencement of graduate study.



(a) Fellows may commence study under their fellowships as early as the summer following the announcement of their
award. Fellows are normally expected to commence study under their fellowships in the fall term of the academic year
following the date on which their award is announced. However, as indicated in  2400.62 below, they may seek
to postpone the commencement of fellowship study under extenuating circumstances.

(b) In determining the two- and five-year fellowship periods of Junior and Senior Fellows respectively, the Foundation
will consider the commencement of the fellowship period to be the date on which each Fellow commences study under a
fellowship.



 2400.45

Special consideration: Junior Fellows' courses of study.



Applicants for junior fellowships who seek or hold baccalaureate degrees in education are strongly encouraged to
pursue master's degrees in history or political science. Those applicants who hold undergraduate degrees in history,
political science, government, or any other subjects may take some teaching methods and related courses, although
the Foundation will not pay for them unless they are required for the degree for which the Fellow is matriculated. The
Foundation will review each proposed course of study for an appropriate balance of subject matter and other courses
based on the Fellow's goals, background, and degree requirements.





 2400.46

Special consideration: second master's degree.



The Foundation may award senior fellowships to applicants who are seeking their second master's degrees providing
that the applicants' first master's degrees were obtained at least five years prior to the year in which the applicants
would normally commence study under a fellowship. In evaluating applications from those intending to pursue a second
master's degree, the Fellow Selection Committee will favor those applicants who are planning to become American
history and social studies teachers after having taught another subject and those whose initial master's degree
was in a subject different from that sought under the second master's degree.



Subpart F_Fellowship Stipends



 2400.50

Amount of stipends.



Junior and senior fellowships carry a stipend of up to a maximum of $24,000 prorated over the period of Fellows' graduate
study. In no case shall the stipend for a fellowship exceed $12,000 per academic year. Within this limit, stipends
will be prorated over the period of Fellows' graduate study as follows: A maximum of $6,000 per academic semester or
trimester of full-time study, and a maximum of $4,000 per academic quarter of full-time study. Stipends for part-time
study will be pro rata shares of those allowable for full-time study.



 2400.51

Duration of stipends.



Stipends for junior fellowships may be payable over a period up to two calendar years of full-time graduate study,
and those for senior fellowships may be payable over a period of not more than five calendar years of part-time graduate
study, commencing with the dates under which Fellows commence their graduate study under their fellowships. However,
the duration of stipend payments will be subject to limitations indicated in  2400.61.



 2400.52

Use of stipends.



Stipends shall be used only to offset the costs of tuition, fees, books, room, and board associated with graduate study
under a fellowship. The costs allowed for a Fellow's room and board will be the amount the Fellow's university reports
to the Foundation as the cost of room and board for a graduate student if that student were to share a room at the student's
university. If no graduate housing exists, then costs for regular shared student housing will be used. If no campus
housing exists, the equivalent room and board costs at neighboring universities will be used. Stipends for room,
board, and books will be prorated for Fellows enrolled in programs less than full time. The Foundation will not reimburse
Fellows for any portion of their master's degree study, if any, that Fellows may have completed prior to the commencement
of their fellowships. Nor will the Foundation reimburse Fellows for any credits acquired above the minimum number
of credits required for the degree. If a Fellow already taken and paid for courses that can be credited toward the Fellow's
graduate degree under a fellowship, those must be credited to the degree; the remaining required courses will be paid
for by the Foundation.

 2400.53 

Certification for stipends



In order to receive a fellowship stipend, a Fellow must submit in writing acceptance of the terms and conditions of
the fellowship; evidence of admission to an approved graduate program; certified copies of undergraduate and, if
any, graduate transcripts; a certified payment request form indicating estimated expenses for tuition, fees, books,
room, and board; estimated income from any other grants or awards; information about the Fellow's degree program,
including the number of required credits and the availability of a thesis option; a statement of the university's
willingness to accept the transfer of 6 credits toward the Fellow's degree requirements for the Fellow's satisfactory
completion of the Summer Institute (see  2400.74); and a full plan of study over the duration of the fellowship,
including information on the contents of required courses. Junior Fellows must provide evidence of receipt of their
baccalaureate degrees, and Senior Fellows must provide evidence of their continued full-time employment as teachers
in grades 7-12.



 2400.54 

Payment of stipends.



Payment for tuition, fees, books, room, and board subject to the limitations in  2400.50-53 and  2400.60-61
will be paid to each Fellow at the beginning of each term of enrollment upon the Fellow's submission of a completed Payment
Request Form provided by the Foundation.



 2400.55 

Termination of stipends.



The Foundation may suspend or terminate the payment of a stipend if a Fellow fails to meet the criteria set forth in  2400.40-2400.44
and  2400.61, except as provided for in  2400.62. Before it suspends or terminates a fellowship under
these circumstances, the Foundation will give notice to the Fellow, as well as the opportunity to be heard with respect
to the grounds for suspension or termination.



 2400.56 

Repayment of stipends.



(a) If a Fellow fails to secure a master's degree, to teach American history, American government, or social studies
on a full-time basis in a secondary school for at least one school year for each academic year for which assistance was
provided under a fellowship, to secure no fewer than 12 credits for study of the Constitution as indicated in  2400.43(b),
or to attend the Foundation's Summer Institute on the Constitution, the Fellow shall repay all of the fellowship assistance
received plus interest at the rate of 6% per annum or as otherwise authorized and, if applicable, reasonable collection
fees, as prescribed in Section 807 of the Act (20 U.S.C. 4506 (b)).

(b) If a Fellow resigns a fellowship, the Foundation will seek to recover all fellowship funds which have been remitted
to the Fellow under a fellowship.



Subpart G_Special Conditions



 2400.60 

Other awards.



Fellows may accept grants from other foundations, institutions, corporations, or government agencies to support
their graduate study or to replace any income foregone for study. However, the stipend paid by the Foundation for allowable
costs indicated in  2400.52 will be reduced to the extent these costs are paid from other sources, and in no case
will fellowship funds be paid to Fellows to provide support in excess of their actual total costs of tuition, required
fees, books, room, and board. The Foundation may also reduce a Fellow's stipend if the Fellow is remunerated for the
costs of tuition under a research or teaching assistantship or a work-study program. In such a case, the Foundation
will require information from a Fellow's university about the intended use of assistantship or work-study support
before remitting fellowship payments.

 2400.61 

Renewal of awards.


(a) Provided that Fellows have submitted all required documentation, it is the intent of the Foundation to renew junior
fellowship awards annually for a period not to exceed two calendar years and senior fellowships for a period not to
exceed five calendar years (except when those periods have been altered because of changes in Fellows' programs of
studies as provided for in  2400.65), or until a Fellow has completed all requirements for a master's degree,
whichever comes first. In no case, however, will the Foundation continue payments under a fellowship to a Fellow who
has reached the maximum payments under a fellowship as indicated in  2400.50, or completed the minimum number
of credits required for the degree. Although Fellows are encouraged to take courses in addition to those required
for the degree or required to maintain full-time status, the Foundation will not in such cases pay for those additional
courses unless they are credited to the minimum number of credits required for the degree.
(b) Fellowship renewal will be subject to an annual review by the Foundation and certification by an authorized official
of the university at which a Fellow is registered that:



The Fellow is making satisfactory progress toward the degree and is in good academic standing according to the standards
of each university.



(c) As a condition of renewal of awards, each Fellow must submit an annual activity report to the Foundation by July
15th. That report must indicate, through submission of a copy of the Fellow's transcript, courses taken and grades
achieved; courses planned for the coming year; changes in academic or professional plans or situations; any awards,
recognitions, or special achievements in the Fellow's academic study or school employment; and such other information
as may relate to the fellowship and its holder. Fellows must also submit a final report to the Foundation following
completion of their fellowships.


 2400.62 

Postponement of awards.


Upon application to the Foundation, a Fellow may seek postponement of his or her fellowship because of ill health or
other mitigating circumstances, such as military duty, temporary disability, necessary care of an immediate family
member, or unemployment as a teacher. Substantiation of the reasons for the requested postponement of study will
be required.


 2400.63 

Evidence of master's degree.


At the conclusion of the fellowship term, each Fellow must provide evidence that he or she has secured an approved master's
degree as set forth in the Fellow's original plan of study/or approved modifications thereto.


 2400.64 

Excluded graduate study.


(a) James Madison Fellowships do not provide support for study toward doctoral degrees, for the degree of master of
arts in public affairs or public administration, or toward the award of teaching certificates. Nor do fellowships
support practice teaching required for professional certification or other courses related to teaching unless
those courses are required for the degree. In those cases, however, the Foundation will provide reimbursement only
toward those courses related to teaching that fall within the minimum number of courses required for the degree, not
in addition to that minimum.

(b) If a course or courses required toward a Fellow's master's degree are coincidentally credited toward a Fellow's
future doctoral degree or teaching certificate, the Foundation will provide reimbursement toward that course or
those courses. Such reimbursement will be governed by all other rules, requirements, and obligations set forth here.



 2400.65 

Alteration of plans of study.



Although Junior Fellows are expected to pursue full-time study and Senior Fellows to pursue part-time study, the
Foundation may permit Junior Fellows with an established need (such as the need to accept a teaching position) to study
part time and Senior Fellows with established need (such as great distance between the Fellow's residence and the
nearest university, thus necessitating a full-time leave of absence from employment in order to study) to study full
time.



 2400.66 

Completion of fellowships.



A Fellow will be deemed to have satisfied all terms of a fellowship and all obligations under it when the Fellow has completed
no fewer than 12 credits of study of the Constitution, formally secured the masters degree, attended the Foundation's
Summer Institute on the Constitution, completed teaching for the number of years and fractions thereof required
as a condition of accepting Foundation support for study, and submitted all required reports.



Subpart H_Summer Institute on the Constitution



 2400.70 

Institute's relationship to fellowship.



Each year, the Foundation offers, normally during July a four-week graduate-level Institute on the principles,
framing, ratification, and implementation of the United States Constitution at an accredited university in the
Washington, DC area. The Institute is an integral part of each fellowship.



 2400.71 

Fellows' participation in institute.



Each Fellow is required as part of his or her fellowship to attend the Institute, normally during the summer following
the Fellow's commencement of graduate study under a fellowship.



 2400.72 

Contents of institute.



The principal element of the Institute is a graduate history course, ``The Origins of Constitutional Government
in the United States, 1763-1803.'' Other components of the Institute include study visits to sites associated
with the lives and careers of members of the founding generation and exposure to advanced teaching methods.

 2400.73

Allowances and institute costs.


For their participation in the Institute, Fellows are paid an allowance from non-federal sources to help offset income
foregone by their required attendance. The Foundation also funds the costs of the Institute and Fellows' round-trip
transportation to and from the Institute site. The costs of tuition, required fees, books, room, and board entailed
by the Institute will be paid for by the Foundation directly but may be offset against fellowship award limits if the
credits earned for the Institute are included within the Fellows' degree requirements.


 2400.74

Institute accreditation.


The Institute is accredited for six graduate credits by the university at which it is held. It is expected that the universities
at which Fellows are pursuing their graduate study will, upon Fellows' satisfactory completion of the Institute,
accept these credits upon transfer from the university at which the Institute is held in fulfillment of the minimum
number of credits required for Fellows' graduate degrees. Satisfactory completion of the Institute will fulfill
six of the Foundation's 12 credits of required graduate study of the history and development of the Constitution.
Fellows, with the Foundation's assistance, are strongly encouraged to make good faith efforts to have their universities
incorporate the Institute into their course programs and accept the 6 Institute credits toward the minimum number
of credits required for their master's degrees.

Financial Reporting Requirements and Rate of Return Methodology in the Domestic Offshore Trades


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Maritime Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Federal Maritime Commission proposes to amend its regulations governing financial reporting requirements
and rate of return methodology applicable to vessel-operating common carriers by water in the domestic offshore
trades to discontinue use of the comparable earnings test in determining the reasonableness of a carrier's return
on rate base. In its place, the Commission proposes to use the weighted average cost of capital methodology. In addition,
the Commission proposes to amend its rules pertaining to the treatment of insurance expenses, accumulated deferred
taxes and the Capital Construction Fund for purposes of calculating a carrier's rate base. The proposed rule addresses
a number of shipper and carrier concerns regarding the Commission's current rate of return methodology and would
align the Commission's ratemaking methodologies more closely with those used by numerous other regulatory agencies.
The intent is to improve the Commission's methodology for evaluating the reasonableness of rates filed by carriers
in the domestic offshore trades and for acquiring the data that are essential to that evaluation.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On March 11, 1993, the Federal Maritime Commission (``FMC'' or ``Commission'') published a final rule in Docket No.
91-51, Financial Reports of Common Carriers by Water in the Domestic Offshore Trades, which amended the provisions
under which carriers could obtain waivers of certain financial reporting requirements. 58 FR 13414. (1993) (``Docket
No. 91-51''). The Commission stated that it intended ``* * * to turn its attention, separately,
to the numerous other substantive changes to 46 CFR part 552 that have been suggested in this proceeding.'' Id. at 13417.
 In this regard, the Commission conducted an extensive review of part 552 to assess the need for changes to its financial
reporting requirements and rate of return methodology in the domestic offshore trades.




Based on its review, the Commission has determined that several issues regarding the adequacy and appropriateness
of various aspects of its present regulations should be addressed. The issues on which the Commission is proposing
changes to existing regulations include:
 The FMC's methodology for computing an allowable rate of return on rate base.
 The treatment of deferred taxes and the Capital Construction Fund for rate base purposes.
 The definition of working capital.
Each of these issues is discussed in turn below.
 Also discussed are the rules governing the allocation of assets and expenses, but no changes are proposed.




Computing an Allowable Rate of Return on Rate Base


I. The Allowable Rate of Return Should Equal the Cost of Capital


The fundamental objective when using a rate of return on rate base method of regulation is to set a regulated firm's
maximum allowable rate of return on rate base equal to the regulated firm's cost of capital. The cost of capital, sometimes
referred to by economists as ``the opportunity cost of capital'' or ``the required rate of return,'' is the minimum
rate of return necessary to attract capital to an investment. It is the expected rate of return prevailing in capital
markets on alternative investments of equivalent risk.
 The bases for setting the allowable rate of return equal to the cost of capital are legal and economic.

A. Legal Rationale


Two landmark Supreme Court cases defined the legal principles underlying rate of return regulation and provided
the notion of a fair rate of return. The two cases, 

Bluefield Water Works & Improvement Co. 

v. 

Public Service Commission of West Virginia, 

262 U.S. 679 (1923) and 

Federal Power Commission 

v. 

Hope Natural Gas Company, 

320 U.S. 391 (1944), established that investors in companies subject to rate regulation must be allowed an opportunity
to earn returns sufficient to attract capital and comparable to those they would expect from investments in other
firms for incurring the same amount of risk, and that revenues must not only cover operating expenses, but capital
costs as well.


B. Economic Rationale


The economic rationale for setting the allowable rate of return of a regulated enterprise equal to its cost of capital
is that the regulated firm's customers will thereby pay the lowest cost for service in the long run.
 For example, if a regulator sets the allowable rate of return above the cost of capital, the firm's stockholders will
realize earnings in excess of those they could earn on alternative investments of comparable risk. Such excess earnings
are paid for by the firm's customers in the form of prices higher than those that they would otherwise be required to
pay. If, on the other hand, a regulator sets the allowable rate of return below the cost of capital, stockholders will
realize earnings less than they could on alternative investments of comparable risk. In the short run, the firm's
customers may benefit because they pay prices lower than those they would otherwise be required to pay. In the long
run, however, the firm's stockholders will be unwilling to continue to invest their funds, and the firm will, therefore,
lack the requisite financial capital for maintaining and augmenting the firm's physical plant and equipment. Customers,
in turn, will be supplied with a lesser quantity and/or quality of service.




C. Methodologies


The Commission uses a version of the Comparable Earnings Test (``CET'') to determine the reasonableness of rates
of return. The carrier's projected rate of return ((net income after taxes + interest expense)/rate base
) is compared with the rate of return on total capital earned by U.S. manufacturing firms over an extended period of
time_the benchmark rate of return. Where appropriate, adjustments are made to the benchmark for current trends in
rates of return, the cost of money and relative risk.

<TEXT>
 

However, most regulatory agencies use the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (``WACC'') methodology to set allowable
rates of return, including, for example the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission
(``ICC''), the Federal Communications Commission, and the Maryland Public Service Commission. Indeed, the most
recent yearbook published by the National Association of Regulatory Commissioners shows that virtually every state
regulatory commission in the U.S. uses some variation of the WACC.

6

 Further, current economic literature recognizes the WACC approach as the most generally accepted method of setting
allowable rates of return. 





The WACC approach recognizes that there are several methods by which a firm may raise capital and each has its attendant
cost. Typically, the total capital of a firm has come from three different sources, long-term debt, preferred stock

7

 and common-stock equity. Thus, the total capital of a firm may have a debt component, a preferred stock component and
a common-stock equity component. Under the WACC methodology,

8

 the cost of each of these components is calculated separately and weighted by the proportion the component is to the
total capital of the firm.

9









To illustrate the calculation of the WACC, consider a hypothetical regulated company that has total invested capital
of $100 million, consisting of $25 million of long-term debt, $15 millon of preferred stock, and $60 million of common-stock
equity. Assume that the firm's cost of long-term debt is 7 percent, cost of preferred stock is 9 percent, and cost of
common-stock equity is 12 percent. Further, assume that the firm operates in a world where corporate taxes do not exist.
The WACC for this firm is calculated as follows: 










where:


K

d

 is the regulated firm's cost of long-term debt capital;
K

p

 is the regulated firm's cost of preferred stock capital;
K

e

 is the regulated firm's cost of common-stock equity capital;
D is the value of the regulated firm's long-term debt outstanding;
P is the value of the regulated firm's preferred stock outstanding; and
E is the value of the regulated firm's common-stock equity outstanding.



Thus, given the assumptions of this example, the WACC is 10.30 percent. The allowable rate of return for this hypothetical
company should, therefore, be set at 10.30 percent, which would provide the firm with the opportunity to earn revenues
sufficient to service the company's overall cost of capital.

11

 




The costs of long-term debt and preferred stock capital may be calculated with relative precision. For the debt component,
this is done by computing the actual total annual fixed charges on long-term debt for all issues, including any amortized
discount or premium and issuance expense. The total annual fixed charges are then divided by the actual total value
of long-term debt outstanding for all issues in order to arrive at the cost of debt stated as a percentage. For example,
if the annual fixed charges on long-term debt are $1,750,000 and the total long-term debt outstanding is $25 million,
the cost of debt would be 7 percent ($1,750,000/$25 million=.07). 

The cost of preferred stock is calculated in similar fashion. The actual total annual dividend requirements on the
preferred stock for all issues is divided by the actual total value of preferred stock outstanding for all issues in
order to arrive at the cost of preferred stock stated as a percentage. For example, if the actual total annual dividend
requirements amounted to $1,350,000 and the total value of outstanding preferred stock is $15 million, the cost of
preferred stock would be 9 percent ($1,350,000/$15 million=.09). 

The calculation of the cost of common stock equity capital, the third component of the WACC, is more difficult. Commonly
used methods are the Discounted Cash Flow (``DCF''), the Capital Asset Pricing Model (``CAPM'') and the Risk Premium
(``RP''). Each of these models is based on market variables (e.g., stock market prices and bond yields) which reflect
the expectations of investors in capital markets. More specifically, the DCF, CAPM and RP models are constructed
under the generally accepted assumption that a company's stock market price at any moment in time reflects completely
investors' current expectations. Because these market-based models are designed to reflect the expectations of
investors, and because a company's cost of capital is defined as the rate of return expected by investors on alternative
investments of equivalent risk, the WACC framework implemented through the use of such models will, in general, equate
the allowable rate of return with the cost of capital.

II. The Commission's Comparable Earnings Test Compared to the WACC 



A. Theoretical Issues 



The Commission has used its variation of the CET in a number of rate investigations. Commission orders adjudicating
the reasonableness of rate increases under the CET have been repeatedly upheld by the courts. 

E.g., Matson Navigation Company, Inc. 

v. 

FMC,

 959 F.2d 1039 (D.C. Cir. 1992); and 

Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping Authority 

v. 

FMC,

 678 F.2d 327 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 906 (1982). However, the Commission's CET does present a theoretical
shortcoming compared to the WACC method, in that it is unlikely to equate the allowable rate of return with the cost
of capital, because it uses historical accounting data to calculate an average book value

12

 rate of return that the regulated carrier should be allowed. 




The accounting rate of return for a company is not equivalent to the firm's true economic rate of return because accounting
and economic concepts of income and value are substantially different. Accounting numbers are derived on the basis
of generally accepted accounting principles while economics specifies the use of opportunity costs. This difference
is particularly acute when the economy is characterized by high and variable rates of inflation. For example, accountants
define asset values in terms of acquisition or historical costs while economists define asset values on the basis
of market values or replacement costs. This distinction effects both the income statement as well as the balance sheet.
Consequently, an accounting-based rate of return methodology such as the Commission's CET does not adequately measure
a regulated carrier's true cost of capital. In Docket No. 91-51, the State of Hawaii noted the problems associated
with using accounting data and criticized the Commission's CET for being accounting-based and not market-based.


Several empirical tests have demonstrated that there is a large discrepancy between accounting rate of return and
true economic return.

13

 These studies also demonstrate that biases inherent in book returns are systematic, and that these biases do not cancel
out by averaging across companies. Furthermore, the type and magnitude of bias for regulated firms are different
than those of unregulated firms contained in the comparable risk group of firms selected in applying the Commission's
CET method.

14

<TEXT>
 

B. Practical Issues 


The WACC approach also presents some important technical advantages. First, the WACC uses the actual long-term interest
expense currently provided by a regulated carrier to compute the company's cost of long-term debt capital, while
the Commission's CET uses an estimate of a carrier's long-term interest expense based on moving averages of Baa-rated
corporate bond yields in computing an allowable rate of return on rate base. By definition, a firm's actual long-term
interest expense is more accurate than an estimate of that expense. In its comments in Docket No. 91-51, the State
of Hawaii stated that the Commission's CET introduces imprecision into the calculation by requiring that parties
substitute a proxy for carrier interest expense as a component of the carrier's rate of return, although this component
is known and subject to verification. 
Second, the WACC, when implemented properly, ensures that the regulated carrier will be allowed a return on rate base
that is large enough to ensure that the carrier will have the opportunity to earn, at a minimum, revenues that are sufficient
to cover its embedded (actual historical) cost of debt. Assuming that debt capital financing is less expensive than
preferred stock and common-stock equity capital financing, when the known cost of long-term debt is weighted by the
regulated company's proportion of long-term debt capital outstanding, and then added to the firm's cost of preferred
stock weighted by the firm's proportion of preferred stock capital outstanding and the firm's cost of common-stock
equity capital weighted by the firm's proportion of common-stock equity capital outstanding, the resulting sum
(

i.e.

, the WACC) can be no less than the cost of the firm's embedded cost of debt. Such a guarantee is not available under the
Commission's CET, as Matson Navigation Company, Inc. (``Matson''), has pointed out. For example, if the long-term
interest expense estimate, derived on the basis of a moving average of historical Baa corporate bond yields, is not
representative of the actual long-term interest expense of the regulated carrier, or if the historical financial
data reflecting the financial picture of the benchmark group of firms are not representative of the regulated carrier's
financial position, then the regulated carrier's calculated allowable rate of return on rate base could fall short
of its embedded cost of debt. 
Third, the Commission's CET has proved difficult to apply in the case of the Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping Authority
(``PRMSA''), which has a capital structure composed entirely of long-term debt and by law is not required to pay taxes.
On the other hand, the WACC can be used effectively to establish an appropriate allowable rate of return for such a carrier.
The WACC is computed for such a carrier by weighting the cost of long-term debt near or equal to one, the cost of preferred
stock near or equal to zero, and the cost of common-stock equity near or equal to zero, and setting the corporate tax
rate equal to zero. The WACC can be used effectively to compute an accurate estimate of the overall cost of capital and,
in turn, to establish an appropriate allowable rate of return for a regulated carrier that is financed exclusively
or almost completely by long-term debt

15

 and is tax-exempt, because it distinguishes between such a carrier and one that is financed with substantial amounts
of common-stock equity and is not tax-exempt. In its comments in Docket No. 91-51, PRMSA observed that the Commission's
CET makes no such distinction because it uses as a benchmark for every regulated carrier, regardless of actual capital
structure or tax status, a typical firm financed with a relatively balanced mixture of long-term debt and common-stock
equity capital, and is not tax-exempt. 




Lastly, the WACC method typically uses a number of different methods to calculate the regulated firm's cost of common-stock
equity capital. This yields several different estimates of the firm's WACC providing a regulatory commission with
a range of numbers from which a single number representing an allowable rate of return on rate base can be chosen. This
minimizes the possibility that the allowable rate of return will be distorted by inappropriate subjective judgements
or by extraordinary economic conditions existing during the time period used to measure that return. By comparison,
the Commission's CET produces a single measure of an allowable rate of return. 
On the basis of its review, the Commission has determined to propose the use of the WACC methodology to evaluate the
reasonableness of a carrier's rates in the domestic offshore trades. The Commission believes that the WACC approach
set forth in the proposed rule represents a substantial improvement over the existing methodology and addresses
the criticisms voiced in comments in Docket No. 91-51. We now turn to the proposed rule. 


III. Estimating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital 


A. Capital Structure 


The first step in calculating the WACC is to determine an appropriate capital structure (

i.e.

, the proportions of long-term debt, preferred stock, and common-stock equity capital issued by a firm to finance
its operations) for the regulated firm. There are two important issues that may have to be resolved. The first is whether
to calculate the WACC using a ``typical'' or ``ideal'' capital structure as some regulatory commissions do, or the
actual capital structure or that expected in the near future, as others do. The second issue concerns the situation
where the regulated company is a subsidiary of a parent company. The issue is whether to use the capital structure of
the subsidiary or that of the consolidated system (

i.e.

, the parent company and all of its subsidiaries) in computing the WACC.

<TEXT>
 

1. 

Hypothetical Versus Actual Capital Structure

. The WACC may be much lower when the proportion of debt contained in a company's capital structure is relatively high
compared to common-stock equity. This is because the interest rate on debt is usually much lower than the cost of common-stock
equity.

16

 In addition, debt costs the firm and the ratepayer less than equity because equity earnings are subject to income taxes
and debt is not. The revenue that a company is allowed to earn on its common-stock equity is increased by amounts added
to that revenue for the purpose of paying income taxes. By contrast, since interest is deductible for income tax purposes,
earnings to cover debt costs are computed before any income tax calculations, and are not subject to income tax. Consequently,
within limits determined by such factors as the risk of a business, the WACC may be lower and ratepayers may pay less
when the firm employs a relatively large proportion of debt than when it uses a relatively large proportion of equity.
Given this differential, some regulatory commissions compute the WACC using what they believe to be the ``typical,''
or ``ideal,'' capital structure without regard to the actual capitalization of the regulated company in question.
Other regulatory commissions base their WACC estimates on either the actual capital structure, or that expected
in the near future when rates to be decided will be in effect. 




There are strong reasons for using a regulated carrier's actual or expected capital structure rather than the alternative
of a hypothetical or ideal capital structure in calculating the carrier's WACC. First, a regulated company's current
capital structure could be the product of decisions that were logical and efficient at the time they were made, although
a different capitalization might be consistent with a lower WACC at the time of a rate investigation and hearing. Although
hindsight is always more accurate than foresight, a company must make financial decisions based on an evaluation
of the present and projections of future conditions.

17

 Second, using a hypothetical or typical capital structure substitutes an estimate of what the WACC 

would be 

under conditions that do not exist for what it 

actually is

 or 

will soon

 be under existing conditions.

18

 





Accordingly, the Commission's proposed rule specifies the use of a regulated domestic offshore carrier's expected
capital structure in computing the carrier's WACC. The proposed rule stipulates the use of the expected rather than
the actual capital structure because the Commission uses a future instead of a historic test year.

Where a regulated company is a wholly owned subsidiary which obtains its common-stock equity capital through a parent
company, regulators often use the capital structure of the consolidated system (i.e., the parent company and all
of its subsidiaries) in computing the WACC. The consolidated capital structure is an appropriate capitalization
to use in calculating a regulated subsidiary's WACC when: (1) No substantial minority interest in the subsidiary
exists (i.e., the regulated subsidiary is wholly-owned by a parent company or nearly so), and (2) the risks are similar
between the parent and subsidiary.
 In such a situation, investors' appraisals of the parent company's common stock are thought to represent the best
measure of the current cost of common-stock equity to the subsidiary.
 When the consolidated capital structure is used, the consolidated system's cost of common-stock equity capital
(issued by the parent company), the consolidated system's cost of preferred stock, and the consolidated system's
cost of long-term debt, rather than the respective capital component costs of the regulated subsidiary, are also
used because the consolidated capital structure directly affects the capital component costs of the consolidated
system and not those of the subsidiary.
 The use of the regulated subsidiary's capital component costs is inconsistent with the use of the consolidated system's
capital structure and could, therefore, distort the WACC estimate obtained for the regulated subsidiary. 







The use of the consolidated capital structure is not correct, however, when a substantial minority interest in the
regulated subsidiary exists, or when the regulated subsidiary's risk differs substantially from that of the parent
company. The appropriate approach in this situation is to ignore the parent-subsidiary relationship and to estimate
the subsidiary's WACC using the subsidiary's own capital structure and capital component costs. This method, referred
to as the ``stand alone'' or ``subsidiary approach,'' recognizes the subsidiary as an independent operating company,
and its cost of common-stock equity capital is inferred as the cost of common-stock equity of firms having risk comparable
to that of the subsidiary.
 The basis for this method is that the required return on an investment depends on its risk (i.e., the subsidiary's risk)
rather than on the parent's financing costs. In short, this method emphasizes the use, rather than the source, of the
subsidiary's capital funds. 





The Commission's proposed rule specifies that a subsidiary carrier's capital structure is to be used in computing
the WACC unless, after notice and opportunity for comment, the Commission determines that: (1) The subsidiary carrier's
parent company issues publicly traded common-stock equity; (2) no substantial minority interest in the subsidiary
carrier exists; and (3) risks are similar between the subsidiary carrier and the parent company. Under the proposed
rule, no substantial minority interest in a subsidiary carrier exists when a parent company owns 90 percent or more
of the subsidiary's voting shares of stock. It also must be demonstrated that both the business and the financial risks
facing the parent and subsidiary are similar.
 





Such an evaluation may involve a comparison of such financial risk measures as total capitalization and debt-to-equity
ratios, investment quality ratings on short-and long-term debt instruments, and coverage ratios such as the times
interest earned and fixed charges coverage ratios.
 There must also be an assessment of the degree to which the regulated subsidiary comprises the parent's holdings.
To the extent that a subsidiary accounts for a substantial majority of the consolidated system's revenues, expenses,
and profits, the business risks of the parent and subsidiary would, in general, be the same. However, where a parent's
holdings are diversified into areas of business unrelated to the regulated subsidiary, the business risks of the
parent and of the subsidiary are more likely to differ. 





Accordingly, the Commission's proposed rule states that the Commission shall consider some or all of the aforementioned
business and financial risk criteria in determining whether to approve the use of a consolidated system's capital
structure and component costs in computing the subsidiary's WACC. 

Other measures of business and financial risks may also be used in comparing the risk of a parent with the risk of a subsidiary.
These could include those discussed later for selecting an appropriate proxy group of firms.

3. 

Book Value Versus Market Value Capitalization Ratios

. Another capital structure issue is whether to use market or book values in computing the capitalization ratios (

i.e.

, the weights) in the WACC formula. Technically, capitalization ratios should be computed on the basis of market value.
A capital structure computed on the basis of historical (

i.e.

, book values) as opposed to current market values misrepresents the true capital structure over time, since price
levels fluctuate. The common practice is, nevertheless, to compute capitalization ratios on the basis of book values.
This is defended on grounds that a regulated firm supposedly raises capital in such a fashion that a target capitalization
ratio expressed on the basis of book values is maintained by the company. Consequently, regulators must compute the
firm's overall cost of capital on the same basis in order to ensure that the company's capital costs are adequately
covered. In addition, book value capitalization ratios are stable and the regulator is, therefore, not required
to deal with the uncertainties associated with volatile market weights. Further, effective regulation is said to
force book and market values toward equality. Accordingly, the Commission's proposed rule requires the use of book
value capitalization ratios in computing the WACC. 
4. 

Average Versus Year-End Capital Structure.

 Finally, there is the issue of whether a year-end or average capital structure should be used in computing the WACC.
The fact that financial variables and ratios are commonly stated on an average basis argues in favor of using an expected
average capital structure projected over a future test year, rather than a year-end capital structure. Earnings
per share, for example, are typically expressed on the basis of average number of shares outstanding. Equity returns
are also frequently expressed on the basis of average common-stock equity. In addition, an average capital structure
computed over a future test year is likely to represent the company's capital structure during the time interval in
which a proposed general rate increase will be in effect better than a year-end capital structure, because the company
could acquire new capital from, or return existing capital to, investors during that period of time. The use of an average
capital structure rather than a year-end capital structure is, therefore, more likely to enable a regulated firm
to actually earn its allowable rate of return. Accordingly, the Commission's proposed rule specifies the use of test-year
average

25

 book value capitalization ratios in computing the WACC.

B. Annual Cost of the Capital Components 


Determining the cost of the regulated firm's senior capital (

i.e.

, debt and preferred stock) and common-stock equity is the second step in estimating the WACC. The costs of each of these
components are then applied to the capital structure (

i.e.

, each is weighted on the basis of the proportion of the value of the total capital outstanding that each represents)
in order to determine the WACC. 
1. 

Cost of Senior Capital.

 There are usually few problems encountered in computing the cost of senior capital with precision. Regulatory commissions
traditionally compute cost of senior capital on the basis of embedded (actual historical) cost. This is done by first
computing the actual total annual fixed charges on long-term debt, including any amortized discount or premium and
issuance expense, and the actual total annual dividend requirements on the preferred (and preference) stock for
all issues on a dollar basis. These dollar figures are then converted to a percentage by dividing the actual total annual
fixed charges on long-term debt by the actual total value of long-term debt outstanding, and the actual total annual
preferred stock dividend requirements by the actual total value of preferred stock outstanding for all issues. If
a future (rather than a historical) test year is used (as the FMC does), the cost of senior capital is calculated on the
basis of: (1) The embedded cost for the existing long-term debt and preferred stock, and (2) the current cost for any
new long-term debt and preferred stock that the regulated firm anticipates issuing on or before the final day of the
projected test year. 
The embedded cost is used to calculate the cost of existing senior capital in order to determine what the senior capital
will cost the firm today, in view of the fact that the majority of it was issued at prior points in time, and under bond
and stock market conditions that could have differed substantially compared to those prevailing today. The objective
is not to determine what the existing senior capital would cost if issued today. Rather, the embedded debt cost measures
precisely what the regulated firm needs to satisfy its contractually required interest payments to those holding
existing long-term debt, and preferred-dividend payments to those holding existing preferred stock. The current
cost of bonds and preferred stock is, therefore, estimated only to measure the cost to the regulated firm when such
senior securities are to be issued in the near future. 
2. 

Cost of Common-Stock Equity Capital.

 The most critical problem in determining the WACC is that of estimating the cost of common-stock equity capital. The
objective is to determine how much the regulated firm is required to earn in order to be able to entice investors into
purchasing and holding its common-stock equity. A precise answer to this question is difficult to arrive at due to
the absence of any expressed or fixed agreement as to the level of dividends that are to be paid by the regulated firm
to its common-stock equityholders. Dividend payments, on the one hand, depend upon the profits of the regulated company.
The allowable amount of profits, on the other hand, is the object of a rate investigation and hearing. A regulator,
in allowing a fair rate of return, does not, therefore, have any predetermined gauge as to the level of profit and common-stock
equity dividends required by investors. 
There are five major methods used to estimate the cost of common-stock equity capital: DCF, RP, CAPM,

26

 Market-to-Book Ratio (``MBR''), and Comparable Earnings (``CE'').

27

 The DCF, CAPM, RP, and MBR methods are market-based approaches that emphasize the standard of capital attraction
articulated in 

Hope

 and 

Bluefield 

by examining investors' expectations of the regulated firm's profits, dividends, and 

market

 prices. The CE method emphasizes the comparable earnings standard specified by those cases by estimating the return
on 

book 

common-stock equity of firms having risk similar to that of the regulated firm under consideration. The five methods
are reviewed in turn.

a. Discounted Cash Flow Method. The DCF method of estimating the cost of common-stock equity is the technique that
is used with the greatest frequency by state and federal regulatory commissions and agencies. Its popularity reflects
the intuitive appeal of the DCF model with its basis in valuation theory. That theory holds that the current market
price of a common stock is equal to the present value of its expected future dividend payments plus the proceeds that
an investor would expect to receive when the common stock is finally sold. Because the value of an amount of money to
be received in the future is less than the value of the same amount of money received today,

28

 the expected value of the future dividends and ultimate proceeds must be discounted back to the present at the investor's
required rate of return in computing the present value of a common stock. The most basic mathematical representation
of this concept assumes that: (1) Dividends grow at a constant annual rate, and (2) that an investor will hold the common
stock forever. The latter assumption implies that the value of the stock depends solely on the dividends that are expected
to be paid. The basic DCF model is expressed algebraically as follows:










where:




P

o

 is the current market price per share of the regulated company's common stock; 

D

1

 is the dividend to be received at the end of year 1 (mathematically D

1

=D

o

(1+g), where D

0

 is the current dividend); 

K

e

 is the required or expected return on the regulated firm's common-stock equity capital (

i.e.

, the cost of common-stock equity capital); and 




g is the constant expected annual rate of growth in dividends per share. 




The equation is solved for K

e

 in rate of return testimony in order to determine the cost of the common-stock equity of the regulated firm under consideration.
Solving the equation for K

e

 yields the following expression: 









Hence, the basic or standard DCF model states that the cost of common-stock equity is equal to the expected (first-year)
dividend yield plus the rate at which investors expect dividends to grow in the future. 




To illustrate the basic DCF model, assume that the current market price of a hypothetical regulated company's common
stock is $30.00 per share, and that a single common stock share currently pays a $2.00 dividend, which is expected to
grow at a rate of 5 percent per year. The cost of common-stock equity capital for such a company is: 









i. Practical Issues 




(a) Expected Growth Rate of Dividends. The major practical issue involves determining ``g,'' the constant expected
annual rate of growth in dividends per share. There are three techniques that are commonly used to estimate ``g'':
(1) Historical growth rates; (2) professional investment services' projections; and (3) sustainable growth or
retention growth. An average of the growth rates arrived at separately using each of the three methods is often used
to produce a final growth estimate. This averaging procedure is the one reflected in the proposed rule. 




(i) Historical Growth Rate. The historical growth rate in dividends over some period, frequently five or ten years,
is one method used to estimate ``g.'' Historical data are used because investors' expectations of future growth are
based in part on growth rates experienced in the past. The historical growth in earnings per share, or book value per
share, is sometimes used as a proxy for the growth in dividends, because dividends are often increased at discrete
intervals, so that their estimated growth rate can differ considerably depending upon the precise beginning and
ending points of the selected data series. The proposed rule, therefore, requires averaging the historical growth
rate of dividends per share, earnings per share, and book value per share in arriving at an estimate of ``g.'' 

The period over which ``g'' is to be measured must be sufficiently long to avoid distortions in the data resulting from
short-term conditions and aberrational years, but sufficiently short to capture foreseeable influences relevant
for investors' evaluation of the future. The most recent five- and ten-year periods are commonly used to calculate
the growth rate. The proposed rule uses an average of the five- and ten-year growth rates on the basis that the average
represents a reasonable trade-off between the incongruous requirements of representativity and statistical adequacy.

<TEXT>
 

(ii) Professional Investment Services' Projections. The expected growth rate of dividends is also commonly based
upon the growth rates published by professional investment services, since investor expectations are the desired
quantities in the DCF model, and investors' growth anticipations are based in part upon the projections of such services.
Growth forecasts of dividends per share, earnings per share, and book value per share are published by several services,
including Value Line Publishing, Inc. (``Value Line''), and the Institutional Brokers Estimation Service (``IBES'').
Such growth rates are published on a regular basis, usually for five-year periods, and are readily available to investors.
Expert witnesses usually develop a consensus forecast by averaging the forecasts of the professional analysts,
and use this average in calculating ``g.'' The Commission's proposed rule similarly specifies that ``g'' will be
measured by using the average of: (1) The five-year dividend, earnings, and book value forecasts published by Value
Line, and of (2) the five-year earnings forecast published by IBES.

29







(iii) The Sustainable Growth Rate. The third technique used to estimate ``g,'' known alternately as the ``sustainable
growth,'' ``retention ratio,'' or ``plowback'' method, is to multiply the proportion of earnings expected to be
retained by the company, ``b,'' by the expected return on book equity, ROE. The relationship is expressed algebraically
as g=(b)(ROE). The theoretical underpinning for the method is that future growth in dividends for existing equity
can only occur if a portion of the overall return to investors is plowed back into the firm rather than being paid out
as dividends.




To illustrate the sustainable growth rate method, assume that a hypothetical regulated company is expected to retain
75 percent of its earnings, and is expected to earn a 10 percent return on book equity. The company's sustainable growth
rate estimate of ``g'' is:




g=.75(.10)

=.075 or 7.5 percent.




Both historical and projected values of ``b'' and ROE are used to estimate ``g.'' Projected values are regarded as
superior, however, since forecasted values incorporate current and predicted changes into the values. In addition,
the use of historical realized book returns on equity in estimating ROE has been criticized because the realized returns
are the product of the regulatory process itself, and are also subject to tests of reasonableness. Therefore, the
Commission's proposed rule requires that the forecasted values of ``b'' and ROE published by Value Line be used in
implementing the sustainable growth method.

(iv) Final Estimate of ``g''. The final estimate of ``g'' for the DCF model is commonly based on an average of the separate
estimates arrived at using the historical data, the professional investment services' projections, and the sustainable
growth model. Thus, the Commission's proposed rule reflects such an averaging procedure.




(b) Dividend Yield. Two methods are commonly used to calculate dividend yields in DCF analyses. The standard DCF model
uses the annual dividend expected to be paid 12 months following the purchase of the security. This method assumes
that dividends are paid annually. The other method uses the current dividend to compute the yield portion of the annual
return. This method assumes that dividends are paid continuously. However, the assumption of annual payments results
in an overstatement of the required return (

i.e.,

 the regulated firm's cost of common-stock equity capital), and the assumption of continuous payments results in
an understatement of the required return. Since most firms pay dividends on a quarterly basis, however, it is proper
to use a method that recognizes such quarterly installments. Such a method applies an adjustment factor to the current
dividend yield to account for quarterly payment of dividends. The dividend yield, assuming quarterly payment of
dividends, is calculated on the basis of the following formula:









where:




D

0

 is the current annualized dividend (defined as four times the current quarterly installment) per share;

P

0

 is the current market price per share of the common stock; and

g is the constant expected annual rate of growth in dividends per share.




To illustrate the quarterly dividend formula, assume that the current market price of a hypothetical regulated company's
common stock is $30.00 per share, and that a single common stock share currently pays quarterly a 50 cent dividend ($2.00
annually), which is expected to grow at a rate of 5 percent per year. The dividend yield for such a company is:












The Commission proposes to use this formula in calculating the dividend yield in DCF analyses.

In calculating the current price per share found in the denominator of the expression for the dividend yield, an average
price over a period of time, rather than a price on a particular day, is often used in order to remove aberrations from
the calculation. Such aberrations could be the result of events internal to the company (

e.g.,

 the stock may go ex-dividend

30

) or external factors (

e.g.,

 political events that affect the price of a firm's stock). The period over which to average the price of the common stock
should be sufficiently long to remove the aberration, but sufficiently short so as not to obscure any real trends in
the stock market. The Commission believes that the use of an average of the monthly high and low prices for a six-month
period in computing the dividend yield meets these criteria, and such an average is, therefore, reflected in the proposed
rule.





(c) Company-Specific Versus Comparable Group DCF Approach. The DCF model can be applied directly to a regulated company
which issues publicly-traded common-stock equity (so that the requisite stock market price data for doing so exist),
to a group of companies comparable in risk to the subject carrier which issue publicly-traded common-stock equity,
or, where possible, both. The company-specific DCF approach provides the stock market's most direct and meaningful
measure of a company's cost of common-stock equity capital. Accordingly, the Commission's proposed rule requires
that the DCF model be applied directly to the subject carrier where the carrier issues common-stock equity which trades
publicly.

31

 Only where a carrier issues no publicly-traded common-stock equity is the DCF model to be applied to a comparable group
of firms under the proposed rule. Some expert witnesses do, however, apply the DCF model to a comparable group of firms,
even where direct stock market data are available, either in place of, or in addition to, the company-specific DCF
approach. The Commission's proposed rule does not prescribe the comparable group DCF approach where direct stock
market price data are available because it is not certain that this approach would improve upon the accuracy of the
cost of common-stock equity capital estimate obtained using the carrier-specific DCF approach.

b. Capital Asset Pricing Model. 
The conceptual basis of the CAPM is that investors hold diversified portfolios consisting of individual common stocks
to minimize risk. Diversification reduces the risk of the portfolio because individual common stock rates of return

32

 are not perfectly correlated. The rate of return on some common stocks tends to be high while on others it tends to be
low so that the average risk or variability of the return of the portfolio is less than the average risk of the returns
of the common stocks contained in that portfolio. Diversification does not completely eliminate risk, however,
since individual common stock returns are correlated to a certain degree due to the influence of pervasive forces
not specific to a particular security that affect the overall market. 




The total risk of a common stock is partitioned into two components: (1) The ``specific'' or ``unsystematic'' risk
unique to a company that can be diversified away in a well-constructed portfolio, and (2) the ``market'' or ``systematic''
risk that cannot be diversified away. The core idea of the CAPM is that because investors can diversify away company-specific
risk, they should not be rewarded for bearing this superfluous risk. Diversified risk-averse investors are exposed
solely to market risk and are, therefore, rewarded with higher expected returns for bearing higher market risk. 
The CAPM provides a measure of market risk, known as ``beta,'' which gauges the degree to which an individual common
stock's return moves with the overall market's return. Specifically, the common stock's historical returns are
compared with the overall market's historical returns (commonly measured as the returns on a broad market index such
as the Standard and Poor's 500). A common stock is considered to be of above average risk if the stock's return is more
volatile than that of the market,

33

 and of below average risk if the stock's return is less volatile than that of the market.

34

 ``Beta'' is used in the CAPM model to adjust the market premium expected by investors in comparison to debt for the riskiness
of an individual common stock. 





The CAPM holds that the return on a common stock expected by an investor is equivalent to that which could be earned on
a riskless investment, plus a premium for assuming risk that is proportional to the common stock's market risk (i.e.,
``beta''), and the market price of risk (i.e., the difference between the overall expected stock market return and
the expected return on a risk-free investment). The CAPM is represented algebraically as follows:

 

K

e

=R

f

+B(R

m

^R

f

)



where:

 

K

e

 is the expected return on the regulated firm's common stock (i.e., its cost of common-stock equity capital; 
R

f

 is the expected risk-free return; 
B is the relevant expected market risk ``beta'' of the regulated firm's common stock; and 
R

m

 is the expected overall stock market return.

 

To illustrate the CAPM, assume that a hypothetical regulated company's expected ``beta'' is .95, the expected risk-free
rate is 7 percent, and the expected overall stock market return is 12 percent. The company's cost of common-stock equity
capital is:

 

K

e

=.07+.95(.12^.07) 


=.07+.0475 
=.1175 or 11.75 percent.



i. Practical Issues. 
The practical application of the CAPM requires estimates of the expected ``beta'' of the regulated firm, the expected
risk-free rate, and the expected return on the stock market. Each of these inputs is discussed in turn. 
(a) Risk-Free Rate. 
The yield on a 90-day Treasury Bill is theoretically risk-free. It is devoid of default risk and is subject to little
interest rate risk. Treasury Bill rates vary widely, however, resulting in volatile and unreliable common-stock
equity return estimates. In addition, 90-day Treasury Bill rates generally do not match investors' planning horizons,
which typically are far in excess of 90 days. Short-term government obligations may also reflect the impact of factors
(e.g., inflation) differently than long-term securities such as common stocks, or may reflect different factors
than those influencing the long term securities. Long-term Treasury bonds (e.g., 30-year bonds) may more closely
approximate investors' planning horizons, and their yields usually match more closely with common stock returns.
The yields on long-term bonds are subject to substantial interest rate risk, however, and so are not truly risk-free.
A compromise is to use the yields on Treasury securities of intermediate maturities as proxies for the risk-free rate.
Accordingly, the Commission's proposed rule implements the CAPM using a six-month average of five-year Treasury
Note yields.

<TEXT>
 

(b) ``Beta.'' The value of ``beta'' used in applying the CAPM should, in principle, be that which is expected in the
future. The ``beta'' actually used in the practical application of the model is, however, more commonly calculated
on the basis of historical data. ``Beta'' could be calculated by applying regression analysis, using historical
price and dividend data for the regulated firm under consideration, in order to measure the variability of the return
on the regulated firm's common stock relative to that of the market. The usual practice, however, is to use the ``betas''
published by an investment firm such as Value Line. Value Line ``betas'' are derived from a regression analysis between
weekly percent changes in the price of a company's common stock and the weekly percent changes in the New York Stock
Exchange Composite Indices over a period of five years.

35

 Provided that the regulated firm's market risk is not expected to change appreciably in the future, ``betas'' based
on historical data are appropriate for estimating the cost of common-stock equity. Therefore, the Commission's
proposed rule specifies the use of Value Line's most current ``betas'' in implementing the CAPM.




(c) Market Return. The third input required by the CAPM is an estimate of the expected return on the stock market. One
broad approach is to estimate the expected return on the market directly. One such technique is to apply a DCF analysis
to a broad market index such as the Standard & Poor's 500. A second broad approach is the historically derived risk
premium method, which involves two steps: (1) The arithmetic average difference between the actual annual returns
realized in the past on the overall stock market and the risk-free rate is calculated,

36

 and (2) this historical differential is added to the currently prevailing yield on the risk-free security. The resulting
sum is a measure of the return on the market. The rationale for this method is that investors anticipate that common
stocks will yield a higher return than the return on lower risk, fixed income securities, and the additional return
on the common stocks is expected to be approximately equal to what it was in the past. The Commission's proposed rule
stipulates the use of the historically derived risk premium method because it is relatively easy to apply, and its
data requirements are relatively light compared to methods designed to measure the expected market return directly.

<PARENT> FR940407-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The historical risk differential is commonly based on the historical return series published annually by Ibbotson
Associates in the Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation Yearbook (``SBBI Yearbook''). The SBBI Yearbook provides
averages of the historical risk differentials relative to various government securities for the period 1926 to the
present, using Standard and Poor's 500 Index to compute the overall market rate of return. The Commission's proposed
rule specifies the same source for measuring the arithmetic average risk premium relative to the required risk-free
rate proxy (i.e., the five-year Treasury Note).
The choice of a time period for measuring the historical differential sometimes differs, but frequently it matches
the entire period over which Ibbotson Associates provides the data. Returns calculated over a substantially shorter
horizon (e.g., five or ten years) are sometimes used to calculate the risk premium. This is not appropriate, however,
due to the extreme volatility of the return on the overall stock market.

37

 Accordingly, the Commission's proposed rule stipulates that the entire length of the data series be used as the time
horizon.




In summary, the proposed rule requires that the market return used in CAPM calculations be computed using a risk premium
defined as the arithmetic average historical risk differential relative to the five-year Treasury Note using the
data published in the most current SBBI Yearbook for the period 1926 through the most recent date for which the data
are available.
c. Risk Premium Method. The RP method, alternately referred to as the ``risk positioning method'' or the ``stock-bond
yield spread method,'' is based upon the premise that common-stock equity capital is riskier than debt from an investors'
perspective and that investors, therefore, require a larger rate of return on investments in common stocks than on
bonds to compensate them for bearing the extra risk. Common stock equity is riskier than debt because the payment of
interest and principal to debtholders has priority over the payment of dividends and return of capital to common-stock
equityholders. The RP method, therefore, estimates the cost of capital by adding an explicit premium for risk to a
current interest rate, frequently an interest rate on a particular government security. The general mathematical
expression for the RP model is as follows:



K

e



=K

d



+RP



where:



K

e

 is the regulated firm's cost of common-stock equity capital;
K

d

 is the incremental (i.e., current) cost of debt; and
RP is the risk premium.



To illustrate the RP model, assume that the incremental cost of debt is 7 percent, and the risk premium is 5 percent.
The regulated company's cost of common-stock equity capital is:



K

e

=07+.05


=.12 or 12 percent.

i. Practical Issues 


(a) Risk Premium. There are several procedures for estimating the risk premium. One common approach is to use the historical
arithmetic average return differential between rates of return actually earned on investments in common-stock
equities and bonds. This approach is expressed mathematically as follows: 




K

e

=K

d

+Historical bond-equity spread




The historical bond-equity spread, in turn, is often based on the data series published annually in the SBBI Yearbook.
The portfolio of common stocks used as the benchmark for estimating the risk premium should be one that is composed
of a broad array of firms and is well diversified, in order to minimize the potential for it to be contaminated by the
peculiarities of a particular group of common stocks. The SBBI Yearbook database is based upon the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index, which meets these criteria. The range of companies in such a broad group as the Standard & Poor's
500 Index covers the broad dimensions of investor perceptions of the trade-off between risk and return, and serves
as a benchmark for investor-required returns. The Commission's proposed rule stipulates the use of the historical
bond-equity spread based on the data published in the SBBI Yearbook. 
Risk premiums based on the historical differential can be extremely volatile and may fluctuate as macroeconomic
and microeconomic conditions change. The time period over which the risk premium is selected should, therefore,
be sufficiently long that short-term aberrations are smoothed out. Such a time period must encompass at least several
business and interest rate cycles. The Commission's proposed rule requires the use of the entire data series (1926-present)
published annually in the SBBI Yearbook in estimating the risk premium. 
(b) Debt Security. The particular debt security used to implement the RP model should be one which is, at least in theory,
risk-free and embodies a premium for inflation similar in magnitude to that reflected in common stocks. Satisfying
these criteria would isolate the spread component of the return and obviate the need to make any type of adjustment
to the debt yield to account for default risk, which can vary over time, and obscure the long-term relationship between
returns on common stocks and debt. These criteria are the same as those identified for selecting a debt security to
measure the risk-free rate in implementing the CAPM. 
Accordingly, the Commission's proposed rule stipulates the use of the six-month average five-year Treasury Note
yield in implementing the RP model, for the reasons identified for selecting this same yield as the risk-free rate
in implementing the CAPM. 
(c) Risk Adjustment. The risk premium estimate derived from a composite market index is sometimes adjusted if there
are differences in the risk of the firms represented in the common-stock equity index and that of the regulated firm
under consideration. The CAPM (which is actually the company-specific form of the general RP model), for example,
adjusts for such risk differences by multiplying the risk premium by ``beta,'' which serves as the measure of relative
risk in the CAPM model. The Commission's proposed rule specifies that the RP model be used in its general form without
making any adjustment for risk, because the generic form provides a useful benchmark for the range of companies contained
in the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index on which it is based and, therefore, measures the broad dimensions of investor
perceptions of the trade-off between risk and return. The cost of capital estimate produced using the RP model is not
to be used as the estimate, but instead is to be used as a check on, and in combination with, the cost of capital company-specific
estimates produced using the DCF and CAPM models. 
d. Market-to-Book Ratio Method. The MBR method is based on the notion that the market value of a regulated firm's common-stock
equity should be equal to its book value (plus some allowance for underpricing), and will be so if the firm's allowable
rate of return on common-stock equity capital is equal to the firm's cost of common-stock equity capital. The MBR approach
is considered solid conceptually, but is criticized widely for being impractical or even impossible to implement.
In order to apply the MBR, a regulator must be able to accurately predict the effect that its rate order will have on the
common stock price of a regulated firm in attempting to maintain the equality between the market value and book value
of the firm's common stock. Critics argue that regulators are unable to produce such accurate forecasts even when
sophisticated econometric models are used. In addition, a regulator may influence, but cannot control completely,
the market price of the regulated firm's stock. Even if it could, the exercise of such control would produce violent
swings in rate levels which would be uneconomical to both the ratepayer and the regulated firm alike. Finally, diversification
by the regulated firm into unregulated activities could result in a market price that differs from book value, although
the earnings of the regulated segment are restrained.

The severe practical problems involved with implementing the MBR method of computing an allowable rate of return
on common-stock equity capital sharply reduces the utility of the approach. Accordingly, the Commission does not
propose the MBR method of computing an allowable rate of return on common-stock equity capital. 
e. Comparable Earnings Method. The CE method is based upon the fundamental economic concept of opportunity cost.
This concept states that the cost of using any resource (

i.e.

, land, labor, or capital) in a particular activity is what that resource could have earned in its next best alternative
use. Thus, the opportunity cost of an investment in a regulated firm's common stock is what the invested funds could
have earned in their next best alternative investment (

e.g.

, in another company's common stock, in a government or corporate bond, in real estate, in gold, etc.). In brief, the
CE method infers a regulated company's cost of common-stock equity capital from the average (sometimes the adjusted
average) book value rate of return on common-stock equity of a group of firms comparable in risk to the regulated company.

As already discussed above, the CE method is not thought to be well grounded in economic theory, primarily because
the method is implemented using accounting data rather than market information, and does not accurately reflect
the regulated carrier's cost of common-stock equity capital. Accordingly, the proposed rule does not specify the
CE method for computing the regulated firm's cost of common-stock equity capital. 
f. Final Cost of Common-Stock Equity Capital Estimate. Rather than choosing between the DCF, CAPM, and RP methods,
the Commission believes that all three methods should be used to produce separate estimates in arriving at a final
estimate of a regulated carrier's cost of common-stock equity capital, in order to avoid any inappropriate judgments
that could be embodied in any one of the individual estimates. Accordingly, the proposed rule states that the Commission
shall consider the cost of common-stock equity capital estimates obtained using the DCF, CAPM, and RP methods in arriving
at a final cost of common-stock equity capital estimate. 


C. Other Cost of Capital Issues 


1. 

Comparable-Risk Companies

. a. Comparable-Risk Cost of Common-Stock Equity Capital Estimates. When a regulated firm finances assets with common-stock
equity that does not trade publicly, it is necessary to use a surrogate to impute the firm's cost of common-stock equity
capital. The cost must be imputed because the regulated firm's equity position is not explicitly recognized in the
capital market and, consequently, the necessary data for directly estimating the regulated firm's cost of common-stock
equity do not exist. This occurs when: (1) The regulated firm is an independent company (

i.e.

, one which has no corporate parent) which issues no publicly traded common-stock equity, or (2) the regulated firm
is a subsidiary of a parent company, and the subsidiary issues no publicly traded common stock of its own. 
In the case of the independent regulated company which issues no publicly-traded common stock, the cost of common-stock
equity capital must be imputed from a sample of firms having risk similar to that of the regulated company. Once an appropriate
sample is selected, the cost of common-stock equity capital is calculated using the methods described earlier (

i.e.

, DCF, CAPM, and RP) to produce a range of estimates for the independent regulated company. In the case of the regulated
subsidiary, as discussed above, it may be appropriate to use the consolidated system's capital structure and component
costs to estimate the subsidiary's WACC. If so, the consolidated system's cost of common-stock equity is obtained
by applying the DCF, CAPM, and RP methods directly to the parent company, provided that the parent issues publicly-traded
common-stock equity so that the stock market price data required for such an application exist. Otherwise, the regulated
subsidiary's capital structure and component costs are used, and it is necessary to impute the subsidiary's cost
of common-stock equity from a sample of firms having risk similar to that of the subsidiary. 
b. Selecting a Proxy Group. The proxy group must be composed of companies whose business and financial risks are substantially
comparable to the risk of the regulated firm. Since no two companies are identical in risk characteristics, and because
a company's risk profile may not be perfectly stable over time, at least several companies must be chosen to maximize
the reliability of the estimated cost of common-stock equity capital computed for the regulated company. 
The criteria for selecting the proxy companies should evaluate the comparability of each company's business risk
and financial risk with those of the regulated firm. Comparability with regard to business risk is most readily and
directly accomplished by selecting companies in the same line of business as the regulated firm. The comparability
of financial risk can be established by analyzing various financial statistics and investment quality ratings which
are commonly used as measures of risk by investors. The Commission's proposed rule sets forth a set of risk criteria
for selecting proxy companies.

The proposed rule further directs carriers that must rely on proxy companies to impute their cost of common-stock
equity capital to use the prescribed risk criteria in selecting proxy companies, and to annually submit their selection
of proxy companies along with their annually filed statement of financial and operating data, as required in  552.2.
After notice and opportunity for comment, the Commission shall annually designate the respective proxy group of
companies for each applicable carrier in accordance with its prescribed risk criteria. The sequence of steps for
selecting the proxy companies and the prescribed risk criteria are discussed in detail below. 



i. Risk Criteria 



(a) Step 1: U.S. Companies Listed in Value Line. The Commission's proposed rule stipulates that the proxy companies
must be U.S.-based, and must be those for which 

The Value Line Investment Survey (``Value Line'')

 provides financial data. The proxy companies are to be based in the U.S. so as to maintain consistent accounting and
tax requirements. 

Value Line 

contains financial information on 1,700 companies that publicly issue common stock for over 95 industries, including
the transportation sector. The use of 

Value Line 

as a resource for selecting proxy companies is particularly suitable since it contains the requisite historical
and projected financial data for estimating the cost of common-stock equity. 


(b) Step 2: Companies that Operate as Common Carriers. Consistent with the concept of selecting firms of comparable
business risk, the proxy companies should be those which are in the same line of business as the regulated firm. The
proxy companies should operate and derive a major portion of their gross revenues primarily as common carriers in
the business of freight transportation. The proxy group, for example, could be comprised of common carriers that
transport freight by air, truck, water, and/or rail. The companies should also own or operate transportation vehicles
or vessels. Excluded from this group are companies with gross revenues equal to or less than the $25,000,000 waiver
level for vessel operating common carriers in the domestic offshore trades, as described in 46 CFR  552.2(e).


(c) Step 3: Financial Analysis of Comparable Risk. 
The proposed rule further states that the Commission may also consider a company's financial strength in evaluating
the degree of financial risk faced by each of the selected companies. This may include an examination of some, but not
necessarily all, of the factors listed below. 


(i) Total Capitalization Ratios and/or Debt/Equity Ratios. 
Total capitalization ratios and debt/equity ratios measure the proportional mix of financing in a company's capital
structure. They are useful measures of financial risk because they indicate the extent of leverage or fixed-cost
financing in a company (

i.e.,

 the degree to which the company's assets are financed by long-term debt and/or preferred stock). A low percentage
of fixed-cost financing generally denotes a low level of financial risk. 


(ii) Debt Ratings. 
Investment analysis services, such as Standard & Poor's and Moody's, provide investment quality ratings of
companies' long-term debt instruments. These include ratings on corporate bonds and commercial paper. The ratings
reflect a company's risk of default on debt obligations and the possible risk of bankruptcy. The primary basis of the
debt ratings is interest coverage. This represents the number of times a company's earnings are greater than its fixed
contractual charges or interest costs. 

(iii) Stock Safety Rankings. 
Both Value Line and Standard & Poor's provide common-stock equity rankings for each company listed in their respective
publications. While the basis of their ranking systems differ, they both measure the degree of risk associated with
each company's common-stock equity. Value Line bases its ranking system on the stability of the common stock's price
adjusted for trends, as measured by the standard deviation of weekly percent changes in the stock's market prices
over a five-year period, and partially on the subjective analysis of its financial experts. Value Line's safety scale
ranges from 1, the highest, to 5. 

(iv) Financial Strength Ratings. 
Value Line rates the financial strength of each of the 1,700 companies listed in its publication relative to all the
others. The ratings are based on key variables that determine financial leverage, business risk, and company size.

The ratings range from A++, the highest, to C. 

(v) Standard Deviation. 
The standard deviation is a common statistical measure which can be used to determine the variability of a company's
common-stock price changes, or returns on common-stock equity. A high standard deviation indicates a high variability
in the range of price changes or returns relative to the average price change or return. Thus, a high standard deviation
implies a greater degree of risk associated with a particular company's common stock. Value Line provides a price
stability index which ranks the standard deviation of the weekly percentage changes in the market price of each company's
common stock over a five-year period. 

(vi) The Beta Coefficient. 
Beta is a regression coefficient that measures the volatility of a company's common-stock price changes, or returns
on common-stock equity, relative to the stock market as a whole. Where beta for the stock market equals one, common
stocks with beta values of less than one are said to be less risky than the market, while stocks with beta values greater
than one are said to be riskier than the market. Value Line and Standard & Poor's provide the beta values associated
with the common stock of each company listed in their respective publications. 

The Commission may also consider other information commonly accepted by investors as measures of risk in a company.
In this regard, commenters may wish to address whether an accurate measure of comparable risk should include some
consideration of the regulated firm's status as a subsidiary of a larger organization and, if so, whether the criteria
for inclusion in the proxy group should include position in a larger corporate structure.

2. The Before-Tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital. The WACC was defined above as the composite of the cost of the various
classes of capital used by the regulated firm weighted on the basis of the proportions of the total which each class
represents. Corporate taxes were excluded. In reality, a regulated firm typically does pay taxes, and the WACC must
be adjusted accordingly in arriving at a final allowable rate of return. The use of the WACC to determine an allowable
rate of return without making such an adjustment would result in an understatement of the total cost of servicing capital
to ratepayers. Assuming a 40 percent corporate income tax rate, for example, a company requires only $1.00 of revenue
to provide a $1.00 return to bondholders because interest payments are tax deductible for corporate income tax purposes.
The same company requires $1.67 of revenue, however, to provide a $1.00 return to preferred stock and common-stock
equity shareholders because the firm must pay corporate income taxes, and dividend payments to such shareholders
are not tax deductible. 
The following before-tax expression of the WACC (``BTWACC'') recognizes explicitly the existence of income taxes
and is, therefore, the appropriate formula to use in computing an allowable rate of return: 








where: 




K

d

 is the regulated firm's cost of long-term debt capital; 
K

p

 is the regulated firm's cost of preferred stock capital; 
K

e

 is the regulated firm's cost of common-stock equity capital; 
D is the value of the regulated firm's long-term debt outstanding; 
P is the value of the regulated firm's preferred stock outstanding; 
E is the value of the regulated firm's common-stock equity outstanding; and 
T is the corporate income tax rate. 



To illustrate the calculation of the BTWACC, consider a hypothetical regulated company that has total invested capital
of $100 million, consisting of $25 million of long-term debt, $15 million of preferred stock, and $60 million of common-stock
equity. Assume that the firm's cost of long-term debt is 7 percent, cost of preferred stock is 9 percent and cost of common-stock
equity is 12 percent, and that the corporate income tax rate is 40 percent. The BTWACC for this firm is calculated as
follows: 







The allowable rate of return for this hypothetical company should, therefore, be set at 16.02 percent, which would
provide the firm with the opportunity to earn revenues sufficient to service the total cost of capital and taxes.

The Commission's proposed rule specifies that the allowable rate of return on rate base for a regulated carrier in
the domestic offshore trades shall be set equal to the carrier's WACC calculated on a before-tax basis. The proposed
rule also stipulates the use of the regulated carrier's normalized corporate income tax rate (

i.e.

, the statutory corporate income tax rate, not the actual or effective corporate income tax rate) in computing the
BTWACC. This is consistent with the approach the Commission uses currently in calculating the rate of return on rate
base. Furthermore, the large majority of regulatory commissions in the U.S. use the normalized income tax rate for
ratemaking and accounting purposes.

38

 




3. Flotation Costs. Three factors could theoretically result in a firm receiving as net proceeds from the issuance
of common stock an amount less than the pre-announcement common stock price: (1) The cost of floating new issues (

e.g.

, the fee paid to the underwriter) and other administrative expenses (

e.g.

, printing, legal, and accounting expenses); (2) the downward market pressure resulting from the increased supply
of the common stock (

i.e.

, the ``market pressure'' effect); and (3) the potential market price decline related to external market variables
(

i.e.

, the ``market break'' effect). 
The Commission's proposed rule specifies that an allowance for the cost of common-stock equity capital financing
be made for those flotation costs that are actually incurred (

i.e.

, those that are identifiable and directly attributable to underwriting, printing, legal, and accounting expenses),
but only in the event that the regulated carrier under consideration plans on issuing new common stock to the general
public during the test year in question. 
No allowance would be made for any hypothetical costs such as those associated with market pressure and market break
effects. The proposed rule also specifies that the allowance is to be applied solely to the new common-stock equity
and not to the existing common-stock equity balance.

39

 The regulated carrier would be required to supply the requisite information for computing the allowance. 




Deferred Taxes and The Capital Construction Fund 


Under its current rules, the Commission does not address the issue of deferred taxes for calculating rate base. The
Commission proposes to amend its rules to provide for the treatment of deferred taxes, including the Capital Construction
Fund (``Fund''). 
The Fund is comprised of three components: (1) The capital account, which results from contributions, (2) capital
gains on investment transactions, and (3) ordinary income, representing the earnings of Fund assets. Section 607
of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, 46 U.S.C. app.  1177, which governs the Fund, provides for different tax treatment
for withdrawals from the various components of the Fund. Section 607 requires that the basis of vessels, barges or
containers purchased with monies from the Fund be reduced by the amount of funds withdrawn from the ordinary income
and capital gains components of the Fund. The proposed rule takes a similar approach, and would require carriers to
reduce the cost of an asset as shown in rate base by the amount of funds withdrawn from the ordinary income and capital
gains components of the Fund which are used in acquiring the asset. 



A certain portion of a carrier's physical capital (rate base) is financed by deferred taxes. Unlike the debt, preferred
stock, and common-stock equity components of financial capital, deferred taxes cost the carrier nothing. Deferred
taxes are in the nature of an interest-free loan from the government. Given that these funds are obtained at zero cost,
we believe that the carrier should not be allowed a return on that portion of rate base which results from deferred taxes,
except on that portion that results from deferred taxes that may arise from the Fund or the expired Investment Tax Credit,
and that rate base be reduced accordingly. 
This treatment comports with the treatment of deferred taxes by other federal agencies, as well as a majority of state
regulatory agencies.

40

 When it is necessary to allocate such accumulated deferred taxes between Commission and non-Commission regulated
activities, such allocation shall be on the ratio of vessels and other property and equipment included in rate base,
less accumulated depreciation, to total company vessels and other property and equipment, less accumulated depreciation.





Working Capital 


The inclusion of working capital in rate base is intended to recognize the necessity for the carrier to maintain an
adequate supply of cash for the purpose of meeting expenditure requirements during the period between the payment
of expenses and the collection of revenue. Average voyage expense is used as the measure of working capital for a self-propelled
vessel operator under the Commission's existing rule. 
With regard to the treatment of insurance expense in the computation of average voyage expense, the Commission's
current regulations provide for the inclusion of 90 days' hull and machinery insurance and protection and indemnity
insurance. Hawaii suggests that insurance expense be treated in the same manner as other operating expenses, 

i.e., 

include that amount applicable to the duration of an average voyage. The proposed rule adopts that approach. 


Allocation of Assets and Expenses 


In 1980, the Commission amended its rules governing the allocation of assets and expenses. As a result of these changes,
cargo cube or space occupied replaced weight or revenue ton as the basis for allocations. The rationale for this decision
was that in a containership operation, the cost of providing service is the cost of providing space. The Commission
concluded that the carrier's cost per container remains the same regardless of the amount of cargo in the container
or revenue generated by the container. 
Accordingly, part 552 currently prescribes that vessels, accumulated depreciation and vessel expense shall be
allocated on the cargo-cube-mile relationship as defined in 46 CFR 552.5(n), while those expenses related to cargo
handling are allocated on the basis of cargo cube loaded and discharged. Other property and equipment, and administrative
and general expenses are required to be allocated on the voyage expense relationship, as defined in 46 CFR 552.5(p).

Commenters in Docket No. 91-51 suggested several alternative allocation methods, including a method based
on cargo carried on the outbound portion of the voyage or based on revenue generated by Commission and non-Commission
regulated cargo. These proposals stemmed from the bifurcation of regulatory authority in the domestic offshore
trades between the Commission and the Interstate Commerce Commission. However, that split in jurisdiction has no
direct connection with the costs a carrier incurs in providing service. The Commission shall not attempt to contrive
an allocation methodology as a solution to an issue that can best be remedied by legislative action. 

The Federal Maritime Commission certifies pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C.
605(n), that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, including
small businesses, small organizational units and small government jurisdictions. The Commission grants a waiver
of the detailed reporting requirements to carriers which earn gross revenues of $25 million or less in a particular
trade in accordance with 46 CFR 552.2(e).

The collection of information requirements contained in this proposed rule have been submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget for review under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511), as amended.
The incremental public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to range from an average
of 41 hours to 65 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources,
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments
regarding this burden estimate, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Sandra L. Kusumoto, Director,
Bureau of Administration, Federal Maritime Commission, Washington, DC 20573 and to the Office of Information and
Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.

 Each cargo vessel (excluding vessels chartered under leases which are not capitalized in accordance with  552.6(b)(10))
employed in the Service for which a statement is filed shall be listed by name, showing the original cost to the carrier
or to any related company, reduced to reflect the use of funds from the Capital Construction Fund's capital gains account
or ordinary income account, 

plus

 the cost of improvements, conversions, and alterations, reduced to reflect the use of funds from the Capital Construction
Fund's capital gains account or ordinary income account, less the cost of any deductions. All additions and deductions
made during the period shall be shown on a pro rata basis, reflecting the number of days they were applicable during
the period. The result of these computations shall be called the Adjusted Cost.

Investment in other property and equipment; accumulated depreciation other property and equipment (Schedule A-IV
and A-IV(A)). 

(i) Actual investment, representing original cost to the carrier or to any related company, reduced to reflect the
use of funds from the Capital Construction Fund's capital gains account or ordinary income account, in other fixed
assets employed in the Service, shall be reported as of the beginning of the year. Accumulated depreciation for these
assets shall be reported both as of the beginning and as of the end of the year. The arithmetic average of the two amounts
shall also be shown and shall be the amount deducted from original cost in determining rate base. The cost of additions
and deductions during the period, adjusted to reflect the use of the Capital Construction Fund, shall also be reported.
The carrier shall report as though all such changes took place at midyear, except those involving substantial sums,
which shall be prorated on a daily basis. Allocation to the Trade shall be based upon the actual use of the specific asset
or group of assets within the Trade. For those assets employed in a general capacity, such as office furniture and fixtures,
the voyage expense relationship shall be employed for allocation purposes. The basis of allocation to the Trade shall
be set forth and fully explained. 
(ii) * * * 
(5) 

Working Capital (Schedule A-V). 

Working capital for vessel operators shall be determined as average voyage expense. Average voyage expense shall
be calculated on the basis of the actual expenses of operating and maintaining the vessel(s) employed in the Service
(excluding lay-up expenses) during the average length of time of all voyages (excluding lay-up periods) during the
period in which any cargo was carried in the Trade. Expenses for operating and maintaining vessels employed in the
Trade shall include: Vessel Operating Expense, Vessel Port Call Expense, Cargo Handling Expense, Administrative
and General Expense and Interest Expense allocated to the Trade as provided in paragraphs (c) (2), (4) and (5) of this
section.

 (10) 

Accumulated Deferred Taxes (Schedules A-VIII and A-VIII(A)). 

Accumulated deferred taxes, excluding deferred taxes that may arise from the Capital Construction Fund or the expired
Investment Tax Credit, shall be reported both as of the beginning and the end of the year and the arithmetic average
of the two amounts shall be shown. Allocation to the Trade shall be based upon the ratio of Trade Investment in Vessels
(Schedules A-I and A-I(A)) less Accumulated Depreciation (Schedules A-II and A-II(A)) plus
Other Property and Equipment less Accumulated Depreciation (Schedules A-IV and A-IV(A)) to total company
investment in vessels and other property and equipment less accumulated depreciation. 
(c) * * *

(5) 

Interest expense and debt payments (Schedules B-IV and B-IV(A)). 

This schedule shall set forth the total interest and debt payments, apportioned between principal and interest,
short and long-term, on debt and lease obligations. Payments on long-term debt are to be calculated consistent with
the method set forth in  552.6(e)(7) for computing the cost of long-term debt capital. Principal and interest
shall be allocated to the Trade in the ratio that Trade rate base less working capital bears to company-wide assets
less current assets. Where related company assets are employed by the filing company, the balance sheet figures on
the related company's books for such assets shall be added to the company-wide total in computing the ratio. In those
instances where interest expenses are capitalized in accordance with paragraph (b)(9) of this section, a deduction
shall be made for the amount so capitalized. 


* * * * * 


(10) 

Provision for income tax. 

Federal, State, and other income taxes shall be listed separately. If the company is organized outside the United
States, it shall indicate the entity to which it pays income taxes and the rate of tax applicable to its taxable income
for the subject year. Federal, State and other income taxes shall be calculated at the statutory rate. Such tax rates
are to be identical to those set forth in Schedules F-VI or F-VI(A) used in determining the carrier's allowable
rate of return unless the carrier is a subsidiary of a parent company and a consolidated capital structure is to be used
in that determination. 


* * * * * 


(d) 

Rate of Return (Exhibits C and C(A))_

(1) 

General. 

All carriers are required to calculate rate of return on rate base. However, the Commission or individual carriers,
at the Commission's discretion, may also employ fixed charges coverage and/or operating ratios as provided for in
paragraph (f) of this section. 
(2) 

Return on rate base. 

The return on rate base will be computed by dividing Trade net income plus interest expense by Trade rate base. 
(e) 

Maximum allowable rate of return on rate base (Exhibits F and F(A))_

(1) 

General. 

A carrier's maximum allowable rate of return on rate base shall be set equal to the carrier's weighted average cost
of capital calculated on a before-tax basis (``BTWACC''). The BTWACC is defined mathematically by the following
expression: 








where:



K

d

 is the carrier's cost of long-term debt capital; 
K

p

 is the carrier's cost of preferred (and preference) stock capital; 
K

e

 is the carrier's cost of common-stock equity capital; 
D is the average book value of the carrier's long-term debt capital outstanding; 
P is the average book value of the carrier's preferred (and preference) stock capital outstanding; 
E is the average book value of the carrier's common-stock equity capital (par value plus earned and capital surplus)
outstanding; and 
T is the carrier's composite statutory corporate income tax rate.

A carrier's BTWACC shall be calculated in precise accordance with the rules set 
forth in this section. 
(2) 

Subsidiary carrier's capital structure. 

Where a carrier is a subsidiary that obtains its common-stock equity capital through a parent company, the capital
structure of the subsidiary shall be used in computing the BTWACC. The subsidiary carrier's cost of common-stock
equity capital, the subsidiary carrier's cost of long-term debt capital, the subsidiary carrier's cost of preferred
stock capital, and the subsidiary carrier's composite statutory corporate income tax rate shall also be used in computing
the BTWACC. The subsidiary carrier's cost of common-stock equity capital shall be inferred as the cost of common-stock
equity capital estimated for a sample of firms having business and financial risk comparable to the subsidiary carrier
when the subsidiary carrier's capital structure is used in calculating the BTWACC. 
(3) 

Comparable risk companies. 

(i) Concurrently with the filing of the annual financial statements required under  552.2, a carrier must submit
for Commission approval a proxy group of companies to impute the carrier's cost of common-stock equity capital where:

(A) The carrier is an independent company (i.e., it has no corporate parent) which issues no publicly-traded common-stock
equity, or 
(B) The carrier is a subsidiary that obtains its common-stock equity capital through a parent company. 
(ii) After notice and opportunity for comment, the Commission will approve a proxy group of companies based on the
following criteria: 
(A) The proxy companies shall be based in the United States and shall be listed in The Value Line Investment Survey.

(B) The proxy companies shall operate and derive a major portion of their gross revenues primarily as common carriers
in the business of freight transportation, and shall own or operate transportation vehicles or vessels. Companies
with gross annual revenues equal to or less than the $25,000,000 shall be excluded from the proxy group. 
(C) In addition, comparable risk companies shall be selected by examining some, but not necessarily all, of the following
risk indicators: 


(1) 

A company's total capitalization ratio and/or debt-to-equity ratio; 


(2) 

The investment quality ratings of a company's long-term debt instruments; 


(3) 

The investment safety ranking of a company's common-stock equity;

(4)

 The rating of a company's financial strength, as provided by Value Line; 



(5)

 The variability of a company's common-stock price changes or returns on common-stock equity (

i.e.,

 the standard deviation); 



(6)

 The volatility of a company's common-stock price changes or returns on common-stock equity relative to the stock
market as a whole (

i.e.,

 the beta coefficient); or 



(7)

 Other such valid indicators deemed appropriate by the Commission. 

(iii) Any proxy group of companies that has received Commission approval will not be subject to challenge in a subsequent
rate investigation brought under section (3) of the Intercoastal Act, 1933. 

(4) 

Consolidated capital structure. 

(i) Upon application, after notice and opportunity for comment, the Commission may authorize use of the capital structure
of the consolidated system (

i.e.,

 the parent company and all of its subsidiaries) in computing the BTWACC. The application must show that: 

(A) The subsidiary carrier's parent company issues publicly traded common-stock equity; 

(B) The subsidiary carrier's parent company owns 90 percent or more of the subsidiary's voting shares of stock; and


(C) The business and the financial risks of the subsidiary carrier and the parent company are similar. 

(ii) The similarity of the parent company's and subsidiary carrier's business risk shall be evaluated by examining
the degree to which the consolidated system's profits, revenues, and expenses are composed of those of the subsidiary
carrier, and the extent to which the parent's holdings are diversified into lines of business unrelated to those of
the subsidiary carrier, and/or other indicators of business risk deemed appropriate by the Commission. The similarity
of the parent company's and subsidiary carrier's financial risk shall be evaluated by examining the consolidated
system's and the subsidiary's total capitalization ratios, debt-to-equity ratios, investment quality rankings
on short- and long-term debt instruments, times-interest-earned ratios, fixed charges coverage ratios (calculated
to include both FMC and non-FMC regulated operations), and/or other measures of financial risk deemed appropriate
by the Commission. 

(iii) When the consolidated capital structure is used, the consolidated system's cost of common-stock equity capital
(issued by the parent company), the consolidated system's cost of long-term debt capital, the consolidated system's
cost of preferred (and preference) stock capital, and the consolidated system's composite statutory corporate
income tax rate shall also be used in estimating the subsidiary's BTWACC. 

(iv) Where the Commission has approved the use of a consolidated capital structure, such use will not be subject to
challenge in a subsequent rate investigation brought under section (3) of the Intercoastal Act, 1933. 

(5) 

Book-value, average capitalization ratios.

 Capitalization ratios representing the capital structure used in deriving a carrier's BTWACC shall be computed
on the basis of average projected book value outstanding over the 12-month period used to calculate projected midyear
rate base in  552.2 (f)(1)(ii). The average amount of any class of capital outstanding used in determining the
capitalization ratios is computed by adding the amount of a particular type of capital expected to be outstanding
as of the beginning of the 12-month period to the amount of that same type of capital expected to be outstanding as of
the end of the 12-month period, and dividing the sum of the two amounts outstanding by two. 

(6) 

Capitalization amounts and ratios (Schedules F-I and F-I(A)). 

A carrier shall show its long-term debt, preferred stock, and common-stock equity capitalization amounts outstanding,
stated in book value terms, as of the beginning and as of the end of the 12-month period used to calculate projected midyear
rate base, and the average amounts and average ratios for that 12-month period. Where a carrier is a subsidiary of a
parent company, the carrier shall show its own capitalization amounts and ratios unless the carrier applies for and
receives permission from the Commission to use a consolidated capital structure in computing the BTWACC. Where such
permission is granted, the carrier shall show instead the consolidated system's capitalization amounts and ratios.


(7) 

Cost of long-term debt capital (Schedules F-II, F-II(A), F-III, and F-III(A)). 

(i) The cost of long-term debt capital

1

 shall be calculated by the carrier for the 12-month period used to compute projected mid-year rate base on the basis
of: 





(A) Embedded cost for existing long-term debt; and 

(B) Current cost for any new long-term debt expected to be issued on or before the final day of the 12-month period. 

(ii) The arithmetic average annual percentage rate cost of long-term debt capital calculated on the basis of all issues
of long-term debt expected to be outstanding as of the beginning and as of the end of the 12-month period used to compute
projected mid-year rate base shall be the cost of long-term debt capital used in computing the BTWACC. 

(iii) The annual percentage rate cost of long-term debt capital for all issues of long-term debt expected to be outstanding
as of the beginning and as of the end of the 12-month period used to compute projected mid-year rate base shall be calculated
separately for the two dates by: 

(A) Multiplying the cost of money for each issue under paragraph (e)(7)(v)(A)(

10

) of this section by the principal amount outstanding for each issue, which yields the annual dollar cost for each issue;
and 

(B) Adding the annual dollar cost of each issue to obtain the total dollar cost for all issues, which is divided by the
total principal amount outstanding for all issues to obtain the annual percentage rate cost of long-term debt capital
for all issues. 

(iv) The arithmetic average annual percentage rate cost of long-term debt capital for all issues to be used as the cost
of long-term debt capital in computing the BTWACC shall be calculated by: 

(A) Adding the total annual dollar cost for all issues of long-term debt capital expected to be outstanding as of the
beginning of the 12-month period used to compute projected mid-year rate base to the total annual dollar cost for all
issues of long-term debt capital expected to be outstanding as of the end of the 12-month period, and dividing the resulting
sum by two, which yields the average total annual dollar cost of long-term debt for all issues for the 12-month period;

(B) Adding the total principal amount outstanding for all long-term debt issues expected to be outstanding as of the
beginning of the 12-month period used to compute projected mid-year rate base to the total principal amount outstanding
for all long-term debt issues expected to be outstanding as of the end of the 12-month period, and dividing the resulting
sum by two, which yields the average total principal amount expected to be outstanding for all issues for the 12-month
period; and 

(C) Dividing the average total annual dollar cost of long term debt for all issues for the 12-month period by the average
total principal amount expected to be outstanding for all issues for the 12-month period, which yields the average
annual percentage rate cost of long-term debt capital for all issues to be used in computing the BTWACC. 

(v)(A)

The carrier shall calculate the annual percentage rate cost of long-term debt capital for all issues of long-term
debt expected to be outstanding as of the beginning and as of the end of the 12-month period used to compute projected
mid-year rate base separately for the two dates, and shall also calculate the average annual percentage rate cost
of long-term debt for all issues for the 12-month period. The carrier shall support these calculations by showing
in tabular form the following for each class and series of long-term debt expected to be outstanding as of the beginning
and as of the end of the 12-month period separately for the two dates:

the coupon rate, term of issue, and net proceeds ratio determined by reference to any generally accepted table of bond
yields; and, for long-term debt issues to be newly issued on or before the final day of the 12-month period, shall be
based on the average current yield (published in such a publication as Moody's Bond Survey) on long-term debt instruments
similar in maturity and investment quality as the long-term debt security that is to be issued; 

(

11

) Principal amount outstanding (%); 

(

12

) Annual cost ($); and 

(

13

) Name and relationship of issuer to carrier. 

(B) Where a carrier is a subsidiary of a parent company, the carrier shall show the cost of long-term debt calculations
and information required in this paragraph (e)(7)(v) for its own cost of long-term debt unless the carrier applies
for and receives permission from the Commission to use a consolidated capital structure in computing the BTWACC.
Where such permission is granted, the subsidiary carrier shall show the required cost of long-term debt calculations
and information for the consolidated system's long-term debt. 

(vi) In the event that new long-term debt is to be issued on or before the final day of the 12-month period used to compute
projected mid-year rate base, the carrier shall submit a statement explaining the methods used to estimate information
required under paragraphs (e)(7)(v)(A) (

1

) through (

13

).

Cost of preferred (and preference) stock capital Schedules F-IV, F-IV(A), F-V, and F-V(A)).


(i) The cost of preferred (and preference) stock capital shall be calculated by the carrier for the 12-month period
used to compute projected mid-year rate base on the basis of: 

(A) Embedded cost for existing preferred (and preference stock); and 

(B) Current cost for any new preferred (and preference) stock to be issued on or before the final day of the 12-month
period. 

(ii) The arithmetic average annual percentage rate cost of preferred (and preference) stock capital calculated
on the basis of all issues of preferred (and preference) stock expected to be outstanding as of the beginning and as
of the end of the 12-month period used to calculate projected mid-year rate base shall be the cost of preferred (and
preference) stock capital used in computing the BTWACC. 

(iii) The annual percentage rate cost of preferred (and preference) stock capital for all issues of preferred (and
preference) stock expected to be outstanding as of the beginning and as of the end of the 12-month period used to compute
projected mid-year rate base shall be calculated separately for the two dates by: 

(A) Multiplying the cost of money for each issue under paragraph (e)(8)(v)(A)(

9

) of this section by the par or stated amount outstanding for each issue, which yields the annual dollar cost for each
issue; and 

(B) Adding the annual dollar cost of each issue to obtain the total for all issues, which is divided by the total par or
stated amount outstanding for all issues to obtain the annual percentage rate cost of preferred (and preference)
stock capital for all issues.

be used in computing the BTWACC. 

(v)(A) 

Cost of preferred (and preference) stock capital calculation (Schedules F-IV, F-IV(A), F-V, and
F-V(A)). 

The carrier shall calculate the annual percentage rate cost of preferred (and preference) stock capital for all issues
of preferred (and preference) stock expected to be outstanding as of the beginning and as of the end of the 12-month
period used to compute projected mid-year rate base separately for the two dates, and shall also calculate the average
annual percentage rate cost of preferred (and preference) stock for all issues for the 12-month period. The carrier
shall support these calculations by showing in tabular form the following for each issue of preferred (and preference)
stock as of the beginning and as of the end of the 12-month period separately for the two dates:

(

10

) Par or stated amount outstanding ($); 

(

11

) Annual cost ($); and

(B) Where a carrier is a subsidiary of a parent company, the carrier shall show the cost of preferred (and preference)
stock calculations and information required in this paragraph (e)(8)(v) for its own preferred (and preference)
stock unless the carrier applies for and receives permission from the Commission to use a consolidated capital structure
in computing the BTWACC. Where such permission is granted, the subsidiary carrier shall show the required cost of
preferred (and preference) stock calculations and information for the consolidated system's preferred (and preference)
stock.

period used to compute projected mid-year rate base, the carrier shall submit a statement explaining the methods
used to estimate information required under paragraph (e)(8)(v)(A) (

1

) through (

12

). 

(9) 

Cost of common-stock equity capital. 

A carrier's cost of common-stock equity capital shall be calculated using the Discounted Cash Flow (``DCF''), Capital
Asset Pricing Model (``CAPM''), and Risk Premium (``RP'') methods. A final estimate of that cost shall be derived
from the separate estimates obtained using each of the three methods. 

(10) 

DCF method. 

(i) The DCF model that shall be used in calculating a carrier's cost of common-stock equity is defined algebraically
as follows:









where:

 


K

e

 is the carrier's cost of common-stock equity capital; 

D

0

 is the carrier's current annualized dividend (defined as four times the current quarterly installment) per share;


P

0

 is the current market price per share of the carrier's common stock; and 

g is the constant expected annual rate of growth in the carrier's dividends per share.

 


(ii) 

Current market price per share of common stock. 

The current market price per share of the carrier's common stock used in the DCF model shall be an average of the monthly
high and low market prices during a six-month period commencing not more than nine months prior to the date on which
the proposed rates are filed. 

(iii) 

Estimated growth rate of dividends. 

The estimate of g used in the DCF model shall be an average of three separate estimates obtained using historical growth
rate data, professional investment services' projections, and the sustainable growth rate model.

<PARENT> FR940407-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(iv) 

Historical growth rate estimate of g. 

The historical growth rate estimate of g shall be an average of the carrier's most recent five- and ten-year historical
growth rate averages of dividends per share, earnings per share, and book value per share. 

(v) 

Professional investment services' projections estimate of g. 

The professional investment services' projections estimate of g shall be an average of Value Line's five-year forecasted
growth rate of dividends per share, earnings per share, book value per share, and the Institutional Brokers Estimation
Service's five-year forecasted growth rate in earnings per share for the carrier. 

(vi) 

Sustainable growth rate estimate of g. 

The sustainable growth rate estimate of g shall be obtained by multiplying the proportion of earnings expected to
be retained by the carrier by the expected return on book equity. Value Line's forecasted values for expected retained
earnings and expected return on book equity shall be used in arriving at the sustainable growth rate estimate of g.


(11) 

CAPM. 

(i) The CAPM that shall be used in calculating a carrier's cost of common-stock equity is represented algebraically
as follows:




K

e

 = R

f

 + B(R

m 

^ R

f

)




where:

 


K

e

 is the carrier's cost of common-stock equity capital; 

R

f

 is the expected risk-free rate of return; 

B is the relevant market risk beta of the carrier's common stock; and 

R

m

 is the expected overall stock market return.

 


(ii) 

Expected risk-free rate of return. 

A six-month average of five-year Treasury Note yields computed over a period not more than nine months prior to the
date on which the proposed rates are filed shall be used as the estimate of the expected risk-free rate of return in the
CAPM. 

(iii) 

Expected beta. 

Value Line's most current market risk beta of the carrier's common-stock shall be used as the estimate of the expected
beta in the CAPM. 

(iv) 

Expected overall market return. 

The expected overall return on the stock market shall be estimated by adding the six-month average of five-year Treasury
Note yields used as the estimate of the expected risk-free rate to the arithmetic average difference between the actual
annual returns realized historically by the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index and the five-year Treasury Note.
The arithmetic average differential shall be based on the complete historical series published annually by Ibbotson
Associates in the most recent Stocks, Bonds, Bills and Inflation Yearbook, for the period 1926 through the most recent
date for which the specified data are available. 

(12) 

RP method. 

(i) The RP model that shall be used in calculating a carrier's cost of common-stock equity is defined mathematically
as follows:




K

e

 = K

d

 + RP

 


where: 




K

e

 is the regulated carrier's cost of common-stock equity capital; 

K

d

 is the incremental cost of debt; and RP is the risk premium.




(ii) 

Risk premium. 

The risk premium used in the RP model shall be the historical arithmetic average return differential between rates
of return actually earned on investments in the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index and the five-year Treasury Note.
This risk premium shall be based on the complete historical data series published annually in the Stocks, Bonds, Bills
and Inflation Yearbook, for the period 1926 through the most recent date for which the specified data are available.


(iii) 

Incremental cost of debt. 

A six-month average of five-year Treasury Note yields computed over a period not more than nine months prior to the
date on which the proposed rates are filed shall be the estimate of the incremental cost of debt in the RP model. 

(iv) 

Risk adjustment. 

The RP model shall be used in its generic form and the risk premium specified herein shall not be adjusted for any possible
differences in the risk of the firms represented in the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index and that of the carrier
under consideration. The generic RP model shall be used as a benchmark for the range of companies contained in the Standard
& Poor's 500 Stock Index on which it is based, and, therefore, shall be used to measure the broad dimensions of investor
perceptions of the trade-off between risk and return. 

(13) 

Corporate income tax rate (Schedules F-VI and F-VI(A)). 

The corporate income tax rate used in computing the BTWACC shall be the carrier's composite statutory corporate income
tax rate for the 12-month period used to compute projected midyear rate base. Such rate shall be a composite of the carrier's
Federal and State income tax rates, and of any other income tax rate to be applied to the carrier's income by any other
entity to which the carrier is to pay income taxes. The carrier shall calculate and show its composite statutory corporate
income tax rate as well as its Federal, State, and any other applicable statutory income tax rates separately for the
12-month period used to compute projected midyear rate base. The carrier shall also state the name of any entity other
than the Federal and State governments to which it is to pay taxes. Where a carrier is a subsidiary of a parent company,
the carrier shall show its own statutory corporate income tax rates unless the carrier applies for and receives permission
from the Commission to use a consolidated capital structure in computing the BTWACC. Where such permission is granted,
the carrier shall show instead the consolidated system's statutory corporate income tax rates.

(14) 

Flotation costs (Schedules F-VII and F-VII(A)).

 (i) A carrier's cost of common-stock equity capital shall be adjusted to reflect those costs of floating new issues
that are actually incurred, but only in the event that new common stock is to be issued to the general public during the
12-month period used to compute projected midyear rate base. Those flotation costs for which an allowance shall be
made must be identifiable, and must be directly attributable to underwriting fees, and printing, legal, accounting,
and/or other administrative expenses. No allowance shall be made for any hypothetical costs such as those associated
with market pressure and market break effects. The allowance shall be applied solely to the new common-stock equity
and shall not be applied to the existing common-stock equity balance. The formula that shall be used to compute such
an allowance is as follows:

 


k = Fs/(1+s)




where:

 


k is the required increment to the cost of the carrier's common stock equity capital that will allow the company to recover
its flotation costs; 
F is the flotation costs expressed as a decimal fraction of the dollar value of new common-stock equity sales; and 
s is the new common-stock equity sales expressed as a decimal fraction of the dollar value of existing common-stock
equity capital.

 


(ii) 

Flotation costs data (Schedules F-VII and F-VII(A)).

 (A) In the event that new common-stock equity is to be issued during the 12-month period used to compute projected midyear
rate base, the carrier shall show separately by category the estimated costs of floating the new issues to the extent
that such costs are identifiable and are directly attributable to actual underwriting fees, and to printing, legal,
accounting, and/or other administrative expenses that must be paid by the carrier. The carrier shall submit a statement
explaining the method used in estimating the flotation costs. The carrier shall also show estimates of the date of
issuance; number of shares to be issued; gross proceeds at issuance price; and net proceeds to the carrier. 

(B) Where a carrier is a subsidiary that obtains its common-stock equity capital through a parent company, and the
parent company intends to issue new common-stock equity during the 12-month period, the carrier shall show separately
by category the estimated costs to the parent company of floating the new issues, and estimates of the above items relative
to the parent company's issuance of new common-stock equity, provided that such carrier applies for and receives
permission from the Commission to use a consolidated capital structure in computing the BTWACC.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Amended notice of public hearings, an additional public hearing; request for comments. 



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council) is amending the notice of public hearings on draft Amendment
5 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Stone Crab Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico, by adding an additional public hearing
and expanding the scope of all the hearings to solicit comments on draft Amendment 10 to the Fishery Management Plan
for the Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This notice amends a notice of public hearings that appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on March 31, 1994 (59 FR 15151), by adding an additional public hearing and soliciting public comments at all hearings
on draft Amendment 10 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico. Draft Amendment
10 will include the following management measures: (1) A change in the cutoff date from 
November 19, 1992, to February 7, 1994, to qualify for a fish trap endorsement during the current 3-year trap moratorium.
This change would allow a fish trap endorsement on a reef fish permit, which is required to use fish traps, to be issued
or renewed by NMFS for a current owner of a permitted vessel who has a record of reef fish landings from fish traps in the
Gulf of Mexico exclusive economic zone between 1991 and 1994 as reported on vessel logbooks received by NMFS on or before
February 7, 1994; and (2) establishment of a Council appeals board, the members of which would recommend to the Director,
Southeast Region, NMFS, whether additional endorsements should be issued based on demonstrated financial hardship
related to trap fishing or based on an incapacitating illness between November 19, 1992, and February 7, 1994. All
other information, as contained in the notice of public hearings published March 31, 1994, remains the same.

Financial Assistance and Social Services Programs; Proposed Rule

Financial Assistance and Social Services Programs 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Indian Affairs, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA; Bureau) is proposing to amend the existing Financial Assistance and Social Services
Program regulations to incorporate rules for adult care services and the work experience program. Additionally,
a quality assurance section is being incorporated to enable the BIA to assess the quality of the social services it
provides, measure compliance with regulations and adherence to internal control requirements, and provide specific
guidelines for administering the programs. An amendment is also being incorporated to establish rules on the treatment
of per capita payments when determining eligibility for participation in social services programs.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Experience in program administration and outside audit findings have indicated that regulatory amendments are
needed to define with greater clarity the programs provided under this part. A primary purpose of the amendments is
to provide clear, concise guidelines that will effect a reduction in eligibility error rates. 


Amendments are being made in 25 CFR 20.1, Definitions; 20.2, Purpose; 20.3, Policy; 20.20, General and 20.23 Miscellaneous
Assistance. 
The following new sections are added: 20.15, Reporting requirements for all social services programs; 20.16, Staffing
requirements; 20.26, Adult care assistance program; 20.27, Work experience program; and 20.35, Quality assurance
reviews. 

The policy of the Department of the Interior is, whenever practical, to afford the public an opportunity to participate
in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written comments regarding the proposed
rule to the location identified in the ``addresses'' section of this document. 

The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that these proposed regulations meet the
applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) of Executive Order 12778. BIA has made every effort to ensure that
the proposed rules specify their effect on existing regulations, and provide clear, certain language to promote
burden reduction and avoid litigation.
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive
Order 12866, and therefore will not be reviewed at the Office of Management and Budget. The rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).
In accordance with Executive Order 12630, the Department has determined that the rules do not have ``significant
takings'' implications. The rules do not pertain to ``taking'' of private property interests, nor do they impact
private property. 

The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule does not have significant federalism effects under Executive
Order 12612 and will not interfere with the roles, rights and responsibilities of states. 
The Department of the Interior has determined that this proposed rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment and that no detailed statement is required pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969. 

The information collection requirements contained in 25 CFR 20.4 will be submitted to the Office of Management and
Budget for approval as required by 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The collection of this information will not be required until
it has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget. 
The primary author of this document is David Hickman, Chief, Division of Social Services, Office of Tribal Services.

services to eligible Indians in a manner designed to promote individual self-determination, family unity, economic
and social stability, and the attainment of personal independence and self-reliance. Through the application of

environments in their communities that emphasize safety and well-being for all children; promote family stability;
and value individual independence. 

(b) In administering social services programs, it is also BIA policy to emphasize the importance of individual case

strengthening family relationships, and restoring individuals, families or groups to successful social functioning.
When an ineligible adult is a member of an assistance household, the case plan shall address the spousal, parental
and/or custodial responsibilities of the ineligible person relative to the financial support of the eligible members
of the household. 

(c) Further, it is BIA policy to ensure, insofar as possible, that Indians have full access to available Federal and

secondary resources and are provided only when assistance or services are not available from state, local, or other
primary providers.

(b) The Quarterly Analysis of Funds Report shall include, by category of assistance, data on the number of cases, persons
served, and expenditures per person and per case. The Quarterly Analysis of Funds Report is to be accompanied by a narrative
report on the activities and accomplishments of the program, and on projected deficits, if any are anticipated. This
report is due on the fifteenth of the month following the end of each quarter. 

(c) The Annual Report shall include unduplicated counts of cases, persons, and dollars by category and by each reservation
program. This report is due no later than ninety (90) days following the end of each fiscal year. 

(d) Special reports to Congress are due when requested.

(d) When determining eligibility for programs provided under this part, cash distributed per capita pursuant to
Public Law 97-458, Public Law 98-64 and Public Law 100-241, shall be disregarded to the extent that
such cash does not, in the aggregate, exceed $2000 per individual each year. The $2000 limit is applied separately
each year, and cash distributions which an individual received in a prior year and retained into subsequent years
will not be counted as a resource in those years. 
(e) When determining eligibility for programs provided under this part, income and resources of legally responsible
relatives or individuals shall be considered as available to meet the need of the applicant(s). Legal relationships

Agency Superintendent, the Assistant Secretary may designate near reservation service areas that are adjacent
or contiguous to reservations. Upon approval by the Assistant Secretary, each designated near reservation service
area will be published in the 

Federal Register

 as a locale(s) appropriate for the extension of financial assistance and/or social services. Requests for the designation
of a near reservation service area shall be based on the following general criteria: 
(1) Number of Indian people native to the reservation residing in the area;

In the absence of other resources, burial and disaster assistance shall be provided to eligible Indians meeting the
requirement prescribed in  20.20(a)

county, or local public jurisdiction. Case records shall be documented to reflect need and substantiate all relevant
eligibility factors. 
(a)

Money (IIM) accounts, insurance policies, and cash on hand. 
(2) Requests and applications for burial assistance shall be received from relatives or other persons who have assumed
responsibility for making burial arrangements. In no instance, however, shall an application for burial assistance
be approved after interment of the individual on whose behalf burial assistance is sought. 
(3) Applications made on behalf of a deceased Indian person are subject to eligibility determinations in accordance
with criteria specified at  20.20(a). Prior to final burial arrangements, the caseworker shall evaluate each
case relative to all available resources and income. 
(4) Upon the request of a relative or other responsible party, the actual cost for transporting the body of a deceased
Indian person determined to be eligible and without resources may be provided if the following conditions are met:

(i) No other resources for transportation are available; 
(ii) The death occurred while the decedent was away from the reservation or other approved service area and the absence

(5) In the absence of a locally established state/county rate, the approved payment rate shall be the national maximum
burial payment rate to be established annually by the Assistant Secretary. 
(6) A supplement may be granted when state/county/tribal burial benefits or other resources are available, but are
less than the BIA's established rate. However, the supplement together with the public benefit may not exceed BIA's
national payment rate. 
(7) Upon request, funds to assist with a culturally relevant tribal burial practice may be approved if all other factors
of eligibility are met. The rate of payment for this purpose, together with other burial assistance provided under
this part, shall not exceed the amount established annually by the Assistant Secretary. 
(b) 

Disaster assistance.

 (1) Disaster assistance payments shall be made only for food, shelter, and/or other necessities directly related
to meeting immediate, basic living needs. 
(2) The order of preference for payment standards is the Federal emergency payment standard, locally established
state/county rate, or the rate as determined annually by the Assistant Secretary. Payment shall not exceed the payment
standard. Emergency services and expenditures shall be coordinated with other appropriate disaster committees
or programs and documented. 
(3) The Assistant Secretary may authorize community-wide short term disaster assistance and services for Indians
not eligible for other services under this part. This assistance is to be used in conjunction with other assistance
for which the individual community members qualify and may be authorized only under the following conditions: 
(i) The beneficiaries are Indians residing on a reservation or in a designated near-reservation area; 
(ii) A written request is submitted to the Assistant Secretary by the appropriate tribal governing body or BIA official;
and 
(iii) The assistance is necessary to meet essential needs as defined in  20.1. 



5. Under subpart C_Eligibility Conditions, new   20.26 and 20.27 are added to read as follows. 


 20.26 

Adult care assistance. 


The purpose of the adult care program is to provide non-medical care for eligible adults who need personal care and
supervision due to advanced age, infirmity, physical condition, or mental impairment. Services under this program
can be provided only if they are not available through state, county, local or other Federal programs. Nothing in this
subsection shall be construed to restrict payment of adult care financial assistance pending application and/or
approval for other programs. 
(a) Adult care assistance may be approved when: 
(1) The adult or his/her legally responsible guardian applies for such assistance in writing. 
(2) The adult is unable to meet his/her essential needs, including non-medical care and/or protection, with his/her
own resources. 
(3) There are no other Federal, state, or county public assistance resources, including services provided pursuant
to titles XIX and XX of the Social Security Act, available to meet the required special need. 
(4) The cost of care is not available from his/her immediate family. 
(5) Facts regarding infirmity, and/or the physical or mental condition of the client and his/her need for non-medical
adult care have been documented. 
(b) Adult care assistance may be authorized only if the adult does not require skilled nursing care warranting medical
supervision. 
(c) Payments shall be authorized under purchase of service agreements only for care provided in state or tribally
licensed/certified group settings, or by individual service providers licensed/certified by a tribe or a state.

(d) No adult care payment shall be approved for or on behalf of a client until the eligibility case worker certifies
through documentation that all eligibility factors have been met.

(e) Adult care is to be provided in the setting determined to be the least restrictive (in-home care, adult day care,
foster care, group home, or institutional) for the specific individual adult. If appropriate, and when a qualified
care provider is available, in-home care is preferred. When an institutional or group care setting is in the adult's
best interest, the preferred placement shall be in a facility located as close as possible to his/her home community.


(f) The cost of adult care provided by BIA shall not exceed the applicable state payment rate for similar care. 

(g) When establishing the actual level of payment for an adult's care, the BIA shall: 

(1) Consider all available resources when determining eligibility; and 

(2) Determine the amount of the assistance payment for which the client is eligible based upon the deficit remaining
after all available resources are deducted from the cost of care. 
(h) Redetermination of adult care eligibility and the payment level. 

(1) The BIA shall redetermine financial eligibility and the amount of the BIA payment based upon the deficit between
the cost of care and resources available to the adult in need of care, including other Federal, state, or public assistance
resources. Recipients or their authorized representatives are required to inform the BIA immediately of any changes
in status that may affect eligibility or the amount of assistance. The BIA shall redetermine eligibility whenever
there is an indication of a change in circumstances affecting eligibility, but not less frequently than once every
six months for each recipient. 

(2) The redetermination process shall include personal contact with the recipient in the actual placement setting.
The purposes of the contact are to evaluate changes in the adult's personal circumstances or condition and to assess
the need for continued assistance. 



 20.27 

Work Experience Program (WEP). 



WEP is a program for eligible general assistance recipients. It provides work experience and job skills that will
enhance the recipients' potential for job placement. WEP participation is mandatory for general assistance recipients,
unless they are excepted under 25 CFR 20.21(i). 

(a) 

Work experience and training sites. 

(1) Work experience and training sites offering potential for job placement within a specified period of time shall
be given priority. 

(2) If eventual employment at a work site is not likely, other options for WEP placements that provide opportunity
for the development of relevant skills and good work habits shall be preferred. 

(3) Placement should not exceed a period of 24 months. 

(4) Placements of WEP participants in subsidized employment may be authorized for periods up to six months if the employer
shares in the cost of the participant's wages. Agreements with such employers shall include the amount of wages to
be paid and a provision that the WEP participant will be considered for permanent employment if a vacancy exists. 

(b) 

Payment for work-related expenses. 

(1) A monthly work-related payment not to exceed the amount established and periodically reviewed by the Assistant
Secretary shall be allowed for WEP participation. No advance general assistance grant payments or WEP payments are
authorized. 

(2) Payments to participants shall not be considered as wages, but as grant assistance payments pursuant to provisions
at 25 CFR 20.21. 

(c) 

Participants. 

(1) In situations where the recognized head of the family unit is certified as unemployable, an alternate member of
the assistance group, such as the spouse or another adult, shall be designated as available for WEP participation.


(2) Where there are multiple family units in one household, one member of each family unit shall be eligible to participate
in WEP. 

(d) 

Program. 

(1) The local WEP shall have specific written program procedures that cover hours of work, participation requirements,
acceptable reasons for granting leave from work, evaluation criteria and monitoring plans.

(2) WEP services are administered as part of the general assistance program. The costs of providing WEP services is
included within the total social services program budget. The actual cost of providing WEP services shall not exceed
the following formula: 









(3) Capital equipment, materials, and supplies for projects and tools or other equipment may not be purchased with
grant assistance funds. 

(4) Worker's compensation coverage and liability or other insurance may not be provided with grant assistance funds.




6. A new subpart E_Quality Assurance, consisting of  20.35, is added to read as follows: 



Subpart E_Quality Assurance 



 20.35 

Quality assurance reviews. 



(a) The BIA shall establish and perform quality assurance reviews to assess the provision of quality services through
uniform application of regulations. This will be done by performing regular, periodic reviews to determine the degree
to which regulations are followed and implemented in all areas of operation, and to ensure that internal control processes
comply with OMB Circular A-123. The review shall include operations at Central, Area, and Agency Office levels
to ensure program integrity at all levels. 

(b) 

Schedule. 

Scheduled annual reviews shall be performed at selected locations in each of BIA's areas.

A review schedule and the sampling method shall be distributed annually to each Area Director. 

(c) The quality assessment process shall include procedures for; 

(1) Reviewing program records and conducting on-site evaluations; 

(2) Documenting the findings of compliance or non-compliance with program regulations and OMB Circular A-123
requirements; and 

(3) Tracking corrective action plan(s), or administrative recommendations.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes a revision to the distribution method for Housing Improvement Program (HIP) funds from a housing
inventory basis to documented eligible applicants. A technical correction is also made to eliminate Category C,
Downpayments which is inconsistent with the intent of the HIP. A revision is proposed to eliminate individuals who
own a home acquired under Federal housing assistance from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) through
an Indian Housing Authority from being served under HIP.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Since FY 1986, the BIA has distributed HIP funds using a formula that is based on biennial housing inventories submitted
by individual tribes. The funding calculation formula is based on 90% of the repair need and up to 10% of the new construction
need indicated by the inventories, except for Alaska where the percentages are 95% and 35%. These figures are converted
to dollars, and the dollar amount is divided by the number of years required to complete a work plan. The formula is the
basis for proportional distribution of appropriated funds. The use of percentages based on an assumed HIP responsibility
does not reflect an accurate picture of individuals eligible for HIP assistance. 



For a variety of reasons, many of the housing inventories are not accurate. Accuracy would require a house-by-house
assessment and completion of a housing inventory work sheet describing the condition of each house inventoried to
support the repair or replacement decision. Most tribes do not have sufficient qualified personnel with a construction
background to complete the work sheet accurately. Presently, there is no requirement to determine whether the individual
house is occupied and owned by a person who is eligible for HIP assistance. 

At a meeting in Albuquerque, New Mexico, November 1-5, 1993, the Joint Tribal/DOI/BIA Reorganization Task
Force recommended that HIP be transferred in FY 1995 to the Tribal Priority Allocation (TPA) section of the budget
where program priorities and funding levels are established by individual tribes. They further recommended that
the resource allocation methodology for HIP be revised from housing inventory to documented eligible applicants
to ensure that funding distribution better responds to need. 

The policy of the Department of the Interior is, whenever practical, to afford the public an opportunity to participate
in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written comments regarding the proposed
rule to the location identified in the 

Addresses 

section of this document.

(c) Beginning in FY 1995 HIP funds will be distributed to tribes proportionally based upon the total number of documented
program-eligible applicants submitted by all tribes. Tribes shall make every effort to advertise the opportunity
to apply for housing assistance to all member and non-member Indians residing within the designated service area.
Tribes shall review HIP applications for eligibility in accordance with  256.6 and ensure that appropriate
records and documents to verify eligibility are on file. On or before August 1, 1994, each Tribe shall submit to the
Area Office a list of documented program-eligible applicants that also specifies the category of service to be provided
to each applicant. This list shall be accompanied by the applications and a tribal resolution affirming the accuracy
of the list. The Area housing staff will review the HIP applications and certify that they have done so before submitting
the list of documented eligible applicants to the Central Office. In some instances, it may be easier for the Area housing
staff to inspect the applications at the tribal offices. This decision may be made locally. 

(d) Beginning in FY 1995, HIP funds shall be included in the Tribal Priority Allocation (TPA) section of the BIA budget.
Beginning in FY 1996, each tribe shall establish its own funding level for HIP within the TPA allocation based upon
the number of eligible applicants it plans to serve in that year. Tribes are encouraged to provide adequate funding
to meet the housing needs of individuals residing within the designated service area. Every effort shall be made to
use HIP funds in conjunction with other programs so that the result will be a greater amount of housing improvements
than would otherwise be possible with the HIP funds alone. Other funding sources shall be used only to supplement HIP
funds, not as a means to exceed the regulatory cost limits for the category of service.

At least every two years, each tribe shall develop a single priority list of applicants who satisfy the eligibility
requirements of  256.6. The priority list shall be developed using a ranking system based upon five basic factors
of need: Annual income, family size, overcrowded living conditions, age, and handicap or disability. Eligible applicants
may receive points for any or all of these five criteria in accordance with the point schedule contained in Appendix
A of this part. Individuals with a total score below zero, as a result of earning negative points for income, shall not
be considered eligible and shall not be served. Housing assistance will be provided to individuals in priority order
based upon the number of points earned. Eligibility information should be revalidated before service is actually
provided.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is proposing to delete the regulations contained in the Code of Federal Regulations
pursuant to the public law which suspended all deposits to Indian Monies, Proceeds of Labor (IMPL) accounts after
September 30, 1982. The law eliminated the use of IMPL accounts, and since these accounts are no longer in use, they
will be removed from the BIA accounting system.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This proposed rule is published in exercise of authority delegated by the Secretary of the Interior to the Assistant
Secretary-Indian Affairs by 209 DM 8.



This proposed rulemaking action will delete part 113 of subchapter G of chapter I of title 25 of the Code of Federal Regulations,
which contains regulations governing Indian Monies, Proceeds of Labor (IMPL) established under the Act of March
3, 1883, as amended (25 U.S.C. 155).

Pursuant to the amendments contained in Public Law 197-257, title I, section 100, 25 U.S.C. 155 B, which provided
that, ``No funds shall be deposited in such `Indian monies, proceeds of labor' (IMPL) accounts after September 30,
1982,'' all deposits to IMPL accounts were discontinued. The unobligated IMPL balances at the close of business on
September 30, 1982, including the income resulting from investment of funds from such accounts prior to such date,
were transferred to and held in escrow accounts. After consultation with appropriate tribes and individual Indians
up to September 30, 1985, to determine the extent to which the funds held in escrow accounts represented income from
the investment of ``special deposits'' relating to individual Indians or a specific tribe, funds were transferred
to appropriate trust accounts for individual Indians and tribes during the period of October 1, 1985, through September
30, 1987. The unobligated balances of the IMPL escrow accounts as of the close of business on September 30, 1987, are
to be withdrawn and deposited into miscellaneous receipts of the U.S. Treasury. The IMPL accounts are to be removed
from the Bureau of Indian Affairs trust accounting system and are no longer available for use.

The policy of the Department of the Interior is, whenever practical, to afford the public an opportunity to participate
in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written comments regarding the proposed
rule to the office identified in the 

Addresses

 section of this document.

The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these proposed regulations meet the applicable
standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.

The Department of the Interior has determined that this document is not a significant rule under Executive Order 12866

Proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (hereinafter the Service) proposes to establish annual hunting regulations for
certain migratory game birds. The Service also requests proposals from Indian Tribes that wish to establish special
migratory bird hunting regulations. These regulations will permit the taking of the designated species during the
1994-95 season. The Service annually prescribes outside limits (frameworks) within which States may select
hunting seasons. The Service has also employed guidelines to establish special migratory bird hunting regulations
on Federal Indian reservations and ceded lands. These seasons provide hunting opportunities for recreation and
sustenance; aid Federal, State, and Tribal governments in the management of migratory game birds; and are designed
to permit harvests at levels compatible with migratory bird population and habitat conditions.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

For administrative purposes, this document consolidates the notice of intent and request for Tribal proposals with
the preliminary proposals for the annual regulations-development process. The remaining proposed and final rulemaking
documents will be published separately.



Notice of Intent to Establish Open Seasons



This notice announces the intention of the Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to establish open hunting seasons
and daily bag and possession limits for certain designated groups or species of migratory game birds for 1994-1995
in the contiguous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, under   20.101
through 20.107, 20.109, and 20.110 of subpart K of 50 CFR part 20.

``Migratory game birds'' are those bird species so designated in conventions between the United States and several
foreign nations for the protection and management of these birds. For the 1994-95 hunting season, regulations
will be proposed for certain designated members of the avian families Anatidae (ducks, geese, and swans); Columbidae
(doves and pigeons); Gruidae (cranes); Rallidae (rails, coots, moorhens, and gallinules); and Scolopacidae (woodcock
and snipe). These proposals are described under Proposed 1994-95 Migratory Game Bird Hunting Regulations
(Preliminary) in this document. Definitions of waterfowl flyways and mourning dove management units, as well as
a description of the data used in and the factors affecting the regulatory process, were published in the March 14,
1990, 

Federal Register

 (55 FR 9618).



Regulatory Schedule for 1994-1995



This is the first in a series of proposed and final rulemaking documents for migratory game bird hunting regulations.
Proposals relating to the harvest of migratory game birds that may be initiated after publication of this proposed
rulemaking will be made available for public review in supplemental proposed rulemakings to be published in the 

Federal Register

. Also, additional supplemental proposals will be published for public comment in the 

Federal Register

 as population, habitat, harvest, and other information becomes available.

Because of the late dates when certain portions of these data become available, it is anticipated that comment periods
on some proposals will necessarily be abbreviated. Special circumstances that limit the amount of time which the
Service can allow for public comment are involved in the establishment of these regulations. Specifically, two considerations
compress the time in which the rulemaking process must operate: the need, on one hand, to establish final rules at a
time early enough in the summer to allow resource agencies to select and publish season dates and bag limits prior to
the hunting seasons and, on the other hand, the lack of current data on the status of most migratory game birds until
later in the summer.

Because the process is strongly influenced by the times when information is available for consideration, the overall
regulations process is divided into two segments. Early seasons are those seasons that generally open prior to October
1, and include seasons in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Late seasons are those seasons opening
in the remainder of the United States about October 1 and later, and include most of the waterfowl seasons.

Major steps in the 1994-1995 regulatory cycle relating to public hearings and 

Federal Register

 notifications are illustrated in the accompanying diagram. Dates shown relative to publication of 

Federal Register

 documents are target dates. 




Sections of this and subsequent documents which outline hunting frameworks and guidelines are organized under numbered
headings. These headings are:



1. Ducks
2. Sea Ducks
3. Mergansers
4. Canada Geese
5. White-fronted Geese
6. Brant
7. Snow and Ross's (Light) Geese

17. White-winged and White-tipped Doves
18. Alaska
19. Hawaii
20. Puerto Rico 
21. Virgin Islands
22. Falconry
23. Other



Later sections of this and subsequent documents will refer only to numbered items requiring attention. Therefore,
items requiring no attention will be omitted and the remaining numbered items will be discontinuous and appear incomplete.




Hearings



Two public hearings pertaining to 1994-1995 migratory game bird hunting regulations are scheduled. Both hearings
will be conducted in accordance with 455 DM 1 of the Departmental Manual. On June 23, a public hearing will be held at
9 a.m. in the Auditorium of the Department of the Interior Building, 1849 C Street NW., Washington, DC. This hearing
is for the purpose of reviewing the status of migratory shore and upland game birds. Proposed hunting regulations
will be discussed for these species plus regulations for migratory game birds in Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin
Islands; special September waterfowl seasons in designated States; special sea duck seasons in the Atlantic Flyway,
and extended falconry seasons. On August 4, a public hearing will be held at 9 a.m. in the Auditorium of the Department
of the Interior Building, address above. This hearing is for the purpose of reviewing the status and proposed regulations
for waterfowl not previously discussed at the June 23 public hearing. The public is invited to participate in both
hearings. Persons wishing to make a statement at these hearings should write to the address indicated under the caption

Requests for Tribal Proposals



Background



Beginning with the 1985-86 hunting season, the Service has employed guidelines described in the June 4, 1985 Federal
Register (50 FR 23467) to establish special migratory bird hunting regulations on Federal Indian reservations (including
off-reservation trust lands) and ceded lands. The guidelines were developed in response to tribal requests for Service
recognition of their reserved hunting rights, and for some tribes, recognition of their authority to regulate hunting
by both tribal and nontribal members throughout their reservations. The guidelines include possibilities for:
(1) on-reservation hunting by both tribal and nontribal members, with hunting by nontribal members on some reservations
to take place within Federal frameworks, but on dates different from those selected by the surrounding State(s);
(2) on-reservation hunting by tribal members only, outside of usual Federal frameworks for season dates and length,
and for daily bag and possession limits; and (3) off-reservation hunting by tribal members on ceded lands, outside
of usual framework dates and season length, with some added flexibility in daily bag and possession limits. In all
cases, the regulations established under the guidelines would have to be consistent with the annual March 10 to September
1 closed season mandated by the 1916 Convention Between the United States and Great Britain (for Canada) For the Protection
of Migratory Birds (Convention). The guidelines are capable of application to those tribes that have reserved hunting
rights on Federal Indian reservations (including off-reservation trust lands) and ceded lands. They also apply
to the establishment of migratory bird hunting regulations for nontribal members on all lands within the exterior
boundaries of reservations where tribes have full wildlife management authority over such hunting, or where the
tribes and affected States otherwise have reached agreement over hunting by nontribal members on non-Indian lands.

Tribes usually have the authority to regulate migratory bird hunting by nonmembers on Indian-owned reservation
lands, subject to Service approval. The question of jurisdiction is more complex on reservations that include lands
owned by non-Indians, especially when the surrounding States have established or intend to establish regulations
governing hunting by non-Indians on these lands. In such cases, the Service encourages the tribes and States to reach
agreement on regulations that would apply throughout the reservations. When appropriate, the Service will consult
with a tribe and State with the aim of facilitating an accord. The Service also will consult jointly with tribal and
State officials in the affected States where tribes may wish to establish special hunting regulations for tribal
members on ceded lands. As explained in previous rulemaking documents, it is incumbent upon the tribe and/or the State
to put forward a request for consultation as a result of the proposal being published in the 

Federal Register

. The Service will not presume to make a determination, without being advised by a tribe or a State, that any issue is/is
not worthy of formal consultation. 

One of the guidelines provides for the continuation of harvest of migratory game birds by tribal members on reservations
where it is a customary practice. The Service does not oppose this harvest, provided it does not take place during the
closed season required by the Convention, and it is not so large as to adversely affect the status of the migratory bird
resource. For several years, the Service has reached annual agreement with tribes (for example, in Minnesota, the
Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians) for hunting by tribal members on their lands or on lands where they have reserved
hunting rights. The Service will continue to consult with tribes that wish to reach a mutual agreement on hunting regulations
for on-reservation hunting by tribal members.

The guidelines should not be viewed as inflexible. Nevertheless, the Service believes that they provide appropriate
opportunity to accommodate the reserved hunting rights and management authority of Indian tribes while ensuring
that the migratory bird resource receives necessary protection. The conservation of this important international
resource is paramount. Use of the guidelines is not required if a tribe wishes to observe the hunting regulations established
by the State(s) in which the reservation is located. 



Details Needed in Tribal Proposals 



Tribes that wish to use the guidelines to establish special hunting regulations for the 1994-95 hunting season must
submit a proposal that includes: (1) The requested hunting season dates and other details regarding regulations
to be observed; (2) harvest anticipated under the requested regulations; (3) methods that will be employed to measure
or monitor harvest (mail-questionnaire survey, bag checks, etc.); (4) steps that will be taken to limit level of harvest,
where it could be shown that failure to limit such harvest would impact seriously on the migratory bird resource; and
(5) tribal capabilities to establish and enforce migratory bird hunting regulations. 

A tribe that desires the earliest possible opening of the waterfowl season should specify this in the proposal, rather
than request a date that might not be within the final Federal frameworks. Similarly, unless a tribe wishes to set more
restrictive regulations than Federal regulations will permit, the proposal should request the same daily bag and
possession limits and season length for ducks and geese that Federal regulations are likely to permit the States in
the Flyway in which the reservation is located. 



Proposal Procedures



Pertinent details in proposals received from tribes will be published for public review in later 

Federal Register

 documents. Because of the time required for Service and public review, Indian tribes that desire special migratory
bird hunting regulations for the 1994-95 hunting season should submit their proposals as soon as possible,
but no later than June 3, 1994. Tribal inquiries regarding the guidelines and proposals should be directed to the appropriate
Service Regional Office. Tribes that request special hunting regulations for tribal members on ceded lands should
send a courtesy copy of the proposal to officials in the affected State(s).



Public Comments Solicited



The policy of the Department of the Interior is, whenever practicable, to afford the public an opportunity to participate
in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons are invited to submit written comments, suggestions,
or recommendations regarding the proposed regulations. Promulgation of final migratory game bird hunting regulations
will take into consideration all comments received by the Service. Such comments, and any additional information
received, may lead to final regulations that differ from these proposals. Interested persons are invited to participate
in this rulemaking by submitting written comments to the address indicated under the caption 

ADDRESSES

. 

Comments received on the proposed annual regulations will be available for public inspection during normal business
hours at the Service's office in room 634, 4401 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia. Specific comment periods
will be established for each series of proposed rulemakings. All relevant comments will be accepted through the closing
date of the comment period on the particular proposal under consideration. The Service will consider, but possibly
may not respond in detail to, each comment. As in the past, the Service will summarize all comments received during
the comment period and respond to them after the closing date.

NEPA Consideration 


NEPA considerations are covered by the programmatic document, ``Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement:
Issuance of Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (FSES 88-14)'', filed with the Environmental
Protection Agency on June 9, 1988. Notice of Availability was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 16, 1988 (53 FR 22582). The Service's Record of Decision was published on August 18, 1988 (53 FR 31341). In addition,
an August 1985 environmental assessment entitled ``Guidelines for Migratory Bird Hunting Regulations on Federal
Indian Reservations and Ceded Lands'' is available from the Service at the address indicated under the caption

. 



Endangered Species Act Consideration



Prior to issuance of the 1994-95 migratory game bird hunting regulations, consideration will be given to provisions
of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543; hereinafter the Act) to ensure that hunting
is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any species designated as endangered or threatened or modify
or destroy its critical habitat and is consistent with conservation programs for those species. Consultations under
section 7 of this Act may cause changes to be made to proposals in this and future supplemental proposed rulemaking
documents.



Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act



This document was reviewed under Executive Order 12866.

These regulations have a significant economic impact on substantial numbers of small entities under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). Therefore, in accordance with Office of Management and Budget instructions, a Final Regulatory Impact Analysis
(FRIA) was prepared in 1981 and revised in 1990. Although a FRIA is no longer required, the economic analysis contained
in the FRIA has been reviewed and the Service has determined that it meets the requirements of Executive Order 12866.
This analysis was updated for 1994. The FRIA update included waterfowl hunter and harvest information from the 1992-93
season. The summary of the 1994 update follows:

``New information which can be compared to that appearing in the 1990 Final Regulatory Impact Analysis (FRIA) includes
estimates of the 1992 fall flight of ducks from surveyed areas, and hunter activity and harvest information from the
1992-93 hunting season. There was essentially no change in the total fall flight of ducks, regulatory frameworks,
hunter numbers, number of hunting days, or total duck harvest between the 1991-92 and the 1992-93 seasons.''


Copies of the updated analysis are available upon request from the Office of Migratory Bird Management. The address
is indicated under the caption

These regulations contain no information collections subject to Office of Management and Budget review under the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq
