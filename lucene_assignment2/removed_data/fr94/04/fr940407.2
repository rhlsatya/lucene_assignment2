<DOCTITLE>Inadequate Demand for Official Services in Wyoming</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS).






</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

FGIS has determined there is inadequate demand for official services to designate any organization to provide official
services in the State of Wyoming.






</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



This action has been reviewed and determined not to be a rule or regulation as defined in Executive Order 12866 and Departmental
Regulation 1512-1; therefore, the Executive Order and Departmental Regulation do not apply to this action.

In the September 30, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 51047), FGIS announced that the designation of Wyoming ends on March 31, 1994, and asked persons interested
in providing official services in the geographic area assigned to Wyoming to submit an application for designation.
Applications were due by October 29, 1993. Wyoming applied for designation in the entire area currently assigned
to it. FGIS requested comments on the applicant in the December 1, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 63331). Comments were due by December 31, 1993. FGIS received no comments by the deadline.

FGIS then contacted the major applicants for grain inspection services in the Wyoming area and determined that, pursuant
to the provisions of the Act, there is an insufficient need for official services to designate an official agency.
Therefore, FGIS is not designating an official agency to provide services in the area currently assigned to Wyoming.
Any firms which may require official inspection services after March 31, 1994, should contact FGIS' Wichita Office
at 316-269-7171 (FAX: 316-269-6163).

<USBUREAU>Foreign-Trade Zones Board</USBUREAU>





Extension of Subzone Status; FTZ Subzone 2G Equitable Shipyards Trinity Marine Group, Inc. (Shipbuilding), New
Orleans, LA 


Pursuant to its authority under the Foreign-Trade Zones Act of June 18, 1934, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u),
the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) adopts the following Order.

 


Whereas, in 1992, the Board of Harbor Commissioners of the Port of New Orleans, grantee of Foreign-Trade Zone 2, was
authorized temporary subzone status by the Foreign-Trade Zones Board for the Equitable Shipyards facility in New
Orleans, Louisiana (Subzone 2G) (for a period ending April 1, 1994) (Board Order 573, 57 FR 13695, 4-17-92;
Board Order 635, 58 FR 25606, 4-27-93); 
Whereas, in 1993, further application was made by the Board of Commissioners for an indefinite extension of said subzone
status (FTZ Docket 2-93, 1-21-93; 

Federal Register

 notice invited public comment, 58 FR 7528, 2-8-93); and, 
Whereas, upon review, the Board has found that the requirements of the FTZ Act and Board's regulations would be satisfied,
and that approval of the application for the indefinite extension of subzone status would be in the public interest
if approval were given subject to the standard shipyard restriction on foreign steel mill products now in effect for
the facility; 
Now, therefore, the Board hereby approves the application for extension of subzone status, subject to the FTZ Act
and the Board's regulations, including  400.28, and subject to the following special conditions:

 

1. Any foreign steel mill products admitted to the subzone, including plate, angles, shapes, channels, rolled steel
stock, bars, pipes and tubes, not incorporated into merchandise otherwise classified, and which is used in manufacturing,
shall be subject to Customs duties in accordance with applicable law, if the same item is then being produced by a domestic
steel mill; and, 
2. In addition to the annual report, Trinity Marine Group shall advise the Board's Executive Secretary ( 400.28(a)(3))
as to significant new contracts with appropriate information concerning foreign purchases otherwise dutiable,
so that the Board may consider whether any foreign dutiable items are being imported for manufacturing in the subzone
primarily because of subzone status and whether the Board should consider requiring Customs duties to be paid on such
items.

 

Signed at Washington, DC, this 29th day of March 1994.

If the Department does not receive, by April 30, 1994, a request for review of entries covered by an order or finding
listed in this notice and for the period identified above, the Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess
antidumping or countervailing duties on those entries at a rate equal to the cash deposit of (or bond for) estimated
antidumping or countervailing duties required on those entries at the time of entry, or withdrawal from warehouse,
for consumption and to continue to collect the cash deposit previously ordered.

This notice is not required by statute, but is published as a service to the international trading community.

<DOCTITLE>Large Power Transformers From Italy; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 International Trade Administration/Import 
Administration, Commerce.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of preliminary results of antidumping duty 
administrative review. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In response to a request by the petitioner, the Department of Commerce is conducting an administrative review of the
antidumping finding on large power transformers from Italy. The review covers exports of one manufacturer of this
merchandise to the United States during the period from June 1, 1992, through May 31, 1993. As a result of the review,
the Department has preliminarily determined that no dumping margins exist for the respondent. Interested parties
are invited to comment on these preliminary results.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 



On June 7, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative
Review'' (58 FR 31941). The petitioner requested this administrative review on June 28, 1993. We initiated the review
on July 21, 1993 (58 FR 39007), covering the period June 1, 1992, through May 31, 1993. The Department is conducting
this review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). 



Scope of the Review 



Imports covered by the review are shipments of large power transformers (LPTs); that is, all types of transformers
rated 10,000 kVA (kilovolt-amperes) or above, by whatever name designated, used in the generation, transmission,
distribution, and utilization of electric power. The term ``transformers'' includes, but is not limited to, shunt
reactors, autotransformers, rectifier transformers, and power rectifier transformers. Not included are combination
units, commonly known as rectiformers, if the entire integrated assembly is imported in the same shipment and entered
on the same entry and the assembly has been ordered and invoiced as a unit, without a separate price for the transformer
portion of the assembly. This merchandise is currently classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS)
item numbers 8504.22.00, 8504.23.00, 8504.34.33, 8504.40.00, and 8504.50.00. The HTS item numbers are provided
for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. 

The review covers one manufacturer/exporter of transformers, Tamini Costruzioni Elettromeccaniche (Tamini),
during the period June 1, 1992, through May 31, 1993. 



United States Price 



In calculating U.S. price (USP), the Department used purchase price as defined in section 772(b) of the Tariff Act.
We calculated purchase price based on the packed price to the U.S. customer. We made adjustments to USP for transportation
expenses to the Italian port and duty drawback. 



Foreign Market Value 



For the purposes of the preliminary results, we determined that, due to the highly customized nature of the products
under review, the LPTs sold in the United States could not reasonably be compared to any other LPTs sold by Tamini. Therefore,
in accordance with section 773(a)(2) of the Tariff Act, we calculated foreign market value based on constructed value
of the model sold in the United States. 

In accordance with section 773(e) of the Tariff Act, the constructed value includes the costs of materials and fabrication,
general expenses, profit, and packing for shipment to the United States. Home market selling expenses were used pursuant
to section 773(e)(1)(B) of the Tariff Act. Since the profit submitted by Tamini exceeded the statutory eight percent
profit, we applied the submitted profit to the cost of production.

<DOCNO> FR940407-2-00013 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940407-2-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

We made circumstance of sale adjustments for differences in credit expenses, warranty expenses and direct bank charges.
Since commissions were granted only in the home market, we offset the commission adjustment by adding U.S. indirect
selling expenses to the constructed value. 



Preliminary Results of Review 



As a result of our comparison of United States price to foreign market value, we preliminarily determine that a weighted-average
margin of zero percent exists for sales of LPTs made to the United States by Tamini during the period June 1, 1992 through

May 31, 1993. 

Parties to this proceeding may request disclosure within 5 days of publication of this notice and may request a hearing
within 10 days of publication. Any hearing, if requested, will be held 44 days after the date of publication or the first
business day thereafter. Case briefs and/or written comments from interested parties may be submitted not later
than 30 days after the date of publication of this notice. Rebuttal briefs and rebuttals to written comments, limited
to issues raised in those comments, may be filed not later than 37 days after the date of publication of this notice.
Service of all briefs and written comments shall be in accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(e). The Department will publish
the final results of the administrative review, including the results of its analysis of any such comments or hearing.


The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
The Department will issue appropriate appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service upon completion
of this review. 

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of this
administrative review, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act:

(1) The cash deposit rate for Tamini will be the rate established in the final results of this administrative review;

(2) For previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be
the company-specific rate published for the most recent period;

(3) If the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a prior review, or the original less-than-fair-value (LTFV)
investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period
for the manufacturer of the merchandise.

The cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters will be 92.47 percent. On May 25, 1993, the Court of International
Trade (CIT) in 

Floral Trade Council 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 93-79, and 

Federal-Mogul Corporation 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 93-83, decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established, it can only be changed through an administrative
review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate to reinstate
the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors
or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders as the ``all others'' rate for cash
deposits in all current and future administrative reviews. In proceedings governed by antidumping findings, unless
we are able to ascertain the ``all others'' rate from the Treasury LTFV investigation, the Department has determined
that it is appropriate to adopt the ``new shipper'' rate established in the first final results of administrative
review published by the Department (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation)
as the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative
reviews. 

Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping finding, and we are unable to ascertain the ``all others'' rate
from the Treasury LTFV investigation, the Department has determined that it is appropriate to adopt the ``new shipper''
rate of 92.47 percent established in the first final results published by the Department in the 

Federal Register

 on August 6, 1984, (49 FR 31313). 

These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next
administrative review. 

This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file
a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during
this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 

This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22(c)(5).

<DOCTITLE>Titanium Sponge From Kazakhstan; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of final results of antidumping duty administrative review.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On February 11, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the preliminary results of review of
the antidumping duty finding on titanium sponge from Kazakhstan (59 FR 6618). The review covers exports of the subject
merchandise to the United States from Kazakhstan during the period August 1, 1992, through July 31, 1993. 



We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. Based on our analysis of comments
received, the final results remain unchanged from the preliminary results.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On August 28, 1968, the Department of the Treasury published an antidumping finding on titanium sponge from the Union
of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) (33 FR 12138). In December 1991, the USSR divided into fifteen independent states.
To conform to these changes, the Department changed the original antidumping finding into fifteen findings applicable
to the Baltic states and the former USSR (57 FR 36070, August 12, 1992). 

On August 30, 1993, the Department received a request to conduct an administrative review of the antidumping finding
on titanium sponge from Kazakhstan. The Department initiated the review on September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51053), covering
the period August 1, 1992, through July 31, 1993. On February 11, 1994, we published the preliminary results of review
of the antidumping finding on titanium sponge from Kazakhstan (59 FR 6618). The Department has now completed this
administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). 



Scope of the Review 



The merchandise covered by this review is all imports of titanium sponge from Kazakhstan. Titanium sponge is chiefly
used for aerospace vehicles, specifically, in the construction of compressor blades and wheels, stator blades,
rotors, and other parts in aircraft gas turbine engines. 

Imports of titanium sponge are currently classifiable under the harmonized tariff schedule (HTS) subheading 8108.10.50.10.
The HTS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes; our written description of the scope of this
finding is dispositive. 



Analysis of Comments Received 



We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received comments from Titanium
Metals Corporation (TIMET), a domestic producer of titanium sponge, and rebuttal comments from RMI Titanium Co.
(RMI), an importer of titanium sponge. 



Comment 1: 

TIMET argues that there were imports of titanium sponge from Kazakhstan, under temporary importation bond (TIB),
during the period of review. TIMET cites a December 3, 1993, letter from RMI to the Acting Assistant Secretary to support
this statement. TIMET asserts that such imports are processed into titanium mill products and re-exported. TIMET
states antidumping duties should be assessed on imports entered under TIB because such imports result in the circumvention
of the antidumping finding. TIMET cites U.S. Customs Service Headquarter's rulings to argue that Customs has treated
TIB entries of other products as consumption entries in order to prevent circumvention of quota laws.

<PARENT> FR940407-2-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Department's Position: 

We disagree with TIMET. Consistent with the Kazakh Government's questionnaire response, our analysis of Census
data reveals that no shipments of titanium sponge have entered the United States from Kazakhstan during the period
of review. While TIMET provided public information on imports of titanium sponge from Russia and Ukraine in those
ongoing administrative reviews, it provided no information on shipments in this case. Absent evidence to the contrary,
we conclude that there were no imports, including imports under TIB procedures, of titanium sponge from Kazakhstan
during the review period. 


Final Results of Review 


Based on our analysis of the comments received we have not changed the final results from those presented in the preliminary
results of review. 
The following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise, entered or withdrawn
from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of these final results of review, as provided by section
751(a)(1) of the Act: the cash deposit rate for entries of titanium sponge from Kazakhstan will be 83.96 percent. 
These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next
administrative review. 
This notice also serves as a reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 
This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective orders (APOs) of their responsibility
concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d).
Timely written notification of return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order
is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is a sanctionable violation. 
This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22.

<DOCTITLE>Price Determination; Uranium From Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to section IV.C.1. of the antidumping suspension agreements on uranium from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and
Uzbekistan, the Department calculated an observed market price for uranium of $11.37/lb. On the basis of this price,
the export quota from uranium pursuant to Section IV.A. of each of the agreements is zero. Exports pursuant to other
provisions of the agreements are not affected by this price.

Weighting




As in previous price determinations, the Department used the average spot and long-term volumes of U.S. utility and
domestic supplier purchases, as reported by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), to weight the spot and
long-term components of the observed price. However, with the publication of EIA's 1992 Uranium Industry Annual,
we have used purchase data from the period of 1989-1992, rather than 1988-1991. During this period, the
spot market accounted for 31.39 percent of total purchases, and the long-term market for 68.61 percent.



Calculation Announcement




The Department determined, using the methodology and information described above, that the observed market price
is $11.37. This reflects an average spot market price of $9.91, weighted at 31.39 percent, and an average long-term
contract price of $12.04, weighted at 68.61 percent. Since this price is below the $13.00/lb. minimum expressed in
Appendix A of the agreements, there will be no quota under Section IV.A. of the agreements available to any signatory
republic for the period April 1, 1994 to September 30, 1994.



Comments




Consistent with the Department's letters of interpretation dated February 22, 1993, we provide interested parties
our preliminary price determination on March 10, 1994. We received no comments.


Allowing for additional information received since March 10, we have determined that the observed market price for
uranium is $11.37/lb. The Department invites parties to provide pricing information for use in the next price determination.
Any such information should be provided for the record and should be submitted by September 5, 1994.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On April 7, 1981, notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 (46 FR 21404) that Permit Number 324 had been issued to Canada's Wonderland, 9580 Jane Street, P.O. Box 624, Maple,
Ontario L0J 1EO. 




Notice is hereby given that on March 23, 1994 as authorized by the provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of
1972 
(16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.), and Regulations Governing the Taking and Importing of Marine Mammals (50 CFR part 216), the
NMFS modified Permit No. 324 to eliminate the number of Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (

Tursiops truncatus

) and to increase the number of California sea lions (

Zalophus californianus

) in Section A., ``Number and Kind of Marine Mammals.'' This modification is necessary due to renovations being made
to a former dolphin holding facility at Canada's Wonderland for use by six California sea lions from Marine Animal
Productions (MAP), Inc. of Gulfport, MS, for public display. This modification also reflects that the use of six Atlantic
bottlenose dolphins (

Tursiops truncatus

) from Marine Animal Productions, Inc. is no longer authorized.

<DOCTITLE>Prospective Grant of Co-Exclusive Patent Licenses</DOCTITLE>



This is notice in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Technical Information
Service (NTIS), U.S. Department of Commerce, is contemplating the issuance of grant co-exclusive licenses in the
United States to practice the invention embodied in U.S. Patent No. 4,616,316 (Serial No. 6-458,312), titled ``Medication
Compliance Monitoring Device Having Conductive Traces upon a Frangible Backing of a Medication Compartment,''
to Medical MicroSystems, Inc., having a place of business in Clarkson Valley, Missouri, and Medical Technology Systems,
Inc., having a place of business in Clearwater, Florida. The patent rights in this invention have been assigned to
the United States of America.

The prospective co-exclusive licenses will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35
U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. The prospective co-exclusive licenses may be granted unless, within sixty days from the
date of this published Notice, NTIS receives written evidence and argument which establish that the grant of the licenses
would not be consistent with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7.

The present invention is a medication compliance monitoring system consisting of a blister pack having an array of
plastic blisters defining compartments for medication, with a frangible nonconductive backing sheet having conductive
traces behind the compartments which are respectively ruptured when the medication doses are removed. The blister
pack is detachably connected to an electronic memory circuit via a multi-terminal male connector tab on the backing
sheet, wired to the conductive traces, and a corresponding female connector with terminals wired to the electronic
memory circuit. The electronic memory circuit addresses each individual trace periodically at a constant time interval
over a predetermined extended period of time to determine if it is intact. The electronic memory circuit detects the
ruptures and stores the time data thereof over said extended period of time. During the patient's follow-up visit
a microcomputer is employed to retrieve the dose-removal-time data from the memory circuit; it processes the data
and provides a display of the compliance information. A socket adapter is used to alternately configure the electronic
memory circuit for data acquisition and extraction. The socket adapter is in the form of a multiple-pin jumper plug
engageable in a multi-contact socket connected to the memory circuit. Insertion of the plug configures the memory
circuit for data acquisition. Removal of the plug configures the memory circuit for data retrieval and processing
by the microcomputer. In a typical embodiment there are 42 blisters whose associated conductive traces are addressed
every 15 minutes over an extended time period which may be as much as 85 days.







The availability of S.N. 6-458,312 for licensing was published in the 

Federal Register

 Vol. 48, No. 54, p. 11483 (March 18, 1983).

A copy of the instant patent is available for $3.00 (payable by check or money order) from the Commissioner of Patents
and Trademarks, Box 9, Washington, DC 20231.

Inquiries, comments and other materials relating to the contemplated license must be submitted to Neil L. Mark, Center
for the Utilization of Federal Technology, NTIS, Box 1423, Springfield, VA 22151. Properly filed competing applications
received by the NTIS in response to this notice will be considered as objections to the grant of the contemplated license.

Disaster Relief Tourism Promotion Financial Assistance; Financial Assistance for Projects To Promote International
Tourism to Specified States Whose International Tourism Promotion Needs Have Increased Due to Specified Disasters





<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

United States Travel and Tourism Administration (USTTA), Department of Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.










</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice invites applications for an award of disaster relief tourism promotion financial assistance, and establishes
and sets forth application and selection procedures, evaluation criteria, and other requirements.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Notice is hereby given to the States of Florida, Hawaii, and Louisiana and the Territory of Guam, their political subdivisions,
and combinations thereof, and to private or public nonprofit organizations and associations that, pursuant to Pub.
L. No. 102-368, a total of $1,400,000 is available from the USTTA under the Disaster Relief Tourism Promotion
Financial Assistance Program, to assist projects to promote international tourism to Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana,
and Guam. These States'
 International tourism promotion needs have increased due to Hurricane Andrew, Hurricane Iniki or Typhoon Omar.
As used in this notice, ``private or public non-profit organization or association'' means an institution, organization,
or association, either private or public, which has tax exempt status as defined in section 501(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code.





These funds are intended to help defray the costs of increased tourism promotion needs arising from the above specified
disasters.

There is no limit to the amount an applicant may request, nor is there a limit to the aggregate financial assistance
the specified States or Territory may be provided annually.

The funding instrument will be a grant unless it is anticipated that the USTTA will be substantially involved in the
implementation of the project for which an award is to be made, in which case the funding instrument will be a cooperative
agreement.



I. Selection Procedures



Only eligible applicants from the four eligible States whose applications receive a final evaluation score of 80
or greater will be considered for funding. No applicant will be awarded funds unless the application includes: (1)
Documentation demonstrating that all programs set forth in the application are or will be effectively coordinated
with other affected entities in the State; and (2) a marketing plan that contains clearly stated objectives for a time
period of one year and procedures for credible evaluation and tracking, and that is integrated (in terms of multiple
activities) with a generally cohesive approach. Further, no applicant will be awarded funds unless the projects
for which funding is sought are aimed at market(s) which have potential for mitigating the tourism-related negative
effects of the disaster. The application must include credible market research to support this potential.

All applications will be reviewed and judged individually, independent from all other applications, by each of four
qualified evaluators acting without consultation among themselves. Each evaluator will score each application
by awarding points for each of the three (3) evaluation criteria set forth in IV, below. Scores awarded for each evaluation
criterion will be multiplied by the weight assigned to that criterion. A maximum score of 100 points may be awarded
to an application. Once scores have been determined individually by each evaluator, a final score for each application
will be determined by averaging the scores provided by each of the four evaluators.

Awards shall be made based on an equitable geographic distribution and to those applicants whose final evaluation
scores are at least 80 or greater, in descending order starting with the applicant whose application has the highest
final evaluation score, and subject to the availability of funds. Awards may not necessarily be made to the highest-scored
proposals.



II. Matching Requirements



There is no matching requirement.



III. Award Period



The maximum period of time for which financial assistance shall be awarded is one year.



IV. Evaluation Criteria



The three evaluation criteria and the weight assigned each criterion are:

ACTION:

 Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Army Engineer District, Louisville is initiating the preparation of a DEIS for the Middle Wabash River Area,
Greenfield Bayou Project in Vigo and Sullivan Counties, Indiana. The proposed action is the partial reconstruction
of an existing levee, the construction of additional levee, and the restoration of the fish and wildlife habitat of
a significant portion of the previously forstated floodplain. The study area consists of over 12,000 acres of both
cropland and bottomland forest.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Five alternative levee alignments were developed during reconnaissance stage study, providing flood protection
to a wide range of acreage of agricultural land. Additional alternative levee locations may be investigated during
the current feasibility stage study.



The potential effects of the reconstruction of the existing levee, the addition of new levee, and the restoration
of areas to offset previous losses of wetlands (including bottomland hardwood forest) will be reviewed in the DEIS.
Significant issues to be addressed will include, but not be limited to, terrestrial and aquatic vegetation, terrestrial
and aquatic wildlife, surface and ground water resources, geological and crude oil production, soils, agricultural
production, local population and residences, and roadways and local travel patterns.
All Federal, state, and local agencies, organized groups, and individuals are invited to participate by providing
their concerns in writing to the point of contact. An interagency (Federal, state, and local government agencies)
scoping meeting will be held in the near future. No public scoping meeting is planned at this time.

<DOCTITLE>Savannah River Operations Office (SR) Financial Assistance Award; Intent To Award a Noncompetitive Grant</DOCTITLE>



<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The DOE announces that it plans to accept an unsolicited proposal and award a grant to South Carolina Research Authority,
5300 International Boulevard, North Charleston, SC 29418. The project entitled, ``The Reclamation and Reduction
of Nuclear Residuals Program,'' will be awarded for a six-month period with DOE support of $298,602. Pursuant to Section
10 CFR 600.7(b) and 600.14, eligibility for this award has been limited to South Carolina Research Authority as a result
of acceptance of their unsolicited proposal, and DOE has determined that award of a grant is appropriate.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Procurement Request Number: 

09-94SR18422.000.





Project Scope: 

The proposed program will involve the performance of an assessment of a concept to manage, in a comprehensive manner,
the residues from the use and production of nuclear materials in South Carolina. The proposal includes a phased approach
for the assessment, with the first phase assessing the technical, environmental and economic feasibility, benefits
and risks regarding the reclamation and reduction of nuclear residues. The result of Phase I will be an assessment
that will define a nuclear materials management program that vastly improves the existing means of nuclear material
storage, handling and disposal of nuclear materials in South Carolina. The assessment will specifically address
the concept that irradiated and contaminated materials be converted into containers that are necessary to hold and
store nuclear materials, wastes and by-products. This assessment will further define a Nuclear Materials Management
Program centered at the Savannah River Site (SRS) that may improve the situation regarding nuclear material storage
and disposal in South Carolina.

South Carolina Research Authority is a not-for-profit, public corporation established by an act of the South Carolina
Assembly on April 29, 1983, to enhance the research capabilities of the State's public and private universities,
establish a continuing forum to foster greater dialogue throughout the research community within the State, and
to promote the development of high technology industry and research facilities in South Carolina. The proposed project
is considered meritorious and represents a unique and innovative idea and approach which is not eligible for financial
assistance under a recent, current or planned solicitation. Based on documentation presented and appropriate evaluation,
it is determined to be in the best interest of DOE to award a grant to South Carolina Research Authority.

<DOCTITLE>Financial Assistance Award: University of Missouri-Rolla </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. Department of Energy, Metairie Site Office. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Intent. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy (DOE), Metairie Site Office, announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(D) it intends
to make a Non-Competitive Financial Assistance Award (Grant) through the Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center to
the University of Missouri-Rolla. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
The University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR) has proposed that DOE sponsor a study of Area of Review (AOR) variance possibilities
for the East Texas field, with Phase I beginning in April 1994. A further study of other high-priority areas in Texas,
Phase II, will be initiated and completed in 1995. It is expected that the Phase I data required for AOR variance consideration
will be supplied by the East Texas Salt Water Disposal Company, which operates injection wells for the field on behalf
of field owners. 



When the Underground Injection Control (UIC) regulations were promulgated under the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1980,
existing Class II injection wells were excluded from AOR requirements. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
through a Federal Advisory Committee (FAC), has recently recommended that AORs for existing wells (which were not
previously subject to that requirement) be performed within five years of promulgation of amended UIC regulations.
The FAC has, however, recognized that conditions can exist that make it unnecessary to perform well-by-well AORs
and that wells in a basin, producing trend, region or field, or a portion of such areas can be exempted from an AOR through
a variance program. 

A methodology for identifying areas that would be eligible for variance from AOR requirements based upon the FAC criteria
has been developed by a research team in the School of Mines and Metallurgy at the UMR under sponsorship of the American
Petroleum Institute (API). The methodology provides for evaluation of an area for variance based upon certain conditions
or based upon the manner by which wells in the area were constructed and abandoned. Wells not excluded by variance would
be subject to well-by-well AORs. With continuing sponsorship from the American Petroleum Institute, the AOR variance
methodology developed at the UMR has been applied to 24 oil fields undergoing injection in the San Juan Basin of New
Mexico and is currently being applied to injection fields in selected counties of the Permian basin in West Texas.
In the San Juan Basin, at least two variance criteria were found to apply to all 24 fields and are believed to provide
good possibilities for variances in 20 fields and some possibilities in the remaining four. 

The East Texas Field was discovered in 1930 and is the largest oil field in the Lower-48 states. Recovery from the field
is expected to ultimately be about 5.6 billion barrels. The AOR, which has a 1/4 mile radius, frequently includes 25
or more wells. Since the field is over 60 years old and many of the wells have been abandoned for a number of years, the
abandonment records are sometimes not readily available. More than 30,000 wells have been drilled in the field and
less than 8,000 are currently producing. Records on 22,000 abandoned and inactive wells (some of which are over 60
years old) will be hard to locate. 

Requirement for complete AORs on all existing injection wells could create an unbearable burden of proof on the East
Texas Saltwater Disposal Company and many of the independent operators in the East Texas field who can least afford
the expense of such compliance. The cost of compliance with EPA's proposed revisions to the UIC Class II regulations
is estimated to be $86.2 million to the East Texas Saltwater Disposal Company and the East Texas field operators for
the first five years after promulgation of the regulations. Variance from complete AORs for the East Texas field could
significantly reduce these anticipated costs. Successful application of the UMR variance methodology would also
further establish the potential value of the methodology to other producing areas in Texas and the United States.


In accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i) criteria (D), a noncompetitive Financial Assistance Award to the UMR has
been justified. DOE support of the activity would provide that analysis be made of proprietary non-public data which
would otherwise be unavailable. In addition, DOE support would allow the results of the research to be transferred
to oil and gas operators, to the State of Texas, and to the public. This effort is therefore considered suitable for
noncompetitive financial assistance and would not be eligible for financial assistance under a solicitation. 

DOE funding for this research is estimated to be approximately $500,000 for the 24 month duration of the project. These
funds shall be used to pay for the reasonable cost of research staff, equipment, administrative support personnel,
consultants, experts, and printing costs as necessary for the research project.

Define the disruption experience in terms of service interrupted, the impacts of the disruptions on public health,
safety and other essential services, and the economic costs incurred; (2) identify the precise cause of the disruptions;
(3) identify the response actions taken by industry, State and local governments, and Federal agencies; and (4) identify
specific actions which may reduce the vulnerability to similar disruptions in the future or improve the response
actions. A draft report on the results of the examination will be released in the summer of 1994.

<DOCTITLE>The Eugene Water and Electric Board </DOCTITLE>
Proposed Billing Credits Generation Agreement 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), DOE. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent. BPA announces its intention to sign a billing credits generation agreement for the Wauna Cogeneration
Project located in Clatskanie, Oregon. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 BPA has previously signed other Billing Credits Generation Agreements, in addition to the contract described in
this Notice. The Wauna Cogeneration Project is located at the James River Wauna Oregon mill. The size of the Project
is based on thermally matching the mill's steam needs for the pulp and paper making process. The generator will have
an approximate nameplate rating of 36 megawatts. The incremental fuel used for electrical generation is natural
gas. The backpressure turbine installation will augment existing pressure reducing valves. The expected annual
energy production is estimated at 26.4 average megawatts beginning in January 1996. The Project will be interconnected
to the mill electrical system at 13.8 KV. 



BPA, pursuant to its Billing Credits Policy, as amended August 30, 1984, (49 FR 34395), and revised on January 29, 1993,
(58 FR 37918) has negotiated this Billing Credits Generation Agreement with Eugene Water and Electric Board (EWEB)
for the Wauna Cogeneration Project. 



Responsible Official:

 Mr. George Bell, Lower Columbia Area Office, is the official responsible for EWEB's Billing Credits contract and
the Administrative Record.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Administrative Record, available for public review, contains background on BPA's Billing Credits Policy and
a Record of Decision for the Wauna Cogeneration Project and environmental considerations. 


I. Background 


BPA is a self-financing power marketing agency with the United States Department of Energy. BPA was established by
the Bonneville Project Act of 1937, 16 U.S.C. 832 

et seq

., to market wholesale power from Bonneville Dam and to construct power lines for the transmission of this power to
load centers in the Northwest. BPA sells wholesale electric power and energy to 126 utilities, 13 direct service industrial
customers and several government agencies. 
The Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act (Northwest Power Act) directs BPA to serve the
net power requirements of any electric utility requesting service, and to serve existing DSIs in the Pacific Northwest.
16 U.S.C. 839c(b)(1) and (d). Although BPA cannot own or construct electric generating facilities, the Northwest
Power Act directs BPA to acquire rights to the output or capability of electric power resources to serve increased
customer requirements. See 16 U.S.C. 839d(h). Billing Credits may be adjustments to customers' power bills or equivalent
cash payments. Resources eligible for Billing Credits include conservation and generation. 
Specific requirements for resources and the amount BPA can pay for these resources are outlined in the Northwest Power
Act and BPA's Billing Credits Policy. 
BPA's Billing Credits Policy interprets the Billing Credits provisions in the Northwest Power Act, prescribes criteria
for customer and resource eligibility, and establishes procedures for granting Billing Credits. 


II. Description of the Generation Proposal 


BPA proposes to issue the Billing Credits as a method to facilitate Project construction pending the issuance of a
ruling by the Internal Revenue Service under section 9(f) of the Northwest Power Act relating to the portion of the
Project's output that will be furnished to nongovernmental persons and the extent to which the private business use
test of section 141(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, will be met. Upon issuance of a ruling favorable
to EWEB, the Billing Credits will terminate in favor of a negotiated Power Purchase Agreement with similar terms and
conditions for all parties. 
This project meets the qualifications for Billing Credits, and BPA has completed its obligations under the National
Environmental Policy Act. EWEB will comply with all applicable environmental requirements in the construction
of the project and during the operation phase. 


III. Methodology for Determining Generation Billing Credits 


The payment for Billing Credits for EWEB will be calculated and paid monthly as follows: 
EWEB is a Computed Requirements Customer under its Power Sales Contract with BPA, the monthly Billing Credits will
be the lesser of the Adjusted Alternative Cost or Net Cost multiplied by the monthly amounts of Assured Energy Capability
of the Billing Credits Resource, less the amount of Priority Firm Rate dollars EWEB avoids paying as a result of the
Billing Credits Resource. There is no annual true-up because EWEB is required to maintain the Assured Energy Capability
for the Billing Credits Resource, as it must do for all its firm resources under the Power Sales Contract. 


IV. Materials Available 


Copies of the Billing Credits Policy and the Administrative Record are available from BPA's Public Involvement Office.
Refer to the ``For Further Information Contact'' section of this notice.

<USBUREAU>Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</USBUREAU>





Algonquin Gas Transmission Co.; Intent To Prepare An Environmental Assessment for the Proposed Canal Lateral Project
and Request for Comments on Environmental Issues 


April 1, 1994. 



The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or the Commission) will prepare an environmental assessment
(EA) that will discuss environmental impacts of the construction and operation of facilities proposed in the Canal
Lateral Project.

1

 This EA will be used by the Commission in its decision-making process to determine whether an environmental impact
statement is necessary and whether or not to approve the project. 




Summary of the Proposed Project 



Algonquin proposes to construct, own, and operate 4 miles of 18-inch-diameter pipeline, a meter station, valve site,
and tap. Algonquin would use the facilities to transport up to 75,000 MMBtu of natural gas from Algonquin's existing
G-111A valve site in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, to a valve site that would interconnect with nonjurisdictional
facilities planned to be built by Canal Electric Company (CEC). 

CEC would construct 0.9 mile of nonjurisdictional 18-inch-diameter pipeline and a regulator station. The facilities
would supply an electric generating station operated by CEC and Montaup Electric Company (MEC) in Sandwich, Massachusetts.


The general location of these facilities is shown in appendix 1.

2

 




Land Requirements for Construction 



The proposed lateral would be built adjacent and parallel to existing rights-of-way. Algonquin intends to use a construction
right-of-way that would vary between 40 and 50 feet during construction within roads, 70 feet for crossing wetlands
and waterbodies, 80 feet for upland areas, and 85 feet where additional spoil pile placement would be required due
to site specific constraints. About 50 feet of the planned widths would use existing right-of-way; however, about
25 feet of new clearing would be required in many areas. Following construction, about 30 feet of the construction
right-of-way would be allowed to revert to its former land use. Additional working space would be required adjacent
to the planned construction right-of-way at road and stream crossings. 



The EA Process 



The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts
that could result from an action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity.
NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''.
The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues. By this
Notice of Intent, the Commission requests public comments on the scope of the issues it will address in the EA. All comments
received are taken into account during the preparation of the EA. 

The EA will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed project under
these general headings: 

 Geology and soils.

 Water resources, fisheries, and wetlands.

 Vegetation and wildlife.

 Endangered and threatened species. 

 Land use.

 Cultural resources.

 Hazardous waste.

We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the proposed project or portions of the project, and make recommendations
on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas. 

Our independent analysis of the issues will be in the EA. Depending on the comments received during the scoping process,
the EA may be published and mailed to Federal, state, and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals,
affected landowners, newspapers, libraries, and the Commission's official service list for this proceeding. A
comment period will be allotted for review if the EA is published. We will consider all comments on the EA before we recommend
that the Commission approve or not approve the project.

Currently Identified Environmental Issues 



We have already identified several issues that we think deserve attention based on a preliminary review of the proposed
facilities and the environmental information provided by Algonquin. Keep in mind that this is a preliminary list.
The list of issues will be added to, subtracted from, or changed based on your comments and our analysis. Issues are:


 The construction right-of-way for the lateral would be within 50 feet of 10 residences. 
 The pipeline would cross one perennial stream (Herring River) and two wetlands. 
 The entire project would be within the Plymouth/Carver Sole Source Aquifer and about 90 percent of the proposed
route crosses a ``high yield'' area. 
 The pipeline would cross three roads and be within four roads. 
 The project may have an impact on a state-listed Area of Critical Environmental Concern, and several state-listed
rare flora and fauna. 
 The project would cross or be near 19 known prehistoric and 1 historic sites. There is high potential for additional
cultural resources concerns within the project area. 
 The project would require a coastal zone consistency determination. 



Public Participation 



You can make a difference by sending a letter addressing your specific comments or concerns about the project. You
should focus on the potential environmental effects of the proposal, alternatives to the proposal (including alternative
routes), and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impact. The more specific your comments, the more useful they
will be. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that your comments are received and properly recorded: 

 Address your letter to: Lois Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
825 North Capitol St., NE., 
Washington, DC 20426; 

 Reference Docket No. CP94-260-000; 
 Send a copy of your letter to: Mr. Jeff Shenot, EA Project Manager, 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
825 North Capitol St., NE., room 7312, 
Washington, DC 20426; and 

 Mail your comments so that they will be received in Washington, DC on or before May 2, 1994. 

If you wish to receive a copy of the EA, you should request one from Mr. Shenot at the above address. 



Becoming an Intervenor 



In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you may want to become an official party to the proceeding or become
an ``intervenor''. Among other things, intervenors have the right to receive copies of case-related Commission
documents and filings by other intervenors. Likewise, each intervenor must provide copies of its filings to all other
parties. If you want to become an intervenor you must file a Motion to Intervene according to rule 214 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) attached as appendix 2. 

The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file
late interventions must show good cause, as required by  385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be
waived. Environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. You do not need intervenor status
to have your scoping comments considered. 

Additional information about the proposed project is available from Mr. Jeff Shenot, EA Project Manager, at (202)
208-2269.

<DOCTITLE>Central Vermont Public Service Corp.; Availability of Draft Environmental Assessment</DOCTITLE>


April 1, 1994.


In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486,52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for a subsequent, minor license for the Taftsville Hydroelectric Project, located on the Ottauquechee
River, in the Town of Woodstock, Windsor County, Vermont and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA)
for the project. In the DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the potential environmental impacts of the proposed
project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate mitigation or enhancement measures, would
not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

Scoping Process: 

In gathering background information for preparation of the environmental document for the issuance of a Federal
hydropower license, staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is using a scoping process to identify significant
environmental issues related to the construction and operation or the continued operation of hydropower projects.
The staff will review all issues raised during the scoping process and identify issues deserving of study and also
deemphasize insignificant issues, narrowing the scope of the environmental assessment as well. If preliminary
analysis indicates that any issues presented in the scoping process would have little potential for causing significant
impacts, the issue or issues will be identified and the reasons for not providing a more detailed 
analysis will be given. 

q. 

Request for Scoping Comments: 

Federal, state, and local resource agencies; licensees, applicants and developers; Indian tribes; other interested
groups and individuals, are requested to forward to the Commission any information that they believe will assist
the Commission staff in conducting an accurate and thorough analysis of the site-specific and cumulative environmental
effects of the proposed licensing activities of the project(s). Therefore you are requested to provide information
related to the following items: 

 Information, data, maps or professional opinion that may contribute to defining the geographical and temporal
scope of the analysis and identifying 
significant environmental issues. 

 Identification of and information from any other EIS or similar study (previous, on-going, or planned) relevant
to the proposed licensing activities in the subject river basin. 

 Existing information and any data that would aid in describing the past and present effects of the project(s)
and other developmental activities on the physical/chemical, biological, and socioeconomic environments. For
example, fish stocking/management histories in the subject river, historic water quality data and the reasons for
improvement or degradation of the quality, any wetland habitat loss or proposals to develop land and water resources
within the basin. 

 Identification of any federal, state or local resource plans and future project proposals that encompass
the subject river or basin. For example, proposals to construct or operate water treatment facilities, recreation
areas, or implement fishery management programs. 

 Documentation that would support a conclusion that the project(s) does not contribute, or does contribute
to adverse and beneficial cumulative effects on resources and therefore should be excluded for further study or excluded
from further consideration of cumulative impacts within the river basin. Documentation should include, but not
be limited to: how the project(s) interact with other projects within the river basin or other developmental activities;
results from studies; resource management policies; and, reports from federal, state, and local agencies. 

Comments concerning the scope of the environmental document should be filed by the deadline date.

Scoping Process: 

In gathering background information for 
preparation of the Environmental Assessment for the issuance 
of a Federal hydropower license, staff of the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission, is using a scoping process to 
identify significant environmental issues related to the 
construction and operation or the continued operation of 
hydropower projects. The staff will review all issues raised 
during the scoping process and identify issues deserving of 
study and also deemphasize insignificant issues, narrowing 
the scope of the environmental assessment as well. If 
preliminary analysis indicates that any issues presented in 
the scoping process would have little potential for causing 
significant impacts, the issue or issues will be identified 
and the reasons for not providing a more detailed analysis 
will be given. 



q. 

Request for Scoping Comments: 

Federal, state, and local 
resource agencies; licensees, applicants and developers; 
Indian tribes; other interested groups and individuals, are 
requested to forward to the Commission, any information that 
they believe will assist the Commission staff in conducting 
an accurate and thorough analysis of the site-specific and 
cumulative environmental effects of the proposed licensing 
activities of the project(s). Therefore you are requested 
to provide information related to the following items: 



 Information, data, maps or professional opinion that 
may contribute to defining the geographical and 
temporal scope of the analysis and identifying 
significant environmental issues. 



 Identification of and information from any other EIS or 
similar study (previous, on-going, or planned) relevant 
to the proposed licensing activities in the subject 
river basin. 



 Existing information and any data that would aid in 
describing the past and present effects of the 
project(s) and other developmental activities on the 
physical/chemical, biological, and socioeconomic 
environments. For example, fish stocking/management 
histories in the subject river, historic water quality 
data and the reasons for improvement or degradation of 
the quality, any wetland habitat loss or proposals to 
develop land and water resources within the basin. 



 Identification of any federal, state or local resource 
plans and future project proposals that encompass the 
subject river or basin. For example, proposals to 
construct or operate water treatment facilities, 
recreation areas, or implement fishery management 
programs. 



 Documentation that would support a conclusion that the 
project(s) does not contribute, or does contribute to 
adverse and beneficial cumulative effects on resources 
and therefore should be excluded for further study or 
excluded from further consideration of cumulative 
impacts within the river basin. Documentation should 
include, but not limited to: how the project(s) 
interact with other projects within the river basin or 
other developmental activities; results from studies; 
resource management policies; and, reports from 
federal, state, and local agencies. 



Comments concerning the scope of the environmental 
assessment should be filed by the deadline established in

 The Commission staff intends 
to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) on the 
hydroelectric project in accordance with the National 
Environmental Policy Act. The EA will objectively consider 
both site-specific and cumulative environmental impacts of 
the project and reasonable alternatives, and will include 
economic, financial and engineering analyses. 
A draft EA will be issued and circulated for review by all 
interested parties. All timely filed comments on the draft 
EA will be analyzed by the staff and considered in the final 
EA. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then 
be presented for consideration of the Commission in reaching 
its final licensing decision. 


Scoping:

 Interested individuals, organizations, and 
agencies with environmental expertise are invited to assist 
the staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues 
that should be analyzed in the EA by submitting written 
scoping comments. To help focus those comments, a scoping 
document outlining subject areas to be addressed in the EA 
will be mailed to agencies and interested individuals on the 
Commission mailing list. Copies of the scoping document may 
also be requested from FERC staff. 
Persons who have views on issues or information relevant to 
the issues may submit written statements for inclusion in 
the public record. Those written comments should be filed 
with the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, by

Description of Project:

 The proposed project would utilize the Bureau of Reclamation's Sun River Canal System and would 
consist of: (1) An existing drop inlet structure; (2) a 
9,000-foot-long, 8.5-foot-diameter penstock; (3) a 
powerhouse containing a generating unit with a capacity of 
9.8 MW and an estimated average annual generation of 25.0 
GWh; and (4) a 2-mile-long transmission line. 

No new access road will be needed to conduct the studies.

Description of Amendment:

 Idaho Power Company (IPC) 
proposes to relocate approximately 0.65 miles of 
transmission lines along Warm Lake Road between State 
Highway 55 and Warm Lake. IPC proposes to relocate the line 
13 to 21 feet due north of the existing line because Valley 
County is widening Warm Lake Road. All new transmission 
poles will be of similar height and configuration to the 
existing poles and will be of raptor-safe design. The 
relocated poles will be within the road right-of-way and 
will meet Valley County's requirement of being no closer 
than 27 feet from the planned centerline of the new road 
alignment.

<DOCTITLE>State of Oklahoma; Amended NGPA Notice of Determination by Jurisdictional Agency Designating Tight Formation</DOCTITLE>


April 1, 1994.


Take notice that on March 25, 1994, the Corporation Commission of the State of Oklahoma (Oklahoma) submitted the above
referenced amended notice of determination pursuant to  271.703(c)(3) of the Commission's regulations,
that the Sycamore and Woodford Formations, underlying a portion of Stephens County, Oklahoma, qualify as a tight
formation under section 107(b) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. The Commission received Oklahoma's original
notice of determination on April 26, 1993. The amended notice of determination reduces the original recommended
area from approximately 4,640 acres to approximately 1,920 acres. The new recommended area covers all of Section
4, the E/2 of Sections 5 and 8, the NW/4 of Section 15, the N/2 of Section 16, and the NE/4 of Section 17 in T1S, R4W, within
Stephens County, Oklahoma.
The notice of determination also contains Oklahoma's findings that the referenced formations meet the requirements
of the Commission's regulations set forth in 18 CFR part 271.
The application for determination is available for inspection, except for material which is confidential under
18 CFR 275.206, at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington DC 20426.
Persons objecting to the determination may file a protest, in accordance with 18 CFR 275.203 and 275.204, within 20
days after the date this notice is issued by the Commission.

<DOCTITLE>Railroad Commission of Texas, Tight Formation Determination_Texas 156, Spraberry (Trend Area) Formation, FERC
No. JD94-02876T; Preliminary Finding</DOCTITLE>



Issued April 1, 1994.




The Railroad Commission of Texas (Texas) determined that the Spraberry (Trend Area) Formation (Spraberry Formation),
underlying the Preston and Shackelford Units in portions of Midland County, Texas, qualifies as a tight formation
under section 107(c)(5) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.

For the reasons discussed below, the Commission issues this Notice of Preliminary Finding that the determination
is not supported by substantial evidence.



Background



1. Texas' Determination



On February 15, 1994, the Commission received Texas' notice determining that the Spraberry Formation underlying
the Preston and Shackelford Units in Midland County, Texas, qualifies as a tight formation. Parker & Parsley
Development Company (Parker & Parsley) is the applicant before Texas. The recommended area is approximately
52,000 acres in size.

The record shows that the Spraberry Formation consists of three distinct productive intervals_the Upper Spraberry,
Lower Spraberry, and Dean formations_and that these reservoirs have been producing oil and/or gas for more than 40
years. The record further shows that there are approximately 182 currently active wells in the Spraberry Formation
within the recommended area and that at least 100 additional wells have been produced to abandonment. The record also
indicates that natural fractures enhance the permeability of the formation.

Texas concluded that the Spraberry Formation meets the Commission's permeability guideline based on:

(1) Pre-stimulation pressure buildup test data from one well drilled in the recommended area, the Preston Unit Well
No. 3414-A (

#

3414-A well);

(2) Type curve data from 22 stimulated Spraberry wells, 17 of which are located outside of the recommended area;

(3) Core tests from three wells within the recommended area; and

(4) A table from the ``Atlas of Major Texas Oil Reservoirs'' (1983) showing that the average permeability to oil in
the Spraberry (Trend Area) formation is zero.

Texas' finding that the formation meets the Commission's oil and gas flow rate guidelines is based on pre-stimulation
flow test rates from the 

#

3414-A well, which was drilled late in 1992.



2. Regulations/Commission Precedents



To qualify a formation as a tight formation,  271.703(c)(2)(i)(A) of the Commission's regulations requires
the jurisdictional agency to determine that the expected

 in situ

 (matrix and natural fracture) gas permeability throughout the pay section is 0.1 millidarcy (md) or less.

1

  271.703(c)(2)(i)(B) of the regulations requires the jurisdictional agency to show that the expected pre-stimulation
stabilized natural gas flow rate, against atmospheric pressure, for wells completed for production in the formation
is not expected to exceed the applicable maximum flow rate specified in the table in that section (290 Mcf per day in
this case).

2

 Finally,  271.703(c)(2)(i)(C) of the regulations requires the jurisdictional agency to show that wells completed
for production in the formation are not expected to produce more than five barrels of crude oil per day, prior to stimulation.

3

 According to Texas, the Spraberry Formation meets these guidelines.







However, in Order No. 99, the Commission defined a tight formation as ``a sedimentary layer of rock cemented together
in a manner that greatly hinders the flow of gas through the rock.''

4

 The Commission held in a prior preliminary finding that:





The Commission established guidelines on permeability and flow rates to be used to evaluate the physical characteristics
of the rock in the formation in order to show that the formation is tight, which should have been the case 

prior to the onset of sustained production from the formation. 

(emphasis added) Accordingly, the Commission further clarified [in Order No. 99] that the objective of the rule was
to ``provide incentives to develop tight formations, not to provide incentives to develop all formations with low
pre-stimulation production rates.''

5

 As a result, the Commission did not intend to permit a formation that does not actually meet the definition of a ``tight
formation'' to qualify based on currently low permeability and flow rate values that are merely a side effect of prior
conventional levels of production.''

<PARENT> FR940407-2-00030 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Similarly, the Commission held in another preliminary finding that the formation did not qualify as a tight formation
because current-day qualifying values were the result of water influx due to sustained production, not the result
of the way the rock was cemented together.

7







Discussion



Based on a review of the current record, the records in another proceeding involving the Spraberry Formation,

8

 and a study by the Texas Bureau of Economic Geology addressing the Spraberry Formation underlying the recommended
area,

9

 the Commission believes that the determination is not supported by substantial evidence, as explained below.






Commission review shows that the record does not reflect initial conditions (i.e., before sustained production,
pressure decline, and filling of rock pore spaces with water) because virtually all of the data wells were completed
in the Spraberry Formation from 1980 to 1993, long after production from the formation commenced.

10

 In addition, the record does not contain substantial evidence supporting the use of oil production type curve analysis
as a method to calculate effective gas permeability. First, all 22 type curve wells were analyzed with equations where
current gas-oil rations were used, as well as a single current reservoir pressure of 1,000 psia and the corresponding
fluid properties at that pressure.

11

 Second, the oil permeabilities used in the calculations were derived by the analysis of the 22 wells' historical oil
production. It is unclear how the oil permeabilities thus calculated can apply to the calculation of gas permeability
prior to sustained production.






Moreover, the Commission believes that the record does not show initial conditions since waterflooding projects
initiated in 1964 have affected most of the recommended area. Specifically, Commission records show that the Upper
Spraberry formation in the Preston and Shackelford Units, the most productive interval of the three productive intervals,
has undergone unitized waterflooding since 1964.

12

 These records also show that by 1980, the waterflood front had expanded over most of the Preston and Shackelford Units
and as a result, most wells were producing more than 75% water.

13








Our review also shows that at original conditions, the Spraberry Formation was a crude oil reservoir with a solution
gas drive. Such reservoirs initially have zero effective gas permeability by virtue of the fact that all the gas is
dissolved in oil until reservoir pressure declines sufficiently, through sustained production, to allow free gas
to form (known as the ``bubble point''). Thus, it appears that gas could not flow at initial conditions because the
pores of the rock were filled only with oil and water, not because of the way the rock was cemented together.

Finally, we conclude that one oil and gas flow rate data well (

#

3414-A), regardless of its completion date, does not constitute substantial evidence showing that the Spraberry
Formation meets the flow rate guidelines in the recommended area because of the geological characteristics of the
Spraberry Formation in the recommended area. Commission records show that Spraberry sediments in this area were
deposited along two depositional axes running roughly north-south. The records further show that, at initial conditions,
wells located along the eastern axis produced two to six times as much oil as wells located between the two axes, and
that wells located along the western axis are characterized by high water production. The records also show that Spraberry
reservoirs in the recommended area are highly compartmentalized due to extensive natural fracturing and complex
depositional boundaries. Accordingly, we conclude that data from the 

#

3414-A well does not provide sufficient evidence to support Texas' determination that the formation meets
the oil and gas flow rate guidelines.

Our review also shows that the record does not reflect the natural fracture permeability in the formation.

14

 The Commission's records clearly show that the original permeability of the formation (before sustained production
and water injection) substantially exceeded 0.1 md due to the existence of interconnected, well-developed natural
fractures that extend throughout the Spraberry Formation within the recommended area. The Commission's records
also show that wells located parallel to the northeast trend of the fractures have substantially better reservoir
permeability and flow rates than those located perpendicular to the trend. Therefore, wells draining sands that
do not intersect the fracture system would be expected to reflect matrix permeability only, the pressure regime of
a closed system, and low flow rates.

When a well has been cored, natural fracture permeability can only be analyzed if the core has intersected a fracture,
and the well operator requests that vertical permeability be measured. Of the three core analyses in the record, only
one (the Shackelford No. 138-A well) shows both horizontal (matrix) and vertical (fracture) permeability
values. However, only the horizontal permeability was used by the applicant. Although the reported vertical permeabilities
in the well are lower than the horizontal permeabilities in the majority of the core, the vertical permeability is
listed as 55.27 md from one zone and as ``TBFA'' (too broken for analysis) in another zone. In addition, the record contains
no evidence showing that the cored intervals in the three wells are pay zones that were completed for production. 
Finally, the record includes one data well (

#

3414-A) where pressure buildup calculations found that each of the three producing intervals' permeability
was less than 0.1 md. We acknowledge that pressure buildup test analyses usually reflect total (i.e., matrix and fracture)
permeability found in a well's drainage area, and that, despite its 1992 drilling date, initial reservoir pressures
in the 

#

3414-A well appear to be as high as those found in the Spraberry Formation at original conditions. However, the
record also shows that the Upper and Lower Spraberry intervals produced high volumes of water during the tests, and
the record contains no evidence that any of the tested intervals was actually completed for production. Therefore,
we conclude that the 

#

3414-A well's high initial pressures and low permeability values may be the result of its location in an area
of lower reservoir quality, and that the well's permeability does not reflect the formation's original permeability
throughout the recommended area. 
In light of the above, the Commission is issuing this preliminary finding since the record: 
(1) Contains only gas permeability and hydrocarbon flow rate data that do not represent initial conditions found
in the reservoir prior to sustained production, pressure decline, and water injection; and 
(2) Does not reflect natural fracture permeability. 
Under  275.202 (a) of the regulations, the Commission may make a preliminary finding, before any determination
becomes final, that the determination is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Based on the foregoing
facts, the Commission hereby makes a preliminary finding that Texas' determination is not supported by substantial
evidence in the record upon which it was made. Texas or the applicant may, within 30 days from the date of this preliminary
finding, submit written comments and request an informal conference with the Commission pursuant to  275.202
(f) of the regulations. A final Commission order will be issued within 120 days after the issuance of this preliminary
finding. 



By direction of the Commission.

Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe; Tentative Adequacy Determination of Tribal Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (Region 8). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of tentative determination on application of Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe for full program adequacy determination,
public comment period and public hearing. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal
solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or conditionally exempt small quantity
generator waste will comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C)
requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs
for MSWLFs. EPA believes that adequate authority exists under RCRA to allow Tribes to seek an adequacy determination
for purposes of sections 4005 and 4010. 



Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA reviewed Cheyenne
River Sioux Tribe's MSWLF application and made a tentative determination that all portions of Cheyenne River Sioux
Tribe's MSWLF permit program are adequate to ensure compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria. Cheyenne River Sioux
Tribe's application for program adequacy determination is available for public review and comment. 
Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on a determination to approve any Tribe's MSWLF program,
the Region has tentatively scheduled a public hearing on this determination. If sufficient people express interest
in participating in a hearing by writing the Region or calling the contact given below within 30 days of the date of publication
of this notice, the Region will hold a hearing on the date given below in the 

DATES

 section. The Region will notify all persons who submit comments on this notice if it decides to hold the hearing. In
addition, anyone who wishes to learn whether the hearing will be held may call the person listed in the 

CONTACTS

 section below. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A. Background 



On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States (and, as discussed below, allows Indian
Tribes,) to develop permitting programs to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under part 258. Subtitle
D also requires in section 4005 that EPA determine the adequacy of State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs
to ensure that facilities comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, EPA has drafted
and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which
EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate
State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final
promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory
authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements.
EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the Federal
landfill Criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLFs. 

EPA is extending to Tribes the same opportunity to apply for permit program approval as is available to States. Providing
Tribes with the opportunity to apply for adequacy for purposes of adopting and implementing MSWLF permit programs
is consistent with EPA's Indian Policy. This Policy, formally adopted in 1984, recognizes Tribes as the primary sovereign
entities for regulating the reservation environment and commits the Agency to working with Tribes on a ``government-to-government''
basis to effectuate that recognition. A major goal of EPA's Indian Policy is to eliminate all statutory and regulatory
barriers to Tribal assumption of Federal environmental programs. Today's tentative determination to approve a
tribal MSWLF permit program represents another facet of the Agency's continuing commitment to the implementation
of this long-standing policy. 

EPA's interpretation of RCRA is governed by the principles of 

Chevron, USA 

v. 

NRDC,

 467 U.S. 837 (1984). Where Congress has not explicitly stated its intent in adopting a statutory provision, the Agency
charged with implementing that statute may adopt any interpretation which, in the Agency's expert judgment, is reasonable
in light of the goals and purposes of the statute as a whole. Id. at 844. Interpreting RCRA to allow Tribes to apply for
an adequacy determination satisfies the 

Chevron 

test.

States generally are precluded from enforcing their civil regulatory programs on Tribal lands, absent an explicit
Congressional authorization or State-Tribal agreement to do so. 

California 

v. 

Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, 

480 U.S. 202, 216 and n.18 (1987). Yet, under the current statutory scheme, EPA generally is precluded from enforcing
the MSWLF Criteria as well. Furthermore, Congress has not yet created an explicit role for Tribes to implement the
subtitle D program, as it has done under most other major environmental statutes amended since 1986 (Safe Drinking
Water Act, CERCLA, Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act). 
RCRA does not explicitly define a role for Tribes under sections 4005 and 4010 and reflects an undeniable ambiguity
in Congressional intent. Indeed, the only mention of Tribes anywhere in RCRA is in section 1004(13), a part of the ``Definitions''
of key terms in RCRA. Section 1004(13) defines the term ``municipality'' to mean: 



A city, town, borough, county, parish, district or other public body created by or pursuant to State law, with responsibility
for the planning or administration or solid waste management, 

or any Indian tribe or authorized tribal organization or Alaska Native village or organization[.]



Id. (emphasis added). The term ``municipality'', in turn, is used in sections 4008(a)(2) and 4009(a) of RCRA with
reference to the availability of certain Federal funds and technical assistance for solid waste planning and management
activities by municipalities. Thus, Congress apparently intended to make explicit that Tribes could receive funds
and assistance when available in the same manner as municipal governments. However, Congress did not explicitly
recognize any other role for Tribes under other provisions. There is no accompanying legislative history which explains
why Tribes were included in section 1004(13) and nowhere else. 



EPA does not believe that Congress, by including Tribes in section 1004(13), intended to prohibit EPA from allowing
Tribes to apply for an adequacy determination under subtitle D. First of all, it is clear that Tribes are not ``municipalities''
in the traditional sense. Tribes are not ``public bodies created by or pursuant to State law.'' Indeed, Tribes are
not subject to State law except in very limited circumstances. Cabazon, supra

. Indian Tribes are sovereign governments whose authority is subject only to Congressional approval. 

Worcester 

v. 

Georgia, 

31 U.S. (10 Pet.) 515 (1832). There is no indication in the legislative history that Congress intended to abrogate
any sovereign Tribal authority by defining them as ``municipalities'' under RCRA, i.e., that Congress intended
section 1004(13) to subject Tribes to State law for RCRA purposes. Moreover, it is a well-established principle of
statutory construction that Federal statutes which might arguably abridge Tribal powers of self-government must
be construed narrowly in favor of retaining Tribal rights. F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law, 224 (1981); 

See, e.g. Ramah Navajo School Board 

v. 

Bureau of Revenue, 458 U.S. 832, 846 (1982). 
EPA believes that inclusion of Indian Tribes in section 1004(13) was a definitional expedient, to avoid having to
include the phrase ``and Indian tribes or tribal organizations or Alaska Native villages or organizations'' wherever
the term ``municipality'' appeared, not to change the sovereign status of Tribes for RCRA purposes. Second, given
the limited number of times the term ``municipality'' appears in RCRA, it does not appear that Congress intended to
define an all-inclusive role for Tribes for all potential statutory purposes. 
The ambiguity in RCRA regarding Indian Tribes also is evident from the structure of the 1984 Amendments. As mentioned
earlier, Congress expressed a strong preference for a State lead in ensuring compliance with 40 CFR part 258, in that
section 4005(c) allows EPA to enforce the Criteria only after a finding of inadequacy of the State permit program.
Yet, the legislative history of the 1984 Amendments does not suggest that Congress intended to authorize States to
implement such programs on Tribal lands or that Congress intended to override the general legal principle that States
generally are precluded from such implementation. Cf. Washington Dept. of Ecology 

v. 

EPA, 

752 F.2d 1465 (9th Cir. 1985) (RCRA Subtitle C does not constitute an explicit delegation of authority to States to
implement hazardous waste programs on Indian lands); 

accord, Nance 

v. 

EPA

1

, 645 F.2d 701 (9th Cir. 1981). Thus, Congress has otherwise put States in a primary role for the MSWLF program, yet on
Indian lands has failed to define how Tribes participate where States lack authority. EPA believes it necessary to
harmonize the conflicts and resolve the ambiguities created by these provisions. 




EPA concludes that interpreting sections 4005, 4008, and 4010 to allow Indian Tribes to seek an adequacy determination
is reasonable. Several factors enter into this determination. First, as discussed in the previous paragraph, this
approach is consistent with subtitle D because it preserves Congressional intent to limit the Federal government's
role in MSWLF programs. Absent the opportunity to seek a determination of adequacy, there would be few or no adequate
permit programs in place on Indian lands (because the State lacked the authority and the Tribe could not apply for program
approval), requiring the Federal government to assume a substantial role in MSWLF programs by having EPA enforce
40 CFR part 258 directly.

In addition to expanding the Federal role, failure to approve Tribal programs would deny Tribes the option available
to approved States of granting their MSWLF owners and operators flexibility in meeting the requirements of 40 CFR
part 258. The revised Federal Criteria (40 CFR part 258) would be implemented without benefit of an EPA approved permit
process and EPA would take enforcement actions as appropriate. All MSWLFs on Indian Lands, whether Tribal or private,
would be in a disadvantaged position relative to other MSWLFs, being unable to take advantage of the flexibility that
Congress built into Sections 4005 and 4010 and that EPA has incorporated into 40 CFR part 258. By approving Tribal permit
programs, however, MSWLFs on Indian Lands would be under the jurisdiction of the closest sovereign with sufficient
permitting authority, i.e. the Tribe, rather than the Federal government. 
In the case of other environmental statutes (e.g., the Clean Water Act), EPA, in accord with its Indian Policy, has
worked to ensure that Congress revises them at the earliest opportunity to define explicitly the role for Tribes under
these programs. Yet, EPA also has stepped in on at least two occasions to allow Tribes to seek program approval despite
the lack of an explicit Congressional mandate. Most recently, EPA recognized Indian Tribes as the appropriate authority
under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), despite silence on the Tribal role under EPCRA.
55 FR 30632 (1990). EPA reasoned that since EPCRA has no Federal role to backup State planning activities, failure
to recognize Tribes as the authority under EPCRA would leave gaps in emergency planning on Indian lands. 54 FR 13000-13001
(1989). 
EPA filled such a statutory gap much earlier as well, even before development of its formal Indian Policy. In 1974,
EPA promulgated regulations which authorized Indian Tribes to redesignate the level of air quality applicable to
Indian lands under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program of the Clean Air Act in the same manner
that States could redesignate for other lands. See 

Nance 

v. 

EPA, 

645 F.2d 701 (9th Cir. 1981) (upholding regulations). EPA promulgated this regulation despite the fact that the Clean
Air Act at that time made no reference whatsoever to Indian Tribes or their status under the Act.

2

 




One Court already has recognized the reasonableness of EPA's actions in filling such regulatory gaps on Indian lands.
In 

Nance, supra

, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed EPA's PSD redesignation regulations described in the previous
paragraph. The Court found that EPA could reasonably interpret the Clean Air Act to allow for Tribal redesignation,
rather than allowing the States to exercise that authority or exempting Indian lands from the redesignation process.
Id. at 713. The Court noted that EPA's rule was reasonable in light of the general existence of Tribal sovereignty over
activities on Indian lands. Id. at 714. 
Today's tentative determination to approve the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe's MSWLF permit program is analogous to
the rule upheld in 

Nance

. EPA is proposing to fill a gap in jurisdiction on Indian lands. As with the redesignation program, without recognition
of Tribal MSWLF programs, there would be no acceptable way to implement at the Federal level a key statutory provision,
i.e., the MSWLF permitting process. Furthermore, the case law supporting EPA's interpretation is even stronger
today than at the time of the 

Nance

 decision. First, the Supreme Court reaffirmed EPA's authority to develop reasonable controlling interpretations
of environmental statutes. 

Chevron, supra

. Second, the Supreme Court emphasized since 

Nance

 that Indian Tribes may regulate activities on reservations, including those of non-Indians, where the conduct directly
threatens the health and safety of the Tribe or its members. 

Montana 

v. 

United States, 

450 U.S. 544, 565 (1981). 
In the case of MSWLFs, EPA believes that improperly maintained MSWLFs would not be protective of human health (including
that of Tribal members) and the environment (including Indian lands). Tribes are likely to be able to assert regulatory
authority over landfills on tribal lands to protect these interests. Allowing Tribes to seek adequacy would reflect
general principles of Federal Indian law. Thus, as in 

Nance

, EPA believes that allowing Tribes to apply for program approval reflects the sovereign authority of Tribes under
Federal law.

To have its MSWLF permit program deemed adequate by EPA, a tribe must have adequate authority over the regulated activities.
Indian reservations include lands owned in fee by non-Indians. The extent of Tribal authority to regulate activities
by non-Indians on such land has been the subject of considerable recent discussion. The test for civil regulatory
authority over nonmember lands within Indian reservations was stated in 

Montana 

v. 

U.S., 

450 U.S. 544, 565-66 (1981) (citations omitted):

 


To be sure, Indian tribes retain inherent sovereign power to exercise some forms of civil jurisdiction over non-Indians
on their reservations, even on non-Indian fee lands. A tribe may regulate * * * the activities of non-members
who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members, through commercial dealing, contracts, leases,
or other arrangements. * * * A tribe may also retain inherent power to exercise civil authority over
the conduct of non-Indians on fee lands within its reservation when that conduct threatens or has some direct effect
on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe.

 


In 

Brendale 

v. 

Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakima Indian Nation, 

492 U.S. 408 (1989), the Court applied this test. Both the State of Washington and the Yakima Nation asserted authority
to zone non-Indian real estate developments on two parcels within the Yakima reservation, one in an area that was primarily
Tribal, the other in an area where much of the land was owned in fee by nonmembers. Although the Court analyzed the issues
and the appropriate interpretation of 

Montana

 at considerable length, the nine members split 4:2:3 in reaching the decision that the Tribe should have exclusive
zoning authority over property in the Tribal area and the State should have exclusive zoning authority over non-Indian
owned property in the fee area. 

Specifically, the Court recognized Tribal authority over activities that would threaten the health and welfare
of the Tribe, 492 U.S. at 443-444 (Stevens, J., writing for the Court); id. at 449-450 (Blackmun, J. concurring).
Conversely, the Court found no Tribal jurisdiction where the proposed activities ``would not threaten the Tribe's
* * * health and welfare.'' Id. at 432 (White, J., writing for the Court). Given the lack of a majority
rationale, the primary significance of 

Brendale 

is in its result, which was fully consistent with 

Montana

 v. 

United States. 

In evaluating whether a Tribe has authority to regulate a particular activity on land owned in fee by nonmembers but
located within a reservation, EPA will examine the Tribe's authority in light of the evolving case law as reflected
in Montana 

and 

Brendale 

and applicable Federal law. The extent of such Tribal authority depends on the effect of that activity on the Tribe.
As discussed above, in the absence of a contrary statutory policy, a Tribe may regulate the activities of non-Indians
on fee lands within its reservation when those activities threaten or have a direct effect on the political integrity,
the economic security, or the health or welfare of the Tribe. 

Montana, 

450 U.S. at 565-66. For further discussion of this issue see 56 FR 64876. 

However, in 

Brendale 

several justices argued that for a Tribe to have ``a protectable interest'' in an activity, the activity's effect
should be ``demonstrably serious . * * *'' 

Brendale, 

492 U.S. at 431 (White, J.). In addition, in a more recent case involving Tribal criminal jurisdiction, a majority
of the Court indicated in 

dicta

 that a Tribe may exercise civil authority ``where the exercise of tribal authority is vital to the maintenance of tribal
integrity and self-determination.'' 

Duro 

v. 

Reina, 

110 S.Ct. 2053, 2061 (1990). See also 

Brendale,

 492 U.S. at 450 (Blackmun, J.) (test for inherent Tribal authority whether activities ``implicate a significant
tribal interest''); 

id

. at 462 (Blackmun, J.) (test for inherent Tribal authority whether exercise of authority is ``fundamental to the
political and economic security of the tribe * * *''). 

As discussed above, the Supreme Court, in recent cases, has explored several options to assure that the impacts upon
Tribes of the activities of non-Indians on fee land, under the 

Montana

 test, are more than 

de minimis, 

although to date the Court has not agreed, in a case on point, on any one reformulation of the test. In response to this
uncertainty, the Agency will apply, as an interim operating principle, a formulation of the standard that will require
a showing that the potential impacts of regulated activities of non-members on the Tribe are serious and substantial.


The choice of an Agency operating principle containing this standard is taken solely as a matter of prudence in light
of judicial uncertainty and does not reflect an Agency endorsement of this standard per se. Moreover, as discussed
below, the Agency believes that the activities regulated under the various environmental statutes generally have
serious and substantial impacts on human health and welfare. As a result, the Agency believes that Tribes usually
will be able to meet the Agency's operating principle, and that use of such a test by the Agency should not create an improper
burden of proof on Tribes or create the administratively undesirable result of checkerboarding reservations. 

Whether a Tribe has jurisdiction over activities by nonmembers will be determined case-by-case, based on factual
findings. The determination as to whether the required effect is present in a particular case depends on the circumstances.
Nonetheless, the Agency also may take into account the provisions of environmental statutes and any legislative
findings that the effects of the activity are serious in making a generalized finding that Tribes are likely to possess
sufficient inherent authority to control reservation environmental quality. See, e.g., 

Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass'n 

v. 

DeBenedictis, 

480 U.S. 470, 476-77 and nn.6, 7 (1987). As a result, in making the required factual findings as to the impact of
a solid waste activity on a particular Tribe, it may not be necessary to develop an extensive and detailed record in
each case. The Agency also may rely on its special expertise and practical experience regarding the importance of
solid waste management.

The Agency believes that Congressional enactment of RCRA establishes a strong Federal interest in effective management
of solid waste. EPA also notes that, where solid waste affects ground water which has pathways that allow it to migrate
readily, it would be practically very difficult to separate out the effects of solid waste disposal on non-Indian
fee land within a reservation from those on Tribal portions. In other words, any environmental impairment that occurs
on, or as a result of, activities on non-Indian fee lands is very likely to impair Tribal lands. This also suggests that
the serious and substantial effects of solid waste within the non-Indian portions of a reservation are very likely
to affect Tribal health and welfare. EPA believes that a ``checkerboard'' system of regulation, whereby the Tribe
and State split up regulation of solid waste on the Indian Lands, would exacerbate the difficulties of assuring compliance
with RCRA requirements. 

The Agency also believes that the effects on Tribal health and welfare necessary to support Tribal regulation of non-Indian
activities on Indian Lands may be easier to establish in the context of environmental regulation than with regard
to zoning, which was at issue in 

Brendale

. There is a significant distinction between land use planning and environmental regulation of solid waste under
RCRA. The Supreme Court has explicitly recognized such a distinction: ``Land use planning in essence chooses particular
uses for the land; environmental regulation does not mandate particular uses of the land but requires only that, however
the land is used, damage to the environment is kept within prescribed limits.'' 

California Coastal Comm'n 

v. 

Granite Rock Co., 

480 U.S. 572, 587 (1987). The Court has relied on this distinction to support a finding that States retain authority
to carry out environmental regulation even in cases where their ability to carry out general land use regulation is
preempted by Federal law. Id. at 587-89. 

Further, management of solid waste serves the purpose of protecting public health and safety, which is a core governmental
function, whose exercise is critical to self-government. The special status of governmental actions to protect
public health and safety is well established.

3

 By contrast, the power to zone can be exercised to achieve purposes which have little or no direct nexus to public health
and safety. See, e.g., 

Brendale

, 492 U.S. at 420 n.5 (White, J.) (listing broad range of consequences of state zoning decision). Moreover, solid waste
may affect ground water, which is mobile, freely migrating from one local jurisdiction to another, sometimes over
large distances. By contrast, zoning regulates the uses of particular properties with impacts that are much more
likely to be contained within a given local jurisdiction. 





Operationally, EPA's generalized findings regarding the relationship of solid waste management to Tribal health
and welfare will affect the legal analysis of a Tribal submission by, in effect, supplementing the factual showing
a Tribe makes in applying for program approval. Thus, a Tribal submission regarding jurisdiction will need to make
a relatively simple showing of facts that there is or may be solid waste within the meaning of Subtitle D on the reservation
and that the Tribe or Tribal members could be subject to exposure to that waste. The Tribe also must explicitly assert
that activities of non-Indians regarding that waste would have a serious and substantial effect on the health and
welfare of the Tribe. Once the Tribe meets this initial burden, EPA will, in light of the facts presented by the Tribe
and the generalized statutory and factual findings regarding the importance of solid waste discussed above, presume
that there has been an adequate showing of Tribal jurisdiction on fee lands, unless an appropriate governmental entity
(e.g., an adjacent Tribe or State) demonstrates a lack of jurisdiction on the part of the Tribe. 

The Agency recognizes that jurisdictional disputes between Tribes and States can be complex and difficult and that
it will, in some circumstances, be forced to address such disputes by attempting to work with the parties in a mediative
fashion. However, EPA's ultimate responsibility is protection of the environment. In view of the mobility of environmental
problems, and the interdependence of various jurisdictions, it is imperative that all affected sovereigns work
cooperatively for environmental protection, rather than engage in confrontations over jurisdiction.

For purposes of this determination, Tribe is defined to mean any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group
or community which is recognized by the Secretary of the Interior or Congress and which exercises substantial governmental
duties and powers over any area. While the definition of Tribes in today's determination does not explicitly include
Alaska Native Villages, EPA has not determined that such entities are ineligible to apply for permit program approval.
Alaska Native entities (e.g., villages) may apply for permit program approval. Alaska Native Villages that demonstrate
that their permit programs meet the requirements of today's proposal will be deemed adequate. 
EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of STIR. EPA interprets the requirements
for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to impose several
minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that
are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF Criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue
a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe must
also provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA.
Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement
authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program.

EPA is further requesting Tribes to provide a statement of legal authority from the Tribal Attorney General or its
equivalent demonstrating that the Tribe has adequate jurisdiction to regulate the MSWLFs on the reservation. In
addition, EPA is requesting Tribes seeking program approval to demonstrate that it: 
(1) Is Federally recognized; 
(2) Has a government exercising substantial duties and powers; and 
(3) Is capable of administering a permit program. If the Tribe has already demonstrated to EPA that it meets the first
two of these Criteria in the context of the approval to operate another EPA program, it need not do so again. EPA is also
requesting Tribes to provide an explanation of the jurisdiction and responsibilities of all Tribal program implementing
agencies (including any State agency acting pursuant to an agreement with the Tribe) and designation of a lead agency
to facilitate communications between EPA and the Tribe. If a Tribe has already provided information and/or a legal
statement on the Tribe's jurisdiction and capability to operate another EPA program, EPA requests the Tribe to provide
only those additional materials necessary to support its application for MSWLF permit program approval. These requests
incorporate the Criteria used in other environmental statutes to assess whether Tribes may apply for program approval.

EPA Regions will determine whether a Tribe has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation outlined
above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal Implementation
Rule. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives
full approval to a MSWLF program. 


B. Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe

On August 31, 1993, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe submitted an application for adequacy determination. EPA reviewed
the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe's application and tentatively determined that all portions of the Tribe's MSWLF permit
program will ensure compliance with the revised Federal Criteria. 

The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe is a Federally recognized Tribe (53 FR 52830). The Tribe has a tri-partite system of
government. The Tribal Council is the governing legislative body, comprised of fifteen elected representatives.
The Tribe's Chairman is its chief executive officer. The Chairman and Executive Committee oversee day-to-day operations
of the Tribal government departments subject to supervision and oversight by the Tribal Council. The judicial branch
consists of criminal, civil, juvenile and appeals courts and operates independently of the Tribal Council and Executive
branch. The Tribe's Environmental Protection Department administers the solid waste permit program. 
In making today's tentative determination that the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe's MSWLF permit program is adequate,
the Agency has tentatively determined that the Tribe has adequate authority over the activities regulated by such
a program. This includes adequate authority to regulate the activities of non-Indians on fee lands within the Cheyenne
River Sioux Reservation. The Agency believes that the Tribe has satisfactorily demonstrated that there is or may
be solid waste within the meaning of Subtitle D on the Reservation and that the Tribe or Tribal members could be subject
to exposure to that waste. The Tribe has also explicitly asserted that the threat to tribal health is serious and substantial.
In light of the legal argument and facts presented by the Tribe and the generalized statutory and factual findings
regarding the importance of solid waste discussed above, the Agency believes, after consultation with the Department
of the Interior, that the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe has adequate authority over the activities to be regulated by
the Tribe's MSWLF permit program, including the activities of non-Indians. 
In its application, the Tribe has also demonstrated that it has adequate resources to manage a MSWLF permit program
and adequate authority to issue permits, ensure compliance monitoring and enforcement, and to provide for intervention
in civil enforcement proceedings. 
During a 30 day period starting November, 29, 1993, EPA requested comment on the Tribe's application from certain
affected parties. The State of South Dakota submitted written comments. 
Following review of South Dakota's comments and consultation with the Department of Interior, the Agency believes
that the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe has demonstrated adequate jurisdiction to justify the Agency in making its tentative
determination that the Tribe's MSWLF permit program is adequate. In reaching this conclusion, the Agency has considered
whether the risk of potential impacts on tribal health and welfare from existing or future MSWLFs on fee lands is sufficient
to justify tribal regulation of MSWLFs at this time. However, as today's Agency determination is only tentative and
as public comments are solicited and will be considered before any final Agency decision, the Agency will welcome
any available information from public or private sources that pertain to the potential impacts of MSWLFs on tribal
health or welfare. 
In its comments, the State of South Dakota presented three main arguments: (1) That the Supreme Court opinion in 

Brendale 

v. 

Confederated Yakima Nation 

precludes an assertion of tribal jurisdiction in this case, (2) That the Supreme Court opinion in 

South Dakota 

v. 

Bourland 

reaffirms and extends the ``Montana-Brendale rule,'' as interpreted by the State of South Dakota, and 
(3) That Congress has not ``expressly delegated'' to any Indian tribe the power to regulate non-Indians on fee lands
for purposes of the RCRA. 
The Agency has analyzed the significance of 

Brendale

 in detail and has summarized its conclusions in the Background section above. After considering the arguments provided
by the State of South Dakota and after consultation with the Department of Interior on those arguments, the Agency
has concluded that its analysis of tribal jurisdiction, summarized above, is sound. Further, the Agency believes
that its analysis is not changed by the Supreme Court's opinion in 

Bourland

. Lastly, with regard to Congressional delegation of regulatory power to Indian Tribes, the Agency's does not believe
that a finding of such delegation is necessary to today's tentative determination. 
The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe's MSWLF permit program, and the Agency's tentative determination of adequacy, extend
to all Indian Country, defined in 18 U.S.C. section 1151, under the Tribe's control. This includes all lands within
the exterior boundaries of the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation and trust lands located outside the Reservation
boundaries.

The public may submit written comments on EPA's tentative determination until June 1, 1994. Copies of the Cheyenne
River Sioux Tribe's application are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the ``Addresses''
section of this notice. 

Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on a determination to approve any State/Tribe's MSWLF permit
program, the Region has tentatively scheduled a public hearing on this determination. If a sufficient number of people
express interest in participating in a hearing by writing the Region or calling the contact within 30 days of the publication
of this notice, the Region will hold a hearing on June 1, 1994, at the Elderly Nutrition Center, Eagle Butte, South Dakota,
57625. 

EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period or
any public hearing held. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of inadequacy for the
Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe's program. EPA will make a final determination on whether or not to approve the Cheyenne
River Sioux Tribe's program and will give notice of it in the 

Federal Register

. The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all major comments.


Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce
the Federal MSWLF Criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained
in the preamble to the final MSWLF Criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal
program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October
9, 1991). 



Compliance With Executive Order 12866 



The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order
12866. 



Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that approval of the Tribal MSWLF permit program will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens
on small entities. This notice, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of tentative determination on application of the State of South Dakota for program adequacy determination,
public comment period and public hearing. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal
solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or conditionally exempt small quantity
generator waste will comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C)
requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs
for MSWLFs, but does not mandate issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of
proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially
approve, State/Tribal landfill permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit
programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR.
Prior to promulgation of the STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements.
In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes
that early approvals have an important benefit. Approved State/Tribe permit programs provide for interaction between
the State/Tribe and the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators
located in States/Tribes with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258
to the extent the State/Tribal permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval
status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the Federal landfill Criteria will apply to all permitted
and unpermitted MSWLFs. 


The State of South Dakota applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA for jurisdiction over
non-Indian lands for the former lands of the Yankton Sioux Reservation, Lake Traverse (Sisseton-Wahpeton) Reservation
and parts of the Rosebud Indian Reservation lying within Gregory, Tripp, Lyman and Mellette Counties. EPA has reviewed
South Dakota's application and has made a tentative determination that the South Dakota application is adequate
for all lands, 

other than Indian Country as defined in 18 U.S.C. section 1151

, located in the following areas:



(1) Former lands of the Lake Traverse Indian Reservation of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe; 
(2) Former lands of the Yankton Sioux Reservation; and 
(3) Former lands of the Rosebud Sioux Reservation, lying within Gregory, Tripp, Lyman and Mellette Counties. 
South Dakota's application for program adequacy determination and the Tribal comments received in regard to that
application are available for public review and comment. 
Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on a determination to approve any State/Tribe's MSWLF program,
the Region has tentatively scheduled a public hearing on this determination. If a sufficient number of people express
interest in participating in a hearing by writing the Region or calling the contact given below within 30 days of the
date of publication of this notice, the Region will hold a hearing on the date given below in the ``DATES'' section.
The Region will notify all persons who submit comments on this notice if it decides to hold the hearing. In addition,
anyone who wishes to learn whether the hearing will be held may call the person listed in the ``CONTACTS'' section below.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A. Background


On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure
that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA determine
the adequacy of State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply with the revised
Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal
Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to
be determined adequate.
EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of the STIR. EPA interprets the
requirements for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to
impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing
MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority
to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe
also must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA.
Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement
authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program.
EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation
outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal
Implementation Rule. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program
before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program.
On April 29, 1993, South Dakota submitted an application for adequacy determination for the State's municipal solid
waste landfill permit program. On October 8, 1993 (58 FR 52486), EPA determined that South Dakota's application for
adequacy determination met all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly,
South Dakota was granted a determination of adequacy for all portions of its municipal solid waste landfill permit
program. However, EPA's decision to approve the South Dakota MSWLF permitting program did not extend to ``Indian
Country,'' as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151, including the following ``existing or former'' Indian reservations in the
State of South Dakota:



1. Cheyenne River;
2. Crow Creek;
3. Flandreau;
4. Lower Brule; 
5. Pine Ridge; 
6. Rosebud;
7. Sisseton; 
8. Standing Rock; and
9. Yankton.
Before EPA would be able to approve the State of South Dakota MSWLF permit program for any portion of ``Indian Country,''
the State would have to provide an appropriate analysis of the State's jurisdiction to enforce in these areas. In order
for a State (or Tribe) to satisfy this requirement, it must demonstrate to the EPA's satisfaction that it has authority
either pursuant to explicit Congressional authorization or applicable principles of Federal Indian law to enforce
its laws against existing and potential pollution sources within any geographical area for which it seeks program
approval. EPA had reason to believe that disagreement exists with regard to the State's jurisdiction over ``Indian
Country,'' and EPA was not satisfied that South Dakota had, at that time, made the requisite showing of its authority
with respect to such lands.



B. State of South Dakota's Application Concerning Former Lands of the Yankton Sioux, Sisseton-Wahpeton and Parts
of the Rosebud Indian Reservations 


On October 8, 1993, the State of South Dakota submitted an application amendment to EPA for approval of its solid waste
permit program ``for regulation of solid waste activities on non-Indian lands for the former lands of the Yankton
Sioux, Sisseton and parts of the Rosebud Indian Reservations.'' During a 30 day period, starting November 29, 1993,
EPA requested comment on the State's application from certain affected parties. Cheyenne River Sioux, Sisseton-Wahpeton
Sioux, Yankton Sioux and Rosebud Sioux Tribes submitted written comments on the State's assertion of jurisdiction.
The Sisseton-Wahpeton Dakota Nation responded to the application of the State of South Dakota, expressing concern
regarding issuance of a permit to Roberts County (South Dakota) for a new sanitary landfill and gave notice of the Tribe's
intent to develop its capacity to manage its natural resources and enforce its codes within the original 1867 boundaries
of the Lake Traverse Reservation. All permits issued under a program determined by EPA to be adequate must meet minimum
Federal standards, including a permit to Roberts County for a new sanitary landfill. The Tribe's intentions with
regard to activities within the original boundaries of the Lake Traverse Reservation are duly noted, but the Tribe's
authority to take such actions is not before EPA for decision at this time.
On review of the arguments presented and following consultation with the Department of the Interior, EPA believes
that the State of South Dakota has sufficiently demonstrated that the former Lake Traverse reservation was disestablished
by Act of Congress (26 Stat. 1039), as decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 

DeCoteau

 v. 

District County Court

, 420 U.S. 425 (1975).
The Yankton Sioux Tribe argued that the Act of August 15, 1894 (28 Stat. 286, 314) did not expressly disestablish the
Yankton Sioux Reservation and that the Federal Court opinions relating to the issue are not controlling. On review
of the arguments and consultation with the Department of the Interior, EPA believes that the State of South Dakota
has sufficiently demonstrated that the Yankton Sioux Reservation was disestablished by the Act of 1894. See 

Weddell

v. 

Meierhenry

, 636 F.2d 211 (8th Cir. 1980).
The Rosebud Sioux Tribe argued that the Tribal Constitution asserts jurisdiction over all ``territory within the
original confines of the Rosebud Indian Reservation'' and that 

Rosebud Sioux Tribe

 v. 

Kneip

, 430 U.S. 584 (1977) upheld tribal regulatory jurisdiction over all lands within Todd Country and on trust lands outside.
The Agency does not today comment on the potential extent of tribal jurisdiction, but is only concerned with the extent
of jurisdiction of the State of South Dakota. On review of the arguments and consultation with the Department of the
Interior, EPA believes that the State of South Dakota has sufficiently demonstrated that the Rosebud Sioux Reservation
was diminished by three Acts of Congress (33 Stat. 254; 34 Stat. 1230; and 36 Stat. 448) to exclude from the Reservation
all lands 

other than Indian Country

 lying within Gregory, Tripp, Lyman and Mellette Counties. See 

Rosebud Sioux Tribe

 v. 

Kneip

.
Accordingly, the Agency is making a tentative determination that the South Dakota program is adequate under section
4005 of RCRA for the disestablished areas within the former boundaries of the Lake Traverse and Yankton Reservations
and the diminished portions of the Rosebud Sioux Reservation lying within Gregory, Tripp, Lyman and Mellette Counties.
This tentative determination of adequacy does not extend to Indian Country presently located within these disestablished
and diminished areas. 
Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on a determination to approve any State/Tribe's MSWLF program,
the Region has tentatively scheduled a public hearing on this determination. If a sufficient number of people express
interest in participating in a hearing by writing the Region or calling the contact within 30 days of the publication
of this notice, the Region will hold a hearing on June 2, 1994, 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. at the South Dakota Department of Environment
and Natural Resources, 523 East Capitol, Floyd Matthews Training Center, Pierre, South Dakota, 57501.
EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period and
during any public hearing held. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of inadequacy
for State of South Dakota's program. EPA will make a final decision on whether or not to approve South Dakota's program
and give notice of it in the 

Federal Register

. The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all major comments.
Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce
the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained
in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal
program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October
9, 1991). 


Compliance With Executive Order 12866


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order
12866.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Introduction and Purpose 


The purpose of this program announcement is to announce the availability of Fiscal Year 1994 financial assistance
to promote the goal of environmental regulatory enhancement for American Indians and Alaska Natives through the
planning, development and implementation of projects that advance tribal capacity to perform environmental regulatory
functions. Funds will be awarded under section 803(d) of the Native American Programs Act of 1974, as amended, 42 U.S.C.
2991 et seq. 
The Congress has enacted statutes for the purpose of protecting the environment. Several of these statutes provide
a role for Indian tribes. In addition, tribes may also regulate the environment pursuant to their own laws. 
Despite this increasing environmental responsibility and growing awareness of environmental issues on Indian
lands, there has been a lack of resources available to tribes to develop tribal environmental programs that are responsive
to tribal needs. In many cases, this lack of resources has resulted in a delay in action on the part of the tribes. Some
of the critical issues identified by tribes before congressional committees include: the need for assistance to
train professional staff to monitor and enforce tribal environmental programs; the lack of adequate data for tribes
to develop environmental statutes and establish environmental quality standards; and the resources to conduct
studies to identify sources of pollution and the ability to determine the impact on existing environmental quality.
As a result, Congress enacted Public Law 101-408 to strengthen tribal governments through building capacity
within the tribes to identify, plan, develop, and implement environmental programs in a manner that is consistent
with tribal culture. ANA is to support these activities on a government-to-government basis in a way that acknowledges
tribal sovereignty and is consistent with tribal culture. 
Proposed projects will be reviewed on a competitive basis against the evaluation criteria in this announcement.



Background


The Administration for Native Americans believes that responsibility for achieving environmental regulatory
enhancement rests with the governing bodies of Indian tribes, Alaska Native villages, and with the leadership of
Native American groups. 
Progress toward the goal of environmental regulatory enhancement would include the strengthening of tribal environmental
laws, providing for the training and education of those employees responsible for ensuring compliance with and enforcement
of these laws, and the development of programs to conduct compliance and enforcement functions. Other functions
leading toward enhancing local regulatory capacity include, but are not limited to: environmental assessments,
development and use of environmental laboratories, and development of court systems for enforcement of tribal and
Federal environmental laws. Ultimate success in this program will be realized when the applicant's desired level
of environmental quality is acquired and maintained. 
The Administration for Native Americans bases its policies on three interrelated goals: 
(1) 

Governance: 

To assist tribal and village governments, Native American institutions, and local leadership to exercise local
control and decision-making over their resources, including environmental resources. 
(2) 

Economic Development: 

To foster the development of stable, diversified local economies and economic activities which will provide jobs
and promote economic well-being, consistent with environmental protection. 
(3) 

Social Development: 

To support local access to, control of, and coordination of services and programs (including pollution prevention
activities) which safeguard the health and well-being of people and the tribal environment, provide support services
and training so people can work and which are essential to a thriving and self-sufficient community. 
To achieve these goals, ANA supports tribal and village governments, and other Native American organizations, in
their efforts to develop and implement community-based, long-term governance, social and economic development
strategies (SEDS)_strategies that promote the goal of self-sufficiency in local communities. These basic ANA goals
also form the basis for this environmental program. 
The SEDS policy supports ANA's goals and is based on two fundamental principles: 
(1) The local community and its leadership are responsible for determining goals, setting priorities, and planning
and implementing programs aimed at achieving those goals. The unique mix of socio-economic, political, and cultural
factors in each community makes local self-determination necessary. The local community is in the best position
to apply its own cultural, political, and socio-economic values to its long-term strategies and programs. 
(2) Economics, governance, and social development are interrelated. Development in one area should be balanced
with development in the others in order to move toward self-sufficiency. Consequently, comprehensive development
strategies should address all aspects of the governmental, economic, and social infrastructures (including those
for environmental protection) needed to promote self-sufficient communities.

<DOCNO> FR940407-2-00071 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940407-2-00038 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The principles of the SEDS approach discussed above assume these definitions of important terms linked to the SEDS
process: 
 

``Governmental infrastructure'' 

includes the constitutional, legal, and administrative development requisite for independent governance. 
 

``Economic infrastructure'' 

includes the physical, commercial, industrial and/or agricultural components necessary for a functioning local
economy which supports the life-style embraced by the Native American community. 
 

``Social infrastructure'' 

includes those components through which health of the people and the environment and economic well-being are maintained
within the community and that support governance and economic goals. 
These definitions should be kept in mind as a local strategy is developed as part of the application for project funding.

Without a careful balance between governmental, economic and social development infrastructures, a community's
development efforts could be jeopardized. The recently added emphasis on environmental concerns (Pub. L. 103-139
and Pub. L. 101-408) does not in any way negate the SEDS approach but requires the enrichment of each dimension
of SEDS. For example, expansion of social services, without providing opportunities for employment, economic development
and environmental protection, could lead to dependency on social services. Conversely, inadequate social support
services and training could seriously impede productivity and local economic development and environmental protection.
Additionally, infrastructures must be developed or expanded at the tribal or village level to support social and
economic development and growth with proper consideration of their impacts on the environment. 


B. Proposed Projects To Be Funded 


1. General Considerations 


The Administration for Native Americans assists eligible applicants (see section C below) in undertaking one-to-three
year development projects that are a part of long-range comprehensive plans to move toward environmental regulatory
enhancement and be interrelated with a community's social and economic development plans. 
Applicants must also propose a concrete, locally determined strategy to carry out the project's goals, objectives,
and work plans. Local long-range planning must consider the maximum use of all available resources, how these resources
will be directed toward planning and development opportunities, and present a strategy for overcoming the local
issues that hinder environmental regulatory enhancement. 
The Administration for Native Americans encourages applicants to design project strategies to achieve their specific
environmental regulatory enhancement goals and to use available human, natural, financial, and physical resources
to which the applicant has access. 
Non-ANA resources should be leveraged to strengthen and broaden the impact of the proposed project in the community.
Project designs should explain how those parts of projects which ANA does not fund will be financed through other sources.
For example, ANA does not fund construction. Applicants must show the relationship of non-ANA funded activities
to those objectives and activities that 

are

 funded with ANA grant funds. 
All projects funded by ANA must be completed, or self-sustaining or supported with other than ANA funds at the end of
the project period. ``Completed'' means that the project ANA funded is finished, and the desired result(s) have been
attained. ``Self-sustaining'' means that a project will continue without outside resources. ``Supported by other
than ANA funds'' means that the project will continue beyond the ANA project period, but will be supported by funds
other than ANA's. 


2. Activities That Cannot Be Funded by ANA 


The Administration for Native Americans does not fund programs which operate indefinitely or require ANA funding
on a recurring basis. 
The Administration for Native Americans does not fund objectives or activities for the core administration of an
organization. ``Core administration'' is defined as funding for staff salaries for those functions which support
the organization as a whole, or for purposes unrelated to the actual management or implementation of work conducted
under an ANA approved project. 
However, functions and activities that are clearly project related are eligible for grant funding. For example,
the management and administrative functions necessary to carry out an ANA approved project are not considered ``core
administration'' and are therefore grant eligible costs. Additionally, ANA will fund the salaries of approved staff
for time actually and reasonably spent to implement a funded ANA project.

C. Eligible Applicants 



1. Who Is Eligible To Apply? 



The following organizations are eligible to apply: 

 Federally recognized Indian tribes as listed in the 

Federal Register

 Notice dated October 21, 1993; 

 Incorporated non-Federally and state recognized Indian tribes; 

 Alaska Native villages as defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) and/or nonprofit village
consortia; 

 Nonprofit Alaska Native Regional Corporations and/or associations with village specific projects; 

 Other tribal or village organizations or consortia of Indian tribes. 



2. Who Is Not Eligible?



The following organizations are not eligible to apply: 

 Urban Indian Centers; 

 Incorporated nonprofit multi-purpose community-based Indian organizations; 

 Public and nonprofit private agencies serving: Native Hawaiians, peoples from Guam, American Samoa, Palau,
or the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands; 
 Incorporated nonprofit Alaska Native multi-purpose community based organizations; 

 National or regional incorporated nonprofit Native American organizations with Native American community-specific
objectives. 



D. Available Funds 



Approximately $3 million of Fiscal Year 1994 funds were appropriated and are available to support this regulatory
enhancement effort. ANA expects to award approximately 35 grants in amounts up to $250,000 per budget period. 

Each tribe, Native American organization, or other eligible applicant can receive only 

one

 grant award under this announcement. The Administration for Native Americans will accept only one application from
any one applicant. If an eligible applicant sends in two applications, the one with the earlier postmark will be accepted
for review unless the applicant withdraws the earlier application. Applicants who have current ANA SEDS grants are
eligible to apply for funds under this program announcement. 



E. Multi-Year Projects 



This announcement is soliciting applications for project periods up to three years. Awards on a competitive basis,
will be for a one-year budget period, although project periods may be for up to three years. Applications for continuation
grants funded under these awards beyond the one-year budget period, but within the three year project period, will
be entertained in subsequent years on a non-competitive basis subject to availability of funds, satisfactory progress
of the grantee and determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of the government. A multi-year
project 

cannot

 be a series of unrelated objectives with activities presented in chronological order over a two or three period. Timely
submission of objective progress reports on work under a grant is essential to continued funding of that grant. 

Applicants may apply for projects of up to 36 months duration. A multi-year project is a project on a single theme that
requires more than 12 months to complete and affords the applicant an opportunity to develop and address more complex
and in-depth strategies than can be completed in one year. Applicants are encouraged to develop multi-year projects.
A multi-year project 

cannot

 be a series of unrelated objectives with activities presented in chronological order over a two or three year period.


The budget period for each multi-year project grant is 12 months. The non-competitive funding for the second and third
years is contingent upon the grantee's satisfactory progress in achieving the objectives of the project, according
to the approved Objective Work Plan (OWP), the availability of Federal funds, and compliance with the applicable
statutory, regulatory and grant requirements, including timely submission of objective progress reports (OPRs).




F. Grantee Share of Project 



Grantees must provide at least 20 percent of the total approved cost of the project. The total approved cost of the project
is the sum of the Federal share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share may be met by cash or through the provision
of in-kind property or services, but only to the extent that cash or property is from any source (including any Federal
agency) other than a program, contract or grant authorized under the Native American Programs Act of 1974, as amended.
Therefore, a project requesting $300,000 in Federal funds (based on an award of $100,000 per budget period for three
years), must include a match of at least $75,000 (20% of the total project costs). An itemized budget detailing the
applicant's non-Federal share, and its source, must be included in an application. A request for a waiver of the non-Federal
share requirement may be submitted in accordance with 45 CFR 1336.50(b)(3) of the Native American Program Regulations.




G. Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs 



This program is not covered by Executive Order 12372.

Phone: (202) 690-5790. 




2. Application Submission 




One signed original, and two copies of the grant application, including all attachments, must be hand delivered or
postmarked by the closing date to: 
Department of Health and Human Services, 
Administration for Children and Families, 
6th Floor East, 
370 L'Enfant Promenade, SW., 
Washington, DC 20447. 


The application must be signed by an individual authorized (1) to act for the applicant, and (2) to assume the applicant's
obligations under the terms and conditions of the grant award, including statutory and regulatory requirements.





3. Application Consideration 




The Commissioner of the Administration for Native Americans determines the final action to be taken on each grant
application received under this program announcement. The following points should be taken into consideration
by all applicants: 
 Incomplete applications and applications that do not conform to this announcement will not be accepted for
review. Applicants will be notified in writing of any such determination by ANA. 


 Complete applications that conform to all the requirements of this program announcement are subjected to
a competitive review and evaluation process (discussed in section I below). An independent review panel consisting
of reviewers familiar with American Indian Tribes, tribal communities and organizations, and environmental issues
evaluates each application against the published criteria in this announcement. The review will result in a numerical
score attributed to each application. The results of this review assist the Commissioner in making final funding
decisions. 


 The Commissioner's funding decision also takes into account the analysis of the application, and recommendations
and comments of ANA staff, State and Federal agencies having contract and grant performance related information,
and other interested parties. 


 The Commissioner makes grant awards consistent with the purpose of the Act, all relevant statutory and regulatory
requirements, this program announcement, and the availability of funds. 


 After the Commissioner has made decisions on all applications, unsuccessful applicants are notified in writing
within approximately 120 days of the closing date. The notification will be accompanied by a critique including recommendations
for improving the application. Successful applicants are notified through an official Financial Assistance Award
(FAA) document. The Administration for Native Americans staff cannot respond to requests for information regarding
funding decisions prior to the official notification to the applicants. The FAA will state the amount of Federal funds
awarded, the purpose of the grant, the terms and conditions of the grant award, the effective date of the award, the
project period, the budget period, and the amount of the non-Federal matching share requirement. 




I. Review Process and Criteria 




1. Initial Application Review 




Timely applications submitted under this program announcement will undergo a pre-review to determine that: 


 The applicant is eligible in accordance with the Eligible Applicants Section of this announcement; and 


 The application narrative, forms and materials submitted are adequate to allow the review panel to undertake
an in depth evaluation. (All required materials and forms are listed in the Grant Application Checklist in the Application
Kit.) 




2. Determination of Ineligibility 




Applicants who are initially rejected from competitive evaluation because of ineligibility, may appeal an ANA decision
of applicant ineligibility. Likewise, applicants may also appeal an ANA decision that an applicant's proposed activities
are ineligible for funding consideration. Section 810(b) [42 U.S.C. 2991h] of the Native American Programs Act Amendments
provides for an appeals process when ANA determines that an organization or activities are ineligible for assistance.
Section 810(b) [42 U.S.C. 2991h] provides that if an application is rejected on the grounds that the applicant is ineligible
or that activities proposed by the applicant are ineligible for funding, the applicant may appeal to the Secretary,
not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of notification of such rejection, for a review of the grounds for such
rejection. On appeal, if the Secretary finds that an applicant is eligible or that its proposed activities are eligible,
such eligibility shall not be effective until the next cycle of grant proposals are considered by the Administration.




3. Competitive Review of Accepted Applications 




Applications which pass the pre-review will be evaluated and rated by an independent review panel on the basis of the
five evaluation criteria listed below. These criteria are used to evaluate the quality of a proposed project, and
to determine the likelihood of its success.

<TEXT>
 

The five programmatic and management criteria are closely related to each other. They are considered as a whole in
judging the overall quality of an application. Points are awarded only to applications which are responsive to this
announcement and these criteria. The five evaluation criteria are: 


(1) Long-Range Goals and Available Resources (15 Points) 



(a) The application explains how the specific environmental regulatory enhancement goal relates to the proposed
project. The description includes local objectives related to the program purpose of this announcement. The discussion
should highlight specific environmental regulatory needs and explain how the community intends to achieve the goal.
It documents the type of involvement and support of the community in the planning and implementation of the project.
The application has a clearly delineated strategy to improve the capability of the governing body of a tribe to regulate
environmental quality through enhancing local capacity to perform necessary regulatory functions. 
(b) Available resources (other than ANA) which will assist, and be coordinated with the project, are described. These
resources should be documented by letters or documents of commitment of resources, not merely letters of support.
``Letters of support'' merely express another organization's endorsement of a proposed project. Support letters
are not binding commitment letters or documents that factually establish the authenticity of other resources. Letters
and other documents of commitment are binding in that they specifically state the nature, amount and conditions under
which another agency or organization will support a project funded with ANA monies. For example, a letter from another
Federal agency or foundation pledging a commitment of $200,000 in construction funding to complement proposed ANA
funded pre-construction activity is evidence of a firm funding commitment. These resources may be human, natural
or financial, and may include other Federal and non-Federal resources. Applicant statements that additional funding
will be sought from other specific sources is not considered a binding commitment of outside resources. 


(2) Organizational Capabilities and Qualifications (15 Points) 


(a) The management and administrative structure of the applicant is described and explained. Evidence of the applicant's
ability to manage a project of the scope proposed is well documented. The application clearly shows the successful
management of prior or current projects of similar scope by the organization, and/or by the individuals designated
to manage or consult on the project. The tribe itself may not have experience to meet this requirement but the staff
and consultants that it has agreed to hire should contain the required experience and capability. The applicant should
clearly describe any previous or current activities of all participants in support of environmental regulatory
enhancement. 
(b) Position descriptions or resumes of key personnel, including those of consultants, are presented. The position
descriptions and resumes relate specifically to the staff proposed in the Approach Page and in the proposed Budget
of the application. Position descriptions very clearly describe each position and its duties and clearly relate
to the personnel staffing required to achieve the project objectives. Resumes indicate that the proposed staff are
qualified to carry out the project activities. Either the position descriptions or the resumes set forth the qualifications
that the applicant believes are necessary for overall quality management of the project. 


(3) Project Objectives, Approach and Activities (40 Points) 


The application proposes specific project objective work plans with activities related to the environmental regulatory
enhancement strategy and the overall long-term goals. The objective work plan(s) in the application include(s)
project objectives and activities for 

each

 budget period proposed and demonstrates that each of the objectives and its activities: 
 Are measurable and/or quantifiable in terms of results or outcomes; 
 Are based on the fully described and locally determined strategy narrative for environmental regulatory
enhancement; 
 Clearly relate to the community's long-range environmental goals which the project addresses;

<TEXT>
 

 Can be accomplished with the available or expected resources during the proposed project period; 
 Indicate when the objective, and major activities under each objective, will be accomplished; 
 Specify who will conduct the activities under each objective; and, 
 Support a project that will be completed, self-sustaining, or financed by other than ANA funds at the end of
the project period. 


(4) Results or Benefits Expected (20 Points) 


The proposed objectives will result in specific, measurable outcomes to be achieved that will clearly contribute
to the completion of the overall project and will help the community meet its environmental goals. The specific information
provided in the narrative and objective work plans on expected results or benefits for each objective is the standard
upon which its achievement can be evaluated at the end of each budget year. 


(5) Budget (10 Points) 


There is a detailed budget with comprehensive narrative provided for each budget period requested. The budget is
fully explained. It justifies each line item in the budget categories in Section B of the Budget Information of the
application, including the applicant's non-Federal share and its source. Sufficient cost and other detail is included
and explained to facilitate the determination of cost allowability and the relevance of these costs to the proposed
project. The funds requested are appropriate and necessary for the scope of the project. 


J. Guidance to Applicants 


The following is provided to assist applicants in developing a competitive application. 


1. Program Guidance 


 The Administration for Native Americans funds projects that present the strongest prospects for fulfilling
a community's environmental regulatory enhancement goals. The Administration for Native Americans does not fund
on the basis of need alone. 
 In discussing the goals, strategy, and problems being addressed in the application, include sufficient background
and/or history of the community concerning environmental issues and/or progress to date, as well as the size of the
population to be served. 
 An application should describe a clear relationship between the proposed project and the community's long-range
environmental goals or plan. 
 The project application must clearly identify in measurable terms the expected results, benefits or outcomes
of the proposed project, and its positive or continuing impact on the community. 
 Supporting documentation or other testimonies from interested parties other than the applicant should be
included to provide support for the feasibility and the commitment of other resources to implement or conduct the
proposed project. 
 In the ANA Project Narrative, Section A of the application package, Resources Available to the Proposed Project,
the applicant should describe any specific financial circumstances which may impact on the project, such as any monetary
or land settlements made to the applicant, and any restrictions on the use of those settlements. When the applicant
appears to have other resources to support the proposed project and chooses not to use them, the applicant should explain
why it is seeking ANA funds and not utilizing these resources for the project. 
 ANA defines ``environmental regulatory enhancement'' as encompassing (but not limited to) the planning,
development, and application of laws, training, monitoring, and enforcement procedures, tribal courts, environmental
laboratories and other facilities, and associated regulatory activities to strengthen the tribal government's
capacity to enhance the quality of reservation life as measured by the reduction of pollutants in the air, water, soil,
food and materials encountered by inhabitants of tribes and villages. 


2. Technical Guidance 


 It is strongly suggested that the applicant follow the Supplemental Guide included in the ANA application
kit to develop an application. The Guide provides practical information and helpful suggestions, and is an aid to
help applicants prepare ANA applications for environmental regulatory enhancement projects. 
 Applicants are encouraged to have someone other than the author apply the evaluation criteria in the program
announcement and to score the application prior to its submission, in order to gain a better sense of the application's
quality and potential competitiveness in the ANA review process. 
 There is no maximum or minimum amount of Federal funds that may be requested. 
 For purposes of developing an application, applicants should plan for a project start date approximately
120 days after the closing date. 
 The Administration for Native Americans will accept only one application from any one applicant. If an eligible
applicant sends in two applications, the one with the earlier postmark will be accepted for review unless the applicant
withdraws the earlier application. 
 An application from a Federally recognized tribe or an organization serving members of a Federally recognized
tribe must be from the governing body of the tribe. 
 The application's Form 424 must be signed by the applicant's representative authorized to act with full authority
on behalf of the applicant. 
 The Administration for Native Americans recommends that the pages of the application be numbered sequentially
from the first page, and that a table of contents be provided. This allows for easy reference during the review process.
Simple tabbing of the sections of the application is also helpful to the reviewers. 
 Two copies of the application plus the original are required.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940407-2-00076 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940407-2-00038 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 The Cover Page (included in the Kit) should be the first page of an application, followed by the one-page abstract.

 The Approach page (Section B of the ANA Program Narrative) for each Objective Work Plan proposed should be of
sufficient detail to become a monthly staff guide for project responsibilities if the applicant is funded. 
 The applicant should specify the entire project period length on the first page of the Form 424, Block 13, not
the length of the first budget period. If the application narrative and Form 424 propose different project periods,
ANA will consider the project period specified on the Form 424 as governing. 
 Line 15a of the 424 should specify the Federal funds requested for the first Budget Period, not the entire project
period. 
 Applicants proposing multi-year projects must fully describe each year's project objectives and activities.
Separate Objective Work Plans (OWPs) must be presented for each project year and a separate itemized budget of the
Federal and non-Federal costs of the project for each budget period must be included. 
 Applicants for multi-year projects must justify the entire time-frame of the project (i.e., why the project
needs funding for more than one year) and clearly describe the results to be achieved for each objective by the end of
each budget period of the total project period. 


3. Projects or Activities That Generally Will Not Meet the Purposes of This Announcement 


 Projects in which a grantee would provide training and/or technical assistance (T/TA) to other tribes or Native
American organizations (``third party T/TA''). However, the purchase of T/TA by a grantee for its own use or for its
members' use (as in the case of a consortium), where T/TA is necessary to carry out project objectives, is acceptable.

 Projects that request funds for feasibility studies, plans, or written materials, such as manuals, that are
not an essential part of the applicant's environmental regulatory enhancement strategy. The Administration for
Native Americans is not interested in funding `wish lists.' The Administration for Native Americans expects written
evidence of the solid investment of time and consideration on the part of the applicant with regard to proposed projects.

 Core administration functions, or other activities, that essentially support only the applicant's on-going
administrative functions. 
 Proposals from consortia of tribes that are not specific with regard to support from, and roles of, member tribes.
The Administration for Native Americans expects an application from a consortium to have goals and objectives that
will create positive impacts and outcomes in the communities of its members. In situations where both consortia of
tribes and individual consortia tribal members receive ANA funding, ANA expects that consortia groups will not seek
funding that duplicates what their member tribes are doing. 
 Projects which should be supported by other Federal funding sources that are appropriate, and available,
for the proposed activity. 
 Projects that will not be completed, self-sustaining, or supported by other than ANA funds, at the end of the
project period. 
 The purchase of real estate (see 45 CFR 1336.50 (e)) or construction. 
 Projects originated and designed by consultants who provide a major role for themselves in the proposed project
and are not members of the applicant organization, tribe or village. 
The Administration for Native Americans will critically evaluate applications in which the acquisition of major
capital equipment is a major component of the Federal share of the budget. During negotiation, such expenditures
may be deleted from the budget of an otherwise approvable application, if not fully justified by the applicant and
not deemed appropriate to the needs of the project by ANA. 


K. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 


Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-511, the Department is required to submit to the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval any reporting and record 
keeping requirements in regulations including program 
announcements. This program announcement does not contain information collection requirements beyond those approved
for ANA grant applications under the Program Narrative Statement by OMB. 


L. Due Date for Receipt of Applications 


The closing date for applications submitted in response to this program announcement is June 17, 1994. 



M. Receipt of Applications 


Applications must either be hand delivered, or postmarked by the closing date, to the address in Section H, The Application
Process: Application Submission. 
The Administration for Native Americans will not accept applications submitted via facsimile (FAX) equipment.



Deadlines.

 Applications mailed through the U.S. Postal Service or a commercial delivery service shall be considered as meeting
an announced closing date if they are either: (1) Received on or before the deadline date at the address specified in
Section H, Application Submission, or (2) postmarked by the deadline date and received in time for the ANA independent
review. (Applicants are cautioned to request a legible postmark date from the U.S. Postal Service. Private metered
postmarks shall not be acceptable as proof of timely mailing.) 



Late applications. 

Applications which do not meet the criteria in the above paragraph of this section are considered late applications
and will be returned to the applicant. The Administration for Native Americans shall notify each late applicant that
its application will not be considered in the current competition. 


Extension of deadlines. 

The Administration for Native Americans may extend the deadline for all applicants because of acts of God such as floods,
hurricanes, etc., or when there is a widespread disruption of the mails. However, if ANA does not extend the deadline
for all applicants, it may not waive or extend the deadline for any applicant.

Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guide; Availability; Extension of Comment Period


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice; extension of comment period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is extending to May 31, 1994, the comment period on a notice that appeared in
the in the 

Federal Register

 of March 18, 1994 (59 FR 12949). The document announced the availability of a draft guidance document entitled ``Fish
and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guide.'' In response to several requests, FDA is publishing a document
elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

 to extend the comment period on the proposal to adopt regulations to ensure the safe processing and importing of fish
and fishery products, including procedures for the monitoring of selected process in accordance with Hazard Analysis
Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles (59 FR 4142, January 28, 1994). Because the Fish and Fishery Products Hazards
and Control Guide was developed to serve as an adjunct to the proposal, the agency believes that it would be appropriate
also to extend the comment period on it. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of March 18, 1994 (59 FR 12949), FDA issued a notice of availability for a draft guidance document, the ``Fish and Fishery
Products Hazards and Controls Guide'' (hereafter referred to as the Guide). FDA has prepared this document as an adjunct
to proposed regulations on the safe processing and importing of fish and fishery products. 


The proposed regulations include procedures for the monitoring of selected processes in accordance with Hazard
Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles. HACCP is a preventive system of hazard control that can be used
by food processors and importers. 
The agency anticipates that the Guide will help members of the seafood industry identify and control hazards associated
with the fish and fishery products they process and import. The Guide consists largely of an inventory of known likely
hazards and descriptions of control measures that can be taken to minimize or prevent the occurrence of those hazards.
It includes a considerable amount of detail that, to the best of FDA's knowledge, is either new or has never been compiled
in this manner before. For these reasons FDA believes that public comment on the Guide would be extremely useful.
The notice of availability for the Guide stated that comments were due by April 28, 1994. Although many copies of the
Guide had been distributed at public meetings and through other means before the publication of the notice of availability,
FDA is concerned that the time between the publication of that notice and the end of the comment period is not sufficient.

FDA has concluded that it is in the public interest to allow an additional 30 days for comment. FDA considers that this
amount of time should be more than ample for interested persons to complete and submit their comments. 
FDA also believes that the reasons for extending the comment period on the proposed rule apply to the Guide as well.
Elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, FDA is extending the comment period on the proposed rule until May 31, 1994, based on several requests for an extension.

Interested persons may, on or before May 31, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding the Guide. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one
copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in the heading of this document. Received comments
may be seen in the office above between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

ACTION: 

Supplement to the notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the proposed Zortman Mine
Expansion Project in Phillips County, Montana.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice supplements the ``Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Proposed
Zortman Mine Expansion Project, Montana'' that the Bureau of Land Management published in the 

Federal Register

, Volume 57, No. 230, page 56588, November 30, 1992.


This supplement notes that the scope of the Zortman Mine Expansion EIS is expanded to also include long-term mining
and reclamation practices for the Landusky Mine to correct existing problems identified with acid rock drainage.
The Landusky Mine is located approximately two miles west of the Zortman Mine and is also operated by Zortman Mining,
Inc. The Landusky Mine is located in southwestern Phillips County about 50 miles south of Malta, Montana, near the
southern boundary of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation. Existing mine facilities include seven leach pads, four
waste rock dumps, three open pit mining areas, a processing plant and associated infrastructure covering approximately
815 acres. The resulting combined Zortman-Landusky EIS will provide a comprehensive impacts analysis for deciding
on future mine expansion and reclamation requirements at both operations.

<DOCTITLE>Railroad Cost Recovery Procedures-Productivity Adjustment</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Interstate Commerce Commission. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Continuance of advance notice of rail productivity growth estimate. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In Productivity Adjustment-Implementation, 9 I.C.C.2d 1072 (1993), the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC)
prescribed the use of a 5-year moving average for measuring changes in railroad productivity used in calculating
the Rail Cost Adjustment Factor (RCAF). Annually this method produces a productivity growth estimate from an output/input
index. The annual estimates are used, in turn, to generate a geometric mean over a moving five year time span. The resulting
mean productivity factor is then used to adjust the RCAF. Thus, the RCAF (adjusted) (to reflect changes in productivity)
is the product of both the productivity factor and the quarterly output/input index. Railroad rates linked to the
RCAF cannot exceed the level of the RCAF (adjusted) in a given quarter if they are to retain their statutory immunity
to challenge. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In disseminating the annual productivity growth estimate and the new 5-year average, the ICC has traditionally published
its calculations in a separate Ex Parte No. 290 (Sub-No. 4) decision in advance of the effective date. In a decision
served in this docket on December 3, 1993, we proposed to eliminate that notice and requested comments on its elimination
would be detrimental to the rail cost adjustment process. 


Our proposal to streamline the process by eliminating an administrative step has been opposed by the parties. Concern
over mathematical errors appears to be the major issue of commentors. The Western Coal Traffic League (WCTL) wishes
to continue reviewing and verifying the productivity factor in advance of its effectiveness. 
Additionally, both the Association of American Railroads (AAR) and WCTL urge the Commission to continue advance
publication of the productivity growth estimate and the new 5-year average. In their view, this procedure encourages
public dissemination and review of these calculations, thereby affording interested parties an opportunity to
verify the data inputs and to detect computational problems before the productivity adjustments is applied to the
RCAF. Both contend the burden is minimal, and the current advance notice procedure prevents major expenditures to
correct the RCAF if the preliminary calculations require modification. 
After consideration of the comments, we will continue to give timely advance notice of the yearly productivity estimate
in this proceeding which will be published in the 

Federal Register

 no later than November 15 in the year preceding its effective date. This will give the public ample time to review the
calculations before the effective date. 
This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or energy conservation. 



Decided: March 29, 1994.



By the Commission, Chairman McDonald, Vice Chairman Phillips, Commissioners Simmons and Philbin.

Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR part 1152 subpart F_Exempt Abandonments
to abandon approximately a 0.71-mile line of railroad known as the Whiting Industrial Track, from approximately
milepost 448.89

#

 to approximately milepost 449.60

#

, in East Chicago, Lake County, IN. 

Conrail has certified that: (1) No local or overhead traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) no formal
complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity acting on behalf of such
user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District
Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (3) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</USDEPT>



<USBUREAU>Drug Enforcement Administration</USBUREAU>


Joseph Paul Mikalonis, M.D.; Denial of Application



On January 28, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator of the Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Joseph Paul Mikalonis, M.D. (Respondent), of South Boston, Massachusetts,
proposing to deny his pending application for a DEA Certificate of Registration as a practitioner under 21 U.S.C.
823(f). The proposed action was based on Respondent's material falsification of his application for a DEA Certificate
of Registration submitted on July 20, 1992. In addition, the Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent issued anorectic
controlled substances as appetite suppressants, in violation of applicable state law. 

The Order to Show Cause was sent to Respondent by registered mail. More than thirty days have passed since the Order
to Show Cause was received by Respondent and the DEA has received no response thereto. Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(a)
and 1301.54(d), Respondent is deemed to have waived his opportunity for a hearing. Accordingly, the Administrator
now enters his final order in this matter without a hearing and based upon the investigative file. 21 CFR 1301.57. 

The Administrator finds that Respondent submitted an application for a DEA Certificate of Registration on July 20,
1992. Respondent indicated on such application that he had never surrendered a DEA Certificate of Registration for
cause, when in fact, he had voluntarily surrendered his prior DEA Certificate of Registration, AM1950371, for cause,
on May 20, 1992.

Between December 1991 and May 1992, Respondent also issued numerous prescriptions for anorectic controlled substances
for purposes of weight reduction. Under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, a physician is prohibited
from prescribing anorectic controlled substances for these purposes. Although Respondent eventually admitted
that the prescriptions were issued for the purpose of appetite suppression, the prescriptions themselves indicated
that they were issued for other medical reasons. 

The Administrator may deny an application for a DEA Certificate of Registration if he determines that the registration
would be inconsistent with the public interest. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), ``(i)n determining the public interest,
the following factors will be considered:

(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority. 

(2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances.

(3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or
dispensing of controlled substances. 

(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances.

<DOCNO> FR940407-2-00089 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940407-2-00049 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.''

In determining whether a registration would be inconsistent with the public interest, the Administrator is not required
to make findings with respect to each of the factors listed above. Instead, the Administrator has the discretion to
give each factor the weight he deems appropriate, depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. See 

David E. Trawick, D.D.S.,

 53 FR 5326 (1988).

In this proceeding factors two, four and five apply. Factors two and four apply because Respondent prescribed numerous
anorectic controlled substances to patients for weight reduction in violation of state law. Furthermore, Respondent
issued these prescriptions under false pretenses by indicating on the prescriptions that they were issued for medical
treatment other than weight reduction. Factor five is established based upon Respondent's material falsification
of his application for a DEA Certificate of Registration, dated July 20, 1992.

No evidence of explanation or mitigating circumstances has been offered by Respondent. Therefore, the Administrator
concludes that Respondent's application for a DEA Certificate of Registration must be denied.

Accordingly, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him
by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b), hereby orders that the application executed by Joseph Paul Mikalonis,
M.D., on July 20, 1992, for a DEA Certificate of Registration as a practitioner, be, and it hereby is, denied. This order
is effective April 7, 1994.

Aluminum Company of America, Lafayette, IN; Negative Determination on Reconsideration



On March 22, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration
for workers and former workers of the subject firm. This notice will soon be published in the 

Federal Register

.

The application for reconsideration states that the Department's survey was inadequate in that only the hard alloy
customers were surveyed, not the soft alloy customers. It was also stated that (1) the Russians were dumping large
amounts of aluminum in the open market and that (2) workers at two other Alcoa locations were certified for TAA_Newburgh,
Indiana and Wenatchee, Washington.

Investigation findings show that the workers produce both hard and soft aluminum extrusions and tubes.

Other investigation findings show that in 1993 Lafayette exited the commercial extrusion (soft alloy) business
because of non-trade reasons.

The Department's denial was based on the fact that the ``contributed importantly'' test of the Group Eligibility
Requirements of the Trade Act was not met. This test is generally demonstrated through a survey of the workers; firm'
major declining customers. The Department's survey showed that none of the respondents reported purchasing imports
in the relevant period.

On reconsideration, the Department obtained the major declining customers of soft aluminum alloy extrusions. The
customers accounted for over half of the 1993 sales decline of all aluminum extrusions. The Department survey on reconsideration
found that the respondents did not import soft alloy extrusion during the relevant period but transferred their business
from Alcoa to other domestic producers.

Other findings on reconsideration show that Alcoa's Lafayette ingot production was used internally for the production
of extrusions and tubes at Lafayette. Lafayette did not use imported aluminum ingots. Lafayette's ingot production
decreased in 1993 because the company exited the soft alloy extrusion business.

Workers at Alcoa's Newburgh, Indiana (TA-W-28,848) and Wenatchee, Washington (TA-W-28,882)
produced aluminum ingots as the finished article and were certified for TAA because they met all the worker group requirements
in the period relevant to their petitions.



Conclusion



After reconsideration, I affirm the original notice of negative determination of eligibility to apply for adjustment
assistance to workers and former workers of the Aluminum Company of America in Lafayette, Indiana.




Signed at Washington, DC, this 29th day of March 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Determinations Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance and NAFTA Transitional Adjustment
Assistance</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Labor herein presents summaries
of determinations regarding eligibility to apply for trade adjustment assistance for workers (TA-W) issued
during the period of March, 1994.

In order for an affirmative determination to be made and a certification of eligibility to apply for worker adjustment
assistance to be issued, each of the group eligibility requirements of section 222 of the Act must be met.

(1) That a significant number or proportion of the workers in the workers' firm, or an appropriate subdivision thereof,
have become totally or partially separated,

(2) that sales or production, or both, of the firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely, and

(3) that increases of imports of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by the firm or appropriate
subdivision have contributed importantly to the separations, or threat thereof, and to the absolute decline in sales
or production.



Negative Determinations for Worker Adjustment Assistance



In each of the following cases the investigation revealed that criterion (3) has not been met. A survey of customers
indicated that increased imports did not contribute importantly to worker separations at the firm.








TA-W-29,405; General Motors Corp., Inland Fisher Guide Div., Syracuse, NY

TA-W-29,443; Posner Laboratories, South Plainfield, NJ

TA-W-29,437; Philips Technologies, Airpax Protector Group, Frederick, MD

Subchapter D, Chapter 2, Title II, of the Trade Act as amended, the Department of Labor presents summaries of determinations
regarding eligibility to apply for NAFTA-TAA issued during the month of February, 1994.

the following group eligibility requirements of Section 250 of the Trade Act must be met: 

(1) That a significant number or proportion of the workers in the workers' firm, or an appropriate subdivision thereof,
(including workers in any agricultural firm or appropriate subdivision thereof) have become totally or partially
separated from employment and either_ 

(A) That sales or production, or both, of such firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely, 

(B) that imports from Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by such firm

or directly competitive with articles which are produced by the firm or subdivision. 



Negative Determinations NAFTA-TAA 



NAFTA-TAA-00029; Wundies Enterprises, Inc., Williamsport, PA 

 


The investigation revealed that criteria (3) and criteria (4) were not met. There was no shift in production from subject
firm to Canada or Mexico during the relevant period. 

Workers layoffs at the Williamsport facility occurred as a result of the company increasing its imports of articles
similar to those produced at the subject plant; these imports, however, were not sourced in Mexico or Canada. Workers
at the subject firm were certified as eligible to apply for trade adjustment assistance on January 13, 1994 (TA-W-29,274)
on the basis of increased company imports. 

 


NAFTA-TAA-00046; Sears Logistics Services, Inc., Philadelphia, PA 

 


The investigation revealed that workers of the subject firm do not produce an article within the meaning of the Act.
The Department of Labor has consistently determined that the performance of services does not constitute production
of an article as required by the Trade Act of 1974. 

 


NAFTA-TAA-00027; ACI America, Inc. (Currently VVP America, Inc.), DBA Glasscraft, Memphis, TN 

 



The investigation revealed that criterion (1) has not been met in conjunction with the requirements of Section 506
(b)(2) of the Act. Workers at the subject firm were not separated from employment on or after December 8, 1993, the earliest
date for which certification under NAFTA-TAA applies. 

 


NAFTA-TAA-00031; Bus Industries of America, Inc., Oriskany, NY 

 


The investigation revealed that criterion (3) and criterion (4) have not been met. There was no shift of production
by the subject firm to Canada or Mexico, and increased imports from Canada or Mexico did not contribute importantly
to worker separations at the subject firm. Further, as a result of the Department's denial for NAFTA-TAA, an
investigation is being immediately instituted for trade adjustment assistance under Section 221 of the Trade Act.
The number assigned for this trade adjustment assistance investigation is TA-W-29,680. 

 


NAFTA-TAA-00028; McCreary Roofing Co., Erie, PA 

 



The investigation revealed that workers of the subject firm do not produce an article within the meaning of the Act.
The Department of Labor has consistently determined that the performance of services does not constitute production
of an article as required by the Trade Act of 1974. 

 


NAFTA-TAA-00033; Fisher-Price, Inc., East Aurora, NY 

 

 


The investigation revealed that workers of the subject firm do not produce an article within the meaning of the Act.

Atlas Corp.; Receipt of Application To Amend Source Material License No. SUA-917 by Atlas Corp.





Notice is hereby given that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has received, is reviewing and is offering an opportunity
for a hearing on an application from Atlas Corporation to amend Source Material License No. SUA-917.



In general, the submittals referenced below propose to modify License Condition 41 by providing a revision of the
1982 approved reclamation plan for the mill tailings. As in the original reclamation plan, the proposed plan calls
for reclamation of the tailings impoundment in place, covering the tailings with a soil cover to reduce radon emanation,
and flattening the embankment side slopes to 10 horizontal to 3 vertical (10H:3V) or less. In addition, the license
amendment application proposes the following modifications of the previous plan:






1. As means of promoting surface water drainage, the original domed top configuration would be changed to a system
of channels. Three collection ditches would merge to form a larger drainage channel which would convey flood runoff
from the reclaimed tailings surface into Moab Wash.



2. The soil cover thickness for radon attenuation purposes would be reduced based on an increase in the allowable radon
emanation rate.



3. The erosion protection cover design would be modified. The top of the tailings impoundment would be covered with
a layer of compacted rock and soil, and the embankment side slopes would be covered with rock native to the region.



4. Moab Wash would be reconfigured and designed to contain the Probable Maximum Flood, and convey flood flows into
the Colorado River east of the tailings pile. On the southwest side of the tailings embankment, another drainage channel
would divert runoff from the natural sandstone bluffs southwest of the channel.






The licensee's proposal, currently under review, was first proposed to the NRC by a letter dated August 2, 1988, and
has been modified by submittals dated January 17, 1989, June 4, 1992, April 14, 1993, and April 23, 1993. Additional
information has been requested from the licensee by NRC letters dated October 8, 1993, November 29, 1993, and January
3, 1994. Responses to these letters may result in futher modifications to the reclamation plan.



For Further Information Contact: Allan T. Mullins, Uranium Recovery Branch, Division of Low-Level Waste Management
and Decommissioning, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, (301) 504-2578.





Availability of Application





Atlas Corporation's application would revise source material license SUA-917, The application, with the
revisions thereto, describes the proposed modifications to the reclamation plan, and is being made available for
public inspection at the Commission's Public Document room at 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC 20555.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc., Relating
to Listing Criteria for Certain Hybrid Securities




Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on February 25, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I,
II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the CBOE. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
on the proposed rule change from interested persons.




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change




The CBOE proposes to amend its rules to establish specific listing criteria for certain hybrid securities. The text
of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, the CBOE included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.




(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




The purpose of the proposed rule change is to revise certain of the Exchange's rules to permit the Exchange to list and
trade the following securities:




1. Contingent Value Rights




The Exchange is proposing to add rule 31.5.H. to its rules to establish specific listing criteria for contingent value
rights (``CVRs''). CVRs are unsecured obligations providing for a possible cash payment at maturity based on the
value of an equity security issued by an affiliate of the issuer of the CVRs (``related security''). At maturity, the
holder of a CVR would be entitled to a cash payment at maturity if the market price of the related security is lower than
a predetermined target price. If the market price of the related security equals or exceeds the target price, the holder
of the CVR would not be entitled to receive such a cash payment.


Under proposed rule 31.5.H., a CVR would be eligible for listing if:

(1) The issuer satisfies the net worth and earnings requirements set forth in Exchange Rule 31.5.A.;

(2) The issuer has assets in excess of $100 million;

(3) There is a minimum public distribution of 600,000 CVRs;

(4) There is a minimum of 1,200 public holders of the CVRs;

(5) The aggregate market value of the CVRs equals or exceeds $18 million; and


(6) The CVRs have an original term to maturity of at least one year. In the alternative, a CVR would be eligible for listing
if it meets the minimum standards as established by another national securities exchange.



2. Equity-Linked Notes




The Exchange is proposing to add rule 31.5.I. to its rules to establish specific listing criteria for equity-linked
notes (``ELNs''). ELNs are intermediate-term, non-convertible hybrid instruments whose value is based, in part,
on the performance of a highly capitalized, actively traded U.S. common stock or foreign security that is traded in
the U.S. in the form of American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs''), ordinary shares or otherwise. Under proposed rule
31.5.I., the issuer of ELNs must satisfy the earnings requirements set forth in Exchange Rule 31.5.A. and must have
a minimum tangible net worth of $150 million. In addition, although the Exchange does not believe that ELNs will have
any impact on the market for the underlying linked stock, ELNs listed for trading on the Exchange also must satisfy
the following criteria:


(1) An ELN must have an original term to maturity of not less than two and not more than seven years;


(2) The total original issue price of an ELN (when combined with all of the ELNs issued by the issuer which are listed
on a national securities exchange or traded through the facilities of the National Association of Securities Dealers
Automated Quotation system (``NASDAQ'')) cannot exceed 25 percent of the issuer's tangible net worth at the time
of issuance;

(3) The underlying stock must be listed for trading on a national securities exchange or traded through the facilities
of NASDAQ; 

(4) The issuer of the underlying stock either must be subject to the reporting requirements set forth in section 13
of the Act or exempt from such requirements pursuant to SEC rule 12g3-2(b);


(5) The issuer of the underlying stock must have either (x) a minimum market capitalization of $3 billion and trading
volume in the underlying stock during the 12-month period preceding the listing of the ELNs must have been at least
2.5 million shares, or (y) a minimum market capitalization of $1.5 billion and trading volume in the underlying stock
during the 12-month period preceding the listing of the ELNs has been at least 20 million shares;


(6) The amount of stock underlying an ELN cannot exceed five percent of the total amount of outstanding common shares
of such stock; and


(7) If the stock underlying an ELN is a foreign stock that is traded in the U.S. market, then either (x) the Exchange must
have in place a market information sharing agreement with the primary exchange on which the foreign stock is traded,
or (y) the combined U.S. trading volume of the foreign stock and other related securities
 must represent (on a share equivalent basis with respect to ADRs) at least 50% of the combined worldwide trading volume
in the foreign stock and other related securities over the three month period preceding the date of selection of the
ELNs for listing. Prior to listing ELNs for trading, the Exchange will distribute a circular providing guidance regarding
member firm compliance responsibilities when handling transactions in ELNs.






3. Paired Securities



The Exchange is also proposing to add rule 31.5.J. to its rules to set forth specific listing criteria for ``paired
securities.'' Under proposed rule 31.5.J., the term ``paired securities'' would be defined as securities which
may be transferred and traded only in combination with one another as a single economic unit. Under the proposed rule,
the issuers of the paired securities would be required to satisfy the size and earnings criteria set forth in Exchange
Rule 31.5.A. on an aggregate basis. In the event the pairing agreement between the issuers of the paired securities
is terminated, each issuer and each security would be required to satisfy the Exchange's continuing listing guidelines
on an individual basis in order for the security to remain listed for trading on the Exchange.


The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the
objectives of section 6(b)(5) of the Act in particular in that it perfects the mechanism of a free and open market by
expanding the types of securities that may be listed for trading on the Exchange.




(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition




The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose a burden on competition.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will: 




(A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. 



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection
and copying at the principal office of the CBOE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-CBOE-94-04
and should be submitted by April 28, 1994.

Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., Relating to an Interim Extension of the OTC Bulletin Board

 

 Service Through June 1, 1994</DOCTITLE>


March 31, 1994.


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on March 24, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons and is simultaneously approving the proposal.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


On June 1, 1990, the NASD, through a subsidiary corporation, initiated operation of the OTC Bulletin Board Service
(``OTCBB Service'' or ``Service'') in accord with the Commission's approval of File No. SR-NASD-88-19,
as amended.
 The OTCBB Service provides a real-time quotation medium that NASD member firms can elect to use to enter, update, and
retrieve quotation information (including unpriced indications of interest) for securities traded over-the-counter
that are neither listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market

SM

 nor on a primary national securities exchange (collectively referred to as ``OTC Equities'').
 Essentially, the Service supports NASD members' market making in OTC Equities through authorized Nasdaq Workstation
units. Real-time access to quotation information captured in the Service is available to subscribers of Level 2/3
Nasdaq service as well as subscribers of vendor-sponsored services that now carry OTCBB Service data. The Service
is currently operating under interim approval that expires on April 1, 1994.







The NASD hereby files this proposed rule change, pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Act and rule 19b-4 thereunder,
to obtain authorization for an interim extension of the Service through June 1, 1994. During this interval, there
will be no material change in the OTCBB Service's operational features, absent Commission approval of a corresponding
rule 19b-4 filing.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose


The purpose of this filing is to ensure continuity in the operation of the OTCBB Service while the Commission considers
an earlier NASD rule filing (File No. SR-NASD-92-7) that requested permanent approval of the Service.
For the month ending February 28, 1993, the Service reflected the market making positions of 384 NASD member firms
displaying quotations/indications of interest in approximately 4,182 OTC Equities.
During the proposed extension, foreign securities and American Depositary Receipts (collectively, ``foreign/ADR
issues'') will remain subject to the twice-daily, update limitation that traces back to the Commission's original
approval of the OTCBB Service's operation. As a result, all priced bids/offers displayed in the Service for foreign/ADR
issues will remain indicative.
In conjunction with the start-up of the Service in 1990, the NASD implemented a filing requirement (under Section
4 of the Schedule H to the NASD By-Laws) and review procedures to verify member firms' compliance with rule 15c2-11
under the Act. During the proposed extension, this review process will continue to be an important component of the
NASD's oversight of broker-dealers' market making in OTC Equities. The NASD also expects to work closely with the
Commission staff in developing further enhancements to the Service to fulfill the market structure requirements
mandated by the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990, particularly section 17B of the
Act.
 The NASD notes that implementation of the Reform Act entails Commission rulemaking in several areas, including the
development of mechanisms for gathering and disseminating reliable quotation/transaction information for ``penny
stocks.''




2. Statutory Basis


The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with sections 11A(a)(1), 15A(b) (6) and (11), and section
17B of the Act. Section 11A(a)(1) sets forth the Congressional findings and policy goals respecting operational
enhancements to the securities markets. Basically, the Congress found that new data processing and communications
techniques should be applied to improve the efficiency of market operations, broaden the distribution of market
information, and foster competition among market participants. Section 15A(b)(6) requires, 

inter alia,

 that the NASD's rules promote just and equitable principles of trade, facilitate securities transactions, and protect
public investors. Subsection (11) thereunder authorizes the NASD to adopt rules governing the form and content of
quotations for securities traded over-the-counter for the purposes of producing fair and informative quotations,
preventing misleading quotations, and promoting orderly procedures for collecting and disseminating quotations.
Finally, section 17B contains Congressional findings and directives respecting the collection and distribution
of quotation information on low-priced equity securities that are neither Nasdaq nor exchange-listed.

<PARENT> FR940407-2-00058 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The NASD believes that extension of the Service through June 1, 1994 is fully consistent with the foregoing provisions
of the Act.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The NASD believes that the rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others


Written comments were neither solicited nor received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


The NASD requests that the Commission find good cause, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, for approving the proposed
rule change prior to the 30th day after its publication in the 

Federal Register

 to avoid any interruption of the Service. Otherwise, the NASD will be required to suspend operation of the Service
pending Commission action on the proposed extension.
The NASD believes that accelerated approval is appropriate to ensure continuity in the Service's operation pending
a determination on permanent status for the Service, as required in File No. SR-NASD-92-7. Continued
operation of the Service will ensure the availability of an electronic quotation medium to support member firms'
market making in approximately 4,182 OTC Equities and the widespread dissemination of quotation information on
these securities. The Service's operation also expedites price discovery and facilitates the execution of customer
orders at the best available price. From a regulatory standpoint, the NASD's capture of quotation data from participating
market makers supplements the price and volume data reported by member firms pursuant to section 2 of Schedule H to
the NASD By-Laws.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withhheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the NASD. All submissions should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by April 28,
1994.


V. Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval


The Commission finds that approval of the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder, and, in particular, with the requirements of section 15A(b)(11) of the Act, which provides that the rules
of the NASD relating to quotations must be designed to produce fair and informative quotations, prevent fictitious
or misleading quotations, and promote orderly procedures for collecting, distributing, and publishing quotations.
The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the 30th day after the date of publishing
notice of the filing thereof. Accelerated approval of the NASD's proposal is appropriate to ensure continuity in
the Service's operation as an electronic quotation medium that supports NASD members' market making in these securities
and that facilitates price discovery and the execution of customers' orders at best available price. Additionally,
continued operation of the Service will materially assist the NASD's surveillance of its members trading in OTC Equities
that are eligible and quoted in the Service, and in non-Tape B securities that are listed on regional exchanges and
quoted in the OTCBB by NASD members.


It is therefore ordered,

 Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change be, and hereby is, approved for an interim period
through June 1, 1994.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12).

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Proposed Rule Change by New York
Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to Resolutions of the Exchange Board of Directors Authorizing the Exchange To Provide
Information Concerning Pending Formal Exchange Disciplinary Proceedings to the Central Registration Depository
for Disclosure to the Public</DOCTITLE>


March 31, 1994.


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 notice is hereby given that on March 17, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items
I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The NYSE has requested accelerated
approval of the proposal. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change
from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The Exchange Board of Directors (``Board'') has adopted the two resolutions shown below:


Resolved 

That each pending formal disciplinary proceeding initiated by the Division of Enforcement of the Exchange shall
be reported to the Central Registration Depository system (``CRD'') operated by the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''); and it is 

Further resolved

 That significant changes in the status of a pending formal disciplinary proceeding shall also be reported to the CRD
during the pendency of such a proceeding including the issuance of a decision by an Exchange hearing panel, the filing
of an appeal to the Exchange Board of Directors, and the issuance of a decision by the Exchange Board of Directors.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose


The proposed rule change authorizes the Exchange to provide information to the CRD
 concerning pending formal NYSE disciplinary proceedings, for disclosure to the public. A formal disciplinary proceeding
is considered to be pending from the time an executed stipulation is filed
 or charges are issued
 until the proceeding is completed. Currently, the NYSE discloses information only on final NYSE disciplinary actions
to the CRD.






Information concerning final disciplinary actions taken by the NYSE, NASD and other self-regulatory and regulatory
organizations, as well as information concerning certain criminal convictions contained in the CRD, has been disclosed
to the public pursuant to the NASD's 800 number service since October 1991.





On July 1, 1993, the SEC approved an NASD rule change to make more information available to the general public regarding
pending disciplinary proceedings or actions taken by federal or state securities agencies and SROs that relate to
securities or commodities transactions, and regarding criminal indictments and information.





Information on pending formal SRO disciplinary proceedings, among other events, is currently in the CRD, to the extent
that reports are made by members, member organizations and associated persons pursuant to their reporting obligations
on the Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration or Transfer (Form U-4) and Form BD, the uniform
application form for broker-dealer registration. However, the NYSE does not currently report such pending events
to the CRD.
The submission of information concerning pending formal disciplinary proceedings directly by the NYSE would enhance
the CRD database, since the CRD would not have to rely solely on reports from members, member organizations and associated
persons.


2. Statutory Basis


The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b)(5) in that it will protect investors
and the public interest as the increased disclosure will enhance the access of members of the public to information
regarding NYSE members, member organizations or any associated persons thereof.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change will impose no burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others


The Exchange has not solicited, and does not intend to solicit, comments regarding the proposed rule change. The Exchange
has not received any unsolicited written comments from members or other interested parties.

III. Solicitation of Comments 
 


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-NYSE-94-11
and should be submitted by April 28, 1994. 
 


IV. Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change 
 


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of section 6(b).
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(5)
 requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent
fraudulent and manipulative acts and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. 
 





In the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 (``Penny Stock Reform Act''), Congress
mandated that the NASD establish a toll-free telephone number (``800 number service'') for the purpose of receiving
and responding to inquiries from the public regarding the background of NASD members and their associated persons.
The NASD began operating its 800 number service on October 1, 1991. Upon the request of a caller, the NASD may disclose,
in the form of a written report, the following information contained in the CRD:
 past and present employment history of NASD members and their associated persons; all final disciplinary actions,
 taken by federal and state regulatory agencies and SROs, that relate to securities or commodities transactions;
and all criminal convictions reported on Form BD or Form U-4.
 





In 1993, the Commission approved a rule change by the NASD to expand the scope of information that is reportable through
its 800 number service.
 Thus, in addition to the information set forth above, the NASD may disclose to the public such events as pending formal
disciplinary actions initiated by federal and state regulatory agencies and SROs; criminal indictments or informations;
civil judgments; and certain arbitration awards in securities and commodities disputes involving public customers.
Currently, the NASD relies on members and associated persons to report these events to the CRD on Form BD or Form U-4,
respectively.
 Because this represents the only means by which the NASD can obtain data about pending disciplinary actions (other
than its own), the quality of the CRD database, and thus of the 800 number service, depends on complete and timely reporting
by members and associated persons.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940407-2-00111 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940407-2-00059 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In the Commission's opinion, the resolutions adopted by the Board should help fill a potential gap in the NASD's 800
number service, by authorizing the Exchange to report the initiation of a formal NYSE disciplinary proceeding
 involving an Exchange member, member organization or associated person, and significant changes in the status thereof,
 directly to the CRD. As a result, that information will be available to the public whether or not it is voluntarily reported
by the member or associated person. The Commission therefore finds that the proposed rule change should enhance the
fairness and accuracy of the CRD database and, accordingly, of information released to the public through the 800
number service.






The Commission has long believed that investors need access to reliable information in order to protect themselves
against potential fraud and abuse. In this respect, the NYSE proposal should help customers make an informed decision
about whether they should conduct or continue to conduct business with particular securities professionals. In
sum, the Commission has concluded that the proposed rule change should increase the flow of information to the public
and thus should ultimately strengthen investor protection.

The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register.

 The NYSE proposal will enable the Exchange to report and the NASD to disclose certain information about the disciplinary
history of securities professionals that currently may not be available to the public. Accelerated approval thereof
will allow investors to benefit from the implementation of these procedures as soon as possible. Further, the substance
of the proposed resolutions is similar to an NASD proposal that was published in the 

Federal Register

 for the full comment period and was approved by the Commission.








It is therefore ordered, 

Pursuant to section 19(b)(2)
 that the proposed rule change (SR-NYSE-94-11) is hereby approved.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing and Order Granting Partial Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change
by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to Equity-Linked Debt Securities</DOCTITLE>


March 31, 1994.


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and rule 19b-4 hereunder,
 notice is hereby given that on March 1, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items
I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The Exchange proposes to amend Paragraph 703.21 of its Listed Company Manual (``Manual'') regarding the listing
of Equity-Linked Debt Securities (``ELDS''). ELDS are intermediate-term (2-7 years), non-convertible hybrid
instruments whose value is based, in part, on the value of a highly capitalized, actively traded common stock or convertible
preferred stock.
 The proposed rule change would (1) provide alternative minimum capitalization and trading volume requirements
for the security underlying an ELDS issue, and (2) allow the listing of ELDS linked to non-U.S. securities. The text
of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, NYSE, and at the Commission.




II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NYSE has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C
below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


The purpose of the proposed rule change is to make two changes to the Exchange's listing standards for ELDS.
 The first change to the ELDS listing standards is to provide alternative market capitalization and trading volume
criteria for the linked security, that is, the security on which the value of the ELDS is based. Currently, such a security
must have a market capitalization of at least $3 billion and a trading volume of at least 2.5 million shares in the preceding
year.
 The proposed rule change will provide, as an alternative to that standard, the ability to list ELDS linked to a security
that has a $1.5 billion market capitalization and a one-year trading volume of at least 20 million shares. The Exchange
believes that this will provide additional flexibility in the listing of ELDS, while ensuring that the linked security
is highly capitalized and that there is adequate liquidity in the market for the linked security.





The second change to the ELDS listing standards would allow the issuer of the linked security to be a non-U.S. company
if certain criteria are met. Under the proposal, the issuer could be a non-U.S. company (whose securities are traded
in the United States either as ordinary shares or as American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'')) if one of the following
conditions is met:
 The Exchange has in place with the primary exchange for the security (and in the case of an ADR, with the primary
exchange in the home country of the security underlying the ADR) an effective surveillance information sharing agreement;
 The United States is the primary market for the security (determined in the manner discussed below); or
 The staff of the Commission otherwise agrees to the listing.
In determining whether the U.S. is the primary market for the linked security, the combined trading volume of the security
(including the security itself, any ADR overlying the security (adjusted on a share equivalent basis) and other classes
of stock related to the underlying security) in the United States for the three month period preceding the date of listing
must be at least 50% of the combined world-wide trading in such securities. The U.S. trading in the security would include
only those U.S. self-regulatory organizations included in the Intermarket Surveillance Group
 and linked through the Intermarket Trading System.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940407-2-00113 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940407-2-00060 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Trading in the U.S. in other markets would be included in the world-wide volume for the security, but not in the U.S.
volume.
The Exchange believes that allowing ELDS to be issued based on the value of eligible non-U.S. securities will provide
significant benefits to investors and the capital markets by providing increased investment and corporate financing
flexibility. The Exchange believes this flexibility will be achieved without compromising investor protection
by ensuring that the linked security either has its primary market in the United States or that the Exchange has access
to surveillance information from the primary exchange where the linked security is traded (and in the case of ADRs,
with the primary exchange in the home country where the security underlying the ADR is traded).
The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6 of the Act, in general, and with section
6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote
just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market
and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The NYSE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others


No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


The Exchange has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to section
19(b)(2) of the Act.
The Commission finds that the portion of the proposed rule change relating to the alternative minimum capitalization
and trading volume requirements for securities underlying ELDS is consistent with the requirements of the Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements
of section 6(b)(5)
 in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles
of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, the Commission finds that the proposal
will expand the universe of securities that can be linked to ELDS while maintaining the requirement that the linked
security be an actively traded common stock issued by a highly capitalized issuer. While the proposal introduces
an alternative, reducing by one-half the minimum market capitalization of the linked security, the stock of such
an issuer could only be linked to ELDS if its trading volume for the prior 12-month period exceeds by eight times the
current minimum trading volume set forth in Paragraph 703.21 of the Manual. Furthermore, the proposal does not alter
any of the other listing requirements applicable to ELNs contained in Paragraph 703.21 of the Manual which the Commission
has previously approved.
 As a result, the Commission finds that the proposed amendment is consistent with the Act.





The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

 in order to allow the Exchange to list ELDS linked to stocks satisfying the proposed alternative market capitalization
and trading volume guidelines without delay. In addition, the Commission notes it has not been made aware of any adverse
comments concerning the ELDS series currently listed and trading on the Exchange. Furthermore, the Commission believes
that the NYSE proposal does not raise any new issues that were not addressed to the Commission's satisfaction when
the listing and trading of ELDS was originally approved. Finally, the Commission has approved identical alternative
listing standards with respect to equity linked term notes (``ELNs'') listed and traded on the American Stock Exchange
(``Amex'').
 The Commission notes that the Amex proposal with respect to the alternative listing standards applicable to ELNs
was published for the full 21-day comment period and no comments opposing the proposal were received by the Commission.
Accordingly, the Commission believes that good cause exists to approve the proposed rule change on an accelerated
basis.




IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-NYSE-94-04
and should be submitted by April 28, 1994.


It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act
 that the portion of the proposed rule change (SR-NYSE-94-04) allowing securities underlying an
ELDS issue to have a minimum capitalization of $1.5 billion and a trading volume in the 12 months prior to issuance of
at least 20 million shares, in addition to satisfying the other requirements set forth in Paragraph 703.21 of the Manual,
is hereby approved.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Participants Trust Company; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change Relating to
the Percentage Margin Applied by PTC With Respect to GNMA Project, Construction, and Mobile Home Securities</DOCTITLE>



March 31, 1994.



On November 8, 1993, the Participants Trust Company (``PTC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR-PTC-93-04) pursuant to section 19(b)(1)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'').
 Notice of the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on January 31, 1994.
 No comments were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change.






I. Description



PTC seeks permanent approval of its proposed rule change establishing the percentages to be deducted from the market
value of certain securities to determine how those securities should be valued for purposes of participants' Net
Free Equity.
 The current proposal is substantially the same as the one the Commission temporarily approved on October 7, 1991.







Under PTC's rules, the Applicable Percentage
 of the market value of securities is used in computing a participant's Net Free Equity. PTC's rules require participants
to maintain Net Free Equity of zero or greater in each of their agency, pledgee transfer, or proprietary accounts in
order for transactions to be processed. PTC has the right to borrow against or liquidate those assets that comprise
the Net Free Equity computations in those accounts in the event that the participant responsible for one or more of
those accounts fails to pay the account debit balance at the end of the day. By including only a portion of the market
value of securities in Net Free Equity, 

i.e.

, the Applicable Percentage, PTC attempts to limit the risk caused by fluctuations in the market value of securities
in those accounts.





Under the proposal, PTC is seeking permanent approval of the following margin levels:




GNMA Project Loan Securities_10%

GNMA Project Note Securities_10%

GNMA Construction Loan Securities_12%

GNMA Mobile Home Securities_20%




PTC deducts 5% from the market value of GNMA Single-Family securities to arrive at their Applicable Percentage. That
percentage is based upon historical price volatility figures. Historical volatility of the Project, Construction,
and Mobile Home GNMA securities is similar to that of Single-Family GNMA securities, but PTC believes that the market
for those securities is less liquid. This is reflected in the higher margin levels for those securities.



II. Discussion



The Commission believes that PTC's proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A of the Act, and, specifically,
with sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F).
 Those sections require a clearing agency to be organized, and its rules be designed, to promote the prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement of securities transactions and to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds which
are in its custody or control or for which it is responsible.

The Commission approved the margin levels for Project, Construction, and Mobile Home GNMA securities on a temporary
basis on October 7, 1991.
 In that filing, PTC submitted historical data which suggested that the price movements of GNMA Project, Construction,
and Mobile Home securities tracked those of GNMA Single-Family securities.
 The Commission approved PTC's margin levels on a temporary basis to allow further evaluation by PTC of price movement
correlations between GNMA Single-Family securities on the one hand, and GNMA Project, Construction, and Mobile
Home securities on the other, as well as to gauge the volatility of such securities. In seeking permanent approval
of its margin levels, PTC submitted in support of its proposal data consistent with the price movement data in the original
filing.








The Commission is satisfied that PTC's proposal is consistent with the Act, but suggests that PTC review periodically
the price movement correlations and volatility described above. The Commission believes that the enhanced margin
levels for these securities will promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions
and assure the safeguarding of securities and funds in PTC's custody or control by limiting the risk arising from fluctuations
in the market value of Project, Construction, and Mobile Home securities when used to collateralize intraday processing
of securities transactions.



III. Conclusion



For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that PTC's proposal is consistent with section 17A of the Act.



It is therefore ordered, 

Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that PTC's proposed rule change (File No. SR-PTC-93-04) be, and hereby is, approved. 






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

Applicants' Representations




1. The Trust is an open-end management investment company that currently consists of three separate series (together
with any future series, the ``Funds''): (a) ValuGrowth Stock Fund, (b) Intermediate Bond Fund, and (c) Adjustable
U.S. Government Reserve Fund, each with its own investment objective and policy. The Trust filed its Notification
of Registration on Form N-8A under the 1940 Act on December 8, 1993, and its Pre-Effective Registration Statement
on Form N-1A under the 1940 Act and the Securities Act on January 21, 1994.

2. Forum supervises the overall management of the Trust and provides certain administrative facilities and services
for the Trust under a Management Agreement with the Trust. Forum also acts as the agent of the Trust in connection with
the offering of shares of the Funds under a Distribution Agreement with the Trust. Forum receives no payments for its
services as distributor. 

3. Shares of the Funds will be offered initially only to the Minnesota Mutual Life Insurance Company (``Minnesota
Mutual'') and Fortis Benefits Insurance Company (``Fortis'') to be used as investment vehicles for certain variable
annuity contracts, variable life insurance contracts and variable group life insurance contracts. Shares of existing
and future Funds also may be offered to separate accounts of insurance companies that are unaffiliated with Minnesota
Mutual or Fortis (together, ``Participating Insurance Companies'') to be used to fund various variable annuity
contracts, scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts, and flexible premium variable life insurance
contracts issued by the unaffiliated insurance companies (collectively with the Fortis and Minnesota Mutual contracts,
``Variable Contracts'').

4. Norwest Investment Management (``Adviser'') serves as Investment Adviser to the Funds. The Adviser is a part of
Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A., a subsidiary of Norwest Corporation, a multi-bank holding company. The Adviser has
not registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (``Advisers Act'') in reliance on the exclusions provided
under section 202(a)(11) of the Advisers Act and in reliance on the provisions of rules 6e-2(a)(7) and 6e-3(T)(a)(6)
of the 1940 Act.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. In connection with the funding of scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate
account registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust (``Trust Account''), rule 6e-2(b)(15) provides
partial exemptions from sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the 1940 Act. The relief provided by Rule 6e-2
is also available to a separate account's investment adviser, principal underwriter, and sponsor or depositor.

The exemptions granted by the rule 6e-2(b)(15) are available only where the management investment company
underlying the Trust Account (``underlying fund'') offers its shares ``exclusively to variable life insurance
separate accounts of the life insurer, or of any affiliated life insurance company.'' Therefore, the relief granted
by rule 6e-2(b)(15) is not available with respect to a scheduled premium variable life insurance separate account
that owns shares of an underlying fund that also offers its shares to a variable annuity or a flexible premium variable
life insurance separate account of the same company or of any affiliated life insurance company. The use of a common
management investment company as the underlying investment medium for both variable annuity and variable life insurance
separate accounts of the same life insurance company or of any affiliated life insurance company is referred to herein
as ``mixed funding.''

2. Additionally, the relief granted by rule 6e-2(b)(15) is not available with respect to a scheduled premium
variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of an underlying fund that also offers its shares to separate
accounts that fund variable contracts of one or more unaffiliated life insurance companies. The use of a common management
investment company as the underlying investment medium for variable life insurance separate accounts of one insurance
company and separate accounts funding variable contracts of one or more unaffiliated life insurance companies is
referred to herein as ``shared funding.''

3. In connection with the funding of flexible premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a Trust Account,
rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) provides partial exemptions from sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the 1940 Act.
The relief provided by Rule 6e-3(T) also is available to a separate account's investment adviser, principal
underwriter, and sponsor or depositor. The exemptions granted by rule 6e-3(T) are available only where the
Trust Account's underlying fund offers its shares ``exclusively to separate accounts of the life insurer, or of any
affiliated life insurance company, offering either scheduled contracts or flexible contracts, or both; or which
also their shares to variable annuity separate accounts of the life insurer or of an affiliated life insurance company
* * *'' Therefore, rule 6e-3(T) permits mixed funding with respect to a flexible premium variable
life insurance separate account, subject to certain conditions. However, rule 6e-3(T) does not permit shared
funding because the relief granted by rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) is not available with respect to a flexible premium
variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of a management company that also offers its shares to separate
accounts (including variable annuity and flexible premium and scheduled premium variable life insurance separate
accounts) of unaffiliated life insurance companies. 

4. Applicants therefore request that the Commission, under its authority in section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, grant relief
from sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the 1940 Act and rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) thereunder
for themselves and for variable life insurance separate accounts of the Participating Insurance Companies, and
the principal underwriters and depositors of such separate accounts, to the extent necessary to permit mixed funding
and shared funding. 

5. Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act makes it unlawful for any company to serve as an investment adviser to, or principal underwriter
for, any registered open-end investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to any disqualification
specified in sections 9(a)(1) or 9(a)(2). Rule 6e-2(b)(15) (i) and (ii) and rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) (i) and
(ii) provide exemptions from section 9(a) under certain circumstances, subject to limitations on mixed and shared
funding. The relief provided by rules 6e-2(b)(15)(i) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(i) permits a person disqualified
under section 9(a) to serve as an officer, director, or employee of the life insurer, or any of its affiliates, so long
as that person does not participate directly in the management or administration of the underlying fund. The relief
provided by rules 6e-2(b)(15)(ii) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(ii) permits the life insurer to serve as the underlying
fund's investment adviser or principal underwriter, provided that none of the insurer's personnel who are ineligible
pursuant to section 9(a) are participating in the management or administration of the fund.

6. Applicants state that the partial relief granted in rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) from the
requirements of section 9(a), in effect, limits the monitoring of an insurer's personnel that would otherwise be
necessary to ensure compliance with section 9 to that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of section
9. Applicants state that rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T) recognize that it is not necessary for the protection of
investors or for the purposes of the 1940 Act to apply the provisions of section 9(a) to the many individuals in an insurance
company complex, most of whom typically will have no involvement in matters pertaining to an investment company in
that organization. Applicants submit that there is no regulatory reason to apply the provisions of section 9(a) to
the many individuals in various unaffiliated insurance companies (or affiliated companies of Participating Insurance
Companies) that may utilize a Fund as the funding medium for variable contracts. 
7. Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii) provide partial exemptions from sections 13(a),
15(a), and 15(b) of the 1940 Act to the extent that those sections have been deemed by the Commission to require ``pass-through''
voting with respect to management investment company shares held by a separate account, to permit the insurance company
to disregard the voting instructions of its contractowners in certain limited circumstances.
Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii)(A) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(A) provide that the insurance company may disregard
voting instructions of its contractowners in connection with the voting of shares of an underlying fund if such instructions
would require such shares to be voted to cause such companies to make, or refrain from making, certain investments
which would result in changes in the subclassification or investment objectives of such companies, or to approve
or disapprove any contract between a fund and its investment advisers, when required to do so by an insurance regulatory
authority, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(i) and (b)(7)(ii)(A) of each rule.
Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii)(B) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(B) provide that the insurance company may disregard
contractowners' voting instructions if the contractowners initiate any change in such company's investment policies
or any principal underwriter or investment adviser, provided that disregarding such voting instructions is reasonable
and subject to the other provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(ii) and (b)(7)(ii) (B) and (C) of each rule.

Applicants believe that the limits on pass-through voting privileges contained in rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii)
should continue to apply under mixed and shared funding.


8. Applicants submit that shared funding by unaffiliated insurance companies should not present any issues that
do not already exist where a single insurance company is licensed to do business in several or all states. In this regard,
Applicants state that a particular state insurance regulatory body could require action that is inconsistent with
the requirements of other states in which the insurance company offers its policies. Accordingly, Applicants submit
that the fact that different insurers may be domiciled in different states does not create a significantly different
or enlarged problem.


9. Applicants state further that, under rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii), the rights of the insurance
company to disregard the voting instructions of its contractowners do not raise any issues different from those raised
by the authority of state insurance administrators over separate accounts, and that affiliation does not eliminate
the potential, if any, for divergent judgments as to the advisability or legality of a change in investment policies,
principal underwriter, or investment adviser initiated by contractowners. Applicants state that the potential
for disagreement is limited by the requirements in rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T) that the insurance company's disregard
of voting instructions be reasonable and based on specific good faith determinations.


10. Applicants submit that mixed funding and shared funding should benefit variable contractowners by: (a) Eliminating
a significant portion of the costs of establishing and administering separate funds; (b) allowing for a greater amount
of assets available for investment by the Funds, thereby promoting economies of scale, permitting greater safety
through greater diversification, and/or making the addition of new portfolios more feasible; and (c) encouraging
more insurance companies to offer variable contracts, resulting in increased competition with respect to both variable
contract design and pricing, which can be expected to result in more product variation and lower charges. Each Fund
will be managed to attempt to achieve its investment objectives and not to favor or disfavor any particular Participating
Insurance Company or type of insurance product.


11. Applicants believe that there is no significant legal impediment to permitting mixed and shared funding. Applicants
state that separate accounts organized as unit investment trusts have historically been employed to accumulate
shares of mutual funds which have not been affiliated with the depositor or sponsor of the separate account. Applicants
also believe that mixed and shared funding will have no adverse federal income tax consequences.

Applicants' Conditions 



The Applicants have consented to the following conditions: 

1. A majority of the Board of Trustees of the Trust (``Board'') shall consist of persons who are not ``interested persons,''
as defined by section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act and Rules thereunder and as modified by any applicable orders of the Commission,
except that, if this condition is not met by reason of death, disqualification, or bona fide resignation of any trustee
or trustees, then the operation of this condition shall be suspended: (i) For a period of 45 days, if the vacancy or vacancies
may be filled by the Board; (ii) for a period of 60 days, if a vote of shareholders is required to fill the vacancy or vacancies;
or (iii) for such longer period as the Commission may prescribe by order upon application. 

2. The Board will monitor the Trust for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between the interests
of the contractowners of all separate accounts investing in the Trust. A material irreconcilable conflict may arise
for a variety of reasons, including: (a) State insurance regulatory authority action; (b) a change in applicable
federal or state insurance, tax, or securities laws or regulations, or a public ruling, private letter ruling, no-action
or interpretive letter, or any similar action by insurance, tax, or securities regulatory authorities; (c) an administrative
or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding; (d) the manner in which the investments of the Trust are being managed;
(e) a difference in voting instructions given by variable annuity and variable life insurance contractowners; or
(f) a decision by an insurer to disregard contractowner voting instructions. 

3. Participating Insurance Companies and Forum will report any potential or existing conflicts, of which they become
aware, to the Board. Participating Insurance Companies and Forum will be obligated to assist the Board in carrying
out its responsibilities by providing the Board with all information reasonably necessary for it to consider any
issues raised. This responsibility includes, but is not limited to, an obligation by each Participating Insurance
Company to inform the Board whenever contractowner voting instructions are disregarded. These responsibilities
will be contractual obligations of all Participating Insurance Companies investing in the Trust under their agreements
governing participation therein, and such agreements shall provide that such responsibilities will be carried
out with a view only to the interests of the contractowners. 

4. If a majority of the Board, or a majority of the disinterested members of the Board, determine that a material irreconcilable
conflict exists, the relevant Participating Insurance Companies shall, at their expense and to the extent reasonably
practicable (as determinated by a majority of disinterested members of the Board), take whatever steps are necessary
to remedy or eliminate the irreconcilable material conflict, up to and including: (a) Withdrawing the assets allocable
to some or all of the separate accounts from the Trust or any Fund therein and reinvesting such assets in a different
investment medium (including another Fund, if any, of the Trust), or submitting the question whether such segregation
should be implemented to a vote of all affected contractowners and, as appropriate, segregating the assets of any
appropriate group (

i.e., 

annuity contractowners, life insurance contractowners, or variable contractowners of one or more Participating
Insurance Companies) that votes in favor of such segregation, or offering to the affected contractowners the option
of making such a change; and (b) establishing a new registered management investment company or managed separate
account. If a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a Participating Insurance company's decision
to disregard contractowner voting instructions, and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude
a majority vote, the Participating Insurance Company may be required, at the election of the Trust, to withdraw its
separate account's investment therein, and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. The
responsibility to take remedial action in the event of a Board determination of an irreconcilable material conflict
and to bear the cost of such remedial action shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies
under their agreements governing participation in the Trust and these responsibilities will be carried out with
a view only to the interests of the contractowners.

<TEXT>
 

For the purposes of condition (4), a majority of disinterested members of the Board shall determine whether or not
any proposed action adequately remedies any irreconcilable material conflict, but in no event will the Trust or Forum
be required to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract. No Participating Insurance Company shall
be required by this condition (4) to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract if an offer to do so has
been declined by a vote of a majority of contractowners materially affected by the irreconcilable material conflict.

5. The determination by the Board of the existence of an irreconcilable material conflict and its implications shall
be made known promptly in writing to all Participating Insurance Companies.

6. Participating Insurance Companies will provide pass-through voting privileges to all variable contractowners
so long as the Commission continues to interpret the 1940 Act as requiring pass-through voting privileges for variable
contractowners. Accordingly, each Participating Insurance Company will vote shares of each Fund held in its separate
accounts in a manner consistent with timely voting instructions received from contractowners. Each Participating
Insurance Company also will vote shares of each Fund held in its separate accounts for which no timely voting instructions
from contractowners are received, as well as shares it owns, in the same proportion as those shares for which voting
instructions are received. Each Participating Insurance Company shall be responsible for assuring that each of
their separate accounts participating in the Trust calculates voting privileges in a manner consistent with all
other Participating Insurance Companies. The obligation to calculate voting privileges in a manner consistent
with all other separate accounts investing in the Trust shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance
Companies under their agreements governing participation in the Trust.

7. The Trust will notify all Participating Insurance Companies that prospectus disclosure regarding potential
risks of mixed and shared funding may be appropriate. The Trust shall disclose in its Prospectus that: (a) Its shares
are offered to insurance company separate accounts which fund both annuity and life insurance contracts; (b) because
of differences of tax treatment or other considerations, the interests of various contractowners participating
in the Trust might at some time be in conflict; and (c) the Board will monitor the Trust for any material conflicts and
determine what action, if any, should be taken.

8. All reports received by the Board regarding potential or existing conflicts, and all Board action with respect
to determining the existence of a conflict, notifying Participating Insurance Companies of a conflict, and determining
whether any proposed action adequately remedies a conflict, will be properly recorded in the minutes of the Board
or other appropriate records, and such minutes or other records shall be made available to the Commission upon request.

9. If and to the extent rule 6e-2 and rule 6e-3(T) are amended, or rule 6e-3 is adopted, to provide exemptive relief from
any provision of the 1940 Act or the rules thereunder with respect to mixed and shared funding on terms and conditions
materially different from any exemptions granted in the order requested, then the Trust and/or the Participating
Insurance Companies, as appropriate, shall take such steps as may be necessary to comply with rule 6e-2 and rule 6e-3(T),
as amended, and rule 6e-3, as adopted, to the extent such rules are applicable.
10. The Trust will comply with all provisions of the 1940 Act requiring voting by shareholders (which, for these purposes,
shall be the persons having a voting interest in the shares of the Trust), and in particular the Trust either will provide
for annual meetings (except insofar as the Commission may interpret section 16 of the 1940 Act not to require such meetings)
or comply with section 16(c) (although the Trust is not one of the trusts described in this section) as well as with sections
16(a) and, if and when applicable, section 16(b). Further, the Trust will act in accordance with the Commission's
interpretation of the requirements of section 16(a) with respect to periodic elections of directors (or trustees)
and with whatever rules the Commission may promulgate with respect thereto.
11. The Participating Insurance Companies and/or Forum, at least annually, shall submit to the Board such reports,
materials or data as the Board may reasonably request so that it may fully carry out the obligations imposed upon it
by these stated conditions, and said reports, materials, and data shall be submitted more frequently if deemed appropriate
by the Board. The obligations of the Participating Insurance Companies to provide these reports, materials, and
data to the Board when it so reasonably requests, shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance
Companies under their agreements governing participation in each Fund.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.




Applicants' Representations




1. The Fund is a Maryland corporation registered as an open-end management investment company. The Fund currently
consists of twenty-five series of shares (each, together with any series subsequently established or otherwise
acquired is referred to as the ``Portfolio''). Each of the existing Investment Advisers is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of UAM, which is a holding company incorporated in Delaware for the purpose of acquiring and owning firms engaged primarily
in institutional investment management. The Fund's shares are distributed through the RFI Distributors division
of the Distributor. The Distributor of the Fund is a wholly-owned subsidiary of UAM.

2. Existing shares of each Portfolio (``Existing Shares'') are no load, are not offered in connection with a rule 12b-1
distribution plan, and are designed primarily for investment by high net worth individuals and tax-exempt fiduciary
investors who are entrusted with the responsibility of investing assets held for the benefit of others.

3. Applicants propose that the Fund issue additional, separate classes of shares (``New Shares'') designed for a
particular market. Each class of New Shares would be identical in all respects to the Existing Shares except for its
class designation, the allocation of certain expenses, voting rights, and exchange privileges.

<PARENT> FR940407-2-00065 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

4. In addition to the current class of Existing Shares, the Fund may offer several classes of New Shares: (1) In connection
with a distribution plan adopted pursuant to rule 12b-1 (a ``Distribution Plan'') and/or (2) in connection
with a non-rule 12b-1 shareholder services plan (``Shareholder Services Plan''). Shares offered subject
to the Distribution Plan are referred to as the ``Distribution Shares.'' The Distribution Plan and the Shareholder
Services Plan are collectively referred to herein as ``Plans.'' The Fund may offer an unlimited number of classes
of shares, either in connection with a Plan, with more than one Plan, or without any of the Plans. All classes of shares
issued by the Fund in connection with any order granted in response to the application will comply with all representations
and conditions contained herein.
5. Under each of the Distribution Plan and the Shareholder Services Plan, either the Fund or the Distributor enters
into servicing agreements (``Service Agreements'') with banks, broker-dealers, or other institutions, including
the Distributor if the Fund so elects (``Service Organizations''), concerning the provision of certain account
administration services to the customers (``Customers'') of the Service Organizations. Service Agreements under
the Distribution Plan also contemplate an asset-based sales charge to compensate Service Organizations for the
distribution of Distribution Shares and the provision of certain additional shareholder liaison services to Customers,
which services arguably could be considered to be distribution-related. The Shareholder Services Plan would be
used with respect to Service Organizations authorized to provide only personal and account maintenance services
under a Shareholder Services Plan, and the Distribution Plan would be used with respect to the Service Organizations
authorized to provide the distribution and distribution-related and liaison services under the Distribution Plan.
6. Under each Plan, depending on whether either the Fund or the Distributor was a party to a Service Agreement with a
Service Organization, the Fund or the Distributor (which would be reimbursed by the Fund) would pay a Service Organization
for its services and assistance in accordance with the terms of the relevant Plan and the particular Service Agreement
(``Service Payments''). Service Payments with respect to a Shareholder Services Plan are ``service fees,'' and
Service Payments with respect to a Distribution Plan are ``service fees'' or ``asset-based sales charges'' or both,
as defined in Article III, section 26 of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Rules of Fair Practice.





7. In the event that a Distribution Plan and a Shareholder Services Plan are adopted with respect to a single class of
shares, the Directors will apply the analysis required under rule 12b-1(d) to the aggregate amount paid under
such Plans in order to assure that, to the extent that the Plans may be deemed to overlap in some respects, compensation
shall not be duplicative as a result of the use of both Plans.
8. Under the proposed arrangement, each New Share or Existing Share in a particular Portfolio, regardless of class,
would represent an interest in the same portfolio of investments and would have identical voting, dividend, liquidation
and other rights, preferences, powers, restrictions, limitations, qualifications, designations and terms and
conditions, except that: (a) Each class of New Shares would have a different class designation; (b) each class of New
Shares offered in connection with a Plan (or Plans) would bear the expense of the Service Payments that would be made
under the Service Agreements that are entered into with respect to such class; (c) each class of shares could also bear
certain expenses described in condition 1 below (the ``Class Expenses'') that are directly attributable only to
the class; (d) only the holders of the shares of the class or classes involved would be entitled to vote on matters pertaining
to a Plan and any related agreements relating to such class or classes (for example, the adoption, amendment or termination
of a Plan in accordance with the provisions of rule 12b-1 or the terms of the Plan); and (e) each class would have
different exchange privileges.

<TEXT>
 


9. Certain expenses may be attributable to a particular Portfolio, but not a particular class. All such expenses will
be allocated to each class of shares in a Portfolio on the basis of the relative net asset values of the classes of that
Portfolio.


10. Except as noted below, each class of shares may be exchanged only for shares of the same class in another Portfolio
and in all events will be limited to within the same ``group of investment companies'' as that term is defined in rule
11a-3 of the Act. Exchanges will be permitted among classes should a shareholder cease to be eligible to purchase
shares of the original class by reason of a change in the shareholder's status. Exchanges among classes may be made
when a shareholder of a class becomes eligible to purchase shares of another class and ineligible to purchase shares
of the class originally held. This situation might occur, for example, when an investor who beneficially owned shares
held by an institution becomes the holder of legal title by reason of a distribution from the institutional account.
Such distributions may be occasioned by a termination of a trust and distribution of the corpus of the trust to beneficiaries.
An individual would become the holder of shares designed for institutions, and the individual may desire the services
offered by Service Organizations in substitution of the services formerly provided by the trustee of such trust.
In such a case, an exchange may occur upon the request of the shareholder.



Applicants' Legal Analysis




1. The proposed issuance and sale of certain classes of securities representing interests in the Fund's or future
Funds' investment portfolios, including the allocation of voting rights thereto and the payment of dividends thereon
in the manner described below, might be deemed to result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning of Section 18(g)
and to be prohibited by section 18(f)(1) and also to violate the requirement in Section 18(i) that every share of stock
issued by a registered management investment company shall have equal voting rights with every other share of outstanding
voting stock.


2. Applicants believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights relating to the Plans in the manner
described is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders. Although investors purchasing
shares offered in connection with a Plan would bear the costs associated with the related services, they would also
enjoy the benefits of those services and, in the case of Distribution Shares, exclusive shareholder voting rights
with respect to matters affecting such Plans. Conversely, investors purchasing shares that are not covered by a Plan
would not be burdened with such expenses or enjoy such voting rights. Moreover, because with respect to any Portfolio
the rights and privileges of shares would be substantially identical, the possibility that the interests of the various
classes of shareholders would ever conflict would be remote. The interests of each class of shareholders would be
adequately protected since the Plan, the Service Agreements and the Service Payments would conform to the requirements
of rule 12b-1 or the protection described in the application, including the requirement that they be approved
by the Board of Directors of the Fund.


3. The abuses that section 18 of the Act are intended to redress are set forth in section 1(b) of the Act which declares
that the interests of investors are adversely affected when investment companies by excessive borrowing and the
issuance of excessive amounts of senior securities increase the speculative character of the other securities,
or when investment companies operate without adequate reserves. The proposed arrangement does not involve borrowings
and does not affect the Fund's existing assets or reserves. Nor will the proposed arrangement increase the speculative
character of the shares in a Portfolio, since each class of shares in a Portfolio will participate in all of such Portfolio's
appreciation (if any), income and expenses (with the exception of the proposed Service Payments and Class Expenses)
on the basis of the applicable net assets of such class.

Applicants' Conditions



Applicants agree that the order of the Commission granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following
conditions.

1. Each class of shares of a Portfolio will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments and be identical
in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the classes of shares of a Portfolio will relate
solely to one or more of the following: (a) The differences in certain Class Expenses, which are limited to any or all
of the following: (i) Transfer agent fees identified by applicants as being attributable to a specific class of shares;
(ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports,
prospectuses and proxy statements to current shareholders of a specific class; (iii) Commission and Blue Sky registration
fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) the expense of administrative personnel and services as required to support
the shareholders of a specific class; (v) Directors' fees or expenses incurred as a result of issues relating to one
class of shares; (vi) accounting expenses relating solely to one class of shares; and (vii) legal expenses relating
to a specific class of shares; (b) expenses assessed to a class pursuant to a Shareholder Services Plan and/or 12b-1
Plan with respect to such class; (c) the fact that the classes will vote separately with respect to the Fund's Shareholder
Services Plan and/or any 12b-1 Plan; (d) the different exchange privileges of the classes of shares; and (e)
the designation of each class of shares of the Fund. Any additional incremental expenses not specifically identified
above which are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares shall not be
so allocated unless and until approved by the Commission pursuant to an amended order.

2. The Directors of the Fund, including a majority of the independent Directors, who are not interested persons as
defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Act (``Independent Directors''), will approve the offering of additional classes
of New Shares (the ``Multi-Class System''). The minutes of the meetings of the Directors regarding the deliberations
of the directors with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multi-Class System will reflect in detail
the reasons for the Directors' determination that the proposed Multi-Class System is in the best interest of both
the Fund and its shareholders.

3. The initial determination of the Class Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent
changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the Board of Directors including a majority of the Independent
Directors. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by the Fund to
meet Class Expenses shall provide to the Board of Directors, and the Directors shall review, at least quarterly, a
written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made.

4. On an ongoing basis, the Directors of the Fund, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise,
will monitor the Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the classes of shares. The
Directors, including a majority of the Independent Directors, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary
to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The distributor and the investment advisers will be responsible
for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the Directors. If a conflict arises, the distributor and the
investment advisers, at their own cost, will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered
management investment company.

5. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may be sold to particular investors.
Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Fund to agree to conform to such standards.

6. The Shareholder Services Plans will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule
12b-1 (b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b-1, except that shareholders
need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b-1.

7. The Directors will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning the amounts expended under the Shareholder
Services Plans and any Distribution Plans complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b-1, as it may be amended
from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular
class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related
to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the Directors to justify any fee attributable
to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and
approval of the Independent Directors in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.

8. Dividends paid by the Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount per outstanding share, except that
Service Payments made by a class under a Plan and any Class Expenses will be borne exclusively by that class.

9. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the classes
and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes have been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who has rendered
a report to the Applicants, which has been provided to the Commission, that such methodology and procedures are adequate
to ensure that such calculations and allocations would be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert,
or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being
made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Fund that the calculations and allocations
are being made properly. The reports of the Expert will be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the Commission
pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following
request by the Fund (which the Fund agrees to provide), will be available for inspection by the Commission staff upon
written request to the Fund for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management or a regional
officer of the Commission. Authorized staff members would be limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the
Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrator or Associate
or Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a report on policies and procedures placed in operation,
and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness''
as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards
as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.

10. The Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures
for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the classes of shares and the proper allocation
of expenses among the classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial
report referred to in condition (9) above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert,
on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition (9) above. Applicants will take
immediate corrective action if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert or appropriate substitute Expert.

11. The prospectuses of each class of shares will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other
person entitled to receive different compensation for selling or servicing Fund Shares may receive different compensation
with respect to one particular class of shares over another in the Fund.

12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the Directors
with respect to the Multi-Class System will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the Directors.
13. The Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees,
sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus,
regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. The Fund will disclose the respective
expenses and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports
will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the
Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class
basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent that any advertisement or sales literature describes
the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares of a Portfolio, it will also disclose the respective
expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares of such Portfolio. The information provided
by Applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of the Fund's net asset value or public offering
price will present each class of shares separately.
14. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by the application will not imply Commission
approval, authorization of or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Fund may make pursuant to
its Distribution Plan or Shareholder Services Plan in reliance on the exemptive order.

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given of a person who has had its export/retransfer privileges reinstated pursuant to section 38(g)(4)
of the Arms Export Control Act, (the AECA), (22 U.S.C. 2778(g)(4)) and  127.11(b) (formerly  127.10(b))

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 38(g)(4)(A) of the AECA and  127.11(a) of the ITAR prohibit the issuance of export licenses or other
approvals to a person, or any party to the export, who has been convicted of violating certain U.S. criminal statutes
enumerated at section 38(g)(1) of the AECA and  120.27 of the ITAR. The term ``person'' means a natural person
as well as a corporation, business association, partnership, society, trust, or any other entity, organization,
or group, including governmental entities. The term ``party to the export'' means the president, the chief executive
officer, and other senior officers of the license applicant; the freight forwarders or designated exporting agent
of the license applicant; and any consignee or end user of any item to be exported.





The statute permits export/retransfer privileges to be reinstated on a case-by-case basis after consultation with
the Secretary of the Treasury and after a thorough review of the circumstances surrounding the conviction or ineligibility
to export and finding that appropriate steps have been taken to mitigate any law enforcement concerns.
In accordance with these authorities Japan Aviation Electronics Industry, Ltd., Japan, (JAE), effective March
25, 1994, has had export/retransfer privileges reinstated pursuant to section 38(g)(4) of the AECA and  127.11

services subject to section 38 of the AECA and the ITAR.

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that all existing licenses and other approvals, granted pursuant to section 38 of the Arms Export
Control Act, that authorize the export or transfer by, for or to, Rexon Technology Corporation, Gary D. Kauf, Jerome
S. Shafir, James A. Bittel, Ronald L. Laib, Ordnance Technologies, Ltd., John Paul Grecian, and Bryan Mason, and any
of their subsidiaries, associated companies, or successor entities, of defense articles or defense services are
suspended. In addition, it shall be the policy of the Department of State to deny all export license applications and
other requests for approval involving, directly or indirectly, the above cited entities. This action also precludes
the use in connection with such entities of any exemptions from license or other approval included in the International
Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR parts 120-130) (ITAR).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Two indictments were returned on December 13, 1993, in the U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey. The first,
a five (5) count indictment, charging Rexon Technology Corporation, Gary D. Kauf, Jerome S. Shafir, James A. Bittel,
and Ronald L. Laib, with conspiracy (18 U.S.C. 371) to violate and violating section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act
(22 U.S.C. 2778) (AECA) and its implementing regulations, the ITAR. Second, a four (4) count indictment, charging
Ordnance Technologies, Ltd., John Paul Grecian, and Bryan Mason with conspiracy (18 U.S.C. 371) to violate and violating
section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778) (AECA) and its implementing regulations, the ITAR. The indictment
charges that the defendants conspired to export illegally 300,000 sets of United States-origin fuze components
to Iraq, while stating that the fuzes in question were for use by the Jordanian Armed Forces, without having first obtained
the U.S. Department of State requisite authorization. Also, the defendant was charged with causing a false statement
to be made in applications to the Department of State for licenses to export those defense articles to Iraq by supplying
a cover story that stated the fuzes were going to be assembled in Jordan and used by the Jordanian Armed Forces. (

United States

 v. 

Rexon Technology Corporation,

 U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, Criminal Docket No. CR-93-610).




On February 24, 1994, the Department of State suspended all licenses and other written approvals (including all activities
under manufacturing license and technical assistance agreements) concerning exports of defense articles and provision
of defense services by, for or to Rexon Technology Corporation, Gary D. Kauf, Jerome S. Shafir, James A. Bittel, Ronald
L. Laib, Ordnance Technologies, Ltd., John Paul Grecian, and Bryan Mason and any of their subsidiaries, associated
companies or successor entities. Furthermore, the Department of State precluded the use, in connection with the
named persons, of any exemptions from licenses or other approvals included in the ITAR.

This action has been taken pursuant to sections 38 and 42 of the AECA (22 U.S.C. 2778 & 2791) and 22 CFR 126.7(a)(2)
and 126.7(a)(3) of the ITAR. It will remain in force until rescinded.

Exceptions may be made to this policy on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the Office of Defense Trade Controls.
However, such an exception would be granted only after a full review of all circumstances, paying particular attention
to the following factors: Whether an exception is warranted by overriding U.S. foreign policy or national security
interests; whether an exception would further law enforcement concerns; and, whether other compelling circumstances
exist which are consistent with the foreign policy or national security interests of the United States, and which
do not conflict with law enforcement concerns.

A person named in an indictment for an AECA-related violation may submit a written request for reconsideration of
the suspension/denial decision to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. Such request for reconsideration should
be supported by evidence of remedial measures taken to prevent future violations of the AECA and/or the ITAR and other
pertinent documented information showing that the person would not be a risk for future violations of the AECA and/or
the ITAR. The Office of Defense Trade Controls will evaluate the submission in consultation with, 

inter alia,

 the Departments of Treasury, Justice, and other necessary agencies. After a decision on the request for reconsideration
has been rendered by the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs, the requester will be notified whether
the exception has been granted.

quality and customer service.




In view of these changes, for this year's industry day, we plan to present a series of speakers representing all segments
of the industry in lieu of the traditional panel sessions. These presentations, among other topics, will include
the Coast Guard marine safety program's new ``business plan,'' discussions on the Coast Guard's Maritime Regulatory
Reform Program, the status of several joint industry-Coast Guard initiatives to streamline and improve the vessel
inspection process, the latest on marine licensing, an update on several industry ``quality'' programs, and new

First Brands Corporation, Receipt of Petition for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance



First Brands Corporation (FBC) of Danbury, Connecticut has determined that some of its brake fluid fails to comply
with 49 CFR 571.116, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 116, ``Motor Vehicle Brake Fluids,'' and has filed
an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR part 573. FBC has also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and
remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.) on the basis that
the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety.
This notice of receipt of a petition is published under section 157 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety
Act (15 U.S.C. 1417) and does not represent any agency decision or other exercise of judgement concerning the merits
of the petition.
Section S5.1.7, Fluidity and Appearance at Low Temperature, of Standard No. 116 states:




When brake fluid is tested according to S6.7, at the storage temperature and for the storage times given in Table II_
(a) The fluid shall show no sludging, sedimentation, crystallization, or stratification;
(b) Upon inversion of the sample bottle, the time required for the air bubble to travel to the top of the fluid shall not
exceed the bubble flow times shown in Table II; and 
(c) On warming to room temperature, the fluid shall resume the appearance and fluidity that it had before chilling.






Table II of S5.1.7 states that when the brake fluid is stored at ^40
  

#

 2
  C. for 144 hours 

T1#

 4.0 hours the maximum bubble flow time is 10 seconds. When stored at ^50
  

#

 2
  C. for 6 hours 

#

 0.2 hours the maximum bubble flow time is 35 seconds.

NHTSA notified FBC that a sample of Prestone Brake Fluid, AS-400, failed to meet the requirements of S5.1.7 (NHTSA
file NCI 3293). FBC's initial investigation determined that the brake fluid was packaged on May 4, 1993, at its subsidiary,
Paulsboro, Packaging, Inc., and that the fluid was manufactured by Union Carbide Corporation (UCC) and identified
as UCC's PM6060, lot 

#

0319083. FBC further stated:




All [of the] product in FBC's distribution system packaged from the specific lot 

#

 0319083 was placed on hold and all packaging of Brake Fluid PM6060 was ceased pending a full investigation and implementation
of corrective measures.
FBC produced 202,704 units (12.0 fl.oz.) from lot 

#

0319083, and currently has 61,752 units on hold at various warehouses.


Based on review of all data and consultation with USC, it is FBC's opinion that the noncompliance will not affect product
performance in a motor vehicle or create a safety concern.
FBC is recommending that no recall of [the] product outside of FBC's distribution system be made. It is further recommended
that the product in inventory (61,752 units) also be released for sale.




FBC also stated that it has elected to convert to an alternative UCC brake fluid identified as PM6340, which has a freeze
point of ^65
  C., and will provide an added margin to meet the requirements of S5.1.7., Standard No. 116.

In support of its petition FBC attached a letter from UCC, dated January 17, 1994. The UCC letter describes the results
of tests it performed on samples of the subject brake fluid:
 





Specifically with regard to the DOT ``Fluidity and Appearance at Low Temperature'' test (FMVSS 116, Section 5.1.7),
Union Carbide Corporation, using the DOT FMVSS 116 procedure, performed the test at ^40 C
  for 6 days [144 hours] and ^50
 C for 6 hours. Following completion of the tests:






_At ^40
 C for 6 days, the sample passed all requirements. The sample met the requirements for appearance at low temperature,
bubble travel time and room temperature appearance-fluidity properties. 

_At ^50
 C for 6 hours, the sample passed the requirements of bubble travel time and room temperature appearance-fluidity
properties. Upon completion of the 6 hours at ^50
 C, some crystallization was noted in the sample.

_Attempts were made to isolate the crystallized material. It was soft, non-abrasive gel that was difficult to isolate
as it flowed with the brake fluid.






Union Carbide Corporation also conducted the test of FMVSS 116,  5.1.7 on the sample with rigorous temperature
control at ^49
 C 

#

2
 C to more closely realize the ^48
 C limit of the test's specified temperature range  5.1.7 test parameter: ^50
 C 

#

2
 C). The sample was clear, showed no crystals, had a bubble travel time of approximately 5 seconds and regained
its appearance and fluidity at room temperature. These results were confirmed by a second run at the same conditions.

The Pour Point of the sample was measured according to the method of ASTM D97. [The] lowest temperature at which movement
in the liquid could be observed was determined to be ^62
 C.

From the results obtained and observations made, we are confident that this brake fluid will perform and provide braking
under the low temperature conditions of the FMVSS 116 standard,  5.1.7 and offer the following reasons in support
of this: 






_The fluid passed the ^40
 C/6 day fluidity and appearance test.

_The fluid showed appropriate viscosity at low temperature (^40
 C). 

_The fluid showed appropriate viscosity at ^50
 C (bubble travel time of [approximately 5 seconds against a requirement of 35 seconds [maximum]).

_Any crystallization observed was a soft, non-abrasive gel that flowed with the brake fluid. Further, the phenomenon
is fully reversible.

_The Pour Point of the sample was measured as ^62
 C.






Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments on the petition of FBC, described above.
Comments should refer to the docket number and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
Room 5109, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC, 20590. It is requested but not required that six copies be submitted.

All comments received before the close of business on the closing date indicated below will be considered. The application
and supporting materials, and all comments received after the closing date will also be filed and will be considered
to the extent possible. When the petition is granted or denied, the notice will be published in the

Part I_Preamble 


A. Legislative Authority 


The Senate Committee on Appropriations, in its recommendations, provides $5,500,000 for job creation demonstration
activities authorized under section 505 of the Family Support Act of 1988, Public Law 100-485. Sen. Rep. No.
143, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. 170 (1993). Section 505 of the Family Support Act of 1988 authorizes the Secretary to enter
into agreements with not less than 5 nor more than 10 non-profit organizations (including community development
corporations) for the purpose of conducting demonstration projects to create employment and business opportunities
for certain low-income individuals. 


B. Eligible Applicants 


The organizations eligible to apply for funding under this program is any non-profit organization (including community
development corporations) that is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
by reason of paragraph (3) or (4) of section 501(c) of such Code. Applicants must provide documentation of their tax
exempt status. Any of the following is acceptable evidence of non-profit status: (1) A copy of the applicant organization's
list in the Internal Revenue Service's most recent list of tax-exempt organizations described in section 501(c)(3)
of the IRS code; or (2) a copy of the currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. Failure to provide evidence of non-profit
status will result in rejection of the application. 


C. Definition of Terms 


For purposes of this Program Announcement the following definitions apply:



 

_Budget Period: The interval of time into which a multi-year period of assistance (project period) is divided for
budgetary and funding purposes. 
_Community-Level Data: Key information to be collected by each grantee that will allow for a national-level analysis
of common features of JOLI projects. This includes data on the population of the target area, the percentage on public
assistance, the percentage whose 
incomes fall below the poverty line, the unemployment rate, the number of new business starts and business closings,
and a description of the major employers and average wage rates. 
_Community Development Corporation: A private, locally initiated, nonprofit entity, governed by a board consisting
of residents of the community and business and civic leaders, which has a record of implementing economic development
projects or whose Articles of Incorporation and/or By-Laws indicate that it has a focus in the area of economic development.

_Hypothesis: An assumption made in order to test its validity. It should assert a cause-and-effect relationship
between a program intervention and its expected result. Both the intervention and result must be measured in order
to confirm the hypothesis. For example: Eighty hours of classroom training in small business planning will be sufficient
for participants to prepare a successful loan application. In this example, data would be obtained on the number of
hours of training actually received by participants (the intervention), and the quality of loan applications (the
result). 
_Intervention: Any planned activity within a project that is intended to produce changes in the target population
and/or the environment and can be formally evaluated. For example, assistance in the preparation of a business plan
and loan package are planned interventions. 
_Job Creation: To bring about, by activities and services funded under this program, new jobs. Jobs that were not in
existence before the start of the project. These activities can include self-employment/entrepreneurial training,
the development of new businesses or the expansion of existing businesses. 
_Non-profit Organizations: Any organization (including a community development corporation) exempt from taxation
under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by reason of paragraph (3) or (4) of section 501(c) of such
Code. 
_Private employers: Third-party private non-profit organizations or third-party for-profit businesses operating
in the same community as the applicant. 
_Process Evaluation: The ongoing examination of the implementation of a program. It focuses on the effectiveness
and efficiency of the program's activities and interventions (for example, methods of recruiting participants,
quality of training activities, or usefulness of follow-up procedures). It should answer questions such as: Who
is receiving what services?, are the services being delivered as planned?, and are client competencies improving?
It is also known as formative evaluation because it gathers information that can be used to improve the way a program
operates while the program is in progress. 
_Program Participant/Beneficiary: Any individual eligible to receive Aid to Families with Dependent Children
under Part A of Title IV of the Social Security Act and any other individual whose income level does not exceed 100 percent
of the official poverty line as found in the most recent Annual Revision of Poverty Income Guidelines published by
the Department of Health and Human Services. (See Attachment A.) 
_Project Period: The total time a project is approved for support, including any extensions. 
_Self-Sufficiency: A condition where an individual or family, by reason of employment, does not need and is not eligible

D. Purpose


The purpose of this program is to demonstrate and evaluate ways of creating new employment and business opportunities
for certain low-income individuals through the provision of technical and financial assistance to private employers
in the community, self-employment/micro-enterprise programs and/or new business development programs. A low-income
individual eligible to participate in a project conducted under this program is any individual eligible to receive
Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) under Part A of Title IV of the Social Security Act and any other individual
whose income level does not exceed 100 percent of the official poverty line. (See Attachment A.) Within these categories,
emphasis should be on individuals who are unemployed, those residing in public housing, and those who are homeless.


Part II_Program Priority Areas


A. General Projects 1.0


The Congressional Conference Report on the FY 1992 appropriations for the Department of Labor, Health and Human Services,
and Education and related agencies directs the ACF to require economic development strategies as part of the application
process to ensure that highly qualified organizations participate in the demonstration. H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 282,
102d Cong., 1st Sess. 39 (1991). These strategies should include descriptions of how projects financed and jobs created
under this program will be integrated into a larger effort to promote job and business opportunities for eligible
program participants. Proposed projects should demonstrate how their program will impact the overall community/communities
served by the applicant. OCS will only fund projects that create new jobs and/or business opportunities for eligible
program participants. Projects funded under this program must demonstrate how the proposed project will enhance
the participants' ability and skills in their progress toward self-sufficiency. Therefore, proposed projects
must show promise toward progress of achieving self-sufficiency among the target population. OCS expects that the
jobs and/or business/self employment opportunities to be created under this program will contribute to the goal
of self-sufficiency. The employment opportunities should provide hourly wages that exceed the minimum wage and
also provide benefits such as health insurance, transportation, child care, career development opportunities,
etc.
Applicants must show that the proposed project will create a significant number of new full-time permanent jobs through
the expansion of a pre-identified business or new business development and by providing opportunities for self-employment
to eligible participants.
While projected employment in future years may be included in the application, it is essential that the focus of employment
opportunities concentrate on new full-time, permanent jobs to be created during the duration of the grant project
period and/or on the creation of new business development opportunities for low-income individuals.
In creating self-employment business opportunities for eligible participants, the applicant must detail how it
will provide training and support services to potential entrepreneurs. The assistance to be provided to potential
entrepreneurs must include, at a minimum, technical assistance in basic business planning and management concepts,
and assistance in preparing a business plan (see Part IV, Criterion III for requirements) and loan application.
Any funds that are used for training purposes must be limited to providing specific job-related training to eligible
participants who have been selected for employment (expansion of an existing business or new business development)
and/or self-employment business opportunities.
In the review process, favorable consideration will be given to applicants with a demonstrated record of achievement
in promoting job and enterprise opportunities for low-income people. Favorable consideration also will be given
to those applicants who show the lowest cost-per-job created for low-income individuals. For this program, OCS views
$15,000 as the maximum amount for the creation of a job and, unless there are extenuating circumstances, will not fund
projects where the cost-per-job in OCS funds exceeds this amount. Only those jobs created and filled by low-income
people will be counted in the cost-per-job formula. (See Part IV, Criterion IV)
Technical assistance should be specifically addressed to the needs of the private employer in creating new jobs to
be filled by eligible individuals and/or to the individuals themselves such as skills training, job preparation,
self-esteem building, etc. Financial assistance may be provided to the private employer as well as the individual.
If the technical and/or financial assistance is to be provided to pre-identified businesses that will be expanded
or franchised, written comments from the businesses must be included with the application.

<PARENT> FR940407-2-00081 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The creation of a revolving loan fund with funds received under this program is an allowable activity. However, OCS
encourages the use of funds from other sources for this purpose. Points will be awarded in the review process to those
applicants who leverage funds from other sources. (See Part IV, Criterion VI.) Loans made to eligible beneficiaries
for business development activities must be at or below market rate.



(

Note: 

Interest accrued on revolving loan funds may be used to continue or expand the activities of the approved project.)



Grant funds received under this program may not be used for construction.
A formal, cooperative relationship between the applicant and the agency responsible for administering the Job Opportunities
and Basic Skills (JOBS) training program (as provided for under title IV-A of the Social Security Act) in the
area served by the project is a requirement for funding. The application must include a signed, written agreement
between the applicant and the local JOBS agency, or a letter of commitment (contingent only on receipt of OCS funds).
The agreement must describe the cooperative relationship, including specific activities and/or actions each of
these entities propose to carry out over the course of the grant period in support of the project.
The agreement, at a minimum, must cover activities that will be provided to the target population and which are related
to one or more of the mandatory or optional components offered by the appropriate State's JOBS program. The mandatory
activities offered by the States' JOBS programs consist of the following components: Basic education activities,
job skills training, job readiness activities, job development and job placement. The optional components offered
by the States' JOBS programs include: Group and individual job search counseling and training on job seeking skills;
on-the-job-training; work supplementation; and community work experience. (See Attachment I for a list of the State
JOBS agencies.)
Projects also must include an independent, methodologically sound evaluation of the effectiveness of the activities
carried out with the grant funds in creating new jobs and business opportunities. (See Part IV, Criterion V).
Applications should include a plan for disseminating the results of the project after expiration of the grant period.
Applicants may budget up to $1,000 for dissemination purposes.
Priority will be given to applications proposing to serve those areas containing the highest percentage of individuals
receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children under Title IV-A of the Social Security Act. (See Part IV,
Criterion II.)


B. Community Development Corporations Set-Aside 2.0


For Fiscal Year 1994, a set-aside fund of $1 million will be included for community development corporations. A community
development corporation for purposes of this set-aside fund is a private, non-profit entity which has a record of
implementing economic development projects or, whose Articles of Incorporation and/or By-Laws indicate that it
has a focus in the area of economic development, and which has a tax exempt determination under Section 501(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by reason of paragraph (3) or (4) of Section 501(c) of such code.
Such projects must conform to the purposes, requirements, and prohibitions applicable to those submitted under
Part II, General Projects 1.0.
Applications for these set-aside funds which are not funded due to the limited amount of funds available will also
be considered competitively within the larger pool of eligible applicants.


Part III_Application Requirements


A. Background Information


1. Availability of Funds and Grant Amounts


The Office of Community Services expects to award approximately $5,500,000 by September 30, 1994 for new grants under
this program.
A maximum of $500,000 for the entire multi-year project period will be awarded to selected organizations under this
program in FY 94. OCS will award no less than 5 and no more than 10 grants under this program. Due to the limited number
of grants available under this program, only one grant will be allowed to any organization.


2. Project and Budgets Periods




Project and budget periods will be 36 months. 

Full funding of the three-year project and budget periods in FY 94 assures stability for these 36 months.


3. Mobilization of Resources


OCS will give favorable consideration in the review process to applicants who mobilize cash and/or third-party in-kind
contributions for direct use in the project. (See Part IV, Criterion VI.)


4. Program Participants/Beneficiaries

Projects proposed for funding under this announcement must result in direct benefits to low-income people as defined
in the most recent Annual Revision of Poverty Income Guidelines published by DHHS and individuals eligible to receive
Aid to Families with Dependent Children under Part A of title IV of the Social Security Act. 

Attachment A to this announcement is an excerpt from the guidelines currently in effect. Annual revisions of these
guidelines are normally published in the 

Federal Register

 in February or early March of each year. Grantees will be required to apply the most recent guidelines throughout the
project period. These revised guidelines also may be obtained at public libraries, Congressional offices, or by
writing the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402. 


No other government agency or privately-defined poverty guidelines are applicable for the determination of low-income
eligibility for this program. 



5. Cooperative Partnership Agreement 




A signed written agreement or letter of commitment between the applicant and the local JOBS (welfare) agency must
be submitted with the application in order to be reviewed and evaluated competitively. The agreement/letter must
describe the cooperative relationship and include specific activities and/or actions that each of the entities
proposes to carry out over the course of the grant period in support of the project. (Please review PART II, General
Projects 1.0 for additional specific information related to this agreement.) 



6. Prohibition and Restrictions on the Use of Funds 



The use of funds for new construction or the purchase of real property is prohibited. Costs incurred for rearrangement
and alteration of facilities required specifically for the grant program are allowable when specifically approved
by ACF in writing. 

If the applicant is proposing a project which will affect a property listed in, or eligible for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places, it must identify this property in the narrative and explain how it has complied with the
provisions of section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 as amended. If there is any question as
to whether the property is listed in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, the applicant
should consult with the State Historic Preservation Officer. (See Attachment D: SF-424B, Item 13 for additional
guidelines.) The applicant should contact OCS early in the development of its application for instructions regarding
compliance with the Act and data required to be submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services. Failure to
comply with the cited Act must 
result in the application being ineligible for funding consideration. 



7. Multiple Submittals 



Due to the limited number of grants which will be made under this program, only one proposal from an eligible applicant
will be funded by OCS for either the general project fund or the community development corporation set-aside fund.



8. Refunding 



OCS will not provide refunding to a previously funded grantee to conduct the same demonstration in the same target
area. 



9. Third-Party Project Evaluation 



Projects also must include an independent, methodologically sound evaluation of the effectiveness of the activities
carried out with the grant in creating new jobs and business opportunities. 


10. Economic Development Strategy 



Applicants must include an economic development strategy in accordance with the legislative reference cited in
Part II, Section A. 



11. Maintenance of Effort 




The application must include an assurance that activities funded under this program announcement are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, activities previously carried on without Federal assistance.

Applications which pass the pre-rating review will be assessed and scored by reviewers. Each reviewer will give a
numerical score for each application reviewed. These numerical scores will be supported by explanatory statements
on a formal rating form describing major strengths and weaknesses under each applicable criterion published in the
announcement. 

The in-depth assessment and review process will use the following criteria coupled with the specific requirements
described in Part III. Scoring will be based on a total of 100 points. 




(

Note:

 the following review criteria reiterate the collection of information requirements contained in Part VI of this
announcement. These requirements are approved under OMB Control Number 0970-0062 expiration 09-30-95.)




A. Criteria for Review and Assessment of Applications in Priority Areas 1.0 and 2.0 



Criterion I: Organizational Experience in Program Area and Staff Responsibilities (Maximum: 15 Points) 

(i) 

Agency's Commitment and Experience in Program Area 



The application includes documentation which summarizes two similar projects undertaken by the applicant agency
and the extent to which the stated and achieved performance targets, including permanent benefits to low-income
populations, have been achieved. Application indicates how the agency will verify the extent to which the performance
targets are achieved in this project. Application notes and justifies the priority that this project will have within
the agency including the facilities and resources that it has available to carry out the project. In addition, the
application describes how the job creation activities planned in this project relate to the job creation activities
of the agency and how this project will continue without investment from this source. 




(

Note:

 The maximum number of points will be given only to those organizations with a demonstrated record of achievement in
promoting job creation and enterprise opportunities for low-income people.) 



(ii) 

Staff Skills, Resources and Responsibilities 



The application must profile two or three individuals who will have the most responsibility for shaping the project,
connecting it to customers, and achieving performance targets. The focus should be on the energy, capacity and commitment
of those persons who will implement the project. Because this is a demonstration project within an already-established
agency, OCS expects that the key staff person(s) would be identified, if not hired. 

The application must include the minimum qualifications and a position description for the third-party evaluator
(independent entity, i.e. an entity organizationally distinct from, and not under the control of the applicant).
A third-party evaluator must have knowledge about and have experience in conducting process and outcome evaluations,
evaluating issues in the job creation field, expansion of businesses and the creation of self-employment and small
business opportunities for low-income neighborhoods and understands the complexity of the problems that target
population faces. The competitive procurement regulations (45 CFR Part 74, Appendix H) apply to service contracts
such as those for evaluators when the costs of such service will exceed $25,000. 

Described the facilities and resources (i.e. space, equipment, etc.) that it has available to carry out the project.




Criterion II: Analysis of Need (Maximum: 15 Points) 



The application includes a description of the geographic area and population to be served as well as a discussion of
the nature and extent of the problem to be solved. It should indicate what the unemployment rates are in the geographic
areas to be served and (to the extent practicable) cite how the proposed businesses and subsequent jobs will impact
on the nature and extent of the problem. It should also include documentation regarding the number and percentage
of individuals receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children and the total number of individuals which make up
the population in the area where the project will operate.

<PARENT> FR940407-2-00081 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Criterion III: Work Program (Maximum: 20 Points) 



The work plan and business plan(s), where appropriate, must be both sound and feasible. If the applicant is proposing
to use project funds to provide technical and/or financial assistance to a third-party private employer to develop
or expand a pre-identified business, the application must include a complete business plan. An application that
does not include a business plan where one is appropriate may be disqualified and returned to the applicant. 

The project must be responsive to the needs identified in the Analysis of Need. 



(i) Work Plan 




The work plan must include a hypothesis or hypotheses that is significant and includes the key interventions and permits
measurement of the extent to which the target population can achieve greater self-sufficiency as a result of its involvement
in the project. The key interventions should include the types of technical and financial assistance to be provided
the recipients, the level of effort, as well as other activities. If the technical and/or financial assistance is
to be provided to pre-identified businesses that will be expanded or franchised, written commitments from the businesses
must be included with the application. The work program must set forth realistic quarterly time targets by which the
various work tasks will be completed. Critical issues or potential problems that might impact negatively on the project
are defined and the project objectives can be reasonably attained despite such potential problems. The application
provides a description of the process evaluation which will culminate in the development of a policies and procedures
manual. 




(ii) Business Plan 




The business plan, where appropriate, is one of the major components that will be evaluated by OCS to determine the
feasibility of a jobs creation project. 


Because the guidelines were written to cover a variety of possibilities, rigid adherence to them is not possible nor
even desirable for all projects. For example, a plan for a service business would not require a discussion of manufacturing
nor product design. 


The business plan should include the following: 






_The Business and its Industry.

 This section should describe the nature and history of the business if the proposal is an expansion of an existing business,
including the following:

 


1. Products and services; 

2. Market research and evaluation (show that the product or service has a substantial market and can achieve sales
in the face of competition); 

3. Marketing plan (including the estimated market share and sales) 


4. Manufacturing and operations plan (describe the kind of facilities, plant location, space, capital equipment
and labor force 
[part and/or full-time wage structure] that are required to provide the company's product or service). 

5. Critical risk and assumptions (include a description of the risks and critical assumptions relating to the industry,
the venture, its personnel, the product's market appeal, and the timing and financing of the venture). 

6. Community benefits (identify low-income individuals to be employed); and 

7. A financial plan (In developing the financial plan, the following exhibits must be prepared for the first three
years of the business' operation: (a) Profit and Loss Forecasts_for each year; (b) Cash Flow Projections_for each
year; (c) pro forma balance sheets_for each year; (d) initial uses of project funds; and (e) any future capital requirements
and sources.

<TEXT>
 

(iii) 

Facilities 


If the rearrangement or alteration of facilities will be required in implementing the project, the applicant has
described and justified such changes. 


Criterion IV: Significant and Beneficial Impact (Maximum: 25 Points) 
(i) Quality of JOBS/Business Opportunities 


The proposed project is expected to produce permanent and measurable results that will reduce the incidence of poverty
in the community. Expected results are quantifiable in terms of the creation of permanent, full-time jobs or business
opportunities developed. In developing business opportunities and self-employment for low-income individuals
the applicant proposes, at a minimum, to provide basic business planning and management concepts, and assistance
in preparing a business plan and loan package. 
The application documents that:

 

_The business opportunities to be developed for eligible participants will contribute significantly to their progress
toward self-sufficiency; and/or 
_Jobs to be created for eligible participants will contribute significantly to their progress toward self-sufficiency;
they provide, for example, wages that exceed the minimum wage, plus benefits such as health insurance, transportation,
child care and career development opportunities. 


(ii) Cost-per-Job 


During the project period the proposed project will create new, permanent jobs or business opportunities for 
low-income residents at a cost-per-job below $15,000 in OCS funds, (e.g. cost per job is calculated by dividing the
total amount of grant funds requested ($420,000) divided by the number of jobs to be created (60) equals the cost-per-job
($7,000)). If any other calculations are used, please include your methodology in this section.

 



(Note: 

Except in those instances where independent reviewers identify extenuating circumstances related to business
development activities, the maximum number of points will be given only to those applicants proposing cost-per-job
created estimates of $5,000 or less of OCS requested funds. Higher cost-per-job estimates will receive correspondingly
fewer points.) 


Criterion V: Third-Party Evaluation (Maximum: 10 Points) 


A plan for a methodologically sound third-party (i.e., independent) evaluation of the demonstration project must
be included in the application. 


The Evaluation Plan: 



_Includes a specific working definition of ``self-sufficiency'' (consistent with the broad definition contained
in Part I) that permits the measurement of incremental progress of eligible individuals and their families from dependency
toward self-sufficiency; 
_Clearly defines the changes or benefits (outcomes) to be produced, the activities (interventions) that will 
produce the changes, and the measures of client progress toward self-sufficiency for which information will be collected
(for example: increases in income, decreases in public assistance payments); 
_Provides for the annual compilation of community-level data on the characteristics of the population in the project
area, including percentage on public assistance, percentage below the poverty line, unemployment rate, business
starts and failures, and major employers; 
_Provides for the conduct of a continuing process evaluation. This should include the periodic assessment of the
following: client characteristics, pertinent policies and procedures, staffing, cooperative partnerships with
state and local agencies, use of other community resources, client outreach and recruitment, client service delivery,
cost of services, and level of technical and financial assistance to employers. The types of data and information,
measures and indicators to be used for the process evaluation, as well as the methods and timeframe for collecting
and analyzing the required data should be indicated; 
_Provides for the completion of two interim evaluation reports and a final report. The final evaluation report will
describe the program design and any changes from the original workplan, outreach and recruitment results, 
interventions, and accomplishments. The measurement instruments, data collection procedures, and analysis techniques
should be discussed, and the report should yield conclusions as to how well the program works and why. It should also
discuss the program's potential for replication in other communities; and 
_Includes a realistic plan for disseminating the project findings to other interested organizations and public
agencies.

Criterion VI: Public-Private Partnerships (Maximum: 10 Points) 


_The cooperative partnership arrangements are fully described and clearly relate to the objectives of the proposed
project, and the activities include one or more of the mandatory or optional components of the State's JOBS program
as described in Part II, Section A. 
_The application documents that the applicant will mobilize from public and/or private sources cash and/or third-party
in-kind contributions. Applications that document that the value of such contributions will be at least equal to
the OCS funds requested, and demonstrate that the cooperative partnership arrangements clearly relate to the objectives
of the proposed project, will receive the maximum number of points for this criterion. Lesser contributions will
be given consideration based upon the value documented. 
_Applicants should note that partnership relationships are not created via service delivery contracts; partners
should be responsible for substantive project components or elements. 


Criterion VII: Budget Appropriateness and Reasonableness (Maximum: 5 Points) 


Funds requested are commensurate with the level of effort necessary to accomplish the goals and objectives of the
project. 
The application includes a detailed budget break-down for each of the budget categories in the SF-424A. The
applicant presents a reasonable administrative cost if an indirect cost rate has not been negotiated with the cognizant
Federal agency (See Part VI, Section B, Line 6j). 
The estimated cost to the government of the project also is reasonable in relation to the anticipated results.

C. Intergovernmental Review 



This program is covered under Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' and 45 CFR
Part 100, ``Intergovernmental Review of Department of Health and Human Services Programs and Activities.'' Under
the Order, States may design their own processes for reviewing and commenting on proposed Federal assistance under
covered programs. 

All States and Territories except Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota,
Montana, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Oregon, Virginia, Washington, American Samoa and Palau have elected
to participate in the Executive Order process and have established Single Points of Contact (SPOCs). 

Applicants from these seventeen jurisdictions need take no action regarding E.O. 12372. Applicants for projects
to be administered by Federally-recognized Indian Tribes are also exempt from the requirements of E.O. 12372. Otherwise,
applicants must submit any required material to the SPOCs as soon as possible to alert them of the prospective applications
and receive any necessary instructions, so that the ACF can obtain and review SPOC comments as part of the award process.
It is imperative that the applicant submit all required materials, if any, to the SPOC and indicate the date of this
submittal (or the date of contact if no submittal is required) on the Standard Form 424, item 16a. 


Under 45 CFR 100.8(a)(2), a SPOC has 60 days from the application deadline date to comment on proposed new awards. SPOCs
are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine endorsements as official recommendations. Additionally,
SPOCs are requested to clearly differentiate between mere advisory comments and those official State process recommendations
which they intend to trigger the ``accommodate or explain'' rule under 45 CFR 100.10. 





When comments are submitted directly to ACF, they should be addressed to: Department of Health and Human Services,
Administration for Children and Families, Division of Discretionary Grants, 370 L'Enfant Promenade, SW., 
6th Floor, Washington, DC 20447. 

A list of the Single Points of Contact for each State and Territory is included as Attachment E of this announcement.

Applications which meet the screening requirements in Part V, item E below will be reviewed competitively. Such applications
will be referred to reviewers for a numerical score and explanatory comments based solely on responsiveness to the
guidelines and evaluation criteria published in this announcement. 

Applications will be reviewed by persons outside of the OCS unit which will be directly responsible for programmatic
management of the grant. The results of these reviews will assist the Director and OCS program staff in considering
competing applications. Reviewers' scores will weigh heavily in funding decisions but will not be the only factors
considered. Applications generally will be considered in order of the average scores assigned by reviewers. However,
highly ranked applications are not guaranteed funding since other factors are taken into consideration, including,
but not limited to, the timely and proper completion of projects funded with OCS funds granted in the last five (5) years;
comments of reviewers and government officials; staff evaluation and input; geographic distribution; previous

program performance of applicants; compliance with grant terms under previous DHHS grants; audit reports; investigative
reports; and applicant's progress in resolving any final audit disallowances on previous OCS or other Federal agency
grants. 

OCS reserves the right to discuss applications with other Federal or non-Federal funding sources to ascertain the
applicant's performance record. 



E. Criteria for Screening Applicants 



1. Initial Screening 



All timely applicants will receive an acknowledgement with an assigned identification number. This number, along
with any identification code, must be referenced in all subsequent communications concerning the application.
If an acknowledgement is not received within three weeks after the deadline date, please notify ACF by telephone at

Part VIII_Post Award Information and Reporting Requirements
 


Following approval of the applications selected for funding, notice of project approval and authority to draw down
project funds will be made in writing. The official award document is the Financial Assistance Award which provides
the amount of Federal funds approved for use in the project, the project and budget period for which support is provided,
the terms and conditions of the award, and the total project period for which support is contemplated. 

Project directors and chief evaluators will be required to attend two national evaluation workshops in Washington,
DC. A program development and evaluation workshop will be scheduled shortly after the effective date of the grant.
They also will be required to attend, as presenters, the final evaluation workshop on utilization and dissemination
to be held at the end of the project period. 

Grantees will be required to submit quarterly progress and financial reports (SF 269) as well as a final progress and
financial report within 90 days of the expiration of the grant. Interim evaluation reports, along with a written policies
and procedures manual based on the findings of the process evaluation, will be due 30 days after the first twelve months,
and the second interim evaluation 30 days after the second twelve months, and a final evaluation report will be due
90 days after the expiration of the grant. This final report will cover 36 months of activities related to project participants.


Grantees are subject to the audit requirements in 45 CFR Parts 74 (non-profit organization) and OMB Circular A-133.


Section 319 of Public Law 101-121, signed into law on October 23, 1989, imposes new prohibitions and requirements
for disclosure and certification related to lobbying on recipients of Federal contracts, grants, cooperative agreements,
and loans. It provides limited exemptions for Indian tribes and tribal organizations. Current and prospective recipients
(and their subtier contractors and/or grantees) are prohibited from using appropriated funds for lobbying Congress
or any Federal agency in connection with the award of a contract, grant, cooperative agreement or loan. In addition,
for each award action in excess of $100,000 (or $150,000 for loans) the law requires recipients and their subtier contractors
and/or subgrantees (1) to certify that they have neither used nor will use any appropriated funds for payment to lobbyists,
(2) to submit a declaration setting forth whether payments to lobbyists have been or will be made out of nonappropriated
funds and, if so, the name, address, payment details, and purpose of any agreements with such lobbyists whom recipients
or their subtier contractors or subgrantees will pay with the nonappropriated funds and (3) to file quarterly up-dates
about the use of lobbyists if an event occurs that materially affects the accuracy of the information submitted by
way of declaration and certification. The law establishes civil penalties for noncompliance and is effective with
respect to contracts, grants, cooperative agreements and loans entered into or made on or after December 23, 1989.
See Attachment F for certification and disclosure forms to be submitted with the applications for this program. 

Attachment G indicates the regulations which apply to all applicants/grantees under the Job Opportunities for Low-Income
Individuals Program.

Instructions for the SF-424A



General Instructions



This form is designed so that application can be made for funds from one or more grant programs. In preparing the budget,
adhere to any existing Federal grantor agency guidelines which prescribe how and whether budgeted amounts should
be separately shown for different functions or activities within the program. For some programs, grantor agencies
may require budgets to be separately shown by function or activity. For other programs, grantor agencies may require
a breakdown by function or activity. Sections A, B, C, and D should include budget estimates for the whole project except
when applying for assistance which requires Federal authorization in annual or other funding period increments.
In the latter case, Sections A, B, C, and D should provide the budget for the first budget period (usually a year) and
Section E should present the need for Federal assistance in the subsequent budget periods. All applications should

plus or minus, as appropriate, the amounts shown in Columns (e) and (f). The amount(s) in Column (g) should not equal
the sum of amounts in Columns (e) and (f).

Line 5_Show the totals for all columns used.

Line 6k should be the same as the sum of the amounts in Section A, Columns (e) and (f) of Line 5.

Line 7_Enter the estimated amount of income, if any, expected to be generated from this project. Do not add or subtract
this amount from the total project amount. Show under the program narrative statement the nature and source of income.

Lines 8-11_Enter amounts of non-Federal resources that will be used on the grant. If in-kind contributions
are included, provide a brief explanation on a separate sheet.

Attachment H_Certification Regarding Maintenance of Effort



The undersigned certifies that:

(1) Activities funded under this program announcement are in addition to, and not in substitution for, activities
previously carried on without Federal assistance.

(2) Funds or other resources currently devoted to activities designed to meet the needs of the poor within a community,
area, or State have not been reduced in order to provide the required matching contributions.

When legislation for a particular block grant permits the use of its funds as match, the applicant must show that it
has received a real increase in its block grant allotment and must certify that other anti-poverty programs will not
be scaled back to provide the match required for this project.
