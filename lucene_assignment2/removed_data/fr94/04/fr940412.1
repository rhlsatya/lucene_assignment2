Immigration and Naturalization Service













Charging of Fees for Services at Land Border Ports-of-Entry



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule proposes to amend the regulations to allow the Immigration and Naturalization Service (the Service) to
charge a fee for the processing and issuance of specified documents at land border Ports-of-Entry (POEs). Consistent
with Federal user fee statutes and regulations, the Service has identified services that are currently provided
free of charge and for which it would be appropriate to impose a fee. The revenue generated by the collection of fees
for these application processing services will enable the Service to improve service to the public at land border
POEs.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Traffic at land border POEs has continued to increase dramatically in recent years. During FY 1992, Immigration and
Customs inspectors at land border ports completed more than 475 million inspections, representing an increase of
over 50 million more inspections than were completed in FY 1991. This growth in transborder traffic has made it increasingly
difficult to provide expeditious service to the traveling public. Immigration laws require that all applicants-for-admission
at land border POEs undergo a brief interview and preliminary screening in a primary vehicle or pedestrian lane. Those
found admissible are allowed to proceed without further delay. Persons who do not appear to be immediately admissible,
or who require further processing or documentation, are referred for a secondary inspection. Activities directly
related to secondary inspection include, among other duties, examining documents, conducting record checks, and
issuing permits for extended stays in the United States. Additionally, those submitting applications for benefits,
such as border crossing cards and boating permits, often require extensive interviews, as well as record checks,
document production, and other time-consuming paperwork.




Currently, appropriated funds are the major source of funding for the staffing of land border POEs. This funding has
not kept pace with the increased workload at land border locations. Despite the increase in traffic affecting inspection
services, and resulting new construction needed to expand the capacity of many land border POEs, no substantial increase
in appropriated fund has been received for land border positions within the last ten years.

The Service has sought to identify those services that are currently provided free of charge for which it would be appropriate
to impose a fee. Generation of sufficient revenue to recover the costs of providing specific services, such as document-processing,
is consistent with the Federal user fee statute (31 U.S.C. 9701) and regulations which require that recipients of
special benefits bear the costs of providing those services. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-25,
User Charges, states as a general policy that reasonable charges should be imposed to recover the full cost to the Federal
government of rendering such services. The specific application-processing services provided by the Service in
secondary inspection at land border POEs result in the issuance of documents that are beneficial to the specific user.
Therefore, it is appropriate that fees be charged to these users.

This rule proposes to permit the Service to impose a fee at land border POEs for the processing of Form I-94, Arrival/Departure
Record, and I-94W, Nonimmigrant Visa Waiver Arrival/Departure Form; Form I-444, Mexican Border Visitors
Permit; Form I-68, Canadian Border Boat Landing Permit; Form I-175, Application for Nonresident Alien
Canadian Border Crossing Card for issuance of Form I-185, Nonresident Alien Canadian Border Crossing Card;
and Form I-190, Application for Nonresident Alien Mexican Border Crossing Card, to replace a lost, stolen,
or mutilated Nonresident Alien Border Crossing Card, Form I-586.

Prior to development of this proposal, the total cost of providing these specific services to the public was included
as part of the total Service budget and was not separately identified. The fees proposed in this rule were determined
by an analysis of document-processing services and associated costs, and are calculated to recover the direct and
indirect costs to the government of providing these special services and benefits. As the Service collects more detailed
information related to providing these specific services, refinements to the cost base may be necessary.

These services and processes include, among other things, interviewing applicants, determining validity of documents,
conducting background checks, verifying information, providing assistance to complete application forms, issuing
the appropriate documents, and the administrative and support activities associated with providing these services.


The appropriate fee for each application was primarily based on an assessment of the amount of inspector direct labor
devoted to processing each type of application. To arrive at this assessment, the Inspections Program obtained work
hour information directly from various INS field offices. The estimate derived from this survey was then applied
to the estimated volume of each type of application to determine the total estimated inspector direct labor required
for each application. The number of supervisory inspector hours required was determined by applying a standard ratio
to the inspector direct labor estimate. Resource levels for training, management, and administrative support were
determined based on the current ratio of these functions to the areas to which they normally provide support. The associated
costs were calculated based on the level of support that would be required to process each application. Other identifiable
costs related to a specific application, such as card production costs, were calculated and applied to the specific
application. 

With the increase in transborder traffic, the demand for additional resources at land border POEs has become critical.
The collection of fees will allow the Service to support the secondary application-processing services provided
at land border POEs without depending on appropriated resources. Unlike appropriated funding, fluctuations in
fee revenues will correspond directly to fluctuations in workload. Consequently, in the event workload increases,
the level of fee resources available to fund the processing of applications would increase commensurately. It is
anticipated that the imposition of the fee-for-service charge will enable the Service to improve inspection services
at the land border. Once the fee revenues are available, appropriated resources formerly allocated to provide these
services may be redirected to augment staffing of vehicle and pedestrian traffic lanes. The resulting benefit would
be improved facilitation of traffic through the POE. 

The specific forms for which fees are being proposed are as follows: 

Forms I-94 and I-94W are issued to record the entry of many nonimmigrant aliens and serve as a form of alien
registration. These forms document the benefits of admission and permit the alien to travel anywhere within the United
States for a designated purpose and period of time. Payment of a fee will not be required when an I-94 is issued
for the purpose of paroling an alien into the United States. 

Form I-44 is issued in conjunction with presentation of a Nonresident Alien Border Crossing Card (BCC) or nonimmigrant
visitor's visa by a Mexican national requesting entry as a visitor for business or pleasure (B-1/B-2).
This form is issued in lieu of, and serves a similar purpose to, Form I-94, and is issued only to Mexican nationals
when they are traveling to the five-border-state area of Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, or Texas for a period
not to exceed 30 days. Current procedure allows the inclusion of several persons on one Form I-444. The proposed
regulation will require a separate form with fee for each individual; however, there is a family fee cap applicable
to a husband, wife, and minor children under 18 years of age. 

Form I-68 may be issued to eligible United States and Canadian citizens and residents to allow pleasure boaters,
who have been previously inspected and issued the form, to enter the United States by small boat from Canada without
the necessity of reporting for inspection upon each entry. Considerable personnel resources and work hours are spent
each year in its issuance, including record checks and INS outreach activities at boat shows, recreational clubs,
and other similar gatherings to facilitate registration in the program. This rule also provides for the issuance
of a Form I-68 for each individual, rather than for each family group, although a family fee cap is applicable
to a husband, wife, and minor children under 18 years of age.

Form I-185 (CBCC) is issued to Canadian citizens or lawful permanent residents of Canada having a common nationality
with Canada and is intended to facilitate the entry of those individuals into the United States. Since these groups
are automatically waived passport and visa requirements when crossing the border into the United States, Form I-185
is normally issued in conjunction with an approved waiver of excludability pursuant to section 212(d)(3)(B) of the
Act. Form I-185 therefore serves as evidence of a long-term waiver of inadmissibility for the holder of the document.
Currently, no fee is charged for this benefit, although each application requires substantial time to adjudicate
and provides a clear benefit to the applicant by eliminating the need for a yearly waiver application.

Form I-586 (BCC), and its former version Form I-186, offer the same privileges as the B-1/B-2
visa. The issuance of BCCs is a benefit which the Service performs voluntarily. No law or regulation requires the Service
to issue this document, which is an extremely desirable benefit to many Mexican nationals. Possession of the BCC allows
access to the area within 25 miles of the border for periods not to exceed 72 hours without the need for further documentation
upon each entry. With the issuance of other documentation, the BCC also allows travel to all parts of the United States
without the need to obtain a nonimmigrant visa and passport. The existing Agreement on Passports/Visas (Treaty)
between the United States and Mexico currently prohibits charging a fee for the initial issuance of a BCC. However,
the treaty does not specifically preclude charging a fee for replacement cards. The application process for replacement
is identical to the application for initial issuance, placing a significant demand on personnel resources. Institution
of a fee for the application for issuance of a replacement Form I-586 will help to make the process financially
self-supporting and substantially expedite issuance of the card.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that
this rule will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The fees proposed
in this rule, calculated to cover only the costs of providing the service, are nominal, and will apply only to individuals,
not small entities. This rule is not significant within the meaning of section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, nor does
this rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with
Executive Order 12612.

The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been cleared by the Office of Management and
Budget under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act. Clearance numbers for these collections are contained
in 8 CFR 299.5, Display of Control Numbers.

Advanced Medical Systems, Inc; Denial of Petition for Rulemaking 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 


 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Denial of petition for rulemaking. 


 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is denying a petition for rulemaking (PRM-32-3) from Advanced
Medical Systems, Inc. The petitioner requested that the NRC amend its regulations because it believed that the requirements
of part 32, which are applicable to original manufacturers and suppliers, were not equally applicable to manufacturers
and suppliers of replacement parts. The petition is being denied because current regulations apply equally to manufacturers
and suppliers of both original and replacement parts, ensuring the integrity of these parts; therefore, no additional
requirements addressing the regulation of manufacturers and suppliers of replacement parts are necessary. Further,
current regulations address service and maintenance of sources and devices possessed and used under an NRC license,
including replacement parts, whether manufactured or supplied by the original manufacturer or supplier or some
other manufacturer or supplier. Therefore the amendments suggested by the petitioner are not necessary. 


 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
The Petition 



In a letter dated June 28, 1991, Advanced Medical Systems, Inc. (AMS) filed a petition for rulemaking with the NRC.
The petition was docketed by the Commission on July 19, 1991, and was assigned Docket No. PRM-32-3. The
petitioner requested that the NRC amend its regulations because it believed that the requirements of part 32, which
are applicable to original manufacturers and suppliers, were not equally applicable to manufacturers and suppliers
of replacement parts. The petitioner has suggested two alternatives for accomplishing this objective. The first
alternative is to insert the necessary language regarding manufacturers and suppliers of replacement parts into
each appropriate section of part 32. The second alternative would revise the purpose and scope provisions of  32.1
to include manufacturers and suppliers of replacement parts. 



Basis for Petitioner's Request 



The petitioner identified itself as an original teletherapy equipment manufacturer. As such, it has a definite and
direct interest in the health and safety of the public who may use or be treated by equipment it manufactures. 

According to the petitioner, it appears that the requirements of part 32 are being interpreted as applying only to
manufacturers and suppliers of original equipment and not to manufacturers and suppliers of replacement parts,
devices, products, or sources designated for units originally manufactured or transferred by others. In the petitioner's
view, lack of specific requirements applicable to manufacturers and suppliers of replacement parts, devices, products,
or sources, can lead to use of inferior quality replacement parts which in turn can cause malfunction or failure of
devices, in particular teletherapy equipment, and thereby risk of overexposure. Advanced Medical Systems cited
two incidents as examples of this problem: Access No. M49250, Anderson Memorial Hospital, Anderson, South Carolina;
and Access No. M49324, St. Mary's Medical Center, Saginaw, Michigan. 



Public Comments on the Petition 



A notice of receipt of the petition for rulemaking was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 10, 1991 (56 FR 51182). Interested persons were invited to submit written comments concerning the petition.
The comment period closed December 9, 1991. The NRC received comments from the State of Illinois, Department of Nuclear
Safety, and the Department of the Air Force, Headquarters Air Force Office of Medical Support. 

The State of Illinois, Department of Nuclear Safety, stated that the Department fully supports development of the
rule proposed in the petition. The Department further stated that the integrity of NRC evaluated devices (NRC or an
Agreement State evaluate for safety any devices containing radioactive materials) may be compromised significantly
if nonstandard replacement parts are used during the life of the device. While the Department agreed that the issue
of replacement components needs to be addressed, it was concerned with the use of the term ``replacement sources and
devices'' in the wording of   32.74, 32.110 and 32.210 as suggested by the petitioner. The Department
believed that all sources and devices must be evaluated by the NRC or an Agreement State, whether or not they are considered
``original'' or ``replacement'' equipment. Therefore, the Department did not believe it is necessary to distinguish
between original or replacement sources or devices. The Department was in favor of the petitioner's suggested alternative
to modify  32.1, Purpose and Scope.

The Headquarters Air Force Office of Medical Support, Department of the Air Force, opposed the rule language proposed
by the petitioner, as written, although it agreed with the petitioner's intent to ensure that the safety and effectiveness
of devices not be compromised because original parts are replaced by inferior ones. They did not agree that all replacement
parts should be subject to the requirements of 10 CFR part 32. They stated that NRC review and approval should apply
to replacements of parts or components that are essential to the proper and safe operations of a device. The Air Force
gave examples of parts (such as panel screws and covers) that conform to industry standards. These, the Air Force stated,
should not be subject to the proposed requirements. The Air Force voiced concern that the petition, as written, may
serve to restrict competition and would lead to greater expense which would have to be recouped through higher medical
costs from patients, or, in the case of the Air Force, from taxpayers. 



NRC Action on the Petition 



The NRC reviewed the petition, the public comments, and the two cases (incidents) cited by the petitioner as supporting
evidence for filing this petition. The NRC also reviewed its regulations pertinent to the petition. 

Shortly after the NRC received correspondence
 from AMS about the two cases, the NRC advised
 AMS of its intention to investigate these incidents, especially with regard to the quality of service and replacement
parts used in servicing the teletherapy units. From October to December 1989, the NRC conducted a thorough investigation
which included three onsite inspections: Atom Mechanical Company, Cleveland, Ohio (The servicing company that
conducted the maintenance and replacement of parts in the two cases), St. Mary's Medical Center, Saginaw, Michigan,
and Picker International, Highland Heights, Ohio (The company that manufactured the teletherapy units at Anderson
Memorial Hospital and at St. Mary's Medical Center). The NRC also referred the case of Anderson Memorial to the State
of Maryland, because the company that serviced the teletherapy unit there, Atom Mechanical Company, is an authorized
user on the Neutron Products, Inc. license, and Neutron Products is located in the State of Maryland, an Agreement
State. 






The incident at Anderson Memorial Hospital was caused by a broken spring in a teletherapy unit which failed to retract
the source into the OFF position following a cobalt-60 cancer treatment. The hospital technologist promptly retracted
the source manually. According to the hospital report, the technologist received very little additional exposure
over expected monthly exposure, as evidenced by the individual's radiation film badge reading. Moreover, according
to the same report the delivered daily dose to the patient was less than the prescribed daily dose, i.e., no patient
overexposure for that treatment, because the technologist acted promptly. In its communication with NRC (prior
to filing the petition), AMS stated that it was concerned about the quality of the replacement springs used in the teletherapy
machine. 

The incident at St. Mary's Medical Center was caused by the failure of a microswitch. The failure of the switch prevented
a timing device from operating properly, to automatically terminate the treatment. No misadministration occurred
because the subsequent treatment times were adjusted and the total delivered dose did not differ from the total prescribed
dose. Neutron Products, Inc. was called to repair the machine.

The NRC investigation and subsequent inspections revealed several violations. Enforcement action was taken by
the NRC against Atom Mechanical for violation of part 21 requirements, and against St. Mary's Hospital and Picker
International for violations of part 35 and part 30 requirements, respectively.

3

 Moreover, the State of Maryland determined from its own investigation that the incident at Anderson Memorial Hospital
resulted from a failure of the part, i.e., breakage of the return spring. No enforcement action was taken by the State
of Maryland. 




Under current NRC regulations, persons authorized under a specific license to use devices containing byproduct
material (e.g., use of teletherapy equipment under a part 35 specific license) ultimately are responsible for the
safe use of these devices, and for assuring that such devices are properly maintained. Suppliers of sources or devices
containing byproduct material, whether they are an original manufacturer or a manufacturer of replacement sources
or devices, must be licensed under parts 30 or 32 or an appropriate Agreement State license, and also have responsibility
for the safety of the sources or devices that they supply or replace. Service or repair, which would include the replacement
of parts or components of medical or industrial sources or devices that present a risk of radiation exposure from the
failure of certain parts, such as the teletherapy devices discussed as examples in this petition, may be performed
only by qualified persons authorized under an NRC or Agreement State license (cf.   35.605, and 39.43(e)).
Some generally licensed devices may be serviced by general licensees who are authorized to perform limited service
work if sufficient information about the service work (e.g., procedures, training, expected dose, etc.) is submitted
by manufacturer or initial distributor and accepted by the NRC. However, these devices typically are not mechanically
complex and do not present the same risk of significant radiation exposure. Moreover, the NRC has no record of failure
of these devices leading to a radiation exposure attributable to defective replacement parts or improper servicing.
Finally, under the provisions of part 21, the supplier of any basic component,

4

 whether or not a licensee of NRC or an Agreement State, is also responsible for the quality of the component, whether
it is original or replacement. 




Reasons for Denial 


The NRC has examined the petition (1) in light of its regulations and policies for both general and specific licensees,
and (2) in view of the cases cited by the petitioner in support of the petition. The NRC is denying the petition because
current regulations apply equally to manufacturers and suppliers of both original and replacement parts, ensuring
the integrity of these parts; therefore, no additional requirements addressing the regulation of manufacturers
and suppliers of replacement parts are necessary. Further, current regulations address service and maintenance
of sources and devices possessed and used under an NRC license, including replacement parts, whether manufactured
or supplied by the original manufacturer or supplier or some other manufacturer or supplier. 
Accordingly, the petition for rulemaking is denied.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to Univair Aircraft Corporation
(Univair) Models Ercoupe 415-C, 415-CD, 415-D, 415-E, and 415-G, Forney F-1 and
F-1A, Alon A-2 and A-2A, and Mooney M10 airplanes. The proposed action would require installing
inspection openings in the outer wing panels, inspecting (one-time) the wing outer panel structure for corrosion,
and repairing any corrosion found. Several reports of corrosion in the outer wing panels of the affected airplanes
prompted the proposed action. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent wing structural damage
that, if not detected and corrected, could progress to the point of failure.

Discussion 
 


The FAA has received several reports of wing structure corrosion on Univair Models Ercoupe 415-C, 415-CD,
415-D, 415-E, and 415-G, Forney F-1 and F-1A, Alon A-2 and A-2A, and Mooney
M10 airplanes. At least four of these incidents revealed major corrosion in the outer wing panels.

Current maintenance inspection provisions do not allow for thorough viewing of the wing structure. With this in mind,
Univair issued Service Bulletin (SB) No. 29, dated January 27, 1994, which specifies procedures for (1) installing
inspection openings in the outer wing panels, and (2) inspecting the outer wing panels for evidence of corrosion.

 
After examining the circumstances and reviewing all available information related to the incidents described above
including the referenced service information, the FAA has determined that AD action should be taken to prevent wing
structural damage that, if not detected and corrected, could progress to the point of failure. 
 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other Univair Models Ercoupe 415-C,
415-CD, 415-D, 415-E, and 415-G, Forney F-1 and F-1A, Alon A-2 and A-2A,
and Mooney M10 airplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD would require installing inspection openings in
the outer wing panels, inspecting (one-time) the wing outer panel structure for corrosion, and repairing any corrosion
found. The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with Univair SB No. 29, dated January 27, 1994. The
inspection will become part of the affected airplanes' annual maintenance inspection program. 

 
The compliance time for the proposed AD is presented in calendar time instead of hours time-in-service (TIS). The
FAA has determined that a calendar time for compliance is the most desirable method because the unsafe condition described
by the proposed AD is caused by corrosion. Corrosion can occur on airplanes regardless of whether the airplane is in
service or in storage. Therefore, to ensure that corrosion is detected and corrected on all airplanes within a reasonable
period of time without inadvertently grounding any airplanes, a compliance schedule based upon calendar time instead
of hours TIS is utilized. 
 
The FAA estimates that 2,672 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take
approximately 8 workhours (maximum) per airplane to accomplish the proposed action, and that the average labor rate
is approximately $55 an hour. Parts cost approximately $67 (maximum) per airplane. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,354,704. This figure is based on the assumption
that no affected airplane owner/operator has accomplished the proposed action. 
 
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation
prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket
at the location provided under the caption ``

Safety Standards for Scaffolds Used in Shipyard Employment


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Labor.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; limited reopening of the rulemaking record.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is reopening the record for the proposed revision of the
regulation of scaffolds used in shipyard employment (part 1915, subpart N) (53 FR 48182, November 29, 1988). This
reopening incorporates the entire record for scaffolds used in the construction industry (part 1926, subpart L)
(Docket S-205, 51 FR 42680, November 25, 1986; Docket S-205A, 58 FR 16509, March 29, 1993; Docket S-205B,
59 FR 4615, February 1, 1994) including the scaffold-related materials from the record for the proposed general industry
standard for walking and working surfaces (part 1910, subpart D) (Docket S-041, 55 FR 13360, April 10, 1990)
that were previously incorporated into the subpart L record in Docket S-205B. Through this notice, the Agency
also requests input on the scope and application of subpart N; the appropriateness of replacing the term ``capable
person'' with the term ``qualified person'' throughout subpart N; the maximum permissible distance between the
front edge of a platform and the face of a vessel or structure; the requirements for a scaffold that the Agency considers
to be an interior hung scaffold; the frequency of scaffold inspections; the qualifications for persons performing
scaffold inspections; and the requirements for the performance of electric welding operations from suspension
scaffolds. In addition, this notice corrects a typographic error in proposed paragraph  1915.252(b)(18)(iv)
and invites public comment on that paragraph as corrected. The information received as a result of this action will
be used by the Agency in developing its final rule for scaffolds used in shipyard employment.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


A. Scope and Application 


Proposed  1915.251(a)(1) reads as follows:





(a) Scope and application. (1) This subpart applies to all scaffolds used in shipyard workplaces and operations (including
shipbuilding, ship repairing, and shipbreaking), but does not apply to construction operations in shipyards covered
under 29 CFR part 1926.




OSHA received only two comments (Exs. 6-1 and 6-3) on this paragraph. Both of those commenters stated that
the inclusion of the construction standards in the application of the shipyard standards is inappropriate and would
be counterproductive to efforts to bring uniformity to shipyard employment through a vertical standard. They suggested
that this paragraph be changed in order to apply part 1926 only to work being performed in a shipyard by outside non-shipyard
employees.

It should be noted that construction work in shipyards is performed by both shipyard employees and non-shipyard employees.
Shipyard employees fabricate and construct smoke stacks, tunnel sections, railroad cars, and bridge sections when
shipbuilding, ship repairing, and shipbreaking work are either unavailable or in short supply. This work involves
the use of scaffolds in shipyards. OSHA is considering whether all scaffold-related work performed at shipyards,
regardless of who performs the work, should be covered by standards in part 1915, subpart N. If the Agency adopts that
approach, subpart N will apply whenever employees perform work involving scaffolds, including construction operations
in shipyards.

The Agency notes that several types of scaffolds specifically addressed in the proposed construction scaffold standards
were not addressed in the proposed shipyard scaffold standards. If the Agency were to adopt a comprehensive approach
to scaffold use in shipyards, it would incorporate the various construction scaffold standards into part 1915, except
that the shipyard scaffold standard's threshold height for the provision and use of fall protection (5 feet (1.52
m)) would apply. Placing those standards in part 1915 would make the proposed reference to part 1926 unnecessary.

In addition, the Agency is considering if the use of the term ``shipyard workplaces and operations'' in proposed  1915.251(a)(1)
inappropriately limits the scope and application of proposed subpart N. Accordingly, OSHA is contemplating replacement
of the proposed term with the term ``shipyard employment'', so that the activities covered by subpart N would be described
accurately.

OSHA is also considering whether the proposed exclusion of construction operations from the scope of subpart N should
be limited to outside contractors using non-shipyard employees. Under such an approach, the scaffold operations
of outside (non-shipyard) construction employers would still be subject to part 1926, subpart L. In addition, OSHA
would require that scaffolds addressed by part 1926, but not by part 1915, comply with part 1926, regardless of who
the affected employers and employees were. Accordingly, the Agency seeks comment on all or part of the following alternative
language for proposed  1915.251(a)(1):

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940412-1-00014 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940412-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(a) Scope and application. (1) This subpart applies to all scaffolds, except as indicated below, used in shipyard
employment (e.g., shipbuilding, ship repairing, shipbreaking, and related employments), but does not apply to
construction operations being performed in shipyards by outside contractors using non-shipyard employees. 

(i) Types of scaffolds which are specifically covered by 29 CFR part 1926 subpart L, but which are not specifically
addressed by this subpart, shall meet the applicable requirements of part 1926 subpart L, except that fall protection
shall be provided for each shipyard employee working more than 5 feet (1.52 m) above a lower level on such scaffolds.




B. Qualified Person 



OSHA proposed in   1915.252 (b)(11), (b)(12), (b)(18)(i), and (d)(4) that scaffolds be evaluated by
a capable person, and in  1915.252(d)(7) that scaffolds not be erected, moved, dismantled, or altered except
under the supervision of a capable person. Furthermore, OSHA proposed the following definition, which is identical
to the definition of ``competent person'' in  1926.32(f), for ``capable person'': 




``Capable person'' means one who is capable of identifying existing and predictable hazards in the surroundings
or working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous to employees, and who has authorization to take
prompt corrective measures to eliminate them. 




At its meeting on November 20, 1991, the Shipyard Employment Standards Advisory Committee (SESAC) recommended (Tr.
p. 84) that OSHA replace the term ``capable person'' with the term ``qualified person'' throughout the shipyard standards
(29 CFR part 1915). Accordingly, OSHA is considering the appropriateness of replacing the term ``capable person''
with the term ``qualified person (QP)'' in the above-mentioned standards. The definition being considered for ``qualified
person (QP)'' is based on the definition for ``qualified'' found in  1926.32(l) of the construction standards
to which the word ``person'' and the clause ``and who has authorization to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate
any such problems'' have been added in order to indicate clearly that a ``qualified person (QP)'', for the purposes
of subpart N, would have both the ability and the authority needed to correct problems. Accordingly, OSHA seeks comment
on the following definition, which would apply to subpart N only: 




``Qualified person (QP)'' means an individual who by possession of a recognized degree or certificate of professional
standing, or who, by extensive knowledge, training, and experience, has successfully demonstrated the ability
to solve or resolve problems related to the subject matter, the work, or the project, and who has authorization to take
prompt corrective measures to eliminate any such problems. 




Does a person who evaluates scaffolds need authority over other employees in order to perform his or her duties? 



C. Maximum Distance Between the Front Edge of a Platform and the Face of a Vessel or Structure 



Proposed paragraph  1915.252(b)(4), which is effectively identical with proposed  1926.451(b)(4),
reads as follows: 




(4) The front edge of all platforms, except those on outrigger scaffolds, shall be positioned not more than 14 inches
(36 cm) from the face of the vessel, vessel section, building or structure being worked on, unless Type I guardrails
are erected along the open edge or body belt/harness systems are used to protect employees from falling. The maximum
distance for outrigger scaffolds shall be 3 inches (8 cm). 




OSHA is concerned that allowing a 14-inch (36 cm) opening may not be justified by the nature of work performed in shipyards.
Unlike construction work, where an opening of up to 14 inches (36 cm) may be necessary if the structure is being constructed
outward toward the scaffold, the fabrication of vessels and similar structures by shipyard workers is not usually
conducted in that manner. Accordingly, OSHA seeks public comment on the appropriateness of reducing the maximum
space allowed between the front edge of a platform and the face of the structure. Should OSHA extend the 3-inch (7.62
cm) maximum distance provision for outrigger scaffolds to cover all scaffolds? Should OSHA set some other distance?
If so, what should that distance be? Please submit supporting information with any suggestions. 



D. Interior Hung Scaffolds 



OSHA recently became aware of a type of scaffold used in shipyards that consists of single-level or multi-level platforms
suspended by several wire ropes attached to ``S'' hooks inserted through openings in the overhead longitudinal structural
members in tanks. Wire rope clips are used to form the ends of the ropes into eyes. Those eyes are placed over the bottom
of the ``S'' hooks. The platforms are supported by horizontal struts (usually, metal pipes) with slotted ends into
which the suspension ropes are placed with a bolt or wire placed at the end of the opening. The struts rest on wire rope
clips attached to the suspension ropes. OSHA is concerned that the proposed rules may not adequately address these
scaffolds. The Agency also has some concerns about the adequacy of the proposed requirements for suspension scaffolds,
in general. Accordingly, OSHA seeks public comment on the following issues:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940412-1-00015 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940412-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

1. OSHA has characterized these scaffolds as a type of interior hung scaffold. To what extent is the above-described
characterization correct? If this characterization is correct, to what extent do the proposed requirements for
interior hung scaffolds ( 1915.253(p)) and the general scaffold requirements ( 1915.252) adequately
address the above-described scaffolds? To what extent does proposed Appendix A adequately address the above-described
scaffolds? What changes, if any, should be made in proposed subpart N to improve the coverage of the above described
scaffolds? 

2. The Agency is concerned about the possibility that a suspension rope could be inadvertently disconnected from
an ``S'' hook, thereby allowing an interior hung scaffold to fall. Accordingly, OSHA is considering requiring that
the end of the ``S'' hook which supports the suspension rope be effectively closed. If so, what methods can be used to
close the hook? OSHA is considering if mousing (wrapping rope around the hook opening when the suspension rope is connected)
would adequately assure that the suspension rope did not disconnect from the ``S'' hook. What experience have employers
had with the use of mousing to close the hook opening? OSHA is also considering if locking hooks, such as required in
 1910.66, Powered platforms, should be required. To what extent would the use of locking hooks be appropriate
with these scaffolds? 

3. Proposed paragraph  1926.253(p)(3) requires that suspension ropes and cables on interior hung scaffolds
be connected to overhead supporting members by shackles, clips, thimbles, or equivalent means. To what extent do
the ``S'' hooks used on the above-described scaffolds constitute equivalent means of connection? Should OSHA prohibit
the use of ``S'' hooks for suspending these scaffolds? 

4. OSHA is also concerned about the possibility that an ``S'' hook could be inadvertently disconnected from its support,
thereby allowing an interior hung scaffold to fall. Accordingly, OSHA is considering requiring that the ``S'' hooks
be secured to the overhead longitudinal structural members in tanks. If so, what methods can be used to secure them?


5. In its rulemaking for scaffolds used in construction, OSHA reopened the rulemaking record (58 FR 16509, March 29,
1993) to solicit comments and information regarding the feasibility of providing fall protection and safe access
for employees erecting and dismantling scaffolds, including interior hung scaffolds (proposed  1926.452(t)).
The materials submitted in response to that notice (Ex. 34, with attachments) will be considered when OSHA drafts
the final rule for part 1915, subpart N. 

In addition, the Agency is considering requiring the provision and use of fall protection and safe access for employees
erecting and dismantling scaffolds used in shipyard employment. To what extent is it feasible for shipyard employers
to provide fall protection and safe access for employees erecting or dismantling scaffolds, such as the above-described
scaffolds, used in shipyard employment? 

6. How would a fall protection requirement affect the erection and dismantling of scaffolds? 

7. OSHA is considering requiring that measures be taken to prevent the swaying of vertical lines suspending employees
erecting or dismantling the above-described scaffolds. What measures have been taken to prevent such swaying? What
other methods would be appropriate? 

8. OSHA is considering specifying a minimum diameter for wire ropes used to suspend these scaffolds. Proposed 1915.252(a)(4)(ii)
requires that ropes suspending catenary scaffolds be equivalent to at least one-half inch diameter wire rope. Would
that minimum diameter be appropriate for the above described scaffolds? If not, how should OSHA address the minimum
diameter for ropes used to suspend such scaffolds? 

9. OSHA is considering requiring that only improved plow steel wire rope be used as suspension ropes on scaffolds.
To what extent would such a requirement be appropriate? 

10. OSHA is concerned that incorrect size wire rope clips might be used on the wire ropes used to suspend scaffolds.
Accordingly, OSHA is considering specifying that when clips are used they must be the right size for the rope. To what
extent would such a requirement be appropriate? 

11. When a U-bolt wire rope clip is installed backwards on a wire rope (i.e., the saddle is placed on the dead end and the
U-bolt is placed on the live end of a rope), the live end may be damaged through contact with the U-bolt. OSHA is concerned
that the use of U-bolt wire rope clips could damage wire rope so that a rope is not capable of supporting a scaffold. Accordingly,
OSHA is considering prohibiting the use of U-bolt wire rope clips on suspension scaffolds. To what extent would such
a requirement be appropriate? 

12. The struts that support the platforms on the above described scaffolds usually rest on wire rope clips attached
to the suspension ropes. The clips usually are attached to only one section of the rope, instead of two sections as is
the case when an eye is formed in a rope. OSHA is concerned that wire rope clips, especially U-bolt clips, used in this
manner might not provide adequate support for a scaffold. OSHA is also concerned that wire rope clips, especially
U-bolt clips, used in this manner might damage a rope, reducing its load carrying ability (see question 11 above).
Accordingly, OSHA is considering prohibiting the use of wire rope clips in this manner, and seeks comment on the extent
to which wire rope clips adequately support the struts when used in this manner. Would it be appropriate for OSHA to
prohibit the use of U-bolt clips for this purpose, but to allow such a use of double-saddle clips? If the use of clips
is allowed for this purpose, (1) are clips necessary on the top of each strut as well as at the bottom in order to adequately
secure each strut to its wire rope, and (2) how many clips should OSHA require, as a minimum, for rigging these scaffolds?

13. OSHA is considering requiring that measures be taken to prevent the unintentional dislodgement of a suspension
rope from the slot in a strut. Accordingly, the Agency seeks comment on the feasibility of complying with such a requirement.
If such a requirement is promulgated, should OSHA specify the use of a bolt and nut that are at least 1/2 inch (1.27 cm)
in diameter for this purpose? Also, Should OSHA prohibit the use of tie wires for this purpose? 
14. OSHA is concerned that suspension ropes used on the above-described scaffolds could be damaged through contact
with the struts or the overhead longitudinal structural members found in tanks. Accordingly, OSHA is considering
requiring that measures be taken to prevent damage to suspension ropes from contact with the struts or the overhead
longitudinal structural members. To what extent do the procedures currently used to rig such scaffolds prevent damage?
What, if any, changes to rigging procedures or equipment are needed? 
15. OSHA is considering setting minimum requirements (such as length, diameter, thickness (wall thickness for pipes),
shape, or type of material) for the struts used to support the above-described scaffolds. What, if any, minimum requirements
should the Agency set for the struts? To what extent would struts currently in use satisfy any such requirements? 
16. OSHA is concerned that scaffolds designed by persons lacking the necessary skills and knowledge may prove to be
unsafe. Accordingly, OSHA seeks comment on the level of expertise that should be required for persons who design scaffolds
and scaffold components. Should OSHA require that scaffolds and scaffold components be designed by a registered
professional engineer? Should OSHA require that scaffolds and their components be designed by a person who is ``qualified''
as defined in  1926.32(l) (see discussion of Item B, above)? 
17. OSHA is considering prohibiting the performance of heavy structural repairs and steel erection from the above-described
scaffolds to prevent situations where an overload could occur. To what extent are structural repairs and steel erection
performed from such scaffolds? How reasonable would it be for OSHA to require that any such work be performed using
other means of access? 
18. Proposed paragraph  1915.252(e)(1)(i) requires that employees on catenary scaffolds, float scaffolds,
and needle beam scaffolds, all of which are non-adjustable scaffolds, be protected by personal fall arrest systems.
Since the above-described scaffolds and interior hung scaffolds in general are also non-adjustable suspension
scaffolds, OSHA is considering requiring the provision of personal fall arrest systems for employees working on
the above-described scaffolds. The Agency is also considering requiring personal fall arrest systems for suspended
scaffolds in general. To what extent are such systems currently provided to and used by affected employees? 
19. OSHA is considering requiring the use of guardrail systems on the above-described scaffolds. Accordingly, the
Agency seeks information on methods that are currently used to provide guardrail systems on those scaffolds. To what
extent are the ropes used to suspend the scaffold capable of serving as vertical supports in a guardrail system? 
20. In what types of shipyard operations, other than for blasting and painting, are the above-described scaffolds
used? 
21. Does the use of the above-mentioned scaffolds expose employees erecting, dismantling, or using them to any unique
hazards? If so, what are those hazards, and how can the employer prevent them or protect employees from them? 
22. OSHA is considering requiring that the suspension ropes on the above-described scaffolds be secured at the bottom
of the tank. To what extent are suspension ropes currently being secured? What methods are being used? What other methods
would be appropriate? 
23. OSHA is considering requiring that the suspension ropes on the above-described scaffolds be kept in a vertical
position while employees are on the scaffolds. To what extent are suspension ropes currently kept in a vertical position?
What methods are being used? What other methods would be appropriate? 
24. OSHA is considering requiring that platform units used on the above-described scaffolds be secured to the supporting
struts. To what extent are those scaffolds currently secured to the supporting struts? What methods are used or can
be used for securing the platform units to the struts? 


E. Inspection of Scaffolds 


Proposed paragraph  1915.252(d)(3) requires that scaffolds be inspected as follows: 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940412-1-00017 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940412-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) Supported scaffolds and scaffold components shall be inspected for visible defects periodically and after any
occurrence which could affect a scaffold's structural integrity. Suspension scaffolds and scaffold components
shall be inspected for visible defects immediately after installation prior to their first use; periodically thereafter
(preferably before each use); and after any occurrence which could affect a scaffold's structural integrity.

 

This language does not specify who is to perform the inspection or what qualifications that person must possess, nor
does it specify how frequently inspections must occur. The Agency sought public comment in these matters for both
supported and suspension scaffolds in Issue 13 of the proposal. In that issue the Agency stated incorrectly that the
proposed rule required supported scaffolds and scaffold components to be inspected for visible defects prior to
each workshift and after any occurrence which could affect the scaffold's structural integrity. The Agency intended
all scaffolds and scaffold components to be inspected for visible defects prior to each workshift. However, proposed
paragraph  1915.252(d)(3) simply expresses a preference for inspection before each use. The Agency also sought
public comment on whether the scaffold inspector should be an engineer, a qualified person, or a capable person. 
OSHA received three comments (Exs. 6-1, 6-3, and 6-7) in response to Issue 13. Two of these commenters
(Exs. 6-1 and 6-3) stated that the proposed rule uses specification-oriented language and is unnecessarily
restrictive, and that a thorough inspection before each workshift would be impossible and expensive. These two commenters
added that existing rule  1915.71(b)(5), which requires that scaffolds be maintained in a safe and secure condition
and that defective components be replaced, is performance-oriented and has caused the industry to implement effective
programs to ensure safe scaffolds. They recommended the retention of existing  1915.71(b)(5), and that proposed
 1915.252(d)(3) not be included in the final rule. The other commenter (Ex. 6-7) stated that ``[s]caffolds
should be inspected by a capable person during and immediately after the system is anchored. Thereafter, the system
should be inspected daily by the employees using the system.'' This commenter added that the proposed frequency of
inspections adequately reflects current shipyard practices. 
OSHA does not believe that proposed  1915.252(d)(3) is unnecessarily restrictive. To the contrary, OSHA is
concerned that proposed  1915.252(d)(3) and existing  1915.71(b)(5) might not adequately address
the hazards associated with the use of unsafe scaffolds. Accordingly, the Agency seeks public comment on the adequacy
of proposed  1915.252(d)(3), and on the appropriateness of replacing proposed  1915.252(d)(3) with
the following language, which is the same as the corresponding proposed requirement for scaffolds used in the construction
industry (51 FR 42706, November 25, 1986) except that ``competent person'' has been changed to ``qualified person''
(see discussion of Item B, above):

 

(3) Scaffolds and scaffold components shall be inspected for visible defects by a qualified person prior to each work
shift, and after any occurrence which could affect a scaffold's structural integrity. 


F. Correction to Proposed  1915.252(b)(18)(iv) 


The word ``not'' was inadvertently dropped from paragraph  1915.252(b)(18)(iv) when proposed subpart N was
published in the 

Federal Register

 (53 FR 48207, November 29, 1988). Due to a typographic error, proposed  1915.252(b)(18)(iv) read as follows:




(iv) Counterweights shall be removed from a scaffold until the scaffold is disassembled.

 

The preamble discussion for proposed  1915.252(b)(18)(iv) (53 FR 48188) clearly states that OSHA intended
to prohibit the removal of counterweights until the scaffold is disassembled. In addition, the Agency notes that
the corresponding provision in proposed part 1926, subpart L ( 1926.451(b)(18)(iv)) states that ``counterweights
shall not be removed * * *.'' Proposed paragraph  1915.252(b)(18)(iv) should have
read as follows:

 

(iv) Counterweights shall 

not

 be removed from a scaffold until the scaffold is disassembled (emphasis added).

 

OSHA seeks public comment on the appropriateness of the proposed provision as corrected. 


H. Performance of Electric Welding Operations From Suspension Scaffolds 


OSHA raised the issue of the regulation of electric welding on suspension scaffolds in Issue 2 of the NPRM (53 FR 46197).
The Agency asked for input on six precautions that might reduce the possibility of the welding current arcing through
the wire rope when welding is performed by employees on suspension scaffolds. OSHA received only one response to Issue
2. That commenter (Ex. 6-7) stated that the use of welding equipment on suspended platforms has not caused any
safety hazards. 
On the issue of welding work performed while on scaffolds, OSHA seeks public comment on the following provisions that
are being considered for inclusion in the final rule. These requirements are the same as those found in section 6.2.9
of ANSI A10.8-1988 except that in paragraph (b) the term ``unit'' has been changed to ``scaffold'' so that the
language clearly indicates the Agency's intent.

 

To reduce the possibility of the welding current arcing through the suspension wire rope during the course of welding
from suspension scaffolds, the following precautions shall be taken: 
(a) An insulated thimble shall be used to attach each suspension wire rope to its hanging support (such as cornice hook
or outrigger). Excess suspension wire rope and any additional independent lines from grounding shall be insulated.

(b) The suspension wire rope shall be covered with insulating materials at least 4 feet (1.22 m) above the hoist. In
the event a tail line exists below the hoist, it shall be insulated to prevent contact with the platform. The portion
of the tail line that hangs free below the scaffold shall be guided or retained, or both, so that it does not become grounded.

(c) Each hoist shall be covered with protective cover made from insulating materials. 
(d) In addition to a work lead attachment required by the welding process, a grounding conductor shall be connected
from the scaffold to the structure. The size of this conductor shall be equal to or greater than the size of the welding
process work lead and shall not be in series with the welding process or the work piece. 
(e) If the scaffold grounding lead is disconnected at any time, the welding machine shall be shut off.

<PARENT> FR940412-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(f) At no time shall an active welding rod or an uninsulated welding lead be allowed to contact the scaffold or its suspension
system. 




Paragraph (b) above addresses suspension scaffolds with hoists but does not specifically address non-adjustable
suspension scaffolds (i.e., scaffolds that do not have hoists). The Agency believes that employees performing welding
operations from non-adjustable suspension scaffolds are exposed to the same or similar hazards as those faced by
employees on adjustable suspension scaffolds. Accordingly, the Agency seeks public comment on the following issues:

1. Should OSHA require that wire ropes on non-adjustable suspension scaffolds from which employees are performing
welding operations be insulated to a height above the scaffold sufficient to prevent accidental contact between
the ropes and an active welding rod or an uninsulated welding lead? If so, what should that height be? 
2. Should OSHA require that an insulated thimble or equivalent be used to attach each suspension wire rope to the platform
of a non-adjustable suspension scaffold used for welding operations? 
3. What other measures should OSHA require for the protection of employees performing welding from suspended scaffolds?



I. Incorporation of Dockets S-205, S-205A, and S-205B (Part 1926, Subpart L, Scaffolds Used in the
Construction Industry)


On November 25, 1986, the Agency proposed to update the requirements for protection of employees on scaffolds used
in construction (part 1926, subpart L, 51 FR 42680). The public record on scaffolds used in construction was reopened
on March 29, 1993 (58 FR 16509), and again on February 1, 1994 (59 FR 4615). The proposed construction industry requirements
for scaffolds were generally consistent with those proposed for shipyards in 1988. The construction proposal and
the two notices of limited reopening generated public input which OSHA is considering as the Agency drafts the final
rule for scaffolds covered by part 1926, subpart L. Many of those materials contain relevant information or raise
scaffold-related concerns not yet addressed in the comments on part 1915, proposed subpart N. The Agency believes
that, in developing separate standards for the construction industry (part 1926) and for the shipyard industry (part
1915), the substance of those standards should be consistent, except where there are demonstrable differences in
scaffold use which would justify differences in coverage. Therefore, OSHA has determined that the Agency needs to
consider the information generated in the subpart L rulemaking when the Agency drafts the final rule for scaffolds
in the shipyard industry. In addition, OSHA notes that Docket S-205B also contains scaffold-related materials
from the proposed general industry standard for walking and working surfaces (Docket S-041, part 1910, subpart
D) and an August, 1993, NIOSH study of construction-related fatalities titled Fatal Injuries to Workers in the United
States, 1980-1989: A Decade of Surveillance. In order to assure that those relevant materials are considered
by both the Agency and the public as they relate to scaffold use in shipyards, OSHA is incorporating pertinent exhibits
from the construction industry rulemaking record (Dockets S-205, S-205A, and S-205B) into the
part 1915, subpart N rulemaking (Docket S-047). All the materials incorporated from subpart L will be identified
in the subpart N docket as Exhibit 8, with attachments. 


J. Costs, Benefits, and Technological Feasibility



In the regulatory analysis accompanying the proposed rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 29, 1988, the Agency identified three provisions that would impose compliance burdens: (1) Requiring
scaffolds to be no more than 14 inches from the vertical work area unless there was a guardrail or body belt employed;
(2) prohibiting the use of ladders on top scaffolds; (3) forbidding workers to ride on mobile scaffolds unless the
surface to be driven over was free of hazards. 
The Agency requests comments from the shipyard industry about the costs of these provisions, other provisions in
the original proposed rule, and the issues raised in this notice, especially the use of interior hung scaffolds. 
In order to update the rulemaking record, the Agency solicits information regarding: (1) The annual number of accidents
(especially falls) that occur while workers are engaged in erecting or working on scaffolds; (2) the annual number
of workers injured; (3) the severity of injuries; and (4) the causes of accidents. OSHA also solicits comments regarding
the extent to which shipyard scaffold accidents will be avoided by complying with the proposed rule. 
The Agency also requests comments, with supporting information, about the technological feasibility of applying
the proposed standard, including the alternatives set out in this notice, to the shipyard industry. 



II. Public Participation

The State Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Education.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of meetings and teleconferences.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Assistant Secretary announces a series of meetings and teleconferences to discuss a preliminary draft of proposed
regulations to implement certain provisions of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by the Rehabilitation
Act Amendments of 1992 and 1993 (the Act). 


The meetings and teleconferences will allow interested parties an opportunity to review and discuss the draft proposed
regulations prior to the publication of a formal notice of proposed rulemaking in the 

Federal Register

. This effort is part of a broader initiative to be more open to input from the various constituencies interested in
the programs administered by the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS). 
The purpose of the meetings and teleconferences is to invite public comment on the draft proposed regulations, especially
as these regulations interpret or clarify statutory requirements of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 and
1993. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The draft proposed regulations would replace existing regulations under 34 CFR part 361 governing The State Vocational
Rehabilitation Services Program. These draft proposed regulations, however, do not include the provisions relating
to order of selection under 34 CFR 361.36 that were published in the 

Federal Register

 for comment on July 16, 1993 (58 FR 38482). Final regulations relating to the order of selection requirement will be
published as a separate document later this year. In addition, these draft proposed regulations do not implement
section 106 of the Act relating to evaluation standards and performance indicators for The State Vocational Rehabilitation
Services Program. Proposed regulations implementing section 106 will also be published separately for public comment.



Staff from OSERS and other offices of the Department of Education will be available at the meetings and teleconferences
to discuss the draft proposed regulations and provide technical assistance and clarification of the proposed provisions.
Participants are particularly encouraged to express their support for or raise concerns about specific sections
of the regulations and, if possible, to provide alternative language if they disagree with the wording in the draft
proposed regulations. 


Availability of Copies of the Draft Proposed Regulations


The draft proposed regulations can be accessed through the RSA Bulletin Board System (BBS) by calling one of the following
access numbers: (202) 205-5574 (low speed modems) or (202) 401-6147 (high speed modems, 9,600 bps or faster).
If you experience any difficulty in accessing the BBS, please contact either John Chapman at (202) 205-9290
or Teresa Darter at (202) 205-8444, co-system operators (sysops), for assistance. For those individuals unable
to access the BBS, copies of the draft proposed regulations are available in regular print, large print, and computer
diskette (WordPerfect 5.1 and ASCII formats) by calling (202) 205-5482. A limited number of copies in braille
are also available. 


Meeting and Teleconference Information


The Assistant Secretary encourages interested parties to participate in one of the meetings or teleconferences.
There will be three meetings held in Washington, DC. Additional meetings will be held in Chicago, Illinois, and Oakland,
California. There will be three teleconferences to allow individuals to participate who cannot travel to the meeting
sites. Individuals will have to reserve a space for the meetings or teleconferences. Reservations will be accepted
on a first-come, first-served basis. Both meeting space and teleconference lines are limited. Given the level of
response expected, individuals should plan on participating in only one meeting or teleconference and should make
reservations as soon as possible. When making reservations, individuals must indicate the need for any special accommodations,
including sign language interpreters. The meeting rooms and proceedings will be accessible for individuals with
disabilities. 
The meetings in Washington, DC, will be held on April 19, 1994, from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.; May 12, 1994, from 9 a.m. to 12 noon;

Schedule for Rating Disabilities; Diseases of the Ear and Other Sense Organs 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Veterans Affairs. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is proposing to amend its rating schedule regarding evaluation of diseases
of the ear and other sense organs. This amendment is necessary in order to comply with a General Accounting Office (GAO)
study, which recommended that medical criteria in the rating schedule be reviewed and updated. The intended effect
is to update the portion of the Schedule for Rating Disabilities pertaining to diseases of the ear and other sense organs
to ensure that it uses current medical terminology and unambiguous criteria for evaluating these disabilities and
reflects recent medical advances.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 2, 1991, we received comments and suggestions from VA medical doctors and VA Rating Specialists. 


The comments included suggestions that we delete several diagnostic codes, include diagnostic codes for additional
conditions, and change evaluation criteria for a number of conditions. We have considered all of these suggestions
and implemented several as explained in the following proposal. 
If medical terminology in the rating schedule is outdated, 
it is difficult for a rating specialist to accurately associate medical evidence with the proper evaluation criteria.
For that reason, we propose to update the medical terms which identify diseases of the ear so that the schedule uses
the most common terms. 
In addition to publishing an advance notice of proposed rulemaking, we also contracted with an outside consultant
to recommend changes to the evaluation criteria to ensure that the schedule uses current medical terminology and
unambiguous criteria, and that it reflects medical advances which have occurred since the last review. The consultant
convened a panel of non-VA specialists to review that portion of the rating schedule dealing with hearing and ear conditions
in order to formulate recommendations. 
We are proposing to adopt many of the recommendations the contractor submitted. Some recommendations, however,
addressed areas other than evaluation criteria, such as percentage evaluations and frequency of examinations.
Since these suggestions are clearly beyond the scope of the contract and deal with issues which would affect the internal
consistency of the entire rating schedule rather than one section, we have generally not adopted them. 
We propose to change the terminology describing several of the conditions in this section for clarity and to reflect
current medical terminology. Under diagnostic code 6201, the term ``otitis media, catarrhal, chronic'' is outdated
and we propose to replace it with ``chronic otitis media, with effusion (serous otitis media).'' Similarly, ``chronic
otitis externa'' is the medically preferred term for ``auditory canal, disease of'' and we propose to use it as the
heading for diagnostic code 6210. Meniere's syndrome (diagnostic code 6205) is often referred to as ``endolymphatic
hydrops'' and we propose to add this designation in parenthesis to the heading of this diagnostic code. When first
included in the rating schedule, the term ``chronic labyrinthitis'' under diagnostic code 6204 was used to indicate
pathology affecting organs of equilibrium. That term, however, is not used in current medical practice; these conditions
are currently described as vestibular disorders. For this reason, we propose to change the heading of code 6204 to
``peripheral vestibular disorders.'' Since the word ``neoplasm'' connotes a pathological abnormality better
than the term ``new growth,'' we propose to substitute that word under diagnostic codes 6208 and 6209, which pertain
to malignant and benign conditions, respectively. 
A number of grammatical elements are useful in eliminating ambiguity and ensuring that the schedule presents rating
criteria as precisely as possible. We are proposing editorial changes, primarily of syntax and punctuation, throughout
this portion of the schedule. These changes are intended to clarify the rating criteria and represent no substantive
amendment. 
Section 4.85 describes the use of tables VI and VIa in the evaluation of hearing impairment. Table VI is a chart of average
puretone decibel losses and speech discrimination percentages, with conversion to Roman numeral designations
where the values intersect. Table VIa assigns Roman numeral designations to ranges of average puretone decibel loss
without regard to speech discrimination. The Roman numeral designations derived from tables VI or VIa for each ear
are then transferred to Table VII and combined to yield diagnostic codes and disability percentages from 0 to 100.
Higher numeric designations equate to a higher disability percentage. Currently table VIa is reserved for cases
of language impairment or inconsistent test results, and table VI is used in all other hearing loss ratings. 
Based on research and statistical studies conducted by the Veterans Health Administration, we propose the addition
of two new provisions to  4.85. The first new provision, designated as  4.85(d), directs that the rating
specialist choose the higher Roman numeral designation derived from table VI or VIa whenever puretone thresholds
in four of five specified testing frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz (Hz)) are 55 decibels hearing
level (dBHL) or more. While results of speech discrimination tests with this type of hearing loss in a controlled setting
are often near normal, they do not reflect the true extent of difficulty understanding speech in the everyday work
environment, even with the use of hearing aids. Table VIa, which measures pure tone loss only, will be used as an alternative
to the combination of speech discrimination and pure tone scores for this particular configuration of hearing loss,
but only if it results in a higher evaluation. 
The second new provision ( 4.85(e)) directs that the rating specialist choose the higher Roman numeral designation
derived from table VI or VIa when puretone thresholds are 30 dBHL or less at frequencies of 1000 Hz and below, and are
70 dBHL or more at 2000 Hz. The rating specialist will then elevate the Roman numeral designation to the next higher
number. This type of hearing loss is an extreme handicap in the presence of any environmental noise, and often cannot
be overcome by the use of hearing aids. It is therefore appropriate to assign the next higher numeric designation in
order to compensate for this outcome. The intended effect of these two new provisions is to fairly and accurately assess
the hearing disabilities of veterans as reflected in a real life industrial setting and is thus a liberalization of
the current version of this section of the Schedule.

Table VII currently includes a footnote indicating entitlement to special monthly compensation when the criteria
for a 100 percent evaluation are met. Entitlement to special monthly compensation under 38 CFR 3.350(a) (38 U.S.C.
1114(k)) for total deafness is only one of many instances in which hearing loss is a factor in establishing special
monthly compensation. Because the criteria for entitlement to special monthly compensation contained in 38 CFR
3.350 are extremely complex, we propose to delete the footnote in favor of a note following  4.85 directing rating
specialists to refer to  3.350 when evaluating any claim for impaired hearing to determine whether the veteran
is entitled to special monthly compensation. We believe that this will be more effective than the footnote in ensuring
complete review for special monthly compensation. 

Sections 4.86, 4.86a, and 4.87 currently deal with tests to evaluate hearing loss, evidence of hearing loss other
than puretone and controlled speech audiometry, and the definition of impaired auditory acuity. All three of these
provisions are closely related to the evaluation of hearing loss and should be included in one section. We propose
to state that the evaluations are designed to measure best uncorrected hearing, reflecting the accepted testing
method of measuring hearing without hearing aids in place. We therefore propose to reorganize this material so that
it is contained in a single section,  4.86, and to delete  4.86a. Section 4.87a has been redesignated as
 4.87. 

Suppurative otitis media is currently classified under diagnostic code 6200, and mastoiditis under diagnostic
code 6206. Since mastoiditis is often a complication of suppurative otitis media, we propose to include mastoiditis
under diagnostic code 6200 and delete diagnostic code 6206. Cholesteatoma is another condition associated with
suppurative otitis media, and we propose to include it under diagnostic code 6200 as well. 

The diagnosis of ``otitis interna,'' (diagnostic code 6203), is archaic and the medical advice we received indicates
it is no longer a recognized category of disability. For this reason, we propose to delete diagnostic code 6203 from
the schedule and to rate the symptoms attributed to this condition under peripheral vestibular disorders, code 6204.


We propose to amend the NOTE which currently follows diagnostic code 6204 to state that objective findings supporting
the diagnosis of disequilibrium are required prior to the assignment of any compensable evaluation. This requirement
will preclude the use of purely subjective symptoms as the exclusive basis for payment of compensation. The words
``severe,'' ``moderate'' or ``mild'' now precede the evaluation criteria for compensable evaluations under diagnostic
codes 6204 and 6205. These descriptions do not materially help to explain or clarify the specific evaluation criteria
they precede. For that reason, we propose to delete these labels. 

The evaluation criteria under the diagnostic code for Meniere's disease (6205) currently require ``frequent episodes''
for an evaluation of 100 percent. We propose to clarify this ambiguous requirement by specifying that such attacks
must occur more than once weekly for this level of disability since, in our judgment, such frequency would most reasonably
constitute total disablement. We also propose to include the criteria of deafness to the 60 percent evaluation, since
this is a common symptom of the disease. 

The current evaluation criteria for loss of auricle, code 6207, are unclear because they do not specify the extent
of loss required to qualify for the various evaluation levels. We propose to revise the criteria to indicate that the
30 percent evaluation requires complete loss of one auricle and that the 50 percent evaluation requires complete
loss of both. This is consistent with the current instructions for the 10 percent evaluation which require a quantifiable
loss of one-third or more of one auricle. 

Because of the likelihood of serious disablement and the severe side effects which chemotherapy and radiation treatment
produce in the average person, we propose to assign a 100 percent evaluation under the diagnostic code for malignancies
(6208), with the total evaluation continuing after the cessation of surgical, X-ray, antineoplastic or other theraputic
procedure. We propose to continue the total evaluation under this code indefinitely after treatment is discontinued,
and to examine the veteran six months thereafter. If the results of this or any subsequent examination warrant a reduction
in evaluation, the reduction would be implemented under the provisions of 38 CFR 3.105(e). This method has the advantage
of offering the veteran timely notice of any proposed action and, under the provisions of 38 CFR 3.105(e), the opportunity
to present evidence showing that the action should not be taken. This is consistent with evaluation of malignancies
which we have proposed in other parts of the Schedule. 

The evaluation for benign neoplasms of the ear (diagnostic code 6209) currently instructs the rater to evaluate the
condition based on impairment of function, with a minimum evaluation of 10 percent. Likewise, there is an instruction
to add 10 percent to the evaluation for residuals of malignant new growths. We propose to delete these minimum evaluations.
Advances in reconstructive surgery have reduced the disability associated with this condition and loss of function
is the most accurate way of evaluating the residuals of this condition. Since any disability sufficient to warrant
a compensable evaluation would be noted on VA examination, a minimum evaluation is no longer appropriate. 

The evaluation for tinnitus (diagnostic code 6260) currently requires that the condition be ``persistent'' in order
to qualify for a 10 percent evaluation. Tinnitus is a subjective sensation which, under certain circumstances, comes
and goes. The word ``persistent'' suggests a meaning of constant, and we propose to replace it with ``recurrent,''
meaning that the tinnitus might not always be present, but that it does return at regular intervals. Requiring that
tinnitus be ``recurrent'' will allow a realistic evaluation of the typical disablement from this condition.

Tinnitus can be caused by a number of conditions, including injuries, acute diseases and drug reactions. Compensable
evaluation for persistent tinnitus is currently restricted to conditions caused by head injury, concussion or acoustic
trauma. Since the severity of disablement from tinnitus does not depend on its origin, we propose to eliminate the
restriction that tinnitus result from trauma, and provide instead for a compensable evaluation whenever tinnitus
is recurrent. We also propose to remove reference to diagnostic code 8046 (cerebral arteriosclerosis), and to remove
reference to tinnitus under diagnostic code 6204 (peripheral vestibular disorder) in order to allow separate evaluations
for tinnitus when caused by cerebral arteriosclerosis and peripheral vestibular disorder. 

No change is proposed in  4.87b, which provides evaluations for loss of smell (diagnostic code 6275) and taste
(diagnostic code 6276) except wording changes in the NOTE following, for clarity, and redesignation of the section
as  4.87a. 

The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612. The reason
for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries
could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and
final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of   603 and 604. 

This regulation is subject to review under Executive Order 12866.

For the reasons set out in the preamble, 38 CFR part 4, subpart B, is proposed to be amended as set forth below: 



PART 4_SCHEDULE FOR RATING DISABILITIES 

Subpart B_Disability Ratings 



1. The authority citation for part 4 continues to read as follows: 






Authority:

 72 Stat. 1125; 38 U.S.C. 1155. 




2. Section 4.85 is revised to read as follows: 



 4.85

Evaluation of hearing impairment. 



(a) Examinations will be conducted using a controlled speech discrimination test together with a puretone audiometry
test. The horizontal rows in Table VI represent levels of speech discrimination determined from the controlled speech
discrimination test. The vertical columns in Table VI represent levels of puretone decibel loss determined from
the puretone audiometry test. The Roman numeral designation of impaired efficiency (I through XI) is determined
at the point where the horizontal row (percentage of speech discrimination) and the vertical column (puretone decibel
loss) intersect. For example, with 70 percent speech discrimination and average puretone decibel hearing loss of
64, the Roman numeral designation is V. Each ear will be evaluated separately. 

(b) The percentage evaluation will be determined from Table VII. The horizontal row of Roman numeral designations
represents the ear having the better hearing and the vertical column the Roman numeral designations for the ear having
the poorer hearing. The percentage of disability and the diagnostic code are located at the point where the row and
column intersect. For example, if the better ear (horizontal row) has a Roman numeral designation of ``V'' and the
poorer ear (vertical column) has a Roman numeral designation of ``VII,'' the row and column intersect where the percentage
evaluation is 30 percent and the diagnostic code is 6103. 

(c) Table VIa provides Roman numeral designations based solely on puretone decibel hearing loss averages. It is for
application when the Chief of the Audiology Clinic certifies that language difficulties or inconsistent speech
discrimination scores make the combined use of puretone decibel hearing loss and speech discrimination inappropriate.


(d) When puretone thresholds in any four of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz, are 55 decibels hearing
loss or more, the rating specialist will select the Roman numeral designation from either Table VI or Table VIa, whichever
permits the higher Roman numeral designation. Each ear will be evaluated separately. 

(e) When puretone thresholds are 30 decibels hearing loss or less at frequencies of 1000 Hertz and below, and are 70
decibels hearing loss or more at 2000 Hertz, the rating specialist will select the higher Roman numeral designation
from either Table VI or Table VIa, and then elevate the Roman numeral designation selected to the next higher Roman
numeral. Each ear will be evaluated separately. 






Note:

 When evaluating any claim for impaired hearing, refer to  3.350 of this chapter to determine whether the veteran
may be entitled to special monthly compensation due either to deafness itself, or deafness or partial deafness in
combination with other specified disabilities. 




3. Section 4.86 is revised to read as follows: 



 4.86

Auditory acuity, hearing aids, and evidence other than puretone audiometry and controlled speech. 



(a) For Department of Veterans Affairs purposes, ``impairment of auditory acuity'' means the organic loss of the
ability to hear speech. 

(b) The evaluations derived from this schedule are designed to measure the best residual uncorrected hearing. Examinations
comparing hearing with and without hearing aids are unnecessary. 

(c) When the medical evidence necessary to establish service-connection for hearing loss predates the use of puretone
audiometry and controlled speech, service-connection will be determined under the provisions of   4.85
through 4.87 of this part as in effect on December 17, 1987.

Asbestos; Withdrawal of Rulemaking for Exemption from Asbestos Ban on Manufacture, Processing and Distribution
in Commerce 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has decided to withdraw the proposed rulemaking to exempt Omega Phase Transformations, Inc. (Omega) from processing
prohibitions in the Asbestos Ban and Phaseout (ABPO) Rule and not to initiate rulemaking in response to a similar petition
from Vitrifix, Inc. (Vitrifix). Omega and Vitrifix had petitioned EPA for exemptions from the ABPO Rule for thermal
processes that convert asbestos-containing waste material into non-asbestos glass, and EPA had agreed to initiate
rulemaking to exempt such processes from the ABPO Rule. EPA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the 

Federal Register

 of June 2, 1992, to grant an exemption to Omega for its vitrification process. EPA has since decided that thermal conversion
processes that destroy asbestos are not prohibited by the ABPO Rule. Accordingly, the exemption rulemaking is unnecessary.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background and Discussion


In the 

Federal Register

 of July 12, 1989 (54 FR 29460), EPA issued the ABPO Rule at 40 CFR 763.160-763.179 under section 6 of the Toxic Substances
Control Act (TSCA), 15 U.S.C. 2605, to prohibit, at staged intervals, the manufacture, importation, processing
and distribution in commerce of several categories of asbestos-containing products identified in the ABPO Rule.
One banned category is ``new uses of asbestos,'' which is defined in the ABPO Rule as ``commercial uses of asbestos
not identified in  763.165 the manufacture, importation or processing of which would be initiated for the first
time after August 25, 1989'' (40 CFR 763.163). ``New uses of asbestos'' are banned by the ABPO Rule after August 27,
1990 (40 CFR 763.165(a), 763.167(a), and 763.169(a)). 
On October 18, 1991, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in 

Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA

, 947 F2d 1201 (5th Cir., 1991), vacated and remanded most of the ABPO Rule. The ban on ``new uses of asbestos'' is unaffected
by the Court's remand and remains in effect. For a more complete discussion of the decision in 

Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA

, see 58 FR 58964, November 5, 1993. 
The ABPO Rule specifies that applications for exemptions for new uses of asbestos will be treated as petitions to amend
the ABPO Rule pursuant to section 21 of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2620) (See 54 FR 29464, July 12, 1989 and 40 CFR 763.173.) Section
21 of TSCA provides, in part, that any person may petition EPA to initiate a proceeding for the issuance, amendment,
or repeal of a rule issued under TSCA section 4, 6, or 8. The petition must set forth the facts which it claims establish
the need for the action. EPA is required to grant or deny the petition within 90 days after filing. If EPA grants the petition,
EPA must promptly commence an appropriate rulemaking (15 U.S.C. 2620(a)). 
The ABPO Rule also establishes general requirements for submission of data that are needed for EPA decisions on all
exemption applications, including those submitted as section 21 petitions (40 CFR 763.173). Petitioners must submit
evidence which demonstrates, among other requirements, that the proposed manufacture, importation, processing,
distribution in commerce, and use, as proposed, will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health (40
CFR 763.173(d)(1)(ix)).

In response to requests for clarification of the ABPO Rule from the State of California (September 29, 1989) and Omega
(October 13, 1989) with respect to ``processes that transform asbestos into asbestos-free material'' EPA responded
that ``processing for commercial purposes asbestos-containing material (ACM) by vitrification, or other transformation
processes, was a `new use' within the meaning of the [ABPO Rule].'' Therefore, it was subject to the Rule and to the exemption
application procedures outlined in the Rule. EPA also noted that the ABPO Rule ``does not regulate disposal activities''
and:




operations that transform asbestos-containing materials, as defined in 40 CFR 61.141, into nonasbestos material
solely for disposal, (as an alternative disposal method under the asbestos NESHAP regulations), would be subject
to the disposal requirements at 40 CFR 61.151 or 61.152, or any final standards revising the asbestos NESHAP under
40 CFR 61.155. 




(Letter to State of California, Department of Health Services, dated March 29, 1990. See also, letter to Omega, dated
March 30, 1990). The National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants Standard for Operations that Convert
Asbestos-containing Waste Material into Non-asbestos (Asbestos-free) Material (the Asbestos NESHAP Standard)
went into effect in November 1990 (40 CFR 61.155).


On October 9, 1990, Omega submitted a TSCA section 21 petition to EPA requesting an exemption from the ABPO Rule's ``new
use'' prohibitions in order to operate its vitrification process at a location in California. Omega's proposed process
converts ACM (e.g., demolition debris from asbestos abatement projects) into glass. Omega proposed to sell the glass
as aggregate for paving material, among other uses. In addition, the metal ingots produced from the molten metal waste
by-product would be sold as scrap metal. The Omega vitrification process is a modification of glassmaking technology
which would utilize high temperatures over 2000 
 F to melt the asbestos fibers. Evaluation of the Omega process for the proposed rule indicates that when asbestos
is exposed to temperatures over 2000 
 F, the needle-like structure of asbestos fibers breaks down to form amorphous molten glass and asbestos fibers
are destroyed. The Omega petition was followed by a section 21 petition from Vitrifix, Inc., on November 26, 1990.
An earlier feasibility test conducted by Vitrifix for EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards demonstrated
that, under the test conditions utilizing high temperatures over 2000 
 F, ACM waste material was converted into non-asbestos material.
EPA granted Omega's and Vitrifix's section 21 petitions on January 7, 1991, and February 20, 1991, respectively,
indicating its intent to initiate rulemakings under TSCA section 6 to amend the ABPO Rule to allow Omega and Vitrifix
to operate their proposed vitrification operations. 
On June 2, 1992 (57 FR 23183), EPA issued a proposal to amend the ABPO Rule to allow vitrification by Omega. EPA never
issued a proposed rule to allow vitrification by Vitrifix. EPA has reached the conclusion, as explained below, that
thermal processes that convert asbestos into non-asbestos material are not governed by the ABPO Rule. It was not the
intent of the ABPO Rule to regulate processes that permanently remove asbestos from the environment. Rather, the
objective was to prevent introduction of new asbestos into the environment. 


II. Interpretation 


The ABPO Rule specifically prohibits ``processing for any use'' an asbestos-containing product listed in 40 CFR
763.165, including ``new uses of asbestos'' (40 CFR 763.167). The ABPO Rule, however, does not prohibit disposal
or processing for disposal. Because thermal conversion operations destroy asbestos fibers, such operations constitute
processing for disposal and do not constitute use of asbestos as contemplated by the ABPO Rule, and are, therefore,
not regulated by the ABPO Rule. EPA is revising its initial response on the issue of vitrification (as set forth in EPA's
March 29, 1990, letter to the State of California) to reconcile the function of these operations with the intent of
the Rule. 
This interpretation is consistent with EPA's overall intent when it promulgated the ABPO Rule. In general, EPA developed
the ABPO Rule to limit the introduction or continued marketing of additional asbestos products, rather than to regulate
disposal of products that were already in use when the ABPO Rule was issued. In keeping with the overall objective to
reduce entry of asbestos into commerce and into the environment, the ABPO Rule does not prohibit other distribution
activities undertaken solely to dispose of asbestos. (see generally 40 CFR 763.163). 
In some situations, thermal conversion operations may still be subject to the ABPO Rule. If the end product contains
asbestos that has not been converted into glass, for example, and the end product is used for any purpose, the operation
would be subject to the prohibition against processing for use in  763.167 of the ABPO Rule. In that case, an exemption
would be necessary to engage in the activity.
As building materials deteriorate, or as buildings are renovated or demolished, much of this asbestos waste will
require disposal. In a national survey of asbestos-containing friable materials in buildings, conducted in 1984,
EPA estimated that approximately 20 percent of all buildings have some asbestos-containing friable materials.
EPA further estimated that buildings targeted in the survey contained approximately 1.2 billion square feet of sprayed-
or trowelled-on ACM (in an estimated range of 18,000 to 365,000 buildings), and that approximately 16 percent (or
between 239,000 - 888,000 buildings) contain asbestos pipe and boiler insulation. EPA also estimates that approximately
31,000 schools contain asbestos. (

Asbestos in Buildings - A National Survey of Asbestos-Containing Friable Materials

 - EPA Publication No. 560/5-84-006, October 1984, EPA Docket No OPPTS-62105). In addition to building
materials, asbestos is a component of automotive brakes, clutches and transmission components, as well as other
commercial and industrial friction materials which are eventually discarded for disposal after the components'
useful life. The magnitude of asbestos waste requiring disposal will place an increasing economic burden on society
as landfill capacity decreases. 
By converting asbestos into glass, vitrification provides an alternative to land disposal of asbestos waste and
produces a commercially useful non-asbestos product. Vitrification avoids costs of landfilling and of health costs
associated with exposure to asbestos waste. These costs could include a substantial burden on the individual and
society, including medical costs of treating asbestos-related diseases resulting from exposure to asbestos throughout
the life cycle of asbestos products and disposal of asbestos waste. The asbestos vitrification process destroys
asbestos and eliminates any risks from asbestos exposure which occur in the disposal and landfill stages of the asbestos
fiber life cycle. 


III. Asbestos Regulations 


Several existing regulations provide protection against asbestos exposures and releases from asbestos conversion
operations if such facilities are established. Owners or operators of facilities that intend to commence operations
to convert asbestos-containing waste material into non-asbestos material are subject to permit and performance
requirements under the Asbestos NESHAP Standard and to certain reporting requirements under several other EPA regulations.
In addition, such companies would be subject to the worker protection requirements of the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) or of OSHA-approved state, or EPA asbestos worker protection standards. 
The Asbestos NESHAP Standard was established as an alternative to land disposal of asbestos waste (55 FR 48406, November
20, 1990). The Standard establishes permit and performance requirements, including a requirement to obtain EPA
approval to construct a facility, as well as monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements. During normal
operations, a company must demonstrate by laboratory analysis that ACM is completely destroyed. If laboratory testing
reveals that the output material contains asbestos, the company must reprocess the ACM, or dispose of it as asbestos-containing
waste material according to 40 CFR 61.150. Continuous monitoring requirements are also imposed under  61.155
of the Asbestos NESHAP Standard. The Standard is designed to ensure that there are no visible air emissions and that
the output material contains no asbestos. 
Asbestos thermal disposal facilities may also be subject to public disclosure and notification requirements under
the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) (42 U.S.C. 11001 11050). Among other things, EPCRA
requires emergency notification of any release of 1 pound or more of friable forms of asbestos to the appropriate State
Emergency Response Commission and Local Emergency Planning Committee. Section 313 of EPCRA requires submission
of Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) reports to EPA and designated State officials, including the amount of the toxic
chemical entering each environmental medium, such as air and water, annually. Asbestos thermal disposal facilities
would be subject to section 313 of EPCRA only if they fall within the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes
20-39, they employ the equivalent of 10 full time employees, and they manufacture, process, or otherwise use a listed
toxic chemical in excess of the TRI reporting thresholds. Conversion of material containing friable forms of asbestos
into non-asbestos glass that is distributed in commerce is subject to section 313 reporting if the facility otherwise
meets the SIC Code and threshold requirements. Under the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 13101-13109),
facilities that are required to file a TRI report under EPCRA section 313 must include with it certain additional information
about toxic chemical source reduction and recycling. Under the Comprehensive Emergency Response, Compensation
and Liability Act (CERCLA), certain releases must also be reported to the National Response Center and advertised
in local newspapers (42 U.S.C. 9663, 9611 (g)).
Asbestos thermal disposal facilities are also subject to OSHA, EPA, or State laws for occupational exposure to asbestos
in the workplace (see e.g., 29 CFR part 1910 and 1926 and 40 CFR 763.120-763.125). These laws all set permissible
exposure limits to asbestos and establish required work practices to protect workers.
Asbestos thermal disposal facilities must also obtain construction approval from other appropriate Federal, State
and local authorities. 


IV. Administrative Record


EPA has established a record of those documents EPA considered in addressing Omega's and Vitrifix's petitions. The
record consists of documents located in the file designated by docket control number, OPPTS-62105 located
at the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC). A public version of the record, without any confidential
business information, is available in the TSCA NCIC for reviewing and copying from noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday,
excluding legal holidays, at EPA headquarters, Rm. E-G102, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. 


V. Conclusion 


EPA hereby withdraws the proposed rule entitled Proposed Exemption from Asbestos Ban on Manufacture, Processing,
and Distribution in Commerce issued June 2, 1992 (57 FR 23183).

Great Lakes Pilotage Rate Methodology 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Coast Guard, DOT. 





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking and hearing.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Coast Guard proposes to amend the Great Lakes Pilotage Regulations by establishing new procedures for determining
Great Lakes pilotage rates, and revising the financial reporting requirements mandated for Great Lakes pilot associations.
The proposed methodology would adopt methods which have proven effective in ratemaking methodologies used by regulators
of other public service industries. This notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) does not propose a change to the existing
Great Lakes pilotage rates and charges, but proposes to standardize the methodology by which those rates would be
determined in the future.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Request for Comments 



The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting written data, views
or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their name and address, identify this rulemaking (CGD
92-072) and the specific section of this rule to which each comment applies, and give a reason for each comment.
The Coast Guard requests that all comments and attachments be submitted in an unbound format suitable for copying
and electronic filing. If not practical, a second copy of any bound material is requested. Persons wanting acknowledgment
of receipt of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope. 
The Coast Guard will consider all comments received during the comment period. It may change this proposal in view
of the comments. 
The Coast Guard intends to conduct a public hearing on May 20, 1994 in room 769 of the Federal Building, 1240 E. 9th Street,
Cleveland, OH 44199. The hearing will begin at 9 a.m. and last until all comments have been heard, or until 5 p.m., whichever
is earlier. The purpose of this hearing is to gather information relating to this rulemaking and to permit responses
by interested persons to material filed in this docket. 


Drafting Information 


The principal persons involved in drafting this rule are: Mr. Scott A. Poyer, Project Manager, Office of Marine Safety,
Security and Environmental Protection, Mr. David Richards, Project Consultant, Department of Transportation
(DOT) Office of International Aviation, and Mr. Nicholas Grasselli, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel. 


Background and Purpose 


Under the Great Lakes Pilotage Act of 1960 (Pub. L. 86-555, 46 U.S.C. 9301 et seq.), vessels of the United States
operating on register and foreign vessels must engage a U.S. or Canadian registered pilot when traversing the waters
of the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes Pilotage Act, as amended, vests the Secretary of Transportation with responsibility
for setting pilotage rates. The Great Lakes Pilotage Act 49 U.S.C. 9303 provides that the Secretary shall prescribe
by regulation rates and charges for pilotage services, giving consideration to the public interest and the costs
of providing the services. This authority, except for the authority to enter into, revise or amend arrangements with
Canada, has been delegated to the Commandant of the Coast Guard by 49 CFR 1.46 (a).

Currently, the navigable waters of the Great Lakes are divided into eight pilotage areas. United States registered
pilots, along with their Canadian counterparts, provide pilotage services in areas 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Pilotage
area 3 (the Welland Canal) is currently a wholly-Canadian area where only Canadian pilots provide services. Pilotage
areas 2, 4, 6, and 8 are ``undesignated waters.'' Pilotage areas 1, 5, and 7 are ``designated waters.'' Pilots are required
to direct navigation of vessels in designated waters. Pilots are required to be on board and available to direct navigation
in undesignated waters. The seven U.S. pilotage areas are grouped together into three pilotage districts. District
1 consists of areas 1 and 2. District 2 consists of areas 4 and 5. District 3 consists of areas 6, 7, and 8. Each district
has its own pilot association. 
Section 9305 of the Pilotage Act provides that the Secretary of Transportation, subject to the concurrence of the
Secretary of State, may make agreements with the appropriate agency of Canada to prescribe joint or identical rates
and charges. The latest Memorandum of Arrangements between Canada and the United States specifies that the Secretary
of Transportation and the Minister of Transport will arrange for the establishment of regulations imposing identical
rates. In the past, consultations resulted in nominally identical U.S. and Canadian rates. Not only are generally
uniform rates required by the agreement with Canada, but they are also important from the standpoint of predictable
costs for vessels requiring pilotage. However, there are differences in the cost bases and in the operating organizations
of the U.S. and Canadian pilots, particularly with regard to pilot compensation. These differences need to be taken
into account in reaching identical U.S. and Canadian rates. Therefore, the proposed methodology, like its predecessor,
would not translate directly into new rates, but rather would form the basis for proposals to be negotiated with Canada.

On December 7, 1988, the Department of Transportation published the Great Lakes Pilotage Study Final Report (1988
DOT Pilotage Study). The study revealed weaknesses in accounting for the expenses incurred by the pilot associations
and the need to formally establish the factors used in establishing pilotage rates. On April 25, 1990, the Coast Guard
published a final rule (55 FR 17580) establishing improved audit requirements and general guidelines and procedures
to be followed in ratemaking (CGD 92-072). In May, 1990, the Inspector General (IG) for the Department of Transportation
initiated an audit of Coast Guard oversight of Great Lakes pilotage. The final report of the audit (Audit of the U.S.
Coast Guard's Oversight and Management of the Great Lakes Pilotage Program), detailing further issues affecting
the basis for Great Lakes pilotage rates, was issued on December 14, 1990.
On August 2, 1991, a DOT Task Force was formed to: (1) Develop an interim rate adjustment; and (2) establish a new pilotage
ratemaking methodology. On June 5, 1992, an interim rate increase was published (CGD 89-104). This rate adjustment
was designed to increase the revenue received by the pilots, pending development of a permanent rate methodology.

Discussion of Proposed Amendments 


This NPRM proposes a new methodology for setting pilotage rates on the Great Lakes. This NPRM would replace the general
guidelines of the existing methodology, set forth in 46 CFR Part 404, with more detailed and specific steps to be followed
when setting Great Lakes Pilotage rates. It would also make correlative changes to the accounting and reporting requirements
set forth in 46 CFR part 403. 
This NPRM would not change the current Great Lakes pilotage rates and charges contained in 46 CFR 401.400-401.428.
This NPRM proposes to change the methodology by which those rates would be determined during Great Lakes pilotage
ratemaking proceedings.

In summary, the proposed ratemaking methodology would provide that the Director of Great Lakes Pilotage (the Director),
determine the timing for reviews of pilotage rates. Interested parties would be able to petition the Director for
a review at any time. However, the Director would decide, under applicable law, if a review is warranted. If the Director
determined that a review is warranted, he or she would accomplish this review by following the steps detailed in this
rulemaking. 
Basically, these steps involve the projection of operating expenses (including pilot compensation) and revenues
(using the current rate schedule), based on the anticipated demand for pilotage services, by pilotage area for the
succeeding navigation period. Interest expense on the debt of the pilot organizations, and allowances for federal
income taxes and the capital invested in the pilot organizations would be subtracted from this projected operating
profit or loss. Ideally, projected revenues received under the existing rate schedule would be sufficient to cover
projected operating expenses, interest, and allowances. 
If a rate adjustment appeared warranted, the Director would calculate a new hourly rate schedule for basic pilotage
service in each pilotage area by dividing the sum of the projected costs (operating expenses, interest expense, and
tax and return allowances) by the projected hours of pilotage service. The Coast Guard would publish any proposed
rate adjustments in a NPRM inviting comments on the changes. That NPRM, and any subsequent comments on it, would then
form the basis for negotiations on pilotage rates between the United States and Canada. Once these negotiations resulted
in an agreement to change pilotage rates, the Coast Guard would publish a rule establishing a new rate schedule. 
This NPRM also proposes to change the financial reporting requirements for pilot associations to more closely comport
to ratemaking needs. The proposed changes to the reporting requirements, while an integral part of the ratemaking
process, should be considered independently from any proposed ratemaking provisions. This NPRM also proposes to
add a certification requirement. 
The proposals contained in the discussion section of this preamble are presented in two parts. Part A of this section
discusses proposed revisions to the ratemaking methodology. Part B addresses proposed revisions to the financial
reporting requirements. The order of discussion in this preamble differs from the order of presentation in the regulations.
The revisions to the ratemaking methodology are discussed first because an understanding of the methodology is important
to an understanding of the proposed changes to the financial reporting requirements, and because the changes to the
proposed methodology are more extensive than the changes to the financial reporting requirements. 


Adoption of Public Service Rate Methodology 


The Pilotage Act (46 U.S.C. 9303) provides, in part, that the rates and charges for pilotage services shall be fair
and equitable, giving due consideration to the public interest and the reasonable cost and expense of providing and
maintaining such facilities and arrangements as are required for the efficient performance of pilotage services.

Because the provision of service by the pilot organizations contains many of the characteristics and requirements
of a public utility, this NPRM proposes to employ basic utility ratemaking procedures in setting pilotage rates and
charges. Basic utility ratemaking concepts include the non-discriminatory treatment of users, operational and
economic efficiency through the use of ratemaking standards, and other general public policies. 
This NPRM describes the general financial structure of public service rates and proposes to apply this structure
to the three U.S. pilot organizations providing pilotage services on the Great Lakes, with several economic standards
applied to cost elements and specific application and designation of revenue categories. 


1. General Public Service Rate Structure and Definitions 


Public service rates are generally defined rates with established economic standards, most often based upon an allowed
return on investment. Shown below is a basic structure for such rates:

</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940412-1-00029 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940412-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 

This NPRM defines the elements of this basic structure for Great Lakes Pilotage Rates below. 
1.

 Adjusted Operating Revenue: 

Adjusted Operating Revenue is the sum of all operating revenues received by the pilot organizations for their pilotage
services, less revenues from ancillary pilotage services that are offset against operating expenses, discussed
below. 
2. 

Adjusted Operating Expense: 

Adjusted Operating Expense is the sum of all operating expenses incurred by the pilot organizations for their pilotage
services, less the sum of all disallowed expenses, discussed below. 
3. 

Adjusted Operating Profit (Loss): 

Adjusted Operating Profit (Loss) is the Adjusted Operating Revenue, less the Adjusted Operating Expense. 
4. 

Adjusted Interest Expense: 

Adjusted Interest Expense is the reported pilot association interest expense on operations, adjusted to exclude
any interest expense attributable to non-pilotage operations. 
5. 

Adjusted Earnings Before Tax: 

Adjusted Earnings Before Tax is the Adjusted Operating Profit (Loss), less the Adjusted Interest Expense. 
6. 

Federal Tax Allowance: 

The Federal Tax Allowance is the Federal statutory tax on Earnings Before Tax, for those pilot organizations subject
to federal tax. 
7. 

Adjusted Net Income: 

Adjusted Net Income is the Adjusted Earnings Before Tax, less the Federal Tax Allowance. 
8. 

Return Element: 

The Return Element is the Adjusted Net Income, plus Adjusted Interest Expense. The return element can be considered
the sum of the return to equity capital (the net income) and the return to debt (the interest expense). Both interest
expense and net income must be summed to determine the return to the combined debt and equity investment, below. 
9. 

Investment Base: 

The Investment Base is the net capital invested in the pilot organization, including both equity and debt. Should
capital be invested in other than pilotage operations, that capital and related revenues and expenses would be excluded
from the rate base. The investment base is defined below. 
10. 

Return on Investment: 

The Return on Investment (ROI) is the Return Element, divided by the Investment Base, and expressed as a percent. 
Putting actual data into the format described above would generate the pilot organizations' actual financial performance
for a past period. This NPRM proposes to establish prospective rates, however, and therefore propose several additional
regulatory adjustments. These adjustments include establishing a prospective return to investment, adjusting
for inflation, and projecting the need for pilotage services. These adjustments are described in Part A. 


2. Investment Base 


The Investment Base is the recognized capital investment in the useful assets employed by the pilot groups. In general,
it is the sum of available cash and the net value of real assets, less the value of land. This NPRM proposes to establish
the investment base through the use of the balance sheet accounts, as amended by material supplied in the Notes to the
Financial Statement, discussed below. Below are the accounts and methodology this NPRM proposes to use. The account
numbers are taken from the accounting revisions in Part B.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940412-1-00030 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940412-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 




The proposed Investment Base is the Recognized Assets, multiplied by the ratio of Recognized Sources of Funds to Total
Sources of Funds. Recognized assets are adjusted by this ratio to ensure that the assets are not encumbered by outstanding
liabilities. The non-recognized sources of funds are available only because they have not been demanded; they represent
costs that have been incurred, but not paid. 



Notes to the Financial Statement and Other Informational Notes 




All matters which may materially influence interpretations or conclusions drawn from the financial statement with
regard to the financial condition or earnings position are required to be clearly and completely stated as footnotes
to the financial statement (46 CFR Part 403.) 




Part A: Proposed Methodology 



In summary, the basic steps to be followed in the proposed Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking methodology would be as
follows: (1) Projection of operating expenses, including target pilot compensation; (2) projection of operating
revenues at current rates, including revenues from ancillary services; (3) calculation of investment base; (4)
determination of target rate of return on investment; (5) substitution of data into the basic utility rate structure;
and (6) adjustment of the basic pilotage rate schedule if necessary, subject to the requirements of the Memorandum
of Arrangements between the United States and Canada. The details of each of these steps can be found in Appendix A of
the proposed amendments to 46 CFR part 404. 




General Ratemaking Provisions 



The Director would continue to determine, under applicable law, when reviews of Great Lakes pilotage rates would
be conducted. In addition, this NPRM proposes to allow an interested party or parties to petition the Director for
a review, provided that sufficient justification is included in the request. This would allow the Director to react
to changing circumstances which might affect pilotage rates. The Coast Guard invites comment on whether rate reviews
should be conducted at fixed intervals, and if so, what the timing of the intervals should be. 


This NPRM proposes that each of the seven U.S. pilotage areas be treated as separate cost centers for ratemaking calculations.
This is because each area consists of either designated or undesignated waters, and the target pilot compensation
would be different for each. 




Part A.1. Derivation of Return on Investment and Adjustment for Inflation 


Return on Investment 



The proposed rate schedule, based on average costs per pilotage hour as developed below, are in part determined by
the permitted rate of return on investment (ROI). This is calculated by dividing the sum of return to debt (interest
expense) and the return to equity (net income), by the investment base. Revenues received must be sufficiently high
to create sufficient net income, when added to interest expense and the sum divided by the investment base, to equal
the allowed rate of return on investment. 

The ROI for any industry can vary significantly depending solely on the mix of debt to equity capital. Many public service
ratemaking authorities determine the allowable ROI using an artificial debt/equity ratio. This is generally done
to encourage equity capital investment in an industry, since the return to equity is generally set higher than the
return to debt. Since such a mechanism is neither feasible nor necessary in the case of pilotage services, this NPRM
does not propose to establish any ROI standard based on a specified debt/equity ratio, but would accept the debt/equity
ratio of each of the pilot organizations as reported. 

This NPRM proposes to set the allowed rate of return to equity capital at the most recent return on stockholder's equity
for a representative cross-section of transportation industry companies, including maritime companies, with
a minimum rate equal to the interest rate incurred by the associations for debt capital, and a maximum rate of 20.0 percent.
Alternate proposed rate of return to capital percentages should contain reasonable support for their selection
over this NPRM's proposal. For example, under this NPRM's proposed methodology, the computed ROI standard for pilotage
rates, assuming a 50/50 debt/equity ratio, an implicit interest rate of 14 percent on debt capital and a 20 percent
return to equity capital, would be 17.0 percent (.50 times .14, plus .50 times .20 = .170, or 17.0 percent.)

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940412-1-00031 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940412-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The average hourly charge for pilotage services would be set to generate sufficient revenues to cover operating expense
and the return on investment allowance (including Federal taxes, if any). 


Adjustment for Inflation 


This NPRM proposes to project annual inflation factors to the succeeding navigation season, reflecting the gradual
increase in cost throughout the season. These inflation factors would be applied to the actual costs of the pilot organizations,
other than for pilot compensation, in computing the rate necessary to achieve the target ROI. The factors would not
be applied to pilot compensation costs, which are estimated separately. 

This NPRM proposes to project the actual annual experienced changes in the average costs per pilot assignment for
each pilotage area after the initial two years of cost inflation under this NPRM's proposed rate methodology. The
initial two years of cost adjustment would be based on the preceding year's change in the North Central Region's Consumer
Price Index, as calculated by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Costs not subject to inflation (depreciation,
for example) would not be adjusted for this initial period. Alternate methods of cost projection proposed during
the comment period of this rule would be carefully considered. 




Part A.2. Recognition of Costs for Ratemaking Purposes 


Virtually all regulated rates contain economic incentives, penalties, or limits. This NPRM has already mentioned
one such standard sometimes used, an artificial debt/equity ratio for return on investment. This NPRM proposes one
explicit economic standard for Great Lakes pilotage ratemakings_recognition of lease expenses only to the extent
that they either: (a) Approximate open market costs (for those leased assets with readily available markets); or
(b) approximate ownership cost (for those leased assets with limited alternative markets, or which were obtained
through transaction with affiliated companies.) 
This NPRM also proposes to place expenses that appear excessive under greater scrutiny than in the past. Regulators
may disallow expenses, subject to appeal by the pilot associations, as excessive or unrelated to the provision of
pilotage services. 
Finally, while the Coast Guard is unaware of the use of other than the straight-line method of recording depreciation
expense by the pilot organizations, this NPRM does not propose to recognize, for rate-setting purposes, depreciation
expenses on other than a straight-line basis. 


Recognition of Lease Expenses 


Economic organizations lease equipment or other assets for a number of operational or financial reasons. This NPRM
proposes no general objection to the leasing of assets. However, lease transactions, and lease transactions with
related companies in particular, are subject to two general guidelines in public ratesetting. The first guideline
allows recognition of lease expense with no adjustment should the lease terms generally approximate the market conditions
for the leased asset. The second guideline allows the recognition of lease expenses only to the extent that the lease
cost approximates the cost of owning the asset. 
This NPRM proposes to recognize lease costs to the extent that they generally approximates open market costs, subject
to the condition that a readily available alternative supplier for the leased asset exists. Should there be no readily
available alternate supplier, recognition of lease costs would be limited to the approximate cost of ownership,
including a return to capital. Since related-party transactions by definition are not open market transactions,
this NPRM proposes to generally apply the more stringent guideline to all related-party transactions. (See 14 CFR
399.43, for example). 
This NPRM proposes to amend the financial reporting requirements to require that lease costs be recorded in accordance
with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) publication FASB-13, including subsequent rulings
on this subject by the FASB. 


Part A.3. Ancillary Charges 


Several charges have traditionally been levied for ancillary pilotage services, such as docking/undocking and
moving to an anchorage, as well as penalty charges, such as for delay or cancellation. Revenues received for these
services have been included as part of the overall revenues received by the pilot organizations in estimating the
need for rate changes. However, accepting these revenues as general revenues does not tie the revenues received to
the provision of a service or the incursion of a cost. For example, overhead costs (non-pilot compensation costs)
are incurred in assigning a pilot. Should that order be later cancelled, the revenue received from the cancellation
charge is reported as cancellation charge revenue, but is not linked to the overhead cost of assigning the pilot. 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940412-1-00032 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940412-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

This NPRM proposes to link revenues received for ancillary services to the cost of services provided through the use
of revenue offset methodology. Under this method, revenues received from charges for ancillary services are ``offset''
against the direct expenses of providing that service. In the above example, overhead costs would be reduced by the
revenues received for the cancellation charge, other costs (pilot compensation costs for example) would be unaffected.
The total amount of revenue received (needed) or expenses recognized under revenue offset methodology is unchanged.
However, as discussed below, this NPRM proposes to set the charges for ancillary services separately from the basic
pilotage rates in this NPRM. In addition, this NPRM also proposes to equalize ancillary charges between districts.
For equity, as well as for economic reasons, a docking charge at Duluth should be equal to one at Chicago, Detroit, or
Buffalo. This NPRM will discuss these charges in turn. 


Docking/Undocking and Harbor Movement Charges 


The current docking/undocking charges in undesignated waters are $297, $256, and $271, for Districts 1 through 3,
respectively. Districts 1 and 3 also have a direct charge for a moveage in a harbor, at $580 and $531, respectively.
For comparability, during the next ratemaking the Coast Guard would propose to set the docking/undocking charge
at the same level for all three districts (e.g. at $250), subject to supported comment for establishment at any other
level, or for differentiation between districts. This NPRM does not propose to adjust this charge for inflation,
but may change the level of the charge from time to time upon review of the Director. In similar fashion, during the next
ratemaking the Coast Guard would propose to set the charge for moveage in a harbor for all three districts at twice the
docking charge, (e.g. $500), under the presumption that a moveage requires both an undocking (or lifting anchor)
and a docking (anchorage). This adjustment is again subject to supported comment as to level and applicability. Again,
this NPRM does not propose to adjust this charge for inflation, but may change the level of the charge from time to time
upon review of the Director. 
Revenue received for docking/undocking and moveage within a harbor would be offset against revenues required for
pilot compensation. 


Delay Charges 


Delay charges, per hour, whether for trip interruption or departure or moveage delays, would be set at the rate determined
in the pilot compensation phase, below, as adjusted for ship size. The maximum basic rate for any 24 hour period would
be the per hour delay charge, as adjusted for ship size, times 16 hours. Delay charges would not be imposed for interruption
caused by ice, weather, or traffic (except from December 1 through April 8 of each year), and would also not be imposed
in undesignated waters if a trip, though delayed, is still completed within the minimum 6 hour period under 401.410(a).
Revenues received for delay charges would be offset against revenues required for pilot compensation. 


Cancellation Charges 


If a pilot reports for duty and the order is cancelled, the ship would pay the minimum basic pilot compensation charge
for a six-hour period, unadjusted for ship size; if the order is cancelled, and the pilot has started travel but not
arrived, the minimum charge would also apply. If the cancellation is more than six hours after the pilot reports to
the designated boarding point, the ship would pay the minimum basic pilot compensation charge for six-hour period,
plus delay charges for each hour or fraction of an hour over six hours, subject to the maximum basic rate for delay charges
(the delay charge per hour times 16 hours for any 24 hour period.) Revenues received for cancellation charges would
be offset against operating expenses. 


Lock Passage Charges 


As for docking/undocking and moveage, this NPRM proposes that the fee for lock passage should be the same for all three
districts. During the next ratemaking the Coast Guard would propose to set the lock transit charge at the same level
for all three districts (e.g. $150), subject to supported comment for establishment at any other level, or for differentiation
between districts. This NPRM does not propose to adjust this charge for inflation, but may change the level of the charge
from time to time upon review of the Director. Revenues received for lock passage charges would be offset against revenues
required for pilot compensation. 


Part A.4. Development and Application of Hourly Pilotage Charges 


The operating expenses recognized under this NPRM's proposed methodology are broken into two major components,
pilot compensation costs and non-pilot operating costs. The projected non-pilot operating costs for the ensuing
navigation season, including the constructed amount necessary to bring the pilot organizations to the ROI standard,
would be divided by the sum of the estimated pilotage hours for both designated and undesignated waters, by District.
This standard charge per hour would be applied on a per hour basis for each supplied pilotage hour, whether in designated
or undesignated waters. 
Total pilot compensation costs for designated and undesignated waters are derived from the target pilot compensation
for masters and first mates, times the number of needed pilots. The pilot compensation cost per hour for designated
and undesignated waters is this constructed cost, divided by the pilot hours projected in designated or undesignated
waters. Target pilot compensation and the number of needed pilots is developed below. 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940412-1-00033 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940412-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The sum of non-pilot operating costs per hour and pilot compensation costs per hour (for designated and undesignated
waters separately) is the total cost per hour to be charged for pilotage services.


Target Pilot Compensation 


The Coast Guard and Department policy is to maintain income comparability between pilots providing international
regulated pilot services and private masters and first mates operating domestic vessels on the Great Lakes with similar
responsibilities. This NPRM proposes to continue the current income comparability policy of using as target compensation
for pilots in undesignated waters the compensation of first mates on U.S. Great Lakes vessels. Target compensation
for pilots providing service in designated waters would continue to be comparable to masters on Great Lakes vessels,
but this NPRM proposes to set the target at 150% of the compensation of first mates, rather than attempting to determine
the actual average compensation of Great Lakes masters. While the Coast Guard would periodically review this estimate,
available data indicate that this average premium has remained reasonably stable, is relatively simple to administer,
and avoids costly sampling of individual master's contracts, which are not publicly available. 
This NPRM lists below those items proposed to be included as part of the pilot compensation portion of the rate schedule.
Line items here included would be removed from the cost pools included in direct operating expenses to preclude double
counting. 


Target Pilot Compensation Designated and Undesignated Waters 


Undesignated Waters_First Mate Compensation Component 


1. Contractual daily rate @ 260 days: 
Medical allowance, Pension allowance, Holiday pay, Overtime pay, 
Winter close-down allowance. 

2. Additions to compensation: F.I.C.A., 
Workmen's compensation allowance, Total. 


Designated Waters_150 Percent of First Mate Compensation 


This NPRM proposes to exclude profit sharing as a component of pilot compensation expense, since this is a voluntary
contribution by the employer paid from profits, similar in form to the return element proposed to be paid the pilot
organizations (which may be distributed as a bonus). Profit sharing expense, which may have been included in past
rate-setting as an expense item in the pilot associations expense accounts, would be disallowed. 
This NPRM proposes to add a F.I.C.A. allowance and a workmen's compensation allowance to pilot compensation to ensure
comparability between pilot groups, and to properly reflect the allocated cost of pilot services. Allowances listed
here would be transferred from general pilot association costs (if included there), or added to the cost pools (if
not currently included in general association costs). This NPRM proposes to require these costs to be separately
identified and reported in either the financial statement or by special report (See Part B). 


Number of Required Pilots 


The Coast Guard and Department policies have set the minimum number of pilots needed by establishing specific minimum
annual pilot hours for designated and undesignated waters (1,000 and 1,800 hours per pilot, respectively) for a pilot
to receive comparable compensation discussed above. The required number of pilots for any succeeding navigation
season was determined by dividing a projection of the number of pilot hours required in designated and undesignated
waters, by District, by the minimum standard annual pilot hours. This required number of pilots, for both designated
and undesignated services and individually rounded upward, was then multiplied by the target income per pilot (above)
to determine the revenue necessary under the rate.
This NPRM proposes to continue this policy and methodology in determining the number of pilots and the necessary pilot
comparability income to be included in the rate schedule. 


Pilot Compensation Charges Per Hour 


The target pilot compensation, by District and by designated (Master) and undesignated (First Mate) compensation,
would then be divided by the estimated pilotage hours in designated or undesignated waters to construct an average
hourly cost per hour for pilot compensation in designated or undesignated waters. 


Total Pilotage Charges Per Hour 


Pilot compensation charges per hour, for designated and undesignated waters separately, would be added to the average
cost for non-pilot compensation expenses per hour. The sum of these average costs, for designated and undesignated
waters separately, would be the average cost per pilotage hour to be recovered under the rate, subject to the adjustment
for vessel size, below. 


Part A.5. Adjustment of Pilotage Charges for Vessel Size 


It is accepted belief and practice that pilotage of larger vessels deserves a higher level of compensation than that
for smaller vessels. The current rate schedule uses a vessel size multiplier to increase the charge for larger vessels,
and, presumably, the pilot compensation. (46 CFR 401.400) Also, maintaining shipping in the Great Lakes is a public
benefit and goal, and is supported by government agencies. As smaller ships carry less cargo and are more affected
by pilotage cost on a per-ton basis, a differential in cost (or lesser increase) is likely to encourage the continuation
of their service.

<PARENT> FR940412-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Based on this perceived public interest, this NPRM proposes to continue to use these vessel-size rate multipliers
for the proposed rates for all three districts. However, the average base rate derived above must be adjusted for such
multiplication, since the average base rate is an unweighted charge. This NPRM proposes to adjust the base rate to
reflect a ship weighting factor of 1.0 by dividing the average base rate by the average ship weighting factor derived
from pilot billings. For 1990 the average weighted ship sailing, for designated and undesignated waters was as follows:







This NPRM proposes to adjust the hourly charge for pilot services by dividing the average total pilotage charge by
the average vessel weighting factor for the preceding year. 
For illustrative purposes only, this adjustment to the pilotage charge per hour is shown below. (In the example, the
hourly rates are derived from the interim rate increase published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 5, 1992 (CGD 89-104) to calculate charges on an hourly basis.) For District 1, Area 1, ship factor 1.0 would
equal the average cost per hour of $166, divided by the average ship weighting factor of 1.269, or $131. Ship factor
1.3 would be $131 times 1.3, or $170. For ease of calculation this NPRM proposes to continue to use hourly rates rounded
to the nearest dollar.



Example






Part A.6. Application of the Pilotage Charges to Vessel Trips 


The required pilotage charges per pilot hour are determined above. Most trips and sailings, however, are provided
between relatively few points, in part due to pilot changeover, and in part due to ship movements involving mostly
the larger trading ports. For simplicity and operational efficiency, this NPRM proposes to fix the pilotage charges
for selected sailings and trips, based upon average transit time as reported in pilot source forms. This NPRM proposes
that the average time for sailings served more than ten times per year in each direction would adequately define the
necessary pilot time for these repeated sailings, exclusive of delay and demurrage. This NPRM proposes to multiply
the average time for these repeated sailings by the adjusted pilotage charge for Ship Factor 1 to construct a base charge
for these sailings. These base charges would be published in matrix form, by district. 
This NPRM proposes to base the pilotage charges for sailings to less-served points upon the actual time spent in pilotage
(subject to minimum and incremental hourly charges, below), multiplied by the adjusted pilotage charge per hour.
Charges listed in matrix form and computed time-based charges would be subject to the vessel-size multiplier, as
in the current rate schedule. 
This NPRM also proposes, for less-served points, to continue a minimum six-hour pilotage charge, but with additional
charges added in three hour increments. This NPRM's proposal to use three hour increments represents a reduction
from the six hour increments in the current rate schedule, to more closely match the services performed. 


Part B: Financial Reporting 


Summary of Changes to Reporting Requirements 


As indicated in Part A, several changes are proposed to the accounting regulations and reporting requirements under
the Great Lakes Pilotage Regulations. In order to facilitate ratemaking, this NPRM proposes to require more detailed
financial reporting from each pilot association. 
This NPRM proposes that each pilot association report financial data in a standard format prescribed by the Director,
and that financial statements of each association be signed by an officer of that association to verify accuracy.
In addition, 46 CFR part 403 would be renumbered and reorganized to bring this part into conformance with current regulatory
guidelines on the numbering and organization of regulations. 
This NPRM proposes that the general ledger account numbers in part 403 be expanded from four digits to five digits,
and placed in Appendices A and B to part 403. This proposed change would allow greater flexibility in making future
changes to the system of accounts. In addition, the definitions of profit and loss accounts currently found in 46 CFR
403.9 would be deleted because this section does not add any significant information to the uniform accounting system.

This NPRM proposes that the straight line depreciation method would be consistently used by all pilotage associations.
Using this method would evenly allocate the acquisition costs over the useful life of assets subject to depreciation.
It would also minimize the annual fluctuation of operating expenses and their effect over the ratemaking calculations.

This NPRM proposes that the recording of lease costs be guided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
publication FASB-13 and subsequent pronouncements on this subject by the FASB. This proposed change would
differentiate capital leases from operating leases, updating the Great Lakes pilotage accounting standards in
conformance with current accounting practices. 
Under the current regulations (46 CFR part 403), all pilot associations maintain the same general system of accounts.
However, no two associations currently report financial information in the same format, leading to inconsistencies
between associations. This NPRM proposes an adjustment to the system of accounts. This change would facilitate ratemaking
calculations, and would put pilot associations on a comparable footing for ratemaking calculations. 
Corporations are required by law to pay certain expenses (e.g., Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) and Workmen's
Compensation). However, for unincorporated associations, these expenses are paid by the individual members, and
are not shown on the association's financial statement. If these expenses are not considered in the ratemaking calculations
for unincorporated associations, a lower level of compensation for those pilots would be shown, as compared to compensation
for their counterparts in associations organized as corporations. This NPRM proposes that each unincorporated
pilot association report this financial information, now separately reported, in notes to the association's financial
statement. Only reported items would be considered in ratemaking calculations for all pilot associations. The Director
would not impute such items. This change would put pilot associations with different organizations on a comparable
footing for ratemaking calculations. 
This NPRM proposes to require that financial information which is currently reported on a quarterly basis be reported
on a semiannual basis, and to update the address for the Director. This proposed change to the financial reporting
requirements would ease the burden on pilot associations, without affecting the ratemaking process or oversight
of the pilot associations.

This NPRM proposes that profit and loss accounts be reported semiannually in accordance with the charter of accounts
proposed in Appendix B to part 403. 
This NPRM proposes standardized reporting, by account number, for financial data now submitted in summarized, unnumbered
fashion. The proposed revisions and additions to the reporting requirements are necessary to examine selected costs
for reasonableness (lease and interest costs, etc.); to specifically list expenses that would be included in pilot
compensation costs (e.g., pension and health costs, etc.); and to provide identification for costs not currently
listed as incurred in some districts (e.g., pilot insurance, FICA, retirement). 
For ratemaking purposes, more detailed information is needed than that supplied in the current financial statements
to determine the reasonableness of capital lease agreements and the depreciable lives and residual value of selected
assets. This NPRM proposes that all matters which may materially influence interpretations or conclusions drawn
from the financial statements of pilot associations with regard to the financial condition or earnings position
of the association would have to be clearly and completely stated as footnotes to the financial statement. 
This NPRM proposes to continue the requirement that all financial records, including information on lease transactions,
be maintained and be readily available to the Director's auditors for 10 years. 
This NPRM does not propose any significant changes to the form of Inter-Association Settlement Statements. However,
comments on whether it is necessary to retain this section, or any other suggested changes, are specifically requested.



Regulatory Evaluation 


This proposal is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, and significant under the Department
of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040, February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard considers
this proposed regulation to be significant because a rulemaking affecting the setting of pilotage rates is controversial
and of significant interest to the public. 
The primary purpose of this rulemaking is to standardize the financial reporting of Great Lakes pilot associations
and to clarify the methodology to be used in future ratemakings. The methodology proposed is expected to have a minimal
impact on pilotage rates. Since the effect of the rulemaking on pilotage rates is expected to be minimal, a full Regulatory
Evaluation is unnecessary. 


Small Entities 


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are
not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). Because this proposal does not affect the overall level of pilotage rates, this proposal
should have little or no impact on small entities which pay pilotage rates, or receive income from pilotage rates.
Because it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this
proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Collection of Information 


Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviews each proposed rule that contains a collection of information
requirement to determine whether the practical value of the information is worth the burden imposed by its collection.
Collection of information requirements include reporting, recordkeeping, notification, and other, similar requirements.

This proposal contains collection of information requirements in the additions to 46 CFR part 403. The following
particulars apply: 


DOT No.: 

2115. 


OMB Control No.: 

2115-0022. 


Administration: 

U.S. Coast Guard. 


Title: 

Great Lakes Pilotage Rate Methodology. 


Need for Information: 

The information is necessary for ratemaking calculations and for the proper financial oversight of the Great Lakes
pilot associations. However, pilot associations currently report financial information as required by 46 CFR part
403. This proposal merely amends the existing reporting requirements by separating several existing summary accounts
into their individual components, and requiring that the financial reporting of all accounts be done in a standardized
format. 


Proposed Use of Information: 

The reported data would be used in Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking calculations, and for the proper financial oversight
of the Great Lakes pilot associations. 


Frequency of Response: 

The Balance Sheet, and the Profit and Loss Statement, which are currently required quarterly, would be required semiannually.
Revenue and Traffic Statements would be required monthly. 


Burden Estimate: 

No change from the current burden. 


Respondents: 

Each Great Lakes pilot association (there are currently three). 


Form(s): 

Designated by the Director, Great Lakes Pilotage. 


Average Burden Hours Per Respondent: 

No change to the current burden hours. 
The Coast Guard has submitted the requirements to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction
Act. Persons submitting comments on the requirements should submit their comments both to OMB and to the Coast Guard
where indicated under 

ADDRESSES

.


Federalism


The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposed rule in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612 and has determined that this proposed rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Under 49 CFR 1.46(a) the Secretary delegates to the Commandant of the
Coast Guard the authority to carry out the Great Lakes Pilotage Act of 1960, as amended, except the authority to enter
into, revise, or amend arrangements with Canada. 
Furthermore, since vessel traffic in the Great Lakes tends to move between U.S. ports in the national marketplace,
pilotage regulations for the Great Lakes is a matter for which regulations should be of national scope to avoid unreasonably
burdensome variances. State action addressing the same subject matter is preempted by 46 U.S.C. 9306, which provides
that a State or political subdivision of a State may not regulate or impose any requirement on pilotage on the Great
Lakes. 


Environment 


The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this NPRM and concluded that under section 2.B.2 of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. The rule
is procedural in nature because it deals exclusively with ratemaking and accounting procedures. Therefore, this
is included in the categorical exclusion in subsection 2.B.2.1_Administrative actions or procedural regulations
and policies which clearly do not have any environmental impact. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available
in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under

Subpart A_General 


 403.100 

Applicability of system of accounts and reports. 


Each Association shall keep its books of account, records and memoranda, and make reports to the Director in accordance
with the system of accounts prescribed in Appendices A, B and C of this part. These financial records shall be prepared
in accordance with the guidelines of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) issued by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB). These guidelines are available by writing to the Director, Great Lakes Pilotage
at the address listed in  401.110(a)(9) of this chapter. The Director reserves the right, however, to expand
or otherwise modify this system of accounts and reports in accordance with this rule. 


 403.105 

Waivers from the system of accounts and reports. 


The Director may grant a waiver from any provision of the system of accounts or reports prescribed in this part upon
his or her own initiative or upon written request from any Association, provided that such a waiver is in the public
interest. Each request for waiver must expressly demonstrate that: existing peculiarities or unusual circumstances
warrant a departure from a required procedure or technique prescribed herein; a specifically defined alternative
procedure or technique will result in a substantially equivalent or more accurate portrayal of operating results
or financial condition, consistent with the principles embodied in this part; and the application of such alternative
procedure will maintain or improve uniformity in substantive results between Associations. 


 403.110 

General description of system of accounts and reports. 


(a) The Uniform System of Accounts required by this part permits limited contraction or expansion to reflect the varying
needs and capabilities of different Associations without impairing basic accounting comparability between Associations.

<PARENT> FR940412-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(b) Under the Uniform System of Accounts, both balance sheet and profit and loss accounts and account groupings are
designed, in general, to embrace all activities, both pool and nonpool, in which the Association engages. Except
for transactions which are of sufficient magnitude to distort current year operating results, prior year transactions
are recorded in the same accounts as current year transactions of a like nature. 
(c) In order to afford each Association flexibility to establish ledger and subsidiary accounts to meet its individual
needs, a minimum number of accounts are prescribed in the Uniform System of Accounts. Each Association, in maintaining
its accounting records, must use the prescribed chart of accounts. If additional accounts are necessary, the new
accounts must be consistent with the prescribed chart of accounts classification. 


 403.115 

System of accounts coding. 


A five digit control number is assigned for each balance sheet and profit and loss account. Each account is numbered
sequentially, within blocks, designating basic balance sheet and profit and loss classifications. 


 403.120 

Records. 


(a) The general books of account and all books, records, and supporting memoranda shall be maintained in such manner
as to provide, at any time, full information relating to any account. Supporting memoranda must provide sufficient
information to verify the nature and character of each entry and its proper classification under the prescribed Uniform
System of Accounts. 
(b) Each Association shall maintain all records necessary to show the history of, or facts regarding, each accounting
or financial transaction. These records include but are not limited to, organization tables and charts, internal
accounting manuals and revisions, minutes books, stock books, reports, cost distributions and other accounting
work sheets, correspondence, and memoranda. 
(c) Each Association shall maintain all books, records and memoranda in a manner that will readily permit audit and
examination by the Director or the Director's representatives at any time. All books, records and memoranda shall
be protected from loss, theft, or damage by fire, flood or otherwise, and shall be retained for 10 years unless otherwise
authorized by the Director. 


 403.125 

Accounting entities. 


Each Association shall be a separate accounting entity. However, the records shall be maintained with sufficient
particularity to allocate items to each pilotage pool operation or nonpool operation and to support the equitable
proration of items which are common to two or more pilotage pools. 


 403.130 

Interpretation of accounts. 


Questions concerning accounts or reports required by this part should be submitted to the Director. 


 403.135 

Address for reports and correspondence. 


Reports, statements, and correspondence required by this part shall be submitted to the Director at the address listed
in  401.110(a)(9) of this chapter. 


Subpart B_General Accounting Policies 


 403.200 

Bases of allocation between pool and nonpool operations. 


(a) Profit and loss items and assets common to two or more pools or to nonpool operations shall be allocated equitably
to each pool and to nonpool operations. 
(b) Changes in methods of allocating items between pools shall only be made as of the beginning of each calendar year.



 403.205 

Accounting period. 


(a) Each Association subject to this part shall maintain its accounts on a calendar year basis unless otherwise approved
by the Director. 
(b) Each Association shall keep its financial accounts and records on a full accrual basis. All transactions, as nearly
as may reasonably be ascertained, shall be reflected in the Association's books for the accounting period, matching
revenues earned with the costs attaching thereto. 
(c) Expenses incurred during the current accounting year which demonstrably benefit operations to be performed
during subsequent accounting years to a significant extent shall be deferred and amortized. 


 403.210 

Liability accruals. 


Charges shall be made against income and accruals made for only those liabilities for which a definitely demonstrable
obligation exists. Where a definite obligation has been incurred and the precise liability has not been determined,
an estimate may be made of the currently existing liability on such actuarial or other bases as can be justified from
available information, provided that balances are reevaluated and adjusted at least once each accounting year.



 403.215 

Federal income tax accruals. 


(a) All income taxes shall be accrued by proportionate charges or credits to income each accounting period in such
manner as will allocate the charges for taxes, or the tax credits for losses, to the periods in which the related profits
or losses respectively, are reflected. 
(b) The accrual of income taxes for each accounting period requires that each Association take up in its accounts an
amount equivalent to the actual tax liability applicable to the period as computed or estimated on the basis of income
tax laws and regulations then in effect, except where the Association computes depreciation for tax purposes at rates
which differ from straight-line depreciation based upon the estimated life of the asset. In all cases, regardless
of the amount of depreciation which is reported to Federal, State, and local tax authorities for tax purposes, each
Associations' financial reports to the Director shall reflect adjustment of cost to reflect straight-line depreciation.



 403.220 

Delayed items. 


(a) All items affecting net income, including income adjustments, shall be recorded in appropriate profit and loss
accounts and reflected on the income statement and shall not be entered directly to retained earnings.

<DOCNO> FR940412-1-00038 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940412-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(b) Items applicable to operations occurring prior to the current accounting year which were not recorded in the books
of account shall be included in the same accounts which would have been charged or credited if the items had not been
delayed; except that if any delayed item is relatively so large in amount that its inclusion in the accounts for a single
year would materially distort the affected accounts, it shall be included in profit and loss classification 69000
``Miscellaneous.'' 


 403.225 

Estimated items. 


(a) If a transaction has occurred but the amount involved is not precisely determinable, the amount shall be estimated,
included in the proper accounts and, where significant, noted for financial statement purposes. 


 403.230 

Improvements, additions and betterments. 


(a) As a general rule, expenditures for additions, betterments or improvements, which increase the productive capacity
of units of property or equipment, shall be capitalized rather than charged directly against income of the period
in which incurred. Expenditures of insignificant amount may be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized, provided
their inclusion as individual items or when aggregated for like items, will not distort current operating results.

(b) The costs to be capitalized shall include all costs directly incurred by reason of the acquisition of the capital
item, including transportation and installation costs. 


 403.235 

Accounting for transactions in gross amounts. 


(a) All assets and liabilities shall be stated in balance sheet presentations in gross values, provided that all depreciation,
provisions for uncollectible accounts, and other valuation reserves shall be offset against the class of asset to
which related. 
(b) The cost of Treasury Certificates or other tax notes, which are to be surrendered to the United States Treasury,
rather than independently sold, in satisfying Federal income tax liabilities, may be offset against accrued Federal
income tax liabilities provided both the gross income tax liability and the value of the tax notes are reflected on
the face of the balance sheet. The offset of other government securities or other assets against Federal income tax
liabilities is prohibited. 


 403.240 

Valuation of assets. 


All assets shall be recorded at cost to the Association and shall not be adjusted to reflect changes in market value
except that items which have been expensed from current inventories, and are recovered, may be returned to inventory
at estimated value with contra credit to the expense accounts initially charged. 


 403.245 

Establishment of reserves. 


(a) Provisions for reserves covering transactions or conditions which do not diminish assets or result in demonstrable
liability to the Association, with corresponding diminution in stockholder equity during the period over which
accrued, shall not be charged against income but shall be charged directly against balance sheet account 39100 ``Unappropriated
retained earnings.'' 
(b) All reserves shall be classified in balance sheet presentations in terms of their inherent impact upon the Association's
financial condition as either valuation of assets (offsetting the assets to which related), accrued liabilities,
or appropriations of retained earnings. 


 403.250 

Depreciation and amortization. 


(a) Assets of a type possessing prolonged service lives significantly longer than one year, and which are generally
repaired and reused shall be written off against operations through periodic depreciation or amortization charges
from the date first placed in regular service. Assets of a type which are recurrently expended and replaced, rather
than repaired and reused, shall not be depreciated or amortized but shall be charged to expense as issued for use. 
(b) Assets of a type which are subject to depreciation shall not be classified as current assets but shall be carried
in property and equipment or other appropriate noncurrent asset account classifications. Assets of a type which
are recurrently expended and replaced shall be classified as current assets. 
(c) Depreciation shall be calculated and reported to the Director using the straight-line depreciation method.



 403.255 

Contingent assets and contingent liabilities. 


Contingent assets and contingent liabilities shall not be included in the body of the balance sheet but shall be explained
in the footnotes.

 403.260 

Notes to financial statements. 


(a) All matters which are not clearly identified in the body of the financial statements of the Association, but which
may materially influence interpretations or conclusions that may reasonably be drawn in regard to financial condition
or earnings position of the Association, shall be clearly and completely stated as footnotes to the financial statements.

(b) Financial items which are not otherwise required to be reported in the Association financial statements, but
which may affect ratemaking calculations, are required to be reported to the Director in the notes to the financial
statements. Any financial items that are not reported to the Director will not be imputed by the Director during ratemaking
procedures contained in part 404 of this chapter. 


Subpart C_Balance Sheet 


 403.300 

General. 


(a) The balance sheet accounts are designed to show the financial conditions of the Association as of a given date,
reflecting the asset and liability balances carried forward subsequent to the closing or constructive closing of
the Association's books of account. 
(b) The balance sheet accounts prescribed in this system of accounts are listed in appendix A of this part. 


 403.305 

Balance sheet account groupings. 




(a) Current Assets.

 (1) Each Association shall include in this classification all resources which may reasonably be expected to be realized
in cash or sold or consumed within one year, including but not limited to: 
(i) Unrestricted cash; 
(ii) Assets that are readily convertible into cash; or 
(iii) Assets held for current receivables and claims against others to the extent settlement is reasonably assured.

(2) Securities of investment and special fund accounts at date of acquisition need not be reclassified until disposition.

(3) Inventories of all materials, supplies, lubricating oils, motor fuels, and expendable spares shall be physically
verified at least annually. Differences between the inventory account and the actual physical inventory due to shortage,
overage, shrinkage, etc. shall be adjusted by charges or credits to the appropriate expense account. 
(4) Items of general current asset characteristics which are not expected to be realized or consumed within one year
may be included in this classification provided the noncurrent portion is not substantial in amount and classification
as a current item will not impair the significance of working capital. 


(b) Investments and special funds.

 (1) Each Association shall include in this classification long-term investments in securities of others exclusive
of United States Government securities, including: 
(i) Securities which are not readily marketable; 
(ii) Funds set aside for specific purposes or involving restrictions preventing current use; 
(iii) Contract performance deposits and other securities receivable; or 
(iv) Funds not available for current operations. 
(2) Investments in United States Government securities shall be included in the current assets account group. 
(3) Investments in securities of others shall be recorded at cost exclusive of amounts paid for accrued interest or
dividends. 


(c) Property and equipment.

 (1) All investments of the Association in land and units of tangible property and equipment shall be included within
this general classification. 
(2) The property and equipment records shall be maintained so as to identify property with each pool operation, with
nonpool operations, and joint pool or nonpool operations. Property used by two or more pools or nonpool operations
will be maintained to permit an equitable proration of depreciation, amortization, and repair and maintenance cost.

(3) Operating and nonoperating property and equipment shall be accounted for separately as follows: 
(i) Investment in property and equipment shall be recorded at total cost including all expenditures applicable to
acquisition, other costs of a preliminary nature, costs incidental to placing in position and conditioning for operation,
and costs of additions, betterments, improvements and modifications. 
(ii) Upon disposal by sale, retirement, abandonment, dismantling, or otherwise, of equipment depreciated on a unit
basis, the Association shall:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940412-1-00040 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940412-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(A) Credit the account in which the property or equipment is carried with the cost thereof; 
(B) Charge the depreciation and maintenance reserves with the related reserve balance applicable to the property
disposed of; 
(C) Charge the cash proceeds of the sale or the value of salvaged material to the appropriate asset accounts; and 
(D) When the sales price or salvage value less the cost of dismantling differs from the cost of the property less accrued
depreciation and maintenance reserves, the difference shall be recorded in the appropriate capital gain or loss
accounts. 


(iii) Upon disposal by sale, retirement, abandonment, dismantling, or otherwise, of equipment depreciated on a
group basis, the Association shall credit the account in which the property or equipment is carried, and charge the
related depreciation reserve with the original cost thereof, less any salvage realized, regardless of the age of
the item. No gain or loss is recognized on the retirement of individual items of property or equipment depreciated
on a group basis. 
(iv) When property or equipment owned by the Association is applied as part payment of the purchase price of new property
or equipment, the new property or equipment shall be recorded at its full purchase price, provided an excessive allowance
is not made for assets traded-in, in lieu of price adjustments or discounts on the purchase price of assets acquired.
The difference between the depreciated cost of assets applied as payment and the amount allowed therefor shall be
treated as retirement gain or loss. 
(v) The Association shall maintain property and equipment records setting forth the description of all property
and equipment recorded in balance sheet classification 12000-13000, Property and Equipment. With respect
to each unit or group of property or equipment, the record shall show the description, location, date of acquisition,
the original cost, the cost of additions and betterments, the cost of parts retired, rates of depreciation, residual
values not subject to depreciation, and the date of retirement or other disposition. 


(d) Property and equipment depreciation and maintenance reserves. 

(1) Each Association shall include in this balance sheet classification the accumulation of all provisions for losses
occurring in property or equipment from use and obsolescence. For example, it shall include accumulated depreciation
established to record current and cumulative cost expiration of assets being depreciated due to wear and tear from
use and the action of time and the elements which are not replaced by current repairs; as well as losses in capacity for
use or service occasioned by obsolescence, supersession, discoveries, change in popular demand, or the requirement
of public authority. Residual values and rates for accrual of depreciation and maintenance shall be calculated using
the straight-line depreciation method. 
(2) Depreciation shall be calculated from the date on which a building, structure or unit of property is placed in service,
and shall cease on the date such property is disposed of by sale, retirement, abandonment, or dismantling, or when
the difference between the cost and residual value shall have been charged to expense. 
(3) Land owned or held in perpetuity; expenditures on uncompleted units of property and equipment during construction
or manufacture; and items classified as current assets are not subject to depreciation. 


(e) Other assets.

 (1) Each Association shall include in this classification all debit balances in general clearing accounts, including
charges held in suspense pending receipt of information necessary for final disposition, prepayments chargeable
against operations over a period of years, capitalized expenditures of an organizational or developmental character,
property acquisition adjustments, and the cost of patents, copyrights, and miscellaneous intangibles. 
(2) Deferred charges having a definite time incidence shall be amortized over the periods to which they apply. 


(f) Current liabilities.

 (1) Each Association shall include in this classification all debts or obligations for which liquidation or payment
is reasonably expected to require the use, within one year, of existing resources of a type which are properly classifiable
as current assets, or the creation of other current liabilities. Current liabilities shall include payables incurred
in the acquisition of materials, collections received in advance of performance of services, debts accruing from
expenses incurred from operations, and other liabilities that are regularly and ordinarily subject to current liquidation.

(2) Lease costs shall be recorded in accordance with the guidelines of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
publication number 13, and subsequent pronouncements on this subject by the FASB. Lease costs payable on demand within
one year, including the portion of long-term debt due within one year of the balance sheet date, shall be recorded in
balance sheet account 20100.


(g) Noncurrent liabilities.

 (1) Each Association shall include in this classification all debts or obligations for which liquidation or payment
is not reasonably expected to require the use, within one year, of existing resources of a type which are properly classifiable
as current assets, or the creation of current liabilities. Noncurrent liabilities include mortgages, bonds and

404.5 Guidelines for the recognition of expenses. 
404.10 Ratemaking procedures and guidelines.


Appendix A to Part 404_Ratemaking Methology

Authority:

 46 U.S.C. 2103, 9303, 9304; 49 CFR 1.46.


 404.1 

General ratemaking provisions.


(a) The purpose of this part is to provide guidelines and procedures for Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking. Included
in this part are explanations of the steps followed in developing a pilotage rate adjustment, the analysis used, and
the guidelines followed in arriving at the pilotage rates contained in part 401 of this chapter. 
(b) The Director determines the timing for reviews of Great Lakes pilotage rates. These reviews are conducted at his
or her discretion and are intended to determine whether existing Great Lakes pilotage rates are fair and reasonable,
or should be adjusted. An interested party or parties may also petition the Director for a review at any time. The petition
must present a reasonable basis for concluding that a review may be warranted. If the Director determines, from the
information contained in the petition, that the existing rates may no longer be reasonable, a full review of the pilotage
rates will be conducted. If the full review shows that pilotage rates are within a reasonable range of their target,
no adjustment to the rates will be initiated.


 404.5 

Guidelines for the recognition of expenses.


(a) The following is a listing of the principal guidelines followed by the Director when determining whether expenses
will be recognized in the ratemaking process: 
(1) Each expense item included in the rate base is evaluated to determine if it is necessary for the provision of pilotage
service, and if so, what dollar amount is reasonable for that expense item. Each Association is responsible for providing
the Director with sufficient information to show the reasonableness of all expense items. The Director will give
the Association the opportunity to defend any expenses which are questioned. However, subject to the terms and conditions
contained in other provisions of this part, expense items which the Director determines are not reasonable and necessary
for the provision of pilotage services will not be recognized for ratemaking purposes. 
(2) In determining reasonableness, each expense item is measured against one or more of the following: 
(i) Comparable or similar expenses paid by others in the maritime industry, 
(ii) Comparable or similar expenses paid by other industries, or 
(iii) U.S. Internal Revenue Service guidelines. 
(3) Lease costs for both operating and capital leases are recognized for ratemaking purposes to the extent that they
conform to market rates. In the absence of a comparable market, lease costs are recognized for ratemaking purposes
to the extent that they conform to depreciation plus an allowance for return on investment (computed as if the asset
had been purchased with equity capital). Lease costs which exceed these standards are not recognized for ratemaking
purposes. 
(4) For each Association, a market-equivalent return-on-investment is allowed for the net capital invested in the
Association by its members. Assets subject to return on investment provisions are subject to reasonableness provisions.
If an asset or other investment is not necessary for the provision of pilotage services, the return element is not allowed
for ratemaking purposes. 
(5) For ratemaking purposes, the revenues and expenses generated from Association transactions which are not directly
related to the provision of pilotage services are included in ratemaking calculations as long as the revenues exceed
the expenses from these transactions. For non-pilotage transactions which result in a net financial loss for the
Association, the amount of the loss is not recognized for ratemaking purposes. The Director reviews non-pilotage
activities to determine if any adversely impact the provision of pilotage service, and may make ratemaking adjustments
or take other steps to ensure the provision of pilotage service. 
(6) Medical, pension, and other benefits paid to pilots, or for the benefit of pilots, by the Association are treated
as pilot compensation. The amount recognized for each of these benefits is the cost of these benefits in the most recent
union contract for first mates on Great Lakes vessels. Any expenses in excess of this amount are not recognized for
ratemaking purposes. 
(7) Expense items which are not reported to the Director by the Association are not considered by the Director in ratemaking
calculations. 
(8) Expenses are appropriate and allowable if they are reasonable, and directly related to pilotage. Each Association
must substantiate its expenses, including legal expenses. In general, the following are not recognized as reasonable
expenses for ratemaking purposes: 
(i) Undocumented fees; 
(ii) Fees for lobbying; 
(iii) Fees for non-pilotage personal matters; 
(iv) Fees which are not commensurate with the work performed; and 
(v) Any other fees not directly related to pilotage. 
(9) In any Great Lakes pilotage district where revenues and expenses from Canadian pilots are commingled with revenues
and expenses from U.S. pilots, Canadian revenues and expenses are not included in the U.S. calculations for setting
pilotage rates. 
(10) Profit sharing expenses are not recognized for ratemaking purposes. 


 404.10 

Ratemaking procedures and guidelines. 


(a) Appendix A to this part is a description of the types of analyses performed and the methodology followed in the development
of Great Lakes pilotage rate adjustments. Ratemaking calculations in Appendix A of this part are made using the definitions
and formulas contained in Appendix B of this part. Pilotage rates actually implemented may vary from the results of
the calculations in Appendices A and B, because of agreements with Canada requiring identical rates, or because of
other circumstances to be determined by the Director. Additional analysis may also be performed as circumstances
require. The guidelines contained in  404.05 are applied in the steps identified in Appendix A to this part.

(b) A separate ratemaking calculation is made for each of the following U.S. pilotage areas:



Area 1_the St. Lawrence River; 
Area 2_Lake Ontario; 
Area 4_Lake Erie; 
Area 5_the navigable waters from South East Shoal to 
Port Huron, MI; 
Area 6_Lakes Huron and Michigan; 
Area 7_the St. Mary's River; and 
Area 8_Lake Superior. 


Appendix A to Part 404_Ratemaking Methodology 


Step 1: Projection of Operating Expenses


(1) The first Step in the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking methodology is to project the amount of fair and reasonable
operating expenses that basic pilotage rates should recover, as determined by the Director. This step consists of
the following phases: (a) Submission of financial information from each Association; (b) determination of recognizable
expenses; (c) adjustment for ancillary revenues; (d) adjustment for inflation or deflation; and (e) final projection
of operating expenses. Each of these phases is detailed below. 


Step 1.A._Submission of Financial Information


(1) Each Association is responsible for providing detailed financial information to the Director, in accordance
with Part 403 of this chapter. 


Step 1.B._Determination of Recognizable Expenses


(1) The Director determines which Association expenses will be recognized for ratemaking purposes, using the guidelines
for the recognition of expenses contained in  404.05 of this chapter. Each Association is responsible for providing
sufficient data for the Director to make this determination.


Step 1.C._Adjustment for Ancillary Revenues


(1) Several charges have traditionally been levied for pilotage services which are additional to basic pilotage
service. These charges are termed ``ancillary charges,'' and are defined as charges for docking, undocking, moveage,
delay, cancellation, and lock transit. Revenues received from these ancillary charges will be offset against the
operational expenses of the Associations. Rates for ancillary services will be set separately from basic pilotage
rates. The method for setting ancillary rates is discussed in Step 7.D., below.


Step 1.D._Adjustment for Inflation or Deflation


(1) In making projections of future expenses, expenses that are subject to inflationary or deflationary pressures
are adjusted. Costs not subject to inflation or deflation (e.g., depreciation, long-term leases, pilot compensation,
etc.) are not adjusted. The inclusion of an inflation or deflation adjustment does not imply that pilotage rates will
be automatically adjusted each shipping season, without a pilotage rate review. The inflation or deflation adjustment
is only made during the expense projection phase of a full-scale pilotage rate review. 
Annual cost inflation or deflation rates will be projected to the succeeding navigation season, reflecting the gradual
increase or decrease in cost throughout the year. 
For ratemaking calculations begun after January 1, 1996, the actual annual experienced change in the average cost
in non-pilot operational costs per pilot assignment for each pilotage area will be used to project the inflation or
deflation adjustment. For ratemaking calculations begun prior to January 1, 1996, the inflation or deflation adjustment
will be based on the preceding year's change in the North Central Region's Consumer Price Index as calculated by the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.


Step 1.E._Projection of Operating Expenses


(1) Once all adjustments are made to the recognized operating expenses, the Director projects these expenses for
each pilotage district. In doing so, the Director takes into account foreseeable circumstances which could affect
the accuracy of the projection. The Director will determine, as accurately as reasonably practicable, the ``projection
of operating expenses.'' 


Step 2: Projection of Target Pilot Compensation


(1) The second Step in the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking methodology is to project the amount of target pilot compensation
that pilotage rates should provide in each area. This Step consists of the following phases: (a) Determination of
target rate of compensation; (b) determination of number of pilots needed in each pilotage area; and (c) multiplication
of the target compensation by the number of pilots needed to project target pilot compensation needed in each area.
Each of these proposed phases is detailed below.

<DOCNO> FR940412-1-00052 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940412-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Step 2.A._Determination of Target Rate of Compensation 



(1) Target pilot compensation for pilots providing services in undesignated waters is average annual compensation
for first mates on U.S. Great Lakes vessels. The average annual compensation for first mates is determined based on
the most current union contracts, and includes wages and benefits. 

(2) Target pilot compensation for pilots providing services in designated waters approximates the average annual
compensation for masters on U.S. Great Lakes vessels. It is calculated as 150% of the compensation earned by first
mates on U.S. Great Lakes vessels. 



Step 2.B._Determination of Number of Pilots Needed 



(1) The basis for the number of pilots needed in each area of designated waters is established by dividing the projected
bridge hours for that area by 1,000. Bridge hours are the number of hours a pilot is aboard a vessel providing basic pilotage
service. 

(2) The basis for the number of pilots needed in each area of undesignated waters is established by dividing the projected
bridge hours for that area by 1,800. 

(3) In determining the number of pilots needed in each pilotage area, the Director is guided by the results of the calculations
in steps 2.A. and 2.B. However, the Director may also find it necessary to make adjustments to these numbers in order
to ensure uninterrupted pilotage service in each area, or for other reasonable circumstances which the Director
determines are appropriate. 



Step 2.C._Projection of Target Pilot Compensation 



(1) The ``projection of target pilot compensation'' is determined separately for each pilotage area by multiplying
the number of pilots needed in that area by the target pilot compensation for pilots working in that area. 



Step 3: Projection of Revenue 



(1) The third step in the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking methodology is to project the revenue that would be received
in each pilotage area if existing rates were left unchanged. This step consists of two phases: (a) Projection of future
vessel traffic and pilotage revenue; and (b) adjustment for ancillary revenues. 



Step 3.A._Projection of Revenue 



(1) The Director generates the most accurate projections reasonably possible of the pilotage service that will be
required by vessel traffic in each pilotage area. These projections are based on historical data and all other relevant
data available. Projected demand for pilotage service is multiplied by the existing pilotage rates for that service,
to arrive at the projection of all pilotage revenue. 



Step 3.B._Adjustment for Ancillary Revenues 



(1) The projection of pilotage revenue from Step 3.A., above, is adjusted for ancillary revenues (i.e., revenue from
docking, undocking, moveage, delay, cancellation, and lock transit). Ancillary revenues are subtracted from the
projection of all pilotage revenue because the rates for ancillary services are set separately from the basic pilotage
rates. The method for setting ancillary charges is discussed in Step 7.D., below. 

(2) After adjustment for ancillary revenues, the result is the projection for revenues which would be generated by
basic pilotage services if existing rates are left unchanged. The results of these calculations is defined as the
``projection of revenue.'' 



Step 4: Calculation of Investment Base 



(1) The fourth step in the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking methodology is the calculation of the investment base of
each Association. The investment base is the recognized capital investment in the assets employed by each Association
required to support pilotage operations. In general, it is the sum of available cash and the net value of real assets,
less the value of land. The investment base will be established through the use of the balance sheet accounts, as amended
by material supplied in the Notes to the Financial Statement. The formula used in calculating the investment base
is detailed in Appendix B to this part. 



Step 5: Determination of Target Rate of Return on Investment 



(1) The fifth step in the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking methodology is to determine the Target Rate of Return on Investment.
For each Association, a market-equivalent return-on-investment (ROI) is allowed for the recognized net capital
invested in the Association by its members. 

(2) The allowed ROI is based on the rate of the most recent return on stockholder's equity for a representative cross
section of transportation industry companies, including maritime companies, with a minimum rate equal to the interest
rate incurred by the Associations for debt capital, and a maximum rate of 20 percent. 

(3) Assets subject to return on investment provisions must be reasonable in both purpose and amount. If an asset or
other investment is not necessary for the provision of pilotage services, that portion of the return element is not
allowed for ratemaking purposes. 



Step 6: Adjustment Determination 



(1) The next step in the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking methodology is to insert the results from steps 1, 2, 3, and
4 into a formula which is based on a standard utility rate structure, and comparing the results to step 5. This basic
utility rate structure takes into account revenues, expenses and return on investment, and is of the following form:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940412-1-00053 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940412-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 




(2) The Director will compare the projected return on investment (as calculated using the formula above) to the target
return on investment (from step 5), to determine whether an adjustment to the basic pilotage rates is necessary. If
the projected return on investment is significantly different from the target return on investment, the revenues
which would be generated by the current pilotage rates are not equal to the revenues which would need to be recovered
by the pilotage rates. 

(3) The basic pilotage revenues that are needed are calculated by substituting in a figure for the projected revenue
which will make the target return on investment equal to the projected return on investment. This ``projection of
revenue needed'' is used in determining the basis for proposed adjustments to the basic pilotage rates. The mechanism
for adjusting the basic pilotage rates is discussed in Step 7 below. The required return, tax, and interest elements
may be considered additions to the operating expenses and pilot compensation components of the hourly charge for
basic pilotage service, which is discussed in Step 7.A. below. 



Step 7: Adjustment of Pilotage Rates 



(1) The final step in the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking methodology is to adjust Great Lakes pilotage rates if the
calculations from Step 6 show that pilotage rates in a pilotage area should be adjusted, and if the Director determines
that it is appropriate to go forward with a rate adjustment. Rate adjustments are calculated in accordance with the
procedures found in this step. However, pilotage rates calculated in this step are subject to adjustment based on
requirements of the Memorandum of Arrangements between the United States and Canada, and other supportable circumstances
which may be appropriate. Pilotage rate adjustments consist of the following: (a) Calculation of the hourly pilotage
charge; (b) calculation of pilotage charges for unspecified trips; (c) calculation of pilotage charges for specified
trips; (d) calculation of pilotage charges for ancillary services; and (e) adjustment of pilotage charges for vessel
size. Each of these is detailed below. 



Step 7.A._Calculation of Hourly Charge 



(1) The Director determines a proposed hourly charge for basic pilotage service in each pilotage area. This hourly
charge is used in the calculation of pilotage rates discussed in Steps 7.B., 7.C., and 7.D., below. 

(2) The proposed total hourly charge for pilotage service in each pilotage area consists of two components, i.e.,
pilot compensation, and operating expenses. 

(3) The pilot compensation component of the hourly charge is derived by dividing the projected target pilot compensation
for each area, by the estimated pilotage hours (i.e., bridge hours) for that area. This calculation results in a pilot
compensation charge for each hour of pilotage service in that pilotage area. 

(4) The operating expense component of the hourly charge is derived by dividing the projected operating expenses
for each pilotage district, including the constructed amount necessary to bring the Associations to the ROI standard,
by the estimated pilotage hours (bridge hours). This calculation results in an operating expense charge for each
hour of pilotage service in that pilotage district. 

(5) The total hourly charge for basic pilotage service in each pilotage area is derived by adding the pilot compensation
charge for that area to the operating expense charge for the district in which that area is located. These calculations
are adjusted for average ship size as discussed in Step 7.E., below.

<TEXT>
 

Step 7.B._Calculation of Charges for Unspecified Trips 



(1) For transits which are not specified in  401.405 and  401.410 of this chapter, the Director bases basic
pilotage rates on the hourly charge developed in Step 7.A., above. This hourly charge for basic pilotage service is
assessed for each hour that a registered pilot is aboard a vessel, subject to a six-hour minimum each time a pilot is
assigned, with three-hour increments thereafter. 



Step 7.C._Calculation of Charges for Specified Trips 



(1) For transits which are specified in  401.405 and  401.410 of this chapter, the Director periodically
reviews the average time for each individual transit, using the travel time in both directions. This review will be
accomplished at least once every five years. The proposed basic pilotage fee listed for specified transits in  401.405
and  401.410 of this chapter is based on the result of multiplying the hourly basic pilotage fee by the average
transit time calculated for that transit. 

(2) During ratemaking proceedings which occur between periodic reviews of average vessel transit times, the rates
for specified transits are adjusted as a group. The pilotage rate for specified transits in each area is adjusted by
subtracting the ``projection of revenue'' from the ``projection of revenue needed'' and dividing by the ``projection
of revenue,'' with the resultant deficit or surplus expressed in percentage terms, rounded to the nearest whole number.
The proposed basic pilotage rates for specified transits are determined by multiplying the existing rates by the
resultant percentage. 



Step 7.D._Calculation of Charges for Ancillary Services 



(1) Ancillary charges are equalized between districts. These charges need not be adjusted during every ratemaking.
These charges are reviewed at intervals of not more than five years, during the periodic review of average vessel transit
time for specified trips discussed in Step 7.C., above. Each of these charges is discussed below. 

(A) 

Docking, Undocking and Harbor Movement Charges_

For consistency, these charges are set at the same level in all districts. The charges are determined by the Director,
subject to the requirements of the Memorandum of Arrangements between the United States and Canada. 

(B) 

Moveage_

The charge for moveage in a harbor for all three districts is twice the docking charge. 

(C) 

Delay Charges_

Delay charges, per hour, whether for trip interruption or departure or moveage delays, are set at the rate determined
in the pilot compensation phase discussed in Step 2 above, as adjusted for ship size. The maximum delay charge for any
24-hour period is the per hour delay charge, as adjusted for ship size, times 16 hours. 

(D) 

Cancellation Charges_

Cancellation charges are set at the rate determined in the pilot compensation phase discussed in Step 2 above, and
are not adjusted for ship size. If the cancellation occurs less than six hours after the pilot reports, the maximum
charge is the basic pilot compensation charge for a six-hour period. If the cancellation occurs more than six hours
after the pilot reports, the charge is the basic pilot compensation charge for each hour or fraction of an hour, to a
maximum of 16 hours. 

(E) 

Lock Passage Charges_

For consistency, these charges are set at the same level in all districts. The level will be determined by the Director,
subject to the requirements of the Memorandum of Arrangements between the United States and Canada. 



Step 7.E._Adjustment for Ship Size 



(1) The hourly charge for basic pilotage services discussed in Step 7.A., above, is adjusted by dividing the basic
charge by the average weighting factor of the preceding year, as determined from charges adjusted in accordance with
 401.400 of this chapter. 



Appendix B to Part 404_Ratemaking Definitions and Formulas 



The following definitions apply to the ratemaking formula contained in this appendix. The account numbers correspond
to the account numbers in Appendix A to part 403 of this chapter. 

(1) Operating Revenue_means the sum of all operating revenues received by the Association for pilotage services,
less ancillary revenues that are offset against operating expenses.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940412-1-00055 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940412-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) Operating Expense_means the sum of all operating expenses incurred by the Association for pilotage services,
less the sum of disallowed expenses. 
(3) Target Pilot Compensation_means the compensation that pilots are intended to receive for full time employment.
For pilots providing services in undesignated waters, the target pilot compensation is the average annual compensation
for first mates on U.S. Great Lakes vessels. For pilots providing services in designated waters, the target pilot
compensation is 150% of the average annual compensation for first mates on U.S. Great Lakes vessels. 
(4) Operating Profit/(Loss)_means Operating Revenue less Operating Expense and Target Pilot Compensation. 
(5) Interest Expense_means the reported Association interest expense on operations, as adjusted to exclude any
interest expense attributable to losses from non-pilotage operations. 
(6) Earnings Before Tax_means Operating Profit/(Loss), less the Interest Expense. 
(7) Federal Tax Allowance_means the Federal statutory tax on Earnings Before Tax, for those Associations subject
to Federal tax. 
(8) Net Income_means the Earnings Before Tax, less the Federal Tax Allowance. 
(9) Return Element (Net Income plus Interest)_means the Net Income, plus Interest Expense. The return element can
be considered the sum of the return to equity capital (the Net Income), and the return to debt (the Interest Expense).

(10) Investment Base (separately determined)_means the net recognized capital invested in the Association, including
both equity and debt. Should capital be invested in other than pilotage operations, that capital is excluded from
the rate base. 
(11) Return on Investment_means the Return element, divided by the Investment Base, and expressed as a percent. 


Investment base formula. 
(1) Regulatory Investment (Investment Base) is the recognized capital investment in the useful assets employed
by the pilot groups. In general, it is the sum of available cash and the net value of real assets, less the value of land.
The investment base is established through the use of the balance sheet accounts, as amended by material supplied
in the Notes to the Financial Statement. 
(2) The Investment Base is calculated using data from the Uniform System of Accounts described in part 403, as audited
and approved by the Director. Accounts, listed in the Investment Base formula below, which end in 999 are not separate
accounts, but the summation of the accounts listed in each particular grouping. For instance, account no. 10999 is
not a separate balance sheet account, it is the summation of all individual balance sheet accounts in the 10000 grouping.
The Investment Base would be calculated as follows: 







(3) Using the figures developed above, the Investment Base is the Recognized Assets times the ratio of Recognized
Sources of Funds to Total Sources of Funds.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Denial of petitions for reconsideration and rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice denies a petition for reconsideration of the trailer conspicuity requirements of Motor Vehicle Safety
Standard No. 108, and a petition for rulemaking to amend these requirements.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On December 10, 1992, NHTSA published a final rule amending Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108 to establish
a visibility enhancement scheme for large trailers (57 FR 58406). On October 6, 1993, the agency published a response
to petitions for reconsideration of 
that scheme (58 FR 52021). 




A. Petitions Relating to Mounting Height of Side Conspicuity Treatment 


In the time between the two 

Federal Register

 notices, the Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association (TTMA) wrote NHTSA on August 25, 1993, asking that the mounting
height specification for side conspicuity treatment be changed to allow a range of heights from 0.4m to 2.1m. It observed
that the agency had proposed a lower mounting height of 0.4m though it had adopted a height of 1.25m. TTMA observed that
Standard No. 108 permits reflex reflectors to be mounted within 0.4m of the ground, which is 34 inches below 1.25m,
and ``it seems reasonable that the upper location be 34 inches above'' 1.25m, i.e., 2.1m. It also observed that the
only vertical surface of some trailers may be at a height even greater than 2.1m. This observation was reiterated in
a petition for reconsideration of the 1.525m maximum adopted on October 6, 1993, and submitted by Terminal Service
Company (``Terminal''). It asked for a mounting height maximum of 2.28m for cargo tanks, expressing its concern ``that
enforcement personnel will not consider a 508mm (20 inches) to 762mm (30 inches) height above the 1525mm (60 inches)
requirement practicable.'' 

At the time that NHTSA received TTMA's letter, it was evaluating petitions for reconsideration of the final rule mounting
height of ``as close to 1.25m as practicable''. Ultimately, it granted those petitions and, on October 6, 1993, adopted
a revised mounting height of ``as close as practicable to not less than 375mm and not more than 1525mm'' above the road
surface. This amendment effectively granted TTMA's petition to allow a lower mounting height than the one originally
adopted. It also responded in part to TTMA's request for a higher mounting height, by allowing a maximum height of ``as
close as practicable to * * * not more than'' 1.525m, although not as high as the 2.1m requested. However,
TTMA presented no rationale other than symmetry to justify an increase in mounting height from 1.52m to 2.1m. The agency
finds this an inadequate basis upon which to grant TTMA's petition for rulemaking. 

Terminal's rationale is based upon a fear that the mounting height chosen by a manufacturer for application of conspicuity
treatment on cargo tanks will be so much higher than 1525mm that the agency will not deem it ``practicable'' and that
Federal Highway Administration inspectors will not understand the practicability exception to the height requirement.
NHTSA understands this view and wishes to assure Terminal that it regards this concern as unfounded. As the agency
has advised many times in the past in its interpretations of the practicability requirements of Standard No. 108,
the determination of what is ``practicable'' is initially to be made by the manufacturer, whose certification of
compliance covers its determinations of practicability. NHTSA will not question a manufacturer's determination
unless it appears clearly erroneous. In this instance, NHTSA interprets the conspicuity mounting height specification
as allowing mounting heights higher than 1525mm if the trailer manufacturer does not find it practicable to place
the conspicuity treatment at or below 1525mm. 

Terminal's trailer case provides a good example. Since the conspicuity material cannot provide the required brightness
when the trailer is at an angle to traffic unless it is mounted in a nearly vertical plane, practicability dictates
that the material be moved to the height where the trailer provides a suitable, vertical mounting surface. 

Because the agency has determined that no regulatory action is required to give the relief which the petitioner seeks,
the petition by Terminal Service Company for reconsideration of the maximum mounting height requirement is denied.

B. Petition Relating to Adoption of Geometric Visibility Specification 




Paragraph S5.7.1.4.2(a) of Standard No. 108 specifies that, at the location chosen for conspicuity treatment, ``the
strip shall not be obscured in whole or in part by other motor vehicle equipment or trailer cargo.'' TTMA asked that
the words ``trailer cargo'' be deleted and that obscuration of the strip be determined ``when viewed within  
+/^30 degrees horizontally or perpendicular to the sheeting 15m (50 feet) away and at a height of 1.25m.'' In justification
of its petition, it argued that trailer manufacturers should not be responsible for the possible obscuring of sheeting
by cargo, and that ``[t]here is not a similar prohibition of obscuring lamps by cargo in FMVSS 108.'' TTMA supplemented
its August 1993 letter on September 24 with the example of a container chassis whose gooseneck connector to a tractor
trailer is obscured when an intermodal container is secured to it. 

Although paragraph S5.3.1.1 of Standard No. 108 requires that lamps and reflectors be mounted on a vehicle so that
they are visible at the test points specified in the SAE Standards and Recommended Practices, this section does not
apply to conspicuity sheeting because no SAE standards regarding conspicuity sheeting materials are incorporated
in Standard No. 108. Furthermore, it would be undesirable to impose geometric visibility requirements on conspicuity
sheeting or reflectors because the practicability constraints on long strips of conspicuity material and reflectors
used in lieu thereof are different than those on lamps and reflectors. While it is possible to move lamps and reflectors
to locations that achieve geometric visibility, the locations available for conspicuity materials on some trailers,
such as the container chassis, may be too limited to permit optimization. 

With respect to obscuration of conspicuity materials, NHTSA considers that strips or reflectors are obscured by
cargo or equipment only if they are not visible when viewed perpendicular to the conspicuity material.

The potential for obscuration by cargo should not be difficult to foresee. NHTSA considers that trailer manufacturers
are in a reasonable position to anticipate where cargo will be placed in or on their trailers because they have designed
the trailers to accommodate specific cargo types and loading techniques. For example, with respect to the container
chassis cited in TTMA's supplementary letter of September 24, the manufacturer of a container chassis knows that
the gooseneck connector will be obscured when the load is in place, and may apply conspicuity treatment that allows
for the load. Assuming an overall chassis length of 53 feet, the manufacturer is required to mark at least half of that
(26.5 feet) with conspicuity marking. Assuming a gooseneck length of 9 feet, Standard No. 108 thus requires that the
minimum of 26.5 feet of conspicuity material be applied in the 44 feet of trailer length that is behind the gooseneck.
The manufacturer is not prohibited from affixing the material to the gooseneck as well if it chooses, but in such a location
this material is considered surplus and, because it will be obscured when the load is in place, cannot be included in
the manufacturer's 50 percent determination. 



C. Denial of TTMA Petition 



The agency has completed its technical review of the TTMA petition for rulemaking under 49 CFR part 552, and has determined
that there is not a reasonable possibility that the amendments requested in the petition will be issued at the conclusion
of a rulemaking proceeding. Therefore, the petition by TTMA is denied in its entirety.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Denial of petition for rulemaking. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice denies a petition for rulemaking by Metalcore, Ltd., to amend the trailer conspicuity requirements of
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108 as they apply to the rear of van trailers. The reason for the denial is
the importance of maintaining a common image of rear conspicuity while ensuring the availability of appropriate
cues to drivers following large trailers.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Metalcore Ltd. is a Canadian company that manufactures aftermarket door seals for van trailers. It sells a model which
includes 1/2-inch wide conspicuity tape on the rigid channel which supports the seal. The installed seals create
a conspicuity tape pattern equivalent to outlining each rear van door with 1/2-inch wide conspicuity tape. In response
to the final rule of December 10, 1992, adopting trailer conspicuity requirements (57 FR 58406), Metalcore submitted
a ``petition for reconsideration'' on November 5, 1993, in which it asked for the adoption of an alternative rear conspicuity
treatment in which outlining the doors of a van in 1/2-inch wide white material would replace the 2-inch wide red/white
stripe across the rear of the body and the 2-inch wide white upper corner markings. However, because the petition was
not filed within 30 days of the final rule, it has been considered as a petition for rulemaking in accordance with NHTSA
regulations (49 CFR 553.35). 



Metalcore serves the trailer repair industry, and its products are used mainly on older trailers which are not subject
to Federal requirements for conspicuity systems, and, to a lesser extent, on trailers which were equipped upon manufacture
with conspicuity tape. Metalcore anticipates that fleets wishing to add conspicuity material voluntarily to older
trailers will prefer to do so in a way that they can claim meets the standards for new vehicles. The requested amendment
would allow Metalcore to make the sales claim that the use of its door seals would permit trailer owners to retrofit
a conforming conspicuity system using about 12 feet less tape than the minimum 63 feet necessary for compliance on
a typical 45-foot van trailer. The conspicuity rule does not prohibit the use of Metalcore's product as an auxiliary
reflector on any trailer, and the ultimate value to customers of the Metalcore door seal resides in its qualities as
a door seal rather than in the reflective tape attached to it. 

NHTSA considered that two issues to be important in the consideration of this petition for an alternative conspicuity
system. The first issue was whether it is desirable to have any alternatives to the required conspicuity configuration,
and the second issue was the merit of the proposed alternative. 



Desirability of Alternative Conspicuity Systems 



The notice proposing the conspicuity rule (56 FR 63474) presented alternative treatments but made clear the agency's
desire to achieve a common conspicuity configuration. NHTSA said: ``While the agency is proposing two specific configurations
of conspicuity treatment, it * * * anticipates that the final rule would specify only one pattern,
and not allow alternative treatments.'' The NPRM specifically asked for comments ``on the desirability of standardizing
to the maximum extent possible the treatment for all trailers,'' and it introduced for comment the possibility of
exempting certain types of trailers if a standard treatment proved impractical for them. 

Most comments to the docket urged a conspicuity system with sufficient flexibility for universal application without
the need for exceptions. The University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) study (see 57 FR 58409
et seq.), completed during the comment period, concluded that a conspicuity system using the most universally applicable
elements of alternative 2 of the proposed rule would meet the minimum needs for safety in terms of an unambiguous reflective
image with adequate sight distance and closing speed cues. In the final rule preamble, NHTSA noted that one of the attributes
of alternative 2 was that it ``promoted uniformity of appearance,'' and the agency adopted the modifications recommended
by UMTRI to establish a universal treatment without the need for exceptions for difficult to treat trailers.

Van trailers have more surface available for conspicuity treatment than other trailers, but NHTSA did not adopt requirements
that appeared unsuitable for other types of trailers. Part of the value of the uniform conspicuity treatment is that
it is expected to maximize the conspicuity of the least conspicuous trailers, such as platform trailers, by giving
them a familiar night image. While the agency does not discourage the use of auxiliary material on trailers with large
amounts of surface area, it believes that maximizing the number of common elements between trailer treatments aids
in their recognition. NHTSA, therefore, is disinclined to allow alternative conspicuity treatments in general
because the final rule was designed to make them unnecessary. Standard No. 108 specifies a minimum amount of reflective
material to achieve the safety purpose, and at minimum cost. 



Attributes of the Metalcore Alternative 



Metalcore has suggested the alternative of substituting 1/2-inch wide white reflective tape stripes outlining
the doors of a van trailer for the required 2-inch wide white upper corner stripes and 2-inch wide red/white stripe
across the full width of the trailer near the bottom of the doors. It claims that the alternative projects approximately
the same reflective area as the requirement of Standard No. 108 and that the total light return of the alternative is
greater because only white material would be used. It further claims that its alternative of outlining in white has
been shown to be superior to the requirements of Standard No. 108 by Carlton University's report (Tansley and Petrusic)
to Transport Canada. 

Tansley and Petrusic discounted the value of the U.S. red/white pattern in connoting a hazard and suggested that detection
distance should be the principal measure of safety in evaluating conspicuity schemes. According to the petitioner,
Tansley and Petrusic predicted a detection distance of 819 m for the white outline treatment recommended by Carlton
University as compared with a predicted detection distance of 450 m for Standard No. 108. 

In the notice responding to petitions for reconsideration on October 6, 1993 (58 FR 52021, at 52023), the agency discussed
its disagreement with the decision sight distance criterion recommended by Carlton University and the reasons for
NHTSA's use of the stopping sight distance criterion recommended by UMTRI. The agency believes that Standard No.
108 is more cost effective than the Carlton University recommendations while providing a detection distance adequate
for safety and superior recognition and hazard awareness cues. Standard No. 108 also addresses the practicability
problems of trailers other than vans that were not considered in the Carlton University recommendations. NHTSA also
notes that in a demonstration test reported by Transport Canada in its Technical Memorandum TME 9301, the detection
distances found for the Carlton and U.S. rear van treatments were 993 m and 902 m, respectively, with even less difference
in recognition distance. 

It is true that compliance with Standard No. 108 and the Metalcore alternative can be achieved with equivalent amounts
of reflective material and that an all white treatment returns more light than a red/white treatment of equal area
(although the petitioner has underestimated the relative brightness of the red material). However, the petitioner's
claims of greater sight distance based on Tansley and Petrusic are in error. 

The white outlining scheme of Tansley and Petrusic uses 2-inch wide reflective material as does Standard No. 108.
The stripes are perceived at a distance as a line of point sources of light, and the sight distance of a point source depends
on its total light return rather than its luminance per unit area. The sight distance of a 1/2-inch wide stripe will
be less than that of a 2-inch stripe of the same material because it will be perceived as a line of point sources each having
only one fourth the light return. Therefore, the sight distance of the Metalcore alternative will be inferior to the
Tansley and Petrusic scheme cited by the petitioner and to at least the white components of Standard No. 108. 

The UMTRI report discusses the data of previous researchers concerning the width of conspicuity stripes, and remarked
that ``the luminance of a one-inch treatment must be about double that of a two-inch treatment to achieve equal conspicuity.''
The point source model for visibility distance discussed in the previous paragraph is consistent with data for conspicuity
stripes narrower than 4 inches. 



Decision 



The agency has conducted a technical review of the petition and determined that there is not a reasonable possibility
that the amendment requested in the petition will be issued at the end of a rulemaking proceeding. Therefore, the petition
is denied.

Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Stability and Control of Medium and Heavy Vehicles During Braking 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM). 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice proposes to modify the implementation schedule for and certain requirements in the agency's September
1993 notice proposing to improve the stability and control of medium and heavy vehicles during braking. In response
to the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991, the agency proposed in the September notice
that medium and heavy vehicles be equipped with an antilock brake system (ABS) and be able to comply with a 30 mph braking-in-a-curve
test on a low coefficient of friction surface using a full brake application. 



In this supplemental notice, NHTSA is proposing to amend the implementation schedule for the rule and to require independent
wheel control on at least one axle. The agency's decision to issue this notice was prompted by comments on the NPRM favoring
such changes.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On September 28, 1993, NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in which the agency proposed amending
Standard No. 105, 

Hydraulic Brake Systems

 and Standard No. 121, 

Air Brake Systems, 

to require medium and heavy vehicles

1

 to be equipped with an antilock brake system (ABS) to improve the lateral stability and control of these vehicles during
braking. (58 FR 50739). The NPRM proposed supplementing the ABS requirement by including a 30 mph braking-in-a-curve
test on a low coefficient of friction surface using a full brake application. The agency believed that the proposed
requirements would improve heavy vehicle stability and control during braking and thus significantly reduce the
deaths and injuries caused when these vehicles jackknife or otherwise lose control. The notice also proposed requiring
an in-cab ABS malfunction lamp and, during a transition period of eight years, an external trailer lamp to warn drivers
of non-ABS tractors of trailer ABS malfunction. The agency believed that the proposed malfunction indicators would
provide valuable information about ABS malfunctioning to the driver and to maintenance and inspection personnel.
The proposal was based on comments received in response to an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) published
on June 8, 1992 and other available information (57 FR 24212).





NHTSA received over 50 comments in response to the NPRM. These commenters included heavy vehicle manufacturers,
brake manufacturers, safety advocacy groups, heavy vehicle users, trade associations, State entities, and other
individuals. The majority of commenters agreed that the agency should take measures to improve the stability and
control of heavy vehicles during braking to reduce the number of loss-of-control crashes. Commenters addressed
specific issues raised in the NPRM, including the decision proposing to require vehicles to be equipped with ABS,
the type of ABS, the braking-in-a-curve test procedure, the implementation schedule for the requirements, the malfunction
indicator requirement, the power requirement, and the rulemaking's cost.

This SNPRM focuses on two issues raised in the NPRM and addressed by the commenters: (1) The implementation schedule
and (2) the wheels to be controlled by an antilock brake system. 



Implementation Schedule 



In the NPRM, NHTSA stated that its goal is to achieve significant improvements in braking performance at a reasonable
cost to manufacturers and consumers. Based on the available information, NHTSA decided to propose the following
implementation schedule:




Truck Tractors
2 years after final rule (1996) 
Trailers, including converter dollies
3 years after final rule (1997) 
Single unit trucks
4 years after final rule (1998) 
Buses
5 years after final rule (1999)




NHTSA believed that this implementation schedule is appropriate given the current state of ABS technology. The agency
believed that it would provide the industry, ABS manufacturers, and maintenance personnel sufficient leadtime
to prepare for the changes that will be required to accommodate the new technology. 

With respect to truck tractors, NHTSA stated that it was confident that ABS for this type of vehicle would be fully developed,
performance tested, and field tested within two years after the final rule since ABS manufacturers have focused their
initial efforts on developing ABS for truck tractors. The agency noted that ABS for truck tractors is currently available
on a commercial basis in this country and throughout Europe. Nevertheless, a two year leadtime appeared to be necessary
to ensure a smooth transition before the agency mandated this technology given the technical complexities and costs
associated with ABS. 

With respect to trailers, NHTSA noted that ABS manufacturers are currently marketing ABS for these vehicles. NHTSA
stated that it expected its fleet evaluation on 50 ABS-equipped trailers to be completed in 1993. (This evaluation,
titled ``An In-Service Evaluation of the Performance, Reliability, Maintainability, and Durability of Antilock
Braking Systems (ABSs) for Semitrailers'' has been completed and is available for review in the agency's public docket
room. The agency welcomes comments about the report.) 

With respect to single-unit trucks and buses, NHTSA proposed leadtime of four years and five years, respectively,
after the final rule's publication, resulting in an effective date in 1998 and 1999. NHTSA proposed effective dates
that it believed would give the industry sufficient leadtime to develop, field test, and performance test ABS on straight
trucks and buses. The agency also explained that ABS for such vehicles is still being developed, so these leadtimes
appeared to be necessary to ensure that the technology would be reliable when it is required. 

The American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), which represents the eight major domestic truck manufacturers,

2

 recommended that the effective dates for the proposed heavy vehicle stability and control requirements and the previously
proposed stopping distance requirements be ``synchronized for the various vehicle types.'' (58 FR 11009, February
23, 1993).

3

 







AAMA recommended that the agency adopt the following effective dates for both the stability and control requirements
and the stopping distance requirements, assuming that the two rules are issued before September 1994:





Truck tractors
2 years after final rule (1996) 

Trailers, including converter dollies
3 years after final rule (1997) 

Air-braked single unit trucks and buses
3 years after final rule (1997) 

Hydraulic-braked single unit trucks and buses
4 years after final rule (1998)





Similarly, manufacturers of brake components and antilock brake systems recommended that the implementation schedule
for the lateral stability and control requirements be accelerated. Rockwell requested that the leadtime for air-braked
single unit trucks and buses be shortened to three years after the final rule. The Heavy Duty Brake Manufacturers Council
requested that the effective dates of the stopping distance rulemaking and the stability rulemaking be ``made coincident
to allow the industry to maximize its efforts by effectively utilizing its limited resources.''

<TEXT>
 

The American Trucking Association (ATA) recommended effective dates of December 31, 1999 for tractors and December
31, 2001 for trailers, claiming that this schedule would permit each fleet, through its own tests, to determine which
ABS is best suited to its operations and to phase ABS in accordingly. In contrast, Advocates for Highway Safety (Advocates)
favored the proposed implementation schedule and opposed any schedule that moved the compliance calendar to the
next century. It believed that a delayed schedule would unreasonably postpone safety benefits for the public because
ABS technology is both reliable and available.

After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has tentatively determined that it may be appropriate to make the effective dates
for the heavy vehicle stability and control requirements concurrent with the stopping distance requirements. This
could facilitate a more orderly implementation process, avoid the need for manufacturers to redesign the brakes
on individual vehicles twice, and reduce the development and compliance costs that manufacturers would face as a
result of these regulations. Specifically, the agency is considering to adopt the following implementation schedule
for both sets of requirements:




Truck tractors
2 years after final rule (1996)
Trailers
3 years after final rule (1997)
Air-braked single unit trucks and buses
3 years after final rule (1997)
Hydraulic-braked single unit trucks and buses
4 years after final rule (1998)




This proposed implementation schedule, which would accelerate compliance for air-braked single unit trucks and
buses and hydraulic-braked buses, is consistent with the recommendation of the heavy vehicle manufacturers, brake
manufacturers, and the safety advocacy groups. The agency agrees with the manufacturers that reliable antilock
systems can be developed within this time-frame. NHTSA tentatively concludes that the implementation schedule
recommended by ATA is too protracted, especially in light of the widespread use of ABS in Europe, increased use of ABS
in this country, and the comments by the brake and vehicle manufacturers.

NHTSA requests comments about the implementation schedule being proposed in this supplemental notice. Specifically,
commenters should respond to the following questions:

1. Is it appropriate to make the effective dates concurrent for the stopping distance and stability requirements
for heavy vehicles?

2. Is it appropriate to accelerate the stability and control effective dates for air braked trucks and buses and hydraulic
braked buses, and to delay the effective date for the proposed stopping distance requirements for some classes of
vehicles?

3. Since hydraulic braked trucks and buses would have to be equipped with ABS one year later than air braked trucks and
buses, would truck and bus fleets specify hydraulic brake systems for their new vehicles for that one year to avoid
the additional cost of ABS on air braked trucks and buses?

4. The agency received comments to the stability and control NPRM from only one bus manufacturer. Do bus manufacturers
have any specific concerns about the revised implementation dates proposed in this notice?

5. Do the heavy vehicle ABS suppliers have the manufacturing capacity to meet the demand for air braked antilock systems
in 1996 and 1997?



Antilock Brake System Wheel Control



In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed to require that the antilock brake system monitor and control the wheels of the front axle
and of at least one rear axle. NHTSA believed that this would ensure that the wheels on the steering axle are directly
controlled by the antilock braking device. By ``directly controlled,'' the agency meant that the signal provided
at the wheel or on the axle of the wheel directly modulates the braking forces of that wheel. The agency tentatively
concluded that it is necessary to specify that the ABS directly control the steering axle because some ABS control
only a vehicle's drive-axle, a situation which could result in the loss of steering control if the front wheels locked
during braking.

Several commenters addressed the need for front wheel control. ATA strongly opposed mandating ABS for the steering
axle of single-unit trucks and suggested the agency reconsider mandating them on all tractors. In contrast, Rockwell,
WABCO, Freightliner, AAMA, Advocates, and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) favored requiring
that ABS be equipped on front axles. AAMA favored equipping each vehicle with ABS that has at least one independent
channel of control for the wheels on a front axle and at least one independent channel of control for the wheels on a rear
axle, but objected to mandating more than two independent channels of control. Because Rockwell, Freightliner,
Advocates, and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) were concerned that the current proposal would
allow ``select low''

4

 antilock systems on any axle, they recommended that the equipment requirement include language that would require
``independent control of each wheel'' of the axles that are required to be ABS-controlled. They believed such a requirement
would prevent significant degradation in the stopping performance, particularly on a split mu surface.

5

 Rockwell WABCO recommended a minimum standard of at least one rear axle having independent wheel brake control. It
opposed allowing select low ABS which it believed would experience significantly longer stopping distances on split
mu surfaces. Allied Signal recommended requiring independent control of the brakes on the steering axle. Bosch recommended
a minimum requirement of a 4S/3M ABS. Freightliner favored requiring at least four independent channels of control,
two for each axle, allowing independent control of each wheel on the forward and rear axle. Similarly, IIHS favored
requiring that the brakes/wheels of the front axle be independently controlled by an antilock system and that the
brakes/wheels of at least one rear axle have similar independent antilock control. Advocates recommended that ABS
be functional on all axles, not just one axle in each multiple axle set on a heavy vehicle. Because commenters differed
on which axle the antilock system should provide independent wheel control, NHTSA has decided to propose requiring
that the wheels on at least one axle be independently controlled, without specifying the axle on which it should be
installed. This would allow manufacturers the flexibility to determine on which axle the wheels would be independently
controlled by the antilock system.






After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has decided to propose modifications to the proposal to require heavy vehicles
to be equipped with systems that independently control each wheel on at least one axle of a truck, a truck tractor, or
a bus. Based on the comments and other available information, the agency believes that a minimum requirement that
includes an antilock braking system that controls the wheels on at least one front and one rear axle where the wheels
on at least one of these axles are independently controlled would provide an acceptable level of stopping distance
performance on low mu and split mu surfaces. In addition to the data provided by Freightliner and Rockwell WABCO, the
agency's ABS heavy vehicle testing showed that independent wheel control by an ABS enables a vehicle to stop in a shorter
distance compared with either a vehicle equipped with an axle-by-axle control antilock system, or with a non-ABS
equipped vehicle using a driver best-effort brake application. (``Improved Brake Systems for Commercial Vehicles,''
DOT HS 807 706, Final Report, April 1991)

NHTSA is also proposing to prohibit tandem control by an antilock system, by requiring that no more than two wheels
be controlled by one modulator valve. As part of its performance test program, the agency tested four different ABS
configurations: individual wheel control, side-by-side control, axle-by-axle control, and tandem control. The
agency found that the tandem control system produced stopping distances that were significantly longer than those
of axle-by-axle control or side-by-side control, particularly on split coefficient of friction surfaces. These
test results are documented in the report, ``Improved Brake Systems for Commercial Vehicles.'' The agency is aware
that the proposed requirements would allow a 6 x 4 truck or truck tractor to be equipped with a 4S/3M antilock system,
i.e., independent control of each front wheel, select low control on one rear axle, and no ABS control on the other rear
axle. The agency's testing has found that vehicle stability is not significantly degraded if two wheels on a tandem
are locked during braking. Accordingly, the agency has used this concept in developing the limited lockup requirements
for the stopping distance rulemaking where one wheel per axle or two wheels per tandem are allowed to lock above 20 mph
during the stopping distance test. 
The agency requests comments to the following questions about independent control of each wheel on at least one axle
and about prohibiting tandem control by an antilock system: 
1. Is it appropriate to require independent control of each wheel on at least one axle? 
2. Would it be appropriate to adopt the alternative recommendations presented by Rockwell, Freightliner, or Advocates?
Would these alternative recommendations provide significantly greater benefits? Would they prevent unreasonably
long stopping distances on split mu surfaces? 
3. Compared to the original proposal that would allow select low systems, what would be the additional marginal benefits
and cost of the requirement proposed in this SNPRM? Of the requirements recommended by Rockwell, Freightliner, or
Advocates? 
4. Is it appropriate to prohibit tandem control by an antilock system? 
5. How much stability degradation has testing showed with a vehicle where one axle of a tandem was not controlled by
ABS? Are there other concerns (e.g., tire flat spotting) about an uncontrolled axle on a tandem? 
6. Would fleet operators be willing to spend an additional $300 per vehicle to upgrade a 4S/3M system to a 4S/4M system
with side-by-side control or axle-by-axle control with in-axle sensors? 
Comments on this notice must be received no later than 30 days after its publication in the 

Federal Register

. While NHTSA typically provides a comment period of 60 days, the agency has determined that it is in the public interest
to limit the comment period to 30 days since the agency is statutorily required to finish rulemaking in mid-1994. In
addition, the agency previously provided an opportunity in the September 1993 NPRM to comment on these and other issues
in this rulemaking. This notice proposes relatively limited modifications in the agency's tentative position regarding
two of those issues. 


Rulemaking Analyses 


A. Executive Order 12866 (Federal Regulation) and 
DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 


This notice is ``significant'' within the meaning of Executive Order 12866. Further, NHTSA has analyzed this supplemental
proposal and determined that it is also significant within the meaning of the Department of Transportation regulatory
policies and procedures. The agency believes that the proposal to make the lateral stability and control requirements
concurrent with the stopping distance requirements would reduce the rulemaking's costs, based on comments by the
manufacturers. The agency further believes that the proposal related to wheel control would reduce cost. The agency's
expectations upon issuing the NPRM were that the ABS on trucks, truck tractors, and buses would provide individual
wheel control on at least one axle. As such, the safety benefits and cost analyses documented in the Preliminary Regulatory
Impact Analysis were performed assuming that to be the case. Therefore, the agency believes that no additional impact
would result from the changes proposed in this notice. 


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


NHTSA has also considered the effects of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Based upon
the discussion in the immediately preceding paragraph, I certify that this proposed rule would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


C. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism) 


NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612. NHTSA has determined that the proposed rule would not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 


D. National Environmental Policy Act 


In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, NHTSA has considered the environmental impacts
of this proposed rule. The agency has determined that this proposed rule, if adopted as a final rule, would not have
any adverse impact on the quality of the human environment.

ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Coast Guard proposes to amend its regulations for the carriage of certain bulk solid materials by adding materials
carried under Coast Guard Special Permits issued pursuant to this regulation (Special Permits) and other materials
contained in the International Maritime Organization Code of Safe Practice for Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMO Bulk Solids
Code, or ``BC Code''), including coal, to the list of materials permitted under the regulations. The special handling
procedures associated with these materials would also be included in the regulations. The proposed revisions would
harmonize U.S. regulations with recommended international practice, and eliminate the need to apply for Special
Permits, except for newly classified hazardous materials. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Request for Comments 


The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting written data, views
or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this rulemaking (CDG
87-069) and the specific section of this proposal to which each comment applies, and give the reason for each
comment. The Coast Guard requests that all comments and attachments be submitted in an unbound format suitable for

presentations will aid this rulemaking, the Coast Guard will hold a public hearing at a time and place announced by
a later notice in the 

Federal Register

. 


Drafting Information 


The principal persons involved in drafting this notice are Mr. Frank K. Thompson, Project Manager, Office of Marine
Safety, Security, and Environmental Protection, and Ms. Helen Boutrous, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel.



Regulatory History 


On April 28, 1989, an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) was published in the 

Federal Register

 (54 FR 18308). The Coast Guard received sixteen letters commenting on the ANPRM. These comments will be discussed
later in this rulemaking document. A public hearing was not requested and one was not held. 
Persons interested in the portion of this rulemaking concerning coal were provided the opportunity to attend and
participate in meetings held by the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee, Subcommittee on Coal Transportation.
These meetings were announced in the 

Federal Register

, and were open to the public. Minutes of these meetings, and the final report of the subcommittee are on file in the rulemaking
docket and may be obtained at the address under 

ADDRESSES

.


Background and Purpose 


Bulk solid hazardous materials include materials grouped into a number of specific classes, the definitions of which
are contained in the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), Department of Transportation, Hazardous
Materials Regulations (HMR) (49 CFR chapter I, Subchapter C). There are also some solid materials which are not properly
described by any of the hazard classes defined in the HMR, but which when carried in bulk may pose a threat to the vessel
or the crew, most commonly from a tendency to spontaneously generate heat or to deplete the oxygen in the cargo space.

The international standard for the marine transport of solid materials in bulk is the Code of Safe Practice for Solid
Bulk Cargoes, popularly known as the ``BC Code,'' published by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). In
the BC Code, certain materials which do not fit into the standard IMO hazard classes are placed in the class ``Materials
hazardous only in bulk'' (MHB). This class is defined as materials which, when carried in bulk, present sufficient
hazards to require specific precautions. Examples of such materials include materials that are liable to reduce
the oxygen content in a cargo space, self-heating materials, or materials which become hazardous when wet. 
The BC Code is currently only a recommended standard. However, several countries have adopted the Code in their national
regulations. In addition, recent amendments to Chapter VI of the International Convention for the Safety of Life
at Sea, 1974, as amended, (SOLAS 74/83) adopted certain general provisions of the BC Code. These amendments to Chapter
VI of SOLAS 74/83 were developed by the IMO Subcommittee on Containers and Cargoes (BC Subcommittee), and adopted
by the IMO Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) at its 59th Session in May 1991. As adopted by MSC, the amendments to SOLAS
74/83 entered into force for those countries signatory to the Convention, including the United States, on January
1, 1994. These amendments to SOLAS 74/83 make mandatory the provisions of the BC Code dealing with cargo stowage, the
passage of cargo information from the shipper to the master and the use of oxygen and toxic vapor analyzers. The SOLAS
Chapter VI as amended refers to the BC Code as one possible source of information on the properties and recommended
handling procedures for bulk solid materials. 
Many U.S. export shipments are bound for countries which have adopted the BC Code as national regulations. These shipments
therefore already comply with the recommendations of the BC Code. 
The Coast Guard issues Special Permits for shipments of bulk solid materials not listed in 46 CFR part 148 in order to
establish requirements for the safe carriage of these materials. The Special Permits allow the Coast Guard to closely
monitor these shipments in order to determine if the requirements imposed under the permit are adequate to ensure
safe carriage. The Coast Guard also uses Special Permits to allow the shipment of materials not listed in 46 CFR part
148 for which international guidelines have been established. After a history of safe transportation has been established
under a Coast Guard Special Permit, carriage requirements for the material may be included in 46 CFR part 148. 
The Coast Guard issues two basic types of Special Permits. The first type of permit is issued for materials for which
recommended handling procedures are contained in the BC Code. This type of permit basically restates the recommendations
contained in the Code. The second type of permit is issued for materials classified as hazardous substances by the
HMR or as hazardous wastes by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). When hazardous substances are transported
in quantities exceeding their reportable quantity (RQ) they, by definition, become hazardous materials. This second
type of Special Permit basically sets forth requirements for preventing crew exposure to the materials and release
of the material to the atmosphere or water.

Twenty-five new materials are proposed for inclusion in 46 CFR part 148 as materials which require special handling
when transported in bulk by water. All of the twenty-five are covered by the BC Code; in addition, eleven are regulated
by the HMR (49 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter C), and five are currently subject to Coast Guard Special Permits. Twelve of
the materials proposed for inclusion in 46 CFR part 148 are classified as MHB in the BC Code. 
There are ten materials, classified as MHB in the BC Code, which have not previously been regulated by the Coast Guard,
either in 46 CFR part 148 or by Special Permit. It is the Coast Guard's position that these materials, if handled improperly
when loaded as bulk cargoes, pose an unacceptable risk to the vessel and crew. For many of these materials, monitoring
of the cargo space for toxic or flammable gases and oxygen will be required under Chapter VI of SOLAS 74/83 as amended.

The intent of this proposal is to include in 46 CFR part 148 the above mentioned twenty-five materials and any special
handling procedures associated with these materials, including those requirements which will be imposed by Chapter
VI of SOLAS 74/83 as amended. 

As of April 1, 1993, the Coast Guard had the following 45 Special permits outstanding: 







The above Special Permits, which affect bulk solid cargoes such as ammonium nitrate fertilizers, ferrosilicon,
and metal ore concentrates would be terminated as of their expiration dates following publication of a final rule.



Discussion of Comments



As stated earlier, sixteen comments were received in response to the ANPRM. 
1. Five of the comments requested that the Coast Guard reconsider the necessity of regulating unmanned inland barges
in the same manner as oceangoing vessels. It was never the intent of the Coast Guard to require unmanned barges to comply
with the same requirements as manned vessels. This position is evidenced by question nine in the ANPRM. Barges would
be specifically exempted from complying with the stated requirements in several places in the NPRM. For example,
barges would not be required to carry any gas monitoring equipment. The Coast Guard recognizes that the SOLAS Convention
applies only to self-propelled oceangoing vessels, and that to require vapor detection equipment on unmanned barges
would be unnecessary and impractical since the primary purpose of the equipment is to protect the vessel's crew from
being exposed to harmful vapors or entering spaces which lack the oxygen necessary to support life. Placing personnel
on the vessel to take measurements would increase the likelihood of introducing a source of ignition that would not
otherwise be present. This equipment would also be of little benefit on open hopper barges, where any vapors generated
escape to the atmosphere. 
2. One comment suggested that the responsibility of the shipper to provide shipping papers be stated with more specificity.
The Coast Guard has adopted this suggestion. Paragraph (a) of  148.60 would contain a provision requiring that
the shipping paper be prepared by the shipper. Additionally, in several sections, including   148.15(a)
and (b), 148.25(a) and 148.90(c), the responsibility of the shipper would be further clarified. These sections would
state that it is the shipper's responsibility to determine if a Special Permit is required, and to apply for the Special
Permit. The shipper would also be responsible for producing the originating shipping paper, and, most importantly,
the shipper would be responsible for passing information to the master of the vessel (or the tug or towboat operator)
concerning the nature of the cargo to be loaded and any necessary precautions to be taken while loading and transporting
that cargo. 
3. Several comments stated that classification of previously unregulated materials as hazardous would impose unforeseen
burdens on the shippers of these materials. The comments expressed concern that the materials would be subject to
regulations covering all modes of transport, including truck and rail, and that the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) requirements for Material Safety Data Sheets and Hazard Communication Programs would be
applied to shipments of the material.

<TEXT>
 

It is not the Coast Guard's intent to classify the materials previously unregulated by the Coast Guard as ``hazardous''.
In response to the concerns raised by the comments, this NPRM proposes to change the title of 46 CFR part 148 to ``Bulk
Solid Materials Requiring Special Handling'' thereby eliminating the word ``hazardous''. The proposed rules would
also establish a new classification called ``Potentially Dangerous Materials'' (PDM) which would parallel the
IMO classification MHB. This classification would include materials that may be transported in bulk without posing
undue risk if the precautions described in part 148 are observed. Conversely, if these precautions are not followed,
the material in this category would have the potential to cause harm. In most cases the proposed precautions are simply
good operating procedures that would be followed by a prudent mariner in order to ensure the safety and integrity of
the vessel. Also, proposed  148.1 clearly states that these regulations would apply only to bulk shipments
of these materials by water, and proposed  148.3 clearly states that materials defined as Potentially Dangerous
Materials would be regulated only when being carried as a bulk cargo on board a vessel. These categories and requirements
would clearly reflect the intended status and handling requirements for the materials in question. 
4. One comment noted that the amendments to Chapter VI of SOLAS 74/83 will not render the BC Code mandatory, and, that
since the code will remain a recommended standard, it should not be referenced in the Coast Guard regulations. The
fact that IMO has not made the BC Code mandatory through SOLAS does not prohibit any sovereign nation from adopting
the Code or any of its provisions through that nation's domestic statutes and regulations. The Coast Guard proposes,
however, to incorporate by reference in 46 CFR part 148 only those portions of the BC Code dealing with hazardous materials.
Thus, selected pertinent provisions of the BC Code would be adopted in the Coast Guard regulations. Where necessary,
those provisions of the BC Code included in the proposed rules would be modified to fit the nature of the U.S. shipping
industry. 
5. One comment suggested that the format of the regulations not be substantially altered because those affected by
the regulations are familiar with the current format. The comment suggested that if the motivating concern of the
Coast Guard is reduction of the paperwork burden of the Special Permit process, then the Coast Guard should change
the permitting process to allow for one permit per commodity, with interested shippers becoming a party to that permit,
and extend the expiration date of the permit by ten years. The comment suggested adopting these changes without adding
any of the materials currently carried under Special Permit to the list of materials permitted under the regulations.

The Coast Guard does not agree with this comment. It is the Coast Guard's position that while this rule, if adopted,
would alter the current format of the regulations, it would also clarify the responsibilities of shippers and provide
them with important safety information. Elimination of the time-consuming paperwork burden inherent in the Special
Permit process for those materials which have an established record of safe transportation is only one of the motivating
factors for undertaking this regulatory revision. Under this proposal, new or one-time carriers of a material would
be informed of the risks and precautions involved in carrying that material. When the materials currently carried
under Special Permit are not included in the proposed regulations, there is a possibility that a shipper or carrier
might not be aware that a material is potentially dangerous when carried in bulk and therefore might not observe the
appropriate precautions. 
In addition, the inclusion of materials currently carried under Special Permit in 46 CFR part 148 would allow all shippers
more flexibility since they would not have to allow for lead time to obtain a Special Permit, and would have a wider choice
in the number of cargoes that they would be able to carry. 
6. One comment suggested that the Coast Guard differentiate between the hazards associated with the various materials.
This has been done by placing the materials into one of the hazard classes defined by the HMR or by classifying them as
PDM and including provisions with special requirements for materials with the potential to cause significant harm
if mishandled. 
7. One comment stated that there is no need to change U.S. regulations until the amendments to Chapter VI of SOLAS 74/83
are approved by IMO and the BC Code becomes mandatory. The Coast Guard does not agree with this comment. The amendment
to Chapter VI of SOLAS 74/83 will not make the entire BC Code mandatory, only certain basic provisions concerning the
passage of cargo information from the shipper to the master and the use of vapor detection equipment will become mandatory.
Moreover, since the comment was received, the revisions to Chapter VI of SOLAS 74/83 were adopted at the 59th session
of MSC. Therefore, the Coast Guard has determined that there is no need to further delay the proposal to revise 46 CFR
part 148. 
8. Three comments supported the addition of Direct Reduced Iron (DRI), in both hot-molded and cold-molded briquets,
to the regulations, since they are currently being shipped under Special Permits which mirror the provisions of the
BC Code. The requirements for carrying DRI are included in proposed   148.245 and 148.250.

9. Two comments suggested that the provision of Special Permit 1-92 excepting shipments of DRI lumps, pellets,
and cold-molded briquets on short and sheltered voyages from the requirement that such cargoes must be inerted or
inhibited should be extended to voyages made entirely on the inland waters of the U.S. This comment is adopted and is
included in proposed  148.245(h)(2). 
10. One comment recommended that precautions for entering inerted holds be added to the requirements for carrying
DRI lumps, pellets and cold-molded briquets. The comment noted that when carbon dioxide is the inerting medium, a
safety risk could possibly be created by carbon monoxide produced by reaction between the carbon dioxide and the DRI.
The recommendation is adopted and appropriate requirements for analyzing the atmosphere of the cargo hold for carbon
monoxide and oxygen prior to entry are included in proposed  148.245(g). Also, that section is referenced in
proposed Table 148.10. 
11. Four comments recommended that the Coast Guard refrain from publishing any proposed requirements for the carriage
of coal prior to receiving the final report of the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC) Subcommittee
on Coal Transportation. 
CTAC formed the Coal Subcommittee in order to obtain the recommendations of the U.S. coal industry, and the Coast Guard
did not intend to publish any requirements for the carriage of coal prior to receiving the Subcommittee's report.
Since this comment was received, the final report of the Coal Subcommittee was submitted to and approved by CTAC. Subsequently,
the Coast Guard prepared and submitted a proposal based on the Coal Subcommittee's final report to the 31st session
of the IMO Subcommittee on Containers and Cargoes (The ``BC Subcommittee''). The U.S. proposal, with some slight
modifications, was adopted by the BC Subcommittee; and in 1991, the provisions of the BC Code dealing with the transport
of coal were amended accordingly. Proposed  148.240 is based on the BC Code as amended. 
Proposed  148.240 differs from the report of the CTAC Coal Subcommittee in the following respects: 
a. The report offers no guidance on the frequency of monitoring for methane and carbon monoxide, while paragraphs
(i) and (l) of proposed  148.240 set out minimum testing frequency for that coal which is most likely to create
dangerous conditions. Under proposed  148.240(n), it would be within the discretion of the master to reduce
the frequency of monitoring in certain situations. 
b. The report does not specify that the temperature of a self-heating coal must be monitored. Paragraph (j) of proposed
 148.240 would require such monitoring. 
c. The report directs the master to seek expert advice and to consider heading for the nearest suitable port of refuge
if it is determined that the coal is heating. Proposed  148.240(k) would require the master to contact the nearest
Coast Guard Captain of the Port when a coal cargo is heating. 
Other comments about coal concern the effects of designating coal as a hazardous material and question the necessity
of regulating barge shipments of coal. These issues are addressed in the discussion on the designation of certain
materials as potentially dangerous, and in the discussion of the treatment of barge shipments. 
12. Two comments recommended that, based on experience gained while shipping uncalcined petroleum coke under the
terms of a Coast Guard Special Permit, uncalcined petroleum coke be treated in the same manner as calcined petroleum
coke in the proposed regulations. This recommendation is adopted and is included in  148.295. In addition,
the Coast Guard submitted a paper to the 30th session of the IMO Subcommittee on Containers and Cargoes recommending
that a similar change be made to the BC Code. This proposal met with approval and the BC Code was amended accordingly.

13. One comment requested that a public hearing be held in the event that woodchips and wood pulp pellets were not removed
from this rulemaking. The Coast Guard declined to schedule a public hearing at this stage of the rulemaking. The only
requirement for shipments of woodchips and wood pulp pellets included in this proposed rule is that closed holds be
tested prior to entry to ensure that they contain sufficient oxygen to support life. Because most U.S. shipments of
woodchips and wood pulp pellets are currently made in open barges, this requirement would not apply to most U.S. shipments.
The requirement is retained in this proposal in order to comply with the revisions to Chapter VI of SOLAS 74/83. Because
the requirement would not apply to most U.S. shipments of woodchips and wood pulp pellets, the Coast Guard has determined
that a public hearing is not necessary at this time.

Discussion of Proposed Amendments 


Subpart 97.12 


Subpart 97.12 of 46 CFR part 97 would be revised to clarify that the subpart would apply to bulk solid cargoes in general
and not only to ores and ore concentrates. Due to experience gained from a casualty to a foreign vessel that loaded a
bulk solid cargo in a U.S. port, the Coast Guard also proposes to extend the applicability of this part to foreign vessels
operating in U.S. navigable waters. Further, existing  97.12-5, which has not been revised since 1965,
references a manual that was the predecessor of the BC Code and that is no longer in print. The revised section would
include reference to the BC Code as a source of information for use in complying with the requirement that the master
of a vessel be furnished with guidance on safe loading and stowage. 


Part 148 


As discussed, the title of part 148 would be changed to read ``Bulk Solid Materials Requiring Special Handling''.

This NPRM also proposes to modify the structure of the regulations from four to six subparts. Each is explained below
briefly. 
Subpart A would state the purpose and applicability of the regulations, define terms used in the part, and list (in
tabular form) the solid materials permitted to be carried as bulk cargoes. 
Subpart B would provide all relevant information concerning Special Permits. 
Subpart C would set forth minimum transportation requirements for all materials regulated by 46 CFR part 148 and the
requirements for shipping papers and Dangerous Cargo Manifests. 
Subpart D would set forth general stowage and segregation requirements for materials according to their hazard class,
and, in addition, would contain stowage and segregation requirements for specific materials. 
Subpart E would contain special handling, loading, and carriage requirements for specific materials. The requirements
for specific materials in subpart D and this subpart would be in addition to the minimum requirements for all materials
and the general requirements for their respective hazard classes contained in subpart C. 
Subpart F would contain requirements for special equipment or procedures when dealing with certain cargoes. The
requirements of this part would apply when dealing with a cargo only if a provision from this part is included in Table
148.10 in reference to a particular material included in that cargo. 
The current sections of part 148 would be revised and renumbered as follows: 


 

The following proposed sections differ substantively from the current regulations: 


Section 148.1. 

The proposed regulations would apply to foreign-flag, as well as U.S.-flag, vessels when operating in U.S. waters.
The regulations would apply to all classes of vessels that transport solid bulk cargoes which require special handling,
including unmanned barges and barge-carrying vessels. 


Section 148.3. 

This section would include several new definitions, including ``potentially dangerous material.'' Also, the definition
of ``bulk'' has been revised for clarity and consistency with the BC Code.

<TEXT>
 



Section 148.8. 

The appendices B, D.1, D.4 and D.5 of the 1991 Edition of the BC Code would be incorporated by reference. Several provisions
of the proposed rules require the performance of tests specified in the BC Code appendices. Shippers and carriers
in international commerce will be able to comply with the BC Code where such compliance is required by the administration
of the country of origin or destination. 



Section 148.10. 

The format for table 148.10 would be modified. The table would include the UN number and hazard class of the materials
and references to sections of special requirements to be followed whenever that material is carried. These revisions
would make it easier to determine the exact requirements for the carriage of each approved cargo. 



Sections 148.15 through 148.30. 

These sections would clarify when a Special Permit is required, who would have to apply for a Special Permit, what information
would be required to be submitted to obtain a Special Permit, and who would be covered by the Special Permit once it is
issued. These proposed sections are more detailed than the current regulations in order to more clearly state each
person's responsibility and to clear up recurring misunderstandings concerning the applicability of the Special
Permit. The submittal of detailed information about the material carried would also greatly decrease the amount
of time currently spent by the Coast Guard in doing the necessary research to process each petition for a Special Permit.




Section 148.15. 

This proposed section places the responsibility on the shipper to determine if the material to be shipped fits into
any of the hazard classes defined in the HMR or whether it meets the definition of a PDM. 



Section 148.20. 

This section would list the information that must be included in a petition for a Special Permit. Submission of a Material
Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) would, in part, fulfill this requirement. When applying for renewal or extension of an existing
Special Permit, a shipper would be permitted to submit less detailed information because the Coast Guard would already
be in possession of much of the information. 



Section 148.30. 

This section would instruct the shipper on how to obtain a listing of materials for which a Special Permit currently
exists. 



Section 148.55. 

This proposed section states that the regulations apply to all transportation of solid bulk cargoes within the United
States including shipments which originate in foreign countries. This section provides that it would be the responsibility
of the person importing a bulk solid cargo to ensure that the foreign shipper is aware of U.S. regulatory requirements.




Section 148.120. 

This section would contain two tables presenting the requirements for segregation between incompatible bulk solid
cargoes and segregation between bulk solid cargoes and incompatible packaged cargoes. These tables are identical
to those which appear in the BC Code. 



Section 148.155. 

The properties of potentially dangerous materials vary greatly. This section would present the special stowage
and segregation requirements for these materials in tabular form for clarity. 



Section 148.260. 

This proposed section specifies that a vessel may not leave port unless the Captain of the Port is satisfied that the
temperature of the metal turnings is in accordance with the limits set by the applicable provisions of this section.
The current provision merely specifies that the Captain of the Port must be notified if the temperature limits are
exceeded. 



Section 148.270. 

This section would establish a new category of materials in part 148. Hazardous substances have previously been carried
only under Special Permits issued on a case by case basis. Hazardous substances are classified by the EPA based on the
potential of an accidental release of the material to endanger public health or welfare or the environment. The EPA
assigns to each hazardous substance a ``Reportable Quantity'' (RQ), which is that quantity, the release of which,
requires notification pursuant to 40 CFR part 302. 

The HMR, in 49 CFR 171.8, defines hazardous materials as including hazardous substances. Hazardous substances are
defined as materials, including mixtures and solutions, that are listed in the appendix to  172.101 and that
are present in a quantity, in one package, that exceeds the RQ of that substance. The definition further sets out the
concentration of a hazardous substance, for mixtures and solutions, that must be present before the mixture or solution
is considered a hazardous substance. For bulk shipments, the entire shipment would be taken into consideration since
there is no package. RQs assigned by EPA do not exceed 5,000 pounds, so any bulk shipment of hazardous substance would
be a shipment of a hazardous material. This section would not relieve the shipper or the master from any of the reporting
requirements set forth in 40 CFR part 302, but would set out minimum requirements for the safe carriage of solid hazardous
substances in bulk.

Sections 148.300 and 148.305. 

These sections would be revised to reflect recent amendments to the HMR and the BC Code which have redefined low specific
activity (LSA) radioactive materials and added a new entry for Radioactive Material, Surface Contaminated Objects.



Section 148.330. 

In spite of the stated intention of this rulemaking to harmonize U.S. regulations with the BC Code, this section, which
applies to zinc ashes, zinc dross, zinc residues, and zinc skimmings, differs significantly from the BC Code. The
provisions of this section are based on two Coast Guard Special Permits, SP 8-83 and SP 4-84. The terms of
these permits were developed as the result of a number of incidents involving fires or explosions in cargoes of zinc
skimmings, including at least one with loss of life. The intention of this section is to reduce the possibility of hydrogen
gas generation caused by the reaction of seawater and zinc. Under the proposed section, the cargo hold of vessels selected
to carry zinc ashes, zinc dross, zinc residues or zinc skimmings must be equipped with mechanical ventilation using
motors approved for use in hydrogen gas atmospheres, permanently installed combustible gas detectors, and temperature-sensing
thermocouples. 


Section 148.450. 

On April 11, 1991, off the coast of California, a foreign-flag vessel that had loaded a bulk solid cargo in a U.S. port
developed a severe list due to shifting of the cargo. Fortunately, this vessel was able to return to port and off-load
its cargo. The Coast Guard investigation of this marine casualty determined that the cargo shifted because its moisture
content exceeded the safe transportable limit, and that this caused the cargo to behave as a liquid. Due to this marine
casualty and others of a similar nature, the Coast Guard proposes to add a new section that prescribes requirements
for bulk solid cargoes that are subject to liquefaction. The proposed regulations are adapted from the BC Code and
would only apply to calcined pyrites, coal, and metal sulfide concentrates as indicated in table 148.10. The proposed
rules would recommend, but not require, use of the test procedures in appendix D of the BC Code to determine the moisture
content and transportable moisture limit of bulk solid cargoes. 


Incorporation by Reference 


The following material would be incorporated by reference in   148.55, 148.205, 148.220, and 148.450:



The Code of Safe Practice for Bulk Solid Cargoes, 

Appendices B, D.1, D.4 and D.5. 
Copies of the material are available for inspection where indicated under 

ADDRESSES

. Copies of the material are available at the addresses given in  148.8. 
Before publishing a final rule, the Coast Guard will submit this material to the Director of the Federal Register for
approval of the incorporation by reference. 


Regulatory Assessment 


This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and not significant under the ``Department
of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). A draft Regulatory Assessment
is available in the docket for inspection and copying where indicated under ``ADDRESSES''. 
These proposed regulations would have a multifaceted economic impact on the bulk solids transportation industry.
The Coast Guard estimates that if these regulations are adopted there would be an economic impact on the entire bulk
solid shipping industry of $391,653 per year, after an initial investment of $168,000. Costs associated with preparation
of the vessels and operation and maintenance of the equipment are estimated to be $373,440 annually. The cost of doing
the paperwork necessary under the proposed revisions to this part is estimated to be $18,213 annually, which is less
than half of the $43,745 estimated for the current regulations due to the elimination of the need to apply for Special
Permits for most cargoes. 
Amendments to add those materials currently carried under Special Permit to those listed in 46 CFR part 148 that may
be carried with special handling, will, if adopted, reduce the paperwork burden on the regulated industry and the
Coast Guard, and provide greater flexibility for shippers of bulk solid materials. 


Small Entities 


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 501 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are
not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). 
It is estimated that the bulk solid materials affected by this proposal would be shipped on 18 vessels, by at least one
hundred different shippers. Therefore, the cost of these regulations would be divided among numerous interests
and would not significantly impact any particular interest. 
Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. If, however, you think that your business qualifies as
a small entity and that this proposal will have a significant economic impact on your business, please submit a comment
(see 

ADDRESSES

) explaining why you think your business qualifies and in what way and to what degree this proposal will economically
affect your business. 


Collection of Information 


Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviews each proposed rule that contains a collection of information
requirement to determine whether the practical value of the information is worth the burden imposed by its collection.
Collection of information requirements include reporting, recordkeeping, notification, and other, similar requirements.

This proposal contains collection of information requirements in the following sections: 46 CFR part 148, subpart
B and 148.60 and 148.70. The following particulars apply: 



DOT No: 

2115. 


OMB Control No: 

2115-0100. 


Administration: 

U.S. Coast Guard. 


Title: 

Carriage of Bulk Solid Materials Requiring Special Handling. 


Need for Information: 

Special Permits allow the Coast Guard to ensure safety while allowing the shipping industry the flexibility to ship
new materials. Shipping papers are necessary to identify the cargo being shipped and the hazard associated with the
cargo. The Dangerous Cargo Manifest provides information on the location and quantity of hazardous materials on
board a vessel. Shipper's certificates ensure that certain cargoes are acceptable for shipment by vessel. 


Proposed Use of Information: 

This information is used by the Coast Guard to ensure safety on board vessels and in administering and enforcing the
laws, regulations, and international treaties for the safe transportation and stowage of hazardous materials.



Responses: 

1521 per year.

The Coast Guard has submitted the requirements to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction
Act. Persons submitting comments on the requirements should submit their comments both to OMB and to the Coast Guard
where indicated under 

ADDRESSES

. 


Federalism 


The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment. 
This rulemaking proposes regulations under which certain solid materials requiring special handling may be transported
in bulk by water. The regulations would apply to each domestic and foreign vessel, which is not exempted under 49 U.S.C.
1806(b), that transports solid materials requiring special handling when transported in bulk, when in the navigable
waters of the United States. The authority to establish such regulations for vessels operating in the navigable waters
of the United States has been committed to the Coast Guard by Federal statutes. Furthermore, since vessels tend to
move from port to port in the national and international marketplace, the safety standards proposed in this rule should
be of national scope to avoid burdensome variances. Therefore, the Coast Guard intends this rule, if adopted, to preempt
state action addressing the same subject matter. 


Environment 


The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that preparation of an Environmental
Impact Statement is not necessary. An Environmental Assessment and a draft Finding of No Significant Impact are available
in the docket for inspection and copying where indicated under 

ADDRESSES

. The only environmental impact of this rulemaking would be to decrease the likelihood of a spill or release of hazardous
material into the environment. This decrease in the probability of a spill can be attributed to an increased awareness
of the potential danger of hazardous bulk solid materials, and the decreased risk of a fire or explosion on a vessel
carrying these materials. Since bulk carriers currently have a very low rate of spills and releases, this impact would
be minimal. 


List of Subjects 


46 CFR Part 97 


Cargo vessels, Marine safety, Navigation (water), Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 


46 CFR Part 148 


Cargo vessels, hazardous materials transportation, Marine safety. 




For the reasons set out in the preamble the Coast Guard proposes to amend 46 CFR parts 97 and 148 as follows:

Hazard classes used in this part are defined in the following sections of 49 CFR: 








Hazardous substance

 is a substance as defined in 49 CFR 171.8. 



Hold

 means a space below deck that is used exclusively for the stowage of cargo and that is enclosed by the vessel's decks
and sides or permanent steel bulkheads. 



Hot-molded briquets

 are briquets of DRI that have been molded at a temperature of 650 
 C (1495 
 F) or higher, or that have a density of 5.0 g/cm3 (312 lb/ft3) or greater. 



LFL

 means lower flammable limit.

Material Safety Data Sheet

 is as defined in 29 CFR 1910.1200. 



Potentially Dangerous Material (``PDM'')

 means a material which, although not specifically falling into a particular hazard class, when carried as a bulk cargo
on board a vessel presents sufficient likelihood of developing dangerous conditions which require specific precautions.
Materials in this class include those which may cause oxygen depletion in the cargo hold, and those liable to self-heating.
Materials which present a potential danger associated solely with their tendency to shift in the cargo hold are not
included in this class of material.

Separated by a complete cargo compartment or hold from

 means either a vertical or horizontal separation. If the intervening decks are not resistant to fire and liquid, only
horizontal separation, i.e. by a complete cargo compartment or hold, is acceptable. 




Separated from

 means in different cargo compartments or holds when stowed under deck. If the intervening deck is resistant to fire
and liquid, a vertical separation, i.e. in different cargo compartments, is acceptable as equivalent to this segregation.





Separated longitudinally by an intervening complete cargo compartment or hold from

 means that vertical separation alone does not meet this requirement. 




Shipper

 includes an authorized representative of the shipper. 




Stowage factor

 means the number of cubic meters that 1000 kilograms (0.984 long ton) of a bulk solid material will occupy. 




Surface ventilation

 means ventilation which is sufficient to remove accumulated gases from the void space above the cargo, but which does
not direct air into the body of the cargo.

 148.300

Radioactive material; low specific activity. 


Except as authorized under  148.305, radioactive materials that may be stowed or transported in bulk are limited
to those radioactive materials defined as low specific activity materials in 49 CFR 173.403(n). 


 148.305

Radioactive material; surface contaminated objects. 


Solid objects of nonradioactive material having radioactive material distributed on their surfaces are authorized
for shipment only if_
(a) The nonfixed contamination on the accessible surface averaged over 300 cm2 (or the area of the surface if less than
300 cm2) does not exceed 0.0001 microcurie/cm2 (4.0 Bq/cm2) for beta and gamma emitters and low toxicity alpha emitters,
or 10

^

5 microcurie/cm2 (0.4 Bq/cm2) for alpha emitters; 
(b) The fixed contamination on the accessible surface averaged over 300 cm2 (or the area of the surface if less than
300 cm2) does not exceed 1.0 microcurie/cm2 (40,000 Bq/cm2) for beta and gamma emitters and low toxicity alpha emitters,
or 0.1 microcurie/cm2 (4,000 Bq/cm2) for alpha emitters; and 
(c) The nonfixed contamination plus the fixed contamination on the inaccessible surface, averaged over 300 cm2 (or
the area of the surface if less than 300 cm2) does not exceed 1.0 microcurie/cm2 (40,000 Bq/cm2) for beta and gamma emitters
or 0.1 microcurie/cm2 (4,000 Bq/cm2) for alpha emitters. 


 148.310

Seed cake. 


(a) Seed cake, except as provided in paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section, must be carried in accordance with paragraphs
(b) through (g) of this section. 
(b) Prior to loading, the seed cake must be aged in accordance with the instructions of the shipper. 
(c) If the seed cake is solvent extracted, it must be_ 
(1) Free from flammable solvent as far as reasonably practicable; and 
(2) Stowed in a mechanically ventilated hold. 
(d) Prior to loading, the shipper must provide the master of the vessel or person in charge of the barge with a certificate
from a competent testing laboratory stating the oil and moisture content of the seed cake. 
(e) The seed cake must be kept as dry as reasonably practicable at all times. 
(f) For a voyage with a planned duration greater than 5 days, the vessel must be equipped with facilities for introducing
carbon dioxide or another inert gas into the hold. 
(g) Temperature readings must be taken at least once in every 24 hour period. If the temperature of the seed cake exceeds
55
 C (131
 F) and continues to increase, ventilation to the cargo hold must be discontinued. If heating continues after
ventilation has been discontinued, carbon dioxide or the inert gas required under paragraph (f) of this section must
be introduced into the hold; except, if the seed cake is solvent extracted, the use of inert gas must not be introduced
until fire is apparent to avoid the possibility of igniting the solvent vapors by the generation of static electricity.

(h) Seed cake must be carried in accordance with the terms of a Special Permit issued by the Commandant (G-MTH)
in accordance with subpart B of this part if_ 
(1) The oil was mechanically expelled; and 
(2) It contains more than 10% vegetable oil or more than 20% vegetable oil and moisture combined. 
(i) This part does not apply to solvent extracted rape seed meal pellets or soya bean meal that_
(1) Contains not more than 4% vegetable oil and not more than 15% vegetable oil and moisture combined; and 
(2) As far as reasonably practicable, is free from flammable solvent. 


 148.315

Sulfur. 


(a) This part applies to sulfur in the form of lumps or coarse-grain powder only. Fine-grained powder (``flowers of
sulfur'') may not be transported in bulk. 
(b) After the loading or unloading of sulfur to which this part applies has been completed, the vessel's decks, bulkheads,
and overheads, if containing sulfur dust, must be swept clean or washed down with fresh water. 
(c) A cargo space that contains sulfur or the residue of a sulfur cargo must be adequately ventilated, preferably by
mechanical means. Each ventilator intake must be fitted with a spark-arresting screen. 


 148.320

Tankage; garbage tankage; rough ammonia tankage; or tankage fertilizer. 


(a) This part applies to rough ammonia tankage in bulk that contains 7% or more moisture by weight and garbage tankage
and tankage fertilizer that contain 8% or more moisture by weight. 
(b) Tankage to which this part applies may not be loaded in bulk if its temperature exceeds 38
 C (100
 F). 
(c) During the voyage, the temperature of the tankage must be monitored at intervals sufficient to detect spontaneous
heating.

 148.325

Wood chips; wood pulp pellets. 


(a) This part applies to wood chips and wood pulp pellets in bulk that are subject to oxidation leading to depletion
of oxygen and an increase in carbon dioxide in the cargo hold. 
(b) No person may enter a cargo hold containing wood chips or wood pulp pellets, unless_
(1) The atmosphere in the cargo hold has been tested and contains sufficient oxygen to support life; or 
(2) The person entering the cargo hold is wearing the appropriate self-contained breathing apparatus. 


 148.330

Zinc ashes; zinc dross; zinc residues; zinc skimmings. 


(a) The shipper shall inform the cognizant Coast Guard Captain of the Port in advance of any cargo transfer operations
involving zinc ashes, zinc dross, zinc residues, or zinc skimmings (zinc material) in bulk. 
(b) Zinc material must be aged by exposure to the elements for at least one year prior to shipment in bulk. 
(c) Prior to loading in bulk, zinc must be stored under cover for a sufficient period of time to ensure that it is as dry
as reasonably practicable. No zinc material that is wet may be accepted for shipment. 
(d) Zinc material may not be loaded in bulk if its temperature is greater than 11.1
 C (20
 F) in excess of the ambient temperature. 
(e) Paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(5) of this section apply only when zinc materials are carried by a manned cargo vessel:

(1) Zinc material in bulk must be stowed in a mechanically ventilated hold which_ 
(i) Is designed for at least one complete air change every 30 minutes based on the empty hold; 
(ii) Has explosion-proof motors approved for use in Class I, Division 1, Group B atmospheres or equivalent motors
approved by the vessel's flag state administration for use in hydrogen atmospheres; and 
(iii) Has nonsparking fans. 
(2) Each hold into which zinc material is to be loaded must be fitted with permanently installed combustible gas detectors
capable of measuring hydrogen concentr
