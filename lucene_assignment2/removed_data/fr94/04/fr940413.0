NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 









Supplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), with the concurrence of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), is issuing
regulations for employees of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct
for Employees of the Executive Branch issued by OGE. These supplemental regulations address outside employment
by NRC employees and ownership of securities by NRC employees, their spouses, and minor children. The NRC is also repealing
its current regulations on those subjects, while adding a cross-reference to the new provisions and preserving certain
separable financial interest exemptions. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 



On August 7, 1992, the Office of Government Ethics published the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the
Executive Branch (Standards) for codiication at 5 CFR part 2635. See 57 FR 35006-35067, as corrected at 57 FR
48557 and 57 FR 53583. These Standards, which took effect on February 3, 1993, set uniform ethical conduct standards
applicable to all executive branch personnel. 
5 CFR 2635.105 authorizes executive agencies, with concurrence from OGE, to publish agency-specific supplemental
regulations that are necessary to implement their ethics programs. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, with OGE's
concurrence, has determined that the following supplemental regulations, being codified in new chapter XLVIII
of 5 CFR, consisting of part 5801, are necessary for successful implementation of the NRC's ethics program. By this
notice, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is also repealing the parts of its regulations which were preserved by
5 CFR part 2635 pending issuance of this supplemental regulation (see the additional OGE grace period extension at
59 FR 4779-4780). 


II. Analysis of the Regulations 


Section 5801.101 General 


Section 5801.101 explains that the regulations contained in the final rule apply to all NRC employees, including
members of the Commission, and are supplemental to the executive branch-wide standards. Members and employees of
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission also are subject to the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive
Branch at 5 CFR part 2635, the executive branch financial disclosure regulations at 5 CFR part 2634, and additional
regulations regarding their conduct published by the agency in 10 CFR part 0. 


Section 5801.102 Prohibited Securities 



5 CFR 2635.403(a) authorizes agencies, by supplemental regulation, to prohibit or restrict the acquisition or holding
of a financial interest or a class of financial interests by agency employees based on a determination that the acquisition
or holding of such interests would cause reasonable persons to question the impartiality and objectivity with which
agency programs are administered. Where it is necessary to the efficiency of the service, such prohibitions or restrictions
may be extended to employees' spouses and minor children.

By 10 CFR 0.735-29, the Commission has long prohibited most of its employees, their spouses, minor children,
and other members of their households, from holding stocks, bonds, and other securities issued by major entities
in the commercial nuclear field. Section 5801.102 imposes very similar restrictions upon designated employees,
their spouses and minor children, based upon the Commission's determination that these restrictions are necessary
to maintain public confidence in the impartiality and objectivity with which the NRC executes its regulatory functions.
The restrictions also will help to maintain public confidence that sensitive information relating to agency operations
is not misused for private gain and will help accomplish the NRC's mission by avoiding widespread disqualification
of employees from the performance of their official duties. 

Section 5801.102 is narrower in scope than 10 CFR 0.735-29 in that it does not apply to all members of the employee's
household. Consistent with 5 CFR 2635.403(a) and 2635.403(c)(1), it restricts only the holdings of designated employees,
their spouses, and minor children. The Commission has determined that application of the securities restrictions
in  5801.102 to spouses and minor children is necessary to the efficiency of the service. As evidenced by 10 CFR
0.735-29, the NRC believes it is important to the success of its mission for regulated entities and others affected
by agency decisions to have this additional degree of assurance that agency decisions are not influenced by considerations
of personal gain on the part of NRC personnel. 

In addition to limiting the section's application to employees, their spouses, and minor children, the Commission
has made other minor revisions to the restrictions as stated in 10 CFR 0.735-29. The categories of prohibited
securities set forth in  5801.102(b) have been revised to reflect the new types of licenses established in 10
CFR part 52 and to include securities issued by State or local governments to finance low-level waste facilities.
Section 5801.102(b)(8) also prohibits employees for the first time from owning securities issued by an energy or
utility sector mutual fund that has invested more than 25 percent of the fund's assets in prohibited securities. 

The time frames for complying with the security ownership regulations have also been modified. Under 10 CFR 0.735-29,
NRC employees have had 30 days to comply after commencing employment or being promoted to a position covered by the
security ownership prohibitions; one year to divest any security interest newly added to the agency's prohibited
security list; and a ``reasonable time'' to dispose of securities inherited by gift. Consistent with 5 CFR 2635.403(d),
the final rule provides a uniform 90-day period for divestiture, with extension available in cases of undue hardship.


The criteria in  5801.102(e) for waiving the prohibition on holding a specific security have been modified
to provide greater specificity. A criterion has been newly added to cover circumstances in which legal constraints
prevent divestiture. One example of such a legal constraint would be the situation in which the prohibited security
is held as part of the assets of a trust of which the employee is a beneficiary and where the trustee, who has sole authority
to purchase and sell the assets, refuses the employee's request to sell the prohibited security. 

The Commission has eliminated the requirement contained in 10 CFR 0.735-29 that employees who are subject to
the security ownership restrictions certify each year that they are in compliance. Because the annual certifications
have rarely revealed violations of the substantive restrictions, there is inadequate justification for continuing
this requirement. However, to monitor compliance, the NRC will continue to require employees holding designated
positions to certify compliance upon commencement of employment with the agency or upon promotion for the first time
to a position covered by the security ownership restriction. Agency employees will also be required to report to the
Office of the General Counsel in writing any prohibited securities obtained after the initial certification. This
will permit the Office of the General Counsel to track required divestitures. 

On the effective date of this regulation, the NRC will issue Management Directive 7.7 and its accompanying Handbook
which lists those agency positions covered by the security ownership restrictions. The Handbook will also describe
procedures for obtaining Certificates of Divestiture and waivers from the security ownership restrictions. Both
the Management Directive and Handbook will be available at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555-0001. Copies will also be available in each NRC Office.

Section 5801.103 Prior Approval for Outside Employment 



5 CFR 2635.803 authorizes individual agencies, by supplemental regulation, to require agency employees to obtain
approval before engaging in outside employment or other outside activities. The NRC has long had the prior approval
requirement, set forth in 10 CFR 0.735-40. Section 5801.103 of the final rule retains the requirement that NRC
employees obtain prior written approval before engaging in outside employment with entities that are regulated
by or have business with the Commission. The NRC policy has been, and will continue to be, to encourage teaching, lecturing,
or writing not prohibited by 5 CFR part 2635 or other applicable law. 

The agency designees for approval of outside employment and internal agency procedures for obtaining the necessary
approvals will be set forth in NRC Management Directive 7.8 and the accompanying Handbook. This Directive and Handbook
will be issued on the effective date of this regulation and will be available in the NRC Public Document Room and in each
NRC Office. 




III. Repeal of Superseded Portions of the NRC Conduct 
Regulations and Related Modifications 



The final rule repeals the NRC conduct regulations 10 CFR 0.735-8, 0.735-29, and 0.735-40, effective
on the same day that this rule takes effect. The information collection requirements of  0.735-8 are no
longer necessary. Section 0.735-29 will be superseded by the prohibitions on securities contained in 5 CFR
5801.102 and  0.735-40 will be superseded by the requirements for prior approval of outside employment
contained in 5 CFR 5801.103. These repeals, together with those effected by 58 FR 3825 and 29951, leave in 10 CFR part
0 only the waiver provisions of   735-21 (a) and (b) which are preserved by 5 CFR 2635.402(d)(1).
These paragraphs are redesignated  0.735-2 (a) and (b) to follow a new  0.735-1 which provides
a cross-reference to the NRC's supplemental regulation and to the executive branch-wide financial disclosure and
standards of ethical conduct regulations at 5 CFR parts 2634 and 2635. 



IV. Matters of Regulatory Procedure 



Administrative Procedure Act 



Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b), the NRC finds good cause not to seek public comment on this rule. Such comment is unnecessary
because the NRC is essentially repromulgating existing regulations in a different form, and the regulations pertain
wholly to internal agency personnel matters that affect only NRC employees, their spouses, and minor children. To
increase the likelihood of a smooth transition from the NRC's prior ethics rules to the new Government-wide standards
of ethical conduct regulations, these rulemaking actions should take place as soon as possible. The rule and accompanying
repeals will become effective 90 days after the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

. 



Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion 



The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described in categorical exclusions 10 CFR 51.22(c)
(1) and (2). Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement has been prepared
for this final regulation. 



Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 



This final rule contains no information collection requirements and therefore is not subject to the requirements
of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). 



Regulatory Analysis 



The NRC is promulgating a supplemental regulation to OGE's Government-wide standards of conduct regulations in
order to implement effectively the NRC's ethics program. This rule has no significant impact on health, safety or
the environment. There is no substantial cost to licensees, the NRC, OGE, or other Federal agencies. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commission certifies that this rule will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it affects only NRC employees.

Backfit Analysis 


The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this final rule and that a backfit analysis
is not required for this final rule because these supplemental regulations do not involve any provisions which would
impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109.

(i) A member of the Commission;
(ii) The Inspector General of the NRC;
(iii) A member of the Senior Executive Service (SES);
(iv) An employee who holds a non-SES position above GG-15; and
(v) Any other employee, including a special Government employee, whose duties and responsibilities, as determined
by the Commission or its designees, require application of the securities ownership prohibition contained in this
section to ensure public confidence that NRC programs are conducted impartially and objectively. The positions
of these employees are specified in NRC Management Handbook 7.7, which is available in the NRC Public Document Room;
and
(2) The term ``securities'' includes all interests in debts or equity instruments. The term includes, without limitation,
secured and unsecured bonds, debentures, notes, securitized assets and commercial paper, as well as all types of
preferred and common stock. The term encompasses both current and contingent ownership interests, including any
beneficial or legal interest derived from a trust. It extends to any right to acquire or dispose of any long or short
position in such securities and includes, without limitation, interests convertible into such securities, as well
as options, rights, warrants, puts, calls, and straddles with respect thereto.
(d) 

Divestiture and reporting of prohibited securities.

Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the newly covered employee, or the spouse or minor child of
the employee, shall divest prohibited securities within 90 days after appointment to the covered position. 




(2) 

Newly prohibited securities. 

Within 30 days after publication of the prohibited securities list to which an entity's name has been added, a covered
employee who owns, or whose spouse or minor child owns, prohibited securities shall make a written report of that ownership
to the Office of the General Counsel. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the covered employee,
or the spouse or minor child of the covered employee, shall divest prohibited securities within 90 days after publication
of the prohibited securities list. 


(3) 

Securities acquired without specific intent. 

Within 30 days after a covered employee, or the spouse or minor child of a covered employee, acquires securities of
an entity on the prohibited securities list as a result of marriage, inheritance, gift or otherwise without specific
intent to acquire the securities, the covered employee shall make a written report of the acquisition to the Office
of the General Counsel. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, a covered employee, or the spouse or

Disqualification pending divestiture. 

Pending divestiture of prohibited securities, a covered employee must disqualify himself or herself, in accordance
with 5 CFR 2635.402, from participation in particular matters which, as a result of continued ownership of the prohibited
securities, would affect the financial interests of the employee, or those of the spouse or minor child of the employee.
Disqualification is not required where a waiver described in 5 CFR 2635.402(d) applies. Procedures for obtaining
individual waivers are contained in NRC Handbook 7.7, which is available in the NRC Public Document Room. 



(6) 

Tax treatment of gain on divested securities. 

Where divestiture is required by this section, the covered employee (except a special Government employee) may be
eligible to defer the tax consequences of divestiture under subpart J of 5 CFR part 2634, pursuant to procedures in
NRC Handbook 7.7, which is available in the NRC Public Document Room. 


(e) 

Waivers. 

(1) The Chairman may grant a waiver to permit a covered employee, or the spouse or minor child of a covered employee,
to retain ownership of a security of an entity on the prohibited securities list upon a determination that the holding
of the security is not inconsistent with 5 CFR part 2635 or otherwise prohibited by law, and that: 


(i) Under the circumstances, application of the prohibition is not necessary to ensure confidence in the impartiality
and objectivity with which NRC programs are administered; 


(ii) Legal constraints prevent divestiture; or 


(iii) For a special Government employee, divestiture would result in substantial financial hardship. 


(2) Where a waiver has been granted under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the covered employee must disqualify himself
or herself, in accordance with 5 CFR 2635.402, from participation in particular matters which, as a result of continued
ownership of the prohibited security, would affect the financial interests of the employee, or those of the spouse
or minor child of the employee unless the employee has received a waiver described in 5 CFR 2635.402(d), pursuant to
procedures in NRC Handbook 7.9, which is available in the NRC Public Document Room.

or activity, involving the provision of personal services by the employee. It includes, but is not limited to, personal
services as an officer, director, employee, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, trustee,
teacher or speaker.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) adopts, except for the State Telecommunications Modernization
Plan, its interim rule published December 20, 1993, as a final rule with minor technical changes. This action makes
changes to the telephone program required by the Rural Electrification Loan Restructuring Act of 1993 (RELRA or legislation).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Executive Order 12866 


This final rule has been determined to be not-significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning
and Review, and therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). However the interim rule
was reviewed by the OMB in conformance with Executive Order 12291 and Departmental Regulation 1512-1, and was
subsequently exempted from the OMB review under 12866.


Information Collection and Recordkeeping Requirements 


The reporting and recordkeeping requirements contained in the final rule have been approved by the OMB in accordance
with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.). These requirements are approved under OMB control number 0572-0079. 
Send comments regarding this collection of information to: Department of Agriculture, Clearance Office, Office
of Information Resources Management, Room 404-W, Washington, DC 20250, and to the Office of Information and
Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for USDA, room 3201, New Executive Office Building, Washington,
DC 20503. 
The information set forth in the interim rule regarding Executive Orders 12778 and 12372, the Regulatory Flexibility
Act Certification, the National Environmental Policy Act Certification, and the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance,
applies to this final rule without change. 


Background 


On December 20, 1993, REA published an interim rule (58 FR 66250) to incorporate changes to telephone loan policies
required by RELRA (107 Stat. 1356). RELRA amended several provisions of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as
amended (7 U.S.C. 901 

et seq

.) (RE Act), and mandated a restructuring of the telephone loan program. 
REA received 81 comments regarding the interim rule. Overall, the greatest concern on the part of the responding organizations
was 7 CFR part 1751, subpart B, the State Telecommunications Modernization Plan (modernization plan). Because of
the overwhelming response regarding the modernization plan, related concerns and possible modifications will
be resolved in a separate notification. 
This notice addresses comments on parts of the interim rule other than 7 CFR part 1751, subpart B. All comments were
taken into consideration in preparing the final rule. Comments were received from the following:

Two organizations objected to REA distinguishing between authorized loan purposes for Rural Telephone Bank (RTB)
loans by establishing a preference for one classification of authorized statutory loan purposes over another. Further,
it was stated that RTB is without authority to impose such a preference, and this provision should be deleted from the
final rule.



Response: 

While RELRA amended section 408(a)(2) of the RE Act to revise certain purposes for RTB financing, section 408(a)(1)
was not amended and it references section 201 where such purposes are still eligible for RTB financing. REA believes
that RELRA, by amending 408(a)(2), indicated preference to loans for section 408(a)(2) purposes over 408(a)(1)
purposes to the extent that REA has completed applications for loans for purposes set forth in 408(a)(2). This policy
is consistent with the RELRA provisions which provide (1) the same purposes for REA cost-of-money loans as for 408(b)(2)
loans, and (2) that RTB and cost-of-money loans are to be concurrent.



Section 1610.6 Concurrent Bank and REA Cost-of-Money Loans





Comment Summary: 

Several organizations objected to REA requiring that REA cost-of-money loans and RTB loans be made concurrently,
and stated that concurrence should remain an option of the borrower. Also, there was concern that mandating RTB to
make loans concurrently with the REA cost-of-money program would compromise the independence of a future, privatized
RTB. Commenters requested that REA revise the interim rule to provide borrowers with an option of selecting concurrent
RTB and REA cost-of-money loans.



Response: 

Concurrent loans are required by RELRA. This is also consistent with RELRA's other amendments that only allow REA
cost-of-money and RTB loans to be made for the same purposes and that subject those loans to the same eligibility requirements.
This approach facilitates the most effective administration of this policy.



Section 1610.10 Determination of Interest Rate on Bank Loans





Comment Summary: 

REA should acknowledge that future RTB interest rates will be calculated taking into consideration RELRA's interest
rate amendment.



Response: 

The methodology for calculating interest rates charged on RTB loans is provided in  1610.10. While the interest
rate amendment requires calculating a single RTB interest rate that applies to all advances made within a given fiscal
year, this amendment only takes effect when funds have been appropriated by Congress to offset any subsidy associated
with charging a single rate. When such an appropriation is made, RTB will calculate an interest rate in accordance
with the RELRA amendment. However, no revisions will be made to  1610.10 because the methodology for calculating
interest rates remains unchanged.

Section 1610.11 Prepayments 





Comment Summary: 

One commenter suggested that paragraph (b) be changed to conform with the language of the RE Act. Others commented
that the elimination of prepayment premiums should apply to all outstanding RTB loans, not just those approved after
November 1, 1993. 



Response: 

REA believes the language in this provision of the interim rule correctly interprets RELRA's amendment to section
408(b)(8) of the RE Act. All RTB loan agreements entered into before November 1, 1993, contain a prepayment premium
provision. That prepayment premium policy was determined by the RTB Board of Directors. The original prepayment
policy was established by the RTB Board of Directors on February 10, 1972, and later revised on May 3, 1984. RELRA eliminated
the premiums only on loans approved after November 1, 1993. Further, a provision to eliminate the prepayment premium
for RTB loans approved before November 1, 1993, was initially included in an early draft of the legislation but was
eventually removed. 




Section 1735.10 General 





Comment Summary: 

With regard to REA's use of borrower-funded consultants (paragraph (e)), one organization commented that while
the interim rule follows the legislation, many question the intent, usage and unfair advantages such activity could
bring to small companies with little or no capital resources. 



Response: 

REA recognizes these concerns; however, the option of hiring a consultant is necessary in order to adhere to the provision
of the legislation. In accordance with the legislation, the Administrator is authorized to accept funds voluntarily
provided by a borrower to be used to obtain assistance from third party experts in the review of a loan application.
The purpose of this provision is to assist in the expeditious review of numerous loan applications given limited REA
manpower and resources. The Administrator intends that the telephone loan programs be administered in a fair and
impartial manner. 




Comment Summary: 

With regard to paragraph (b), one organization commented that the language ``in REA's opinion'' should be deleted
from the final rule because REA does not possess the authority which this reference implies to deny loans without a
factual basis. 



Response: 

This language was included to insure that (1) the main objectives of the RE Act (i.e., provide service to the widest
practical number of rural subscribers), and (2) the provisions of the borrower's modernization plan will be carried
out by borrowers of REA telephone loans. REA will not deny a loan without a factual basis. If the purposes of a loan are
not consistent with the goals of the modernization plan for the borrower's State, then REA will deny the loan. This
determination will be based on the modernization plan requirements and objectives provided in  1751.106.
However, REA has considered that strict conformity to the requirements of a borrower's modernization plan could
result in loans that would not be economically or technically feasible. REA has expanded  1735.10(b) to take
into consideration these situations when making loans. 



Section 1735.17 Facilities Financed 





Comment Summary: 

One organization commented that the interim rule correctly recognizes that under the legislation certain facilities
and purposes will not be financed depending on the type of loan. The commenter further stated that the background statement
fails to acknowledge that RTB loans will still be made for section 201 loan purposes and that loans that fall into the
restricted purpose category are the new cost-of-money loans. 



Response: 

See the response to the comment on  1610.1. 



Section 1735.22 Loan Security





Comment Summary: 

One commenter objected to the Times Interest Earned Ratio (TIER) maintenance requirement stating that REA is without
authority to impose such requirement, and that the TIER range established in the legislation as eligibility criteria
is adequate to protect loan security. Also, that the 1.75 TIER level is arbitrary. 



Response: 

The TIER criteria put forth in the legislation determines the borrower's loan eligibility, it does not imply that
risks to loan security are nonexistent if the borrower meets the eligibility criteria. Using the TIER eligibility
range for maintenance purposes would require the borrower to maintain a minimum TIER of only 1.0. Allowing the borrower
to maintain net margins at a level sufficient only to cover interest expenses does not offer much financial security
nor assure credit quality. However, during the forecast period (i.e., construction period) when interest expenses
are higher and associated revenues are not yet realized the borrower can maintain a TIER of 1.0. Afterwards, the TIER
maintenance requirement merely requires the borrowers to maintain the TIER predicted by the projections given to
REA by the borrower and on which REA relied on making the loan, but not to exceed 1.75. The TIER maintenance requirement
provides some assurance of adequate loan security without placing an additional burden on the borrower. In fact,
more than 93 percent of REA borrowers have existing TIERS of 1.75 or greater. This standardized maintenance requirement
is needed because the new eligibility requirements rendered the previous maintenance requirement inequitable
and obsolete. As a Federal lending institution, REA has the responsibility to protect the Government's security
interest.

Section 1735.30 Hardship Loans





Comment summary:

 Several commenters suggested that the priority system established for approving REA hardship loans was unnecessary,
too complex, and non-statutory. While recognizing that one of the objectives of the priority system is to ensure financing
to the neediest borrowers, the commenters stated that, overall, the system would be burdensome on REA and its borrowers
and would treat some borrowers unfairly. One commenter stated that the current ``first come first served'' policy
for loan approval would be adequate for approving loans in addition to assessing the urgency of each financing request.
Further, one commenter, stating that loan approval should be based only on the eligibility criteria in the RELRA and
not on specific plant modifications (such as distance learning or medical link facilities), commented that the method
and criteria used in assigning points were unfair to some borrowers. The commenters also stated borrowers may be denied
financing (within a reasonable time frame or perhaps altogether) due to the nature of the point assignment and ranking
system. 



Response:

 The hardship loan program created by the RELRA is intended to ensure that lower cost capital financing will be available
to those applicants most in need due to extreme operating conditions. Since REA believes that the amount of financing
available to fund the hardship program will generally be more limited than the eligible loan applications, it is necessary
to implement a system that allows the widest practical nationwide use of those limited funds. 

The ranking criteria REA has established does not conflict with a borrowers' eligibility to receive hardship financing.
All borrowers that meet the hardship eligibility requirements (TIER, density, and modernization plan) will receive
financing, subject to the availability of funds. The ranking criteria does, however, provide REA with a methodology
of fairly assessing all eligible applications and provides an equitable manner in which to disburse the limited amount
of funds available. 

In addition, the ranking and subsequent prioritizing of a loan application does not require any additional information
on the part of the borrower. All of the information needed is readily available in the loan application and the loan
study prepared by REA. Any additional burden placed on REA is minimal and will not result in a delay in the processing
of an application. 



Comment summary:

 Concerning paragraph (b), one commenter stated that the size of an exchange within a borrower's service territory
is not relevant to the density provision which precludes borrowers from receiving hardship financing for facilities
in an exchange where the average number of subscribers per mile of line is greater than 17. 



Response:

 The RELRA clearly intended to avoid the use of lower-cost hardship financing in densely populated ``semi-urban''
areas. RELRA precluded borrowers from receiving hardship financing to be used in any ``area'' where the average number
of subscribers per mile of line is greater than 17. REA has defined ``area'' to mean an exchange of the borrower. In addition,
to further clarify the measure of a semi-urban area, 1,000 existing subscribers is also used so that high density exchanges
with large populations can be distinguished from those remote pockets of populations that have a high exchange density,
but are clearly rural areas. 



Comment summary:

 With regard to the optimal use of loan funds ( 1735.30(e)), several commenters stated that there is no need for
REA to limit the amount of a hardship loan to any borrower. One respondent commented that by ``splitting'' loan applications
and identifying the most urgent financing needs while seeking agreement from all parties involved in a financing
request, REA could effectively ensure hardship financing in the neediest situations, without limiting loan size.



Response:

 REA has limited the size of hardship loans for the borrowers' (and its subscribers) benefit. Since eligible borrowers
will be competing for a limited amount of available financing, limiting the loan size helps to ensure that (1) hardship
funds will be provided for the most urgent loan purposes and (2) the widest number of borrowers, and consequently rural
subscribers, will benefit from the hardship program. 



Section 1735.31 REA Cost-of-Money and RTB Loans 





Comment Summary:

 With regard to  1735.31(e), one organization commented that the TIER ratio contained in the REA cost-of-money
and RTB eligibility criteria seems to be at variance with the statutory definition, and suggested that the final rule
conform to the precise language of the legislation. 



Response:

 REA believes the language in the interim rule is consistent with the language of the legislation. 



Comment Summary:

 One organization commented that REA is without authority to establish the requirement that interest rates on cost-of-money
loans be fixed at the time of advance rather than at the time of loan approval. The commenter suggested that in the absence
of statutory direction to the contrary, interest rates on cost-of-money loans should be fixed at the time of loan approval.




Response:

 The requirements of the interim rule reflect REA's interpretation of the legislation, that is, interest rates based
on the cost of capital to the Government at the time of each advance of funds. REA adopted this approach to ensure against
rate disparity between the time of loan approval and advance of funds. REA must borrow matching funds from the U.S.
Treasury when the borrower requests an advance. The interest rate charged to the borrower is effectively the same
interest rate to be paid to Treasury on this borrowing by REA. REA believes that such approach is true to Congress' intent
that loans be made at the then current cost of money to the Government. This is evident in the amount of subsidy appropriated
by Congress for cost-of-money loans. 



Comment Summary:

 One organization commented that the procedure outlined in paragraph (c)(2) for determination of the cost-of-money
interest rate is unnecessarily cumbersome and should be simplified in the final rule. The commenter also suggested
that paragraph (d) be revised to make it clear that the borrower's request is a specific one to conform to the language
of the RE Act and  1735.32(a). 



Response:

 With regard to paragraph (c)(2), the procedure as written is necessary to ensure a clear and definitive method for
all parties when setting the interest rate on cost-of-money loans. Concerning paragraph (d), REA believes the language
in the interim rule is consistent with the language of the legislation, and that it is evident that REA will only make
loan guarantees to those borrowers specifically requesting a guarantee. 



Section 1735.32 Guaranteed Loans 





Comment Summary:

 With regard to paragraph (b), one organization commented that the requirement to participate in a modernization
plan should be the same for all loan programs, and the rule as currently written appears discriminatory. 



Response:

 The legislation clearly states that the modernization plan shall apply only to REA hardship, REA cost-of-money,
and RTB loans. The interim rule as written adheres to the legislation. 



Sections 1735.74 Submission of data, and 1737.22 Supplementary information 





Comment Summary:

 One organization commented that the language relating to the certification of participation in a modernization
plan should be revised to eliminate the restrictive reference to the borrower's president by substituting chief
executive officer or preferably authorized corporate officer. 



Response:

 Participating in a modernization plan and fulfilling its goals may require a significant effort from the borrower,
and may effect whether a borrower receives a loan. Due to the critical nature of these factors, REA believes it is in
the interests of both the borrower and REA to have the certification signed by the borrower's president. 



Simultaneous Loans 





Comment Summary:

 One organization commented on REA's reference to simultaneous loans, stating that it is not a defined term in the interim
rule nor is it a term utilized in either the legislation or the existing RE Act. The commenter suggested this provision
be deleted in the final rule.

<PARENT> FR940413-0-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response:

 Since certain purposes will not be financed depending on the type of loan, REA has used the term ``simultaneously''
to clarify that these types of loans may be made to the borrower at the same time or in the same set of documents. The term
``simultaneously'' was used so as not to confuse the reader since, historically, ``concurrent loans'' has referred
only to the combination of REA and RTB loans.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>








Consolidation of the NRC Region V Office With the Region IV Office 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations as a result of the consolidation of the Region
V office in Walnut Creek, California, with the Region IV office in Arlington, Texas. These amendments are necessary
to inform the public of the administrative changes to the NRC's regulations.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On April 4, 1994, the NRC will consolidate its Region V office in Walnut Creek, California, with the Region IV office
in Arlington, Texas. An NRC field office will be established in Walnut Creek, California. 



Previously, the NRC published a general notice in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 8667; March 1, 1994) stating that effective March 1, 1994, the emergency response functions and responsibilities
of the current Region V office would be transferred to the Region IV office. 

Because this amendment deals with agency procedures, the notice and comment provisions of the Administrative Procedure
Act do not apply pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). Good cause exists to dispense with the usual 30-day delay in the effective
date because the amendments are of a minor and administrative nature dealing with a change in address and telephone
number. 
The amendment is effective April 4, 1994. 



Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion 



The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(2).
Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this
final rule. 



Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 



The final rule contains no information collection requirements and, therefore, is not subject to the requirements
of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). 



Regulatory Analysis 



A regulatory analysis has not been prepared for this final rule because it is an administrative action that changes
the address and telephone number of an NRC region. 



Backfit Analysis 



The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this final rule because this rule does
not involve any provisions that would impose a backfit as defined in  50.109(a)(1). Therefore, a backfit analysis
is not required for this rule.

Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11 and MD-11F Series 
Airplanes Equipped With Honeywell Flight Management Computers 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11 and MD-11F series airplanes. 
This action requires revising the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to ensure 
that the flight crews verify the accuracy of data provided by the Flight Management 
Computer (FMC) under certain conditions. This amendment is prompted by a report that 
certain FMC's may provide erroneous V speed data under certain conditions. The actions 
specified in this AD are intended to prevent the airplane from failing to achieve sufficient 
climb gradient, which may result in the airplane failing to achieve obstacle clearance. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Recently, an operator of McDonnell Douglas 
Model MD-11 series airplanes reported that certain Honeywell Flight Management 
Computers (FMC) provided erroneous V speed data when the anti-ice system was turned 
ON during flex (assumed) temperature takeoffs. Investigation into this problem revealed 
that the takeoff decision speed (V

1

) could be as low as 12 knots below the V

1

 speed data 
published in the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM), and the rotation speed 
(V

R

) could be as low as 4 knots below the V

R

 speed data published in the FAA-approved 
AFM. An airplane rotating at low V

R

 speeds could reach 35 feet at a speed less than the 
published minimum safety speed (V

2

). This condition, if not corrected, could result in 
these airplanes failing to achieve sufficient climb gradient, which may lead to these 
airplanes failing to achieve obstacle clearance. 



The FMC's installed on Model MD-11 series airplanes are identical to those 
installed Model MD-11F series airplanes. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
other McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11 and MD-11F series airplanes of the same type 
design equipped with certain Honeywell FMC's, this AD is being issued to prevent these 
airplanes from failing to achieve sufficient climb gradient, which may result in these 
airplanes failing to achieve obstacle clearance. This AD requires revising the 
FAA-approved AFM to ensure that the flight crews verify the accuracy of data provided 
by the FMC when the anti-ice system is turned ON during flex temperature takeoffs. 

This is considered to be interim action. The manufacturer of these airplanes is 
currently developing new software, in concert with the manufacturer of the FMC, that will 
address the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. Once this software is developed, 
approved, and available, the FAA may consider additional rulemaking. 

Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is 
found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and 
that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days. 



Comments Invited 



Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements 
affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public 
comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment 
on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. 
Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to 
the address specified under the caption 

ADDRESSES.

 All communications received on 
or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended 
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's 
ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action 
and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed. 

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, 
environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. 
All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for 
comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that 
summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be 
filed in the Rules Docket. 

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments 
submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on 
which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-29-AD.'' 
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
Assessment. 
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must 
be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant 
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further that this 
action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation 
otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final 
regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if 
filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Distribution of Property of Bankrupt Futures Commission Merchant That Had Participated in a Cross-Margining Program




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Commodity Futures Trading Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rules.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission) has adopted an additional appendix to its bankruptcy rules
to govern the distribution of property where the debtor is a futures commission merchant (FCM) that holds cross-margin
(XM) accounts as well as non-XM accounts. This new distributional framework is intended to assure that non-XM customers
of such an FCM will not be adversely affected by a shortfall in the pool of XM funds. The new distributional framework
will become applicable to each non-proprietary XM program at such time as the relevant clearing organizations submit
an amended participant agreement that makes reference to the new distributional framework and such agreement is
approved by the Commission.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Introduction 



On December 28, 1993, the Commission published a proposed additional appendix to its bankruptcy rules that would
govern the distribution of property where the debtor is an FCM that holds XM accounts as well as non-XM accounts and
allowed thirty days for comment thereon.

1

 The Commission received one written comment in response to the proposal, from the Chicago Board Options Exchange
(CBOE), which expressed support for the proposal. The Commission has carefully considered this comment and, based
upon that review and its own reconsideration of the issue, has determined to adopt the additional appendix to its bankruptcy
rules essentially as proposed. 





II. Background of XM Programs 



In XM programs, intermarket positions with offsetting risk characteristics are margined together as a single portfolio.
These intermarket positions include stock index futures, options on stock index futures and stock index options,
as well as foreign currency futures, options on foreign currency futures and foreign currency options. Because the
related intermarket positions are essentially offsetting and therefore may effectively serve as margin collateral
for one another, the margin requirement for the combined position may be lower than if each were margined separately.

Currently, there generally are two types of XM programs_proprietary and non-proprietary.

2

 In proprietary programs, XM treatment is given to intermarket positions in proprietary (

i.e.

, non-customer) accounts maintained by participating clearing members. With non-proprietary XM programs, XM treatment
is given at the clearing organization level for intermarket positions maintained by clearing members for market
professionals. 





III. Previous Bankruptcy Distribution in the Context of XM Programs 



Under the various non-proprietary XM programs, the futures trades and securities positions of eligible market professionals
are deemed to be customer property under section 4d(2) of the Commodity Exchange Act

3

 and any customer net equity claim which a participating market professional has in respect of XM property held by a
clearing firm in a non-proprietary XM account must be treated as a customer net equity claim under part 190 of the Commission's
rules

4

 and subchapter IV of chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code (the commodity broker liquidation provisions).

5

 In the case of an FCM bankruptcy, the commodity broker liquidation provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and part 190 of
the Commission's rules provide for a pro rata distribution of assets among the section 4d(2) customers whose accounts
are carried by such FCM. Thus, absent some provision to the contrary, if a participating clearing member defaulted
due to losses in its non-proprietary XM account, non-XM customers could be forced to share in those losses.

In order to avoid this possibility, Commission orders approving each of the current non-proprietary XM programs
have required participating market professionals to execute agreements whereby they subordinate their XM-related
claims to customer claims based on non-XM positions in the event of the clearing member's bankruptcy. The net equity
claims of non-XM customers thus have been accorded priority over the net equity claims of XM customers. 

The relevant Commission orders approving the various cross-margin programs and various subordination agreements,
as prescribed by relevant exchange rules, among market professionals, their clearing members and the clearing organizations
involved, established the previous bankruptcy distribution framework. In the case of the bankruptcy of a clearing
member participating in a non-proprietary XM program, the trustee would marshal all of the assets that were available
to satisfy customer claims as set forth in Commission Rule 190.08 (whether such funds derived from XM customers, non-XM
customers or any other available source and irrespective of whether the shortfall in the segregated funds accounts
were attributable to XM or non-XM customers). The trustee would determine if there were sufficient funds to satisfy
in full the net equity claims of all non-XM customers cleared by the clearing member. If all such net equity claims of
non-XM customers could be satisfied in full, the trustee would make the appropriate distributions and market professionals
who participated in an XM program would receive any remaining funds to be shared on a pro rata basis. If there were not
sufficient funds to satisfy non-XM net equity claims in full, the trustee would distribute to the non-XM customers
only whatever funds were available on a pro rata basis and market professionals participating in the XM program would
receive nothing. 

The result of the market professionals' subordination required by the Commission orders has been that the market
professionals' XM-related assets would be included within the pool of customer funds available to meet the claims
of the clearing member's non-XM customers.

7

 Upon satisfaction of these ``regular'' customer claims, any excess customer property would be distributed to the
various market professionals cleared by the defaulting member based upon their XM-related claims consistent with
the pro rata distribution scheme of the Bankruptcy Code and part 190 of the Commission's rules. Thus, non-XM customers
would never receive less than they would have received in the absence of an XM program.

8

 






IV. New Bankruptcy Distribution in the Context of XM Programs 



When the Commission adopted its part 190 bankruptcy rules,

9

 it included an appendix intended to facilitate a trustee's operation of the estate of a bankrupt commodity broker.
This appendix includes a schedule of trustee's duties, forms concerning customer instructions for return of non-cash
property and transfer of hedge contracts, and a proof of claim form. The Commission has now adopted a new appendix to
part 190 to provide further guidance to a trustee of a bankrupt FCM with respect to the appropriate distribution of
property where the FCM had been a participant in an XM program that includes non-proprietary positions. As described
above, such programs are now numerous and include non-proprietary positions in certain instances and where they
do so, participating market professionals have been required by Commission order, among other things, to execute
agreements whereby they subordinate their XM-related claims to the claims of non-XM customers in the event of bankruptcy
in all instances. 





The new bankruptcy appendix will continue the concept of subordination for purposes of assuring treatment of the
market professionals' securities included in an XM account as part of the commodity estate, but will modify the method
for distribution of property of a bankrupt FCM which had participated in an XM program that includes non-proprietary
positions such that the subordination to futures customers in the event of bankruptcy is more limited. However, the
Commission orders and the clearing organization rules will continue to require each market professional participating
in an XM program to agree that all of his XM assets carried by his clearing member, including securities options, will
not be deemed to be ``customer property'' under SIPA and will be treated pursuant to the commodity broker liquidation
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. Thus, the market professional will remain removed from the class of customers
whose claims will be disposed of pursuant to SIPA

10

 and, accordingly, the market professional's XM assets carried by a securities broker-dealer would continue to be
considered as other than SIPA customer property, since such property is defined to include only cash or securities
held for the account of a SIPA customer.

The guiding principles of the new appendix to part 190 are to assure that there is generally pro rata distribution to
customers of the customer funds in the bankrupt FCM's commodity interest estate and that non-XM customers of such
an FCM are not adversely affected by a shortfall in the pool of XM funds. The new appendix preserves the principle that
non-XM customers will never receive less than they would have received in the absence of an XM program, but the distributional
rule will not require market professionals participating in XM programs to subordinate claims they may make for customer
property in all instances. 

Under the new appendix, a bankruptcy trustee handling the commodity interest estate of a bankrupt FCM with XM customer
funds must first determine the respective shortfalls, if any, in the pools of XM customer and non-XM customer segregated
funds. The trustee then would calculate the shortfall in each pool as a percentage of the segregation requirement
for the pool. If there were no shortfall in either of the two pools; if there were an equal percentage shortfall in the
two pools; if there were a shortfall in the non-XM pool only; or if the percentage of shortfall were greater in the non-XM
pool than in the XM pool, the two pools of segregated funds would be combined and XM customers and non-XM customers would
share pro rata in the combined pool.

12

 However, if there were a shortfall in the XM pool only, or if the percentage of shortfall were greater in the XM pool than
in the non-XM pool, the two pools of segregated funds would not be combined.

13

 Rather, XM customers would share pro rata in the pool of XM segregated funds, while non-XM customers would share pro
rata in the pool of non-XM segregated funds. To facilitate this distributional framework, subclasses of customer
accounts, an XM account and a non-XM account, would be recognized.

14

 







As with the previous distribution system for a bankrupt FCM with XM-related claims, the new appendix ensures that
non-XM customers will never receive less than they would have received in the absence of an XM program. Of course, without
the specific subordination of XM customer claims to non-XM customer claims in all cases by market professionals participating
in XM programs, non-XM customers will, depending upon the circumstances, receive either equivalent or less favorable
distributions under the approach of the new appendix than they would have received under the Commission's previous
bankruptcy distribution for FCMs participating in an XM program. In those cases where there is no shortfall in the
non-XM pool (see Examples 1 and 3), the distribution to non-XM customers will be the same under the new appendix as it
has been previously. However, in those cases where there is a shortfall in the non-XM pool, the pro rata distribution
across the combined XM and non-XM pools (see Examples 2, 5 and 6) or the separate treatment of the XM and non-XM pools
and the XM and non-XM account subclasses (see Example 4) will generally mean a less favorable distribution to the non-XM
customers than has been previously required.

15

 This is the result because there will no longer be a marshalling of all assets available from segregated funds, including
those attributable to XM customers, to satisfy all claims from non-XM customers before any claim of an XM customer
can be satisfied. The Commission believes these outcomes are fair to all parties involved and consistent with general
bankruptcy principles, and that they eliminate the need for execution of a separate subordination agreement to comply
with section 4d(2) of the Commodity Exchange Act once participating market professionals elect ``commodity'' customer
treatment for the XM account.

In order for the participants in a particular non-proprietary XM program to be covered by the new bankruptcy distributional
rule, the clearing organizations operating the program must submit an amended form of participant agreement deleting
the provision requiring that a customer net equity claim of a participating market professional be subordinated
to the customer net equity claims of ``public customers'' that do not relate to XM property and substituting a reference
to the distributional rule set forth in the new appendix B. As the Commission indicated when it proposed the new appendix,
it is prepared to modify its orders relating to non-proprietary XM programs accordingly upon receipt from the relevant
clearing organizations of such amended participant agreements. The Commission believes the procedure requiring
approval of amended participant agreements is necessary to eliminate any possible confusion for a trustee as to which
distributional rule to follow in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy of an FCM participating in a non-proprietary XM
program after the effective date of the new appendix B but before an amended participant agreement is approved by Commission
order. 


The Commission has consulted with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Securities Investor Protection
Corporation and believes that this change will not adversely affect continued treatment of XM funds under the commodity
broker, rather than the securities broker-dealer, liquidation provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The Commission
also understands that the OCC will submit conforming rule changes to the SEC to eliminate the subordination to public
customer requirement from its approval order. 




IV. Related Matters 




A. Regulatory Flexibility Act 




The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-611 (1988), requires that agencies, in proposing rules,
consider the impact of those rules on small businesses. These rules will affect distributees of a bankrupt FCM's estate
where the FCM had participated in an XM program. Previously, market professionals with an XM account were required
to subordinate their claims in a bankruptcy to those of non-XM customers in all instances, so the new rules which modify
the subordination requirement should not adversely impact such market professionals. Further, the distributional
framework is intended to assure that non-XM customers of such FCM will not be adversely affected by a shortfall in the
pool of XM funds and thus there should not be a significant economic impact on such customers as a result of the adoption
of these rules. Therefore, the action taken herein will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. When the Commission published its proposal, it invited comments from any person or entity which
believed that the proposal would have a significant impact on its operations. No comments on this issue were filed.





B. Paperwork Reduction Act 




The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

, imposes certain requirements on federal agencies (including the Commission) in connection with their conducting
or sponsoring any collection of information as defined by the PRA. In compliance with the PRA, the Commission submitted
these rules in proposed form and their associated information collection requirements to the Office of Management
and Budget. While these rules have no burden, the group of rules of which these rules are a part has the following burden:

List of Subjects in 17 CFR Part 190 




Bankruptcy.





Accordingly, the Commission, pursuant to the authority contained in the Commodity Exchange Act and, in particular,
Sections 1a, 2(a), 4c, 4d, 4g, 5, e, 8a, 15, 19 and 20 thereof, 7 U.S.C. 1a, 2 and 4a, 6c, 6d, 6g, 7, 7a, 12a, 19, 23 and 24 (1988
& Supp. IV 1992), and in the Bankruptcy Code and, in particular, Sections 362, 546, 548, 556 and 761-766 thereof,
11 U.S.C. 362, 546, 548, 556 and 761-766 (1988), hereby amends part 190 of chapter I of title 17 of the Code of Federal
Regulations as follows: 





PART 190_BANKRUPTCY 





1. The authority citation for part 190 continues to read as follows:

 




Authority:

 7 U.S.C. 1a, 2, 4a, 6c, 6d, 6g, 7, 7a, 12, 19, 23 and 24 and 11 U.S.C. 362, 546, 548, 556 and 761-766. 




2. Section 190.08 is amended by revising the introductory text to read as follows: 




 190.08 

Allocation of property and allowance of claims. 



The property of the debtor's estate must be allocated among account classes and between customer classes as provided
in this section, except for special distributions required under Appendix B to this part. The property so allocated
will constitute a separate estate of the customer class and the account class to which it is allocated, and will be designated
by reference to such customer class and account class. 



* * * * * 




3. Part 190 is amended by designating appendix to part 190 as appendix A to part 190 and revising the heading and by adding
appendix B to part 190 to read as follows: 




Appendix A to Part 190_Bankruptcy Forms


* * * * *


Appendix B to Part 190_Special Bankruptcy Distributions 




Framework 1_Special Distribution of Customer Funds When FCM Participated in Cross-Margining 




The Commission has established the following distributional convention with respect to customer funds held by a
futures commission merchant (FCM) that participated in a cross-margining (XM) program which shall apply if participating
market professionals sign an agreement that makes reference to this distributional rule and the form of such agreement
has been approved by the Commission by rule, regulation or order: 


All customer funds held in respect of XM accounts, regardless of the product that customers holding such accounts
are trading, are required by Commission order to be segregated separately from all other customer segregated funds.
For purposes of this distributional rule, XM accounts will be deemed to be commodity interest accounts and securities
held in XM accounts will be deemed to be received by the FCM to margin, guarantee or secure commodity interest contracts.
The maintenance of property in an XM account will result in subordination of the claim for such property to certain
non-XM customer claims and thereby will operate to cause such XM claim not to be treated as a customer claim for purposes
of the Securities Investors Protection Act and the XM securities to be excluded from the securities estate. This creates
subclasses of customer accounts, an XM account and a non-XM account (a person could hold each type of account), and
results in two pools of customer segregated funds: An XM pool and a non-XM pool. In the event that there is a shortfall
in the non-XM pool of customer class segregated funds and there is no shortfall in the XM pool of customer segregated
funds, all customer net equity claims, whether or not they arise out of the XM subclass of accounts, will be combined
and will be paid pro rata out of the total pool of available XM and non-XM customer funds. In the event that there is a shortfall
in the XM pool of customer segregated funds and there is no shortfall in the non-XM pool of customer segregated funds,
then customer net equity claims arising from the XM subclass of accounts shall be satisfied first from the XM pool of
customer segregated funds, and customer net equity claims arising from the non-XM subclass of accounts shall be satisfied
first from the non-XM customer segregated funds. Furthermore, in the event that there is a shortfall in both the non-XM
and XM pools of customer segregated funds: (1) If the non-XM shortfall as a percentage of the segregation requirement
in the non-XM pool is greater than or equal to the XM shortfall as a percentage of the segregation requirement in the
XM pool, all customer net equity claims will be paid pro rata; and (2) if the XM shortfall as a percentage of the segregation
requirement in the XM pool is greater than the non-XM shortfall as a percentage of the segregation requirement of the
non-XM pool, non-XM customer net equity claims will be paid pro rata out of the available non-XM segregated funds,
and XM customer net equity claims will be paid pro rata out of the available XM segregated funds. In this way, non-XM
customers will never be adversely affected by an XM shortfall. 


The following examples illustrate the operation of this convention. The examples assume that the FCM has two customers,
one with exclusively XM accounts and one with exclusively non-XM accounts. However, the examples would apply equally
if there were only one customer, with both an XM account and a non-XM account. 





1. Sufficient Funds to Meet Non-XM and XM Customer Claims: 







There are adequate funds available and both the non-XM and the XM customer claims will be paid in full.

2. Shortfall in Non-XM Only:








Due to the non-XM account, there are insufficient funds available to meet both the non-XM and the XM customer claims
in full. Each customer will receive his pro rata share of the funds available, or 50% of the $250 available, or $125.


3. Shortfall in XM Only:








Due to the XM account, there are insufficient funds available to meet both the non-XM and the XM customer claims in full.
Accordingly, the XM funds and non-XM funds are treated as separate pools, and the non-XM customer will be paid in full,
receiving $150 while the XM customer will receive the remaining $100.

4. Shortfall in Both, With XM Shortfall Exceeding Non-XM Shortfall:








There are insufficient funds available to meet both the non-XM and the XM customer claims in full, and the XM shortfall
exceeds the non-XM shortfall. The non-XM customer will receive the $125 available with respect to non-XM claims while
the XM customer will receive the $100 available with respect to XM claims.


5. Shortfall in Both, With Non-XM Shortfall Exceeding XM Shortfall:








There are insufficient funds available to meet both the non-XM and the XM customer claims in full, and the non-XM shortfall
exceeds the XM shortfall. Each customer will receive 50% of the $225 available, or $112.50.

6. Shortfall in Both, Non-XM Shortfall = XM Shortfall: 







There are insufficient funds available to meet both the non-XM and the XM customer claims in full, and the non-XM shortfall
equals the XM shortfall. Each customer will receive 50% of the $200 available, or $100. 

These examples illustrate the principle that pro rata distribution across both accounts is the preferable approach
except when a shortfall in the XM account could harm non-XM customers. Thus, pro rata distribution occurs in Examples
1, 2, 5 and 6. Separate treatment of the XM and non-XM accounts occurs in Examples 3 and 4.

Duty-Free Treatment To Be Accorded the Reimportation of Certain Articles Originally Imported Duty Free 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Customs Service, Treasury. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document amends the Customs Regulations to implement a provision of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 that extends
duty-free entry to the reimportation of certain articles originally imported duty free. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


For many years U.S. law, specifically, subheading 9801.00.20 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States
(HTSUS) and its predecessor tariff provision, item 801.00 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS), has
not imposed a tariff on articles reimported into the United States if, after exportation, they were not advanced in
value or improved in condition by any process of manufacture or other means while abroad. This provision, in effect,
sought to avoid double taxation/duty of such articles. 
Subsequent to the promulgation of item 801.00, TSUS, Congress enacted two duty preference schemes_the Caribbean
Basin Initiative or CBI (enacted as the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA), 19 U.S.C. 2701-2706)
and the Generalized System of Preferences or GSP (19 U.S.C. 2461-2466)_that also provide duty-free treatment
for certain imports from designated beneficiary developing countries (BDCs). Item 801.00, TSUS, however, was drafted
in language that precluded its application to articles that were entered duty free in the first instance. Thus, item
801.00, TSUS, operates to frustrate the purpose of those preference programs of encouraging development through
trade. 
The Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 (the Act), 19 U.S.C. 1654 note, Public Law 98-573, 98 Stat. 2948, approved October
30, 1984, and effective as provided, was enacted to change the tariff treatment accorded certain articles and for
other purposes. Section 118 of the Act, entitled ``Reimportation of certain articles originally imported duty free''
and effective November 14, 1984, sought to correct the unanticipated discriminatory effects of item 801.00, TSUS,
on eligible products from BDCs by amending that provision to extend duty-free treatment to goods which were previously
entered free of duty pursuant to the CBI and GSP preference programs. 
Section 10.108 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 10.108) pertains to the entry of reimported articles exported under
lease, but has not been amended to reflect the provisions of section 118 of the Act. Accordingly,  10.108 is amended
to enable articles initially entered duty free under the CBI and GSP programs to be exported and reimported duty free,
provided the other requirements of subheading 9801.00.20 are complied with. 


Inapplicability of Public Notice and Delayed Effective Date Requirements, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and
Executive Order 12866 


Because this amendment merely reflects a statutory requirement that confers a benefit upon the public, pursuant
to 
5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), notice and public procedure thereon are not required. Further, for the same reasons, good cause
exists for dispensing with a delayed effective date under 5 U.S.C. 553(d) (1) and (3). Since this document is not subject
to the notice and public procedure requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553, it is not subject to provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). This amendment is not a significant regulatory action as specified in E.O. 12866.

Recovery Act or Title V of the Trade Act of 1974, is being reimported without having been advanced in value or improved
in condition by any process of manufacture or other means, was exported from the United States under a lease or similar
use agreement, and is being reimported by or for the account of the person who imported it into, and exported it from,

Identifying Information Required on Entry Documents 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. Customs Service, Department of the Treasury.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final interpretive rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document sets forth examples that correctly identify the party in the U.S. to whom imported merchandise is sold
or consigned, or the premises in the U.S. to which it is delivered. This information is required by regulation to be
shown on Customs entry or release documents for the merchandise.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 



Merchandise imported and entered for consumption must be supported by Customs entry and entry summary documentation.

Briefly stated, this entry documentation is detailed in  142.3, 
Customs Regulations (19 CFR 142.3), and consists of the information which must be filed with Customs to secure the
release of imported merchandise from Customs custody (19 CFR 141.0a(a)); entry summary documentation is that which
must be filed in order to enable Customs to assess duties, and collect statistics with respect to the merchandise,
and to determine whether other requirements of law or regulation are met (19 CFR 141.0a(b)). 

In addition, in certain circumstances as enumerated in 
 142.21, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 142.21), merchandise 
may be initially released under a special permit for immediate delivery, in accordance with  448(b), Tariff
Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1448(b)), and in these circumstances as well, the information required by  142.3
must be provided, except that a commercial invoice need not be submitted at such time (see 19 CFR 142.22(a)). 

Customs capability to identify fully all parties involved with imported merchandise being entered or released is
essential in order to support investigative efficiency. Information concerning the party in the U.S. to whom such
merchandise is sold or consigned represents one of several elements which Customs considers in the process of assessing
the risks associated with the transaction and determining the appropriate level of examination to be accorded the
merchandise involved. This process is known generally as ``cargo selectivity''. 

In this latter regard, principally to correct a problem on the Northern Border,  142.3 was amended by T.D. 90-92,
55 FR 49879, to add a new paragraph (a)(6), in order to specifically require that entry or release documents set forth
the identity, including the importer identification number, of the party in the U.S. to whom the imported merchandise
is sold or consigned, or if this is unknown at the time of entry or release, the premises in the U.S. to which the merchandise
is delivered.

<TEXT>
 

Under  142.3(a)(6), the required information, including 
the appropriate importer identification number or numbers, must be provided for each entry of imported merchandise
processed through cargo selectivity, whether the entry is electronically or manually transmitted to Customs. 
In particular, for a consolidated entry, where the entry 
is made listing one broker or freight forwarder as consignee, 
the required information must be submitted for each separate 
and distinct shipment within the consolidated shipment. 
The notice of proposed rulemaking which led to the final rule adopting  142.3(a)(6) set forth seven examples
which were designed and intended to illustrate the application of the identification requirement contained in this
regulation (55 FR 2528, 2529). These examples, however, were dropped from the final rule because they created confusion
on the part of the brokerage community as to which party should be identified in some of the more complex import transactions
(T.D. 90-92, 55 FR 49879, 49883). However, it was noted in the final rule that examples meeting the needs of both
Customs and the trade would be developed and issued separately (

ibid.

). 
Accordingly, after working with the trade community in this endeavor, Customs published a notice of clarification
in the 


Federal Register

 on July 29, 1992 (57 FR 33463), proposing, and asking for public comment on, a number of examples intended to effectively
illustrate the correct application of  142.3(a)(6). 
A total of twelve commenters responded during the public comment period. A number of the comments made were outside
the 
scope of the notice, inasmuch as they did not address or concern the examples themselves. A description of the specific
issues that were raised with respect to these examples, together with Customs response, is set forth below. 


Discussion of Comments 




Comment:

 One commenter requested an explanation of the procedures for including the ultimate consignee on the entry documents
when there are multiple ultimate consignees (both electronically via the Automated Commercial System and on the
paperwork). 


Response:

 While this comment is beyond the scope of this notice, as a result of the passage of the Customs modernization portion
of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103-182, Title VI), Customs will be undertaking
a broad-based review of its regulations. This comment would be more appropriately addressed at that time. 


Comment:

 One commenter wanted to know what would happen if a ``customer'' refuses to give his ultimate consignee number or power
of attorney to his broker. 


Response: 

If the ultimate consignee number is not provided on the required entry documents, the documentation shall not be 
considered to be filed in proper form and shall be returned to the importer for correction pursuant to  141.64,
Customs Regulations (19 CFR 141.64).

Comment:

 Examples 2, 5 and 11 (now 10) are cited as situations where the Canadian shipper should be listed as the ultimate consignee.



Response:

 It would not be possible for the foreign shipper to be listed as the consignee or ultimate consignee on entry documents
at the time of immediate delivery, entry or release. The notice of clarification indicated the party in the United
States to whom merchandise is sold or consigned. It is this party who is required to be identified in the entry documents.



Comment:

 Example 9 is cited as a case where a Canadian company is listed on the entry documents as the buyer. The merchandise is
shipped to a trucking company in the United States, presumably for shipment to the buyer in Canada. It is suggested
that the Canadian buyer be listed as the ultimate consignee on U.S. entry documents. 


Response:

 The U.S. trucking company is properly listed as the ultimate consignee in this situation. Customs Regulations call
for using the premises to which the merchandise is to be delivered in the 
United States as the effective ultimate consignee on the entry, when there is no known U.S. buyer at the time of immediate
delivery, entry or release. 


Comment:

 It was requested that a new example be issued for entries 
filed on merchandise that arrives by pipeline. 


Response:

 The examples do not cover this because the mode of transportation is not a factor in identifying the ultimate consignee.



Comment:

 One commenter gave examples where the consignee or premises could change after the entry has been processed. 


Response: 

It is the party to whom the merchandise is sold or consigned, or the premises to which it is to be delivered, at the time
of entry or release, which must be listed in the Customs entry or release documents. 


Comment:

 One commenter wanted to know who the consignee would be 
if an importer was shipping merchandise from Canada ``directly'' 
to Mexico, through the United States, and chose to make a consumption entry. The commenter pointed out that the merchandise
might be free of duty and both the client and the carrier might not want the shipment to move in-bond. 


Response: 

A situation where a shipment moves from the point of entry to exportation from the United States is outside the scope
of 
 142.3(a)(6). Consequently, Customs will establish a procedure to accommodate importers who wish to file
a consumption entry for 
merchandise that will transit the United States. 


Conclusion 


After careful consideration of the comments received and further review of the matter, Customs has determined to
adopt the 
examples without substantive change, with the exception of one 
example (Example 10 in the notice of clarification) which is removed because the special steel invoice the subject
thereof is no longer being used. The succeeding examples are renumbered accordingly. In addition, the following
two typographical errors are corrected: in Example 5, the reference to ``Example 4'' is changed to ``Example 3'';
and in Example 9, the second sentence beginning with ``Acme shops'' is changed to ``Acme ships''. 


Examples 




Example 1.

 ABC Company, a distributor of telephone equipment located in Seattle, Washington, places an order with Canadian
Bell Limited of Vancouver, Canada, and arranges for the importing carrier to deliver the goods directly to several
customers of ABC Company in the U.S. 
ABC Company is the ultimate consignee for Customs purposes, 
since that is the party which purchased the merchandise from the Canadian shipper. 


Example 2.

 XYZ Limited is a Canadian company which produces and delivers baked goods to twenty retail food stores in the U.S. on
a daily basis. 
Since the baked goods are ordered/purchased separately from the Canadian supplier by the individual stores in the
U.S., each of these stores is the ultimate consignee for Customs purposes. 


Example 3.

 Montreal Furniture Company, a Canadian manufacturer of office furniture, leases storage space at the Champlain
Warehouse Service in Champlain, New York. As orders are received from customers in the U.S., delivery is made from
the Champlain storage facility.

<PARENT> FR940413-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Champlain Warehouse Service should be shown on the entry or release documents in accordance with  142.3(a)(6),
since there is no known buyer of the merchandise at the time of its importation and those are the premises in the U.S.
to which the imported goods are being delivered. 


Example 4.

 Calgary Instruments Limited ships a small parcel containing a medical instrument to the UPS (United Parcel Service)
hub in Sweetgrass, Montana, for subsequent delivery to Memorial Hospital in Great Falls, Montana. Reliable Broker
is the importer of record for this shipment. 
Memorial Hospital is the ultimate consignee for this shipment, since it is the purchasing party, and UPS is merely
a nominal consignee in the transaction. 


Example 5.

 An employee of Ontario Jewelry Sales Limited of Mississauga, Canada, imports in her personal baggage a collection
of diamonds for display and possible sale at a jewelry exhibition taking place at the Intercontinental Hotel in Manhattan,
New York. 
As in Example 3, since this shipment is not being imported subject to a contract of purchase or delivery at the time of
importation, the Intercontinental Hotel should be shown on the entry or release documents in accordance with  142.3(a)(6),
since that is the place to which the diamonds are being delivered.



Example 6.

 The Wilkins Fur Company, Limited, of Toronto, ships twenty mink coats to the Williamson Exposition Company of Boston,
which is handling the arrangements for a trade fair on behalf of the National Association of Fur Garment Wholesalers
to be held at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. 
Since there is no known buyer at the time of importation 
of the mink coats, the Williamson Exposition Company of Boston should be shown on the entry or release documents in
accordance with  142.3(a)(6), since that is the entity to which the coats are consigned. 


Example 7.

 Manitoba Auto Supply of Winnipeg ships ignition kits to the U.S. The buyer shown on the invoice is Minneapolis 
Auto Specialties of 2800 Hennepin, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Marty's Car Parts in Racine, Wisconsin, is shown as the
``ship to'' party. 
As in Example 1, the ultimate consignee for Customs purposes is Minneapolis Auto Specialties, since that is the party
which purchased the merchandise from the Canadian shipper. 


Example 8.

 Manitoba Auto Supply ships ignition kits to Minneapolis Auto Specialties in Duluth, Minnesota. The buyer 
shown on the invoice is Minneapolis Auto Specialties located at 2800 Hennepin in Minneapolis, Minnesota. 
As in Example 7, Minneapolis Auto Specialties in Minneapolis is the ultimate consignee since that is the party in the
U.S. which purchased the merchandise. 


Example 9.

 Acme Compressor Company, Limited, of Edmonton, Alberta, buys an air compressor from the Trucking Supply Company
of Regina, Saskatchewan, and is listed as the buyer on the invoice. Acme ships the compressor to the Lindquist Trucking
Company in Ambrose, North Dakota. 
The Lindquist Trucking Company should be shown on the entry or release documents in accordance with  142.3(a)(6),
since that is the place in the U.S. to which the goods are being delivered.

Example 10.

 Beauty Limited of Montreal, Quebec, sells a shipment of cosmetics to Total Woman, Inc. (a U.S. company) in care of (c/o)
Unique Image of Albany, New York. There is no address listed on the invoice for the buyer, Total Woman, Inc. 
The ultimate consignee in this case is Total Woman, Inc., which is the buyer in this transaction. Its name and address
must therefore be included on the Customs entry or release documents. 


Example 11. 

Spring Water Company of Los Angeles purchases a load of bottled water from Healthy Water Limited of Calgary, Alberta.
The address of Spring Water Company is listed as a post office box in Los Angeles. The water is shipped to Ralph's Grocery
Store on Sepulveda Boulevard in Los Angeles. 
The ultimate consignee is Spring Water Company of Los Angeles as the U.S. buyer of the water, regardless of the fact
that its address shows a post office box. 


Example 12. 

FTX Company in Mexico City ships a load of door knobs to the Rio Company in El Paso, Texas. There are no other parties located
in the U.S. shown on the invoice. 
The Rio Company should be shown on the entry or release documents in accordance with  142.3(a)(6) since there
is no known buyer of the merchandise at the time of its importation and those are the premises in the U.S. to which the
imported goods are being delivered. However, if there is a known buyer that name must be used. 


Example 13. 

ABC Garments of Edmonton, Alberta, manufactures children's clothing and sells to small boutiques in the U.S. 
These boutiques place orders (usually small) with ABC Garments which will accumulate a number of orders before sending
them as a consolidated shipment with their customhouse broker listed as consignee. 
Although  141.51, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 141.51), allows all merchandise arriving on one vessel and consigned
to one consignee (in this case, the broker) to be included in one entry, the ultimate consignee (

i.e.

, the person to whom the merchandise is sold) for each shipment in the consolidated entry must be provided to Customs
in accordance with   141.86(a)(2) and 142.3(a)(6), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 141.86(a)(2) and 142.3(a)(6)).
Furthermore, pursuant to   24.5(a) and 142.3(a)(6), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 24.5(a) and 142.3(a)(6)),
a Customs Form 5106 would also have to be filed for each ultimate consignee for which entry is made. 


Example 14. 

Through Quicksilver Delivery, an international courier company, Just Fabrics, Limited, of Montreal, ships a parcel
of fabric cuttings to Dresses-Are-Us in London, England. Dresses-Are-Us is listed as the destination party on the
invoice. After Customs clearance, the parcel is forwarded to England by A-1 Freight Forwarders of Buffalo,
New York.

Because there is no known buyer in the U.S., A-1 Freight Forwarders in Buffalo, New York, should be shown on the
entry or release documents in accordance with  142.3(a)(6), since theirs are the premises in the U.S. to which
the merchandise is to be delivered before being forwarded to England. 


Example 15. 

Top Hat, Ltd., ships twenty orders of clothing accessories on individual bills of lading to various consignees. 
The entire shipment is included on a master bill of lading designating a customs broker as consignee. 
One entry would be filed in this situation in accordance with  141.51, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 141.51).
Although the broker listed as consignee on the master bill of lading may be the importer of record, tariff-line items
would designate the individual ultimate consignees. Ultimately, all twenty ultimate consignees would be listed
on the entry. Some line items may be repeated for more than one ultimate consignee.

New Animal Drugs for Use In Animal Feeds; Semduramicin



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect the approval of a new animal
drug application (NADA) filed by Pfizer, Inc. The NADA provides for making a semduramicin Type A medicated article
used to make a Type C medicated broiler chicken feed for the prevention of coccidiosis.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pfizer, Inc., 235 East 42d St., New York, NY 10017, filed NADA 140-940, which provides for making a 5.13 percent
Aviax

TM

 (semduramicin sodium) Type 

A medicated article (equivalent to 50 gram (g) of semduramicin per kilogram or 22.7 g per pound (g/lb)) used to make
a 25 parts per million semduramicin Type C medicated broiler chicken feed. The feed is used for the prevention of coccidiosis
caused by 

Eimeria tenella, E. acervulina, E. maxima, E. brunetti, E. necatrix, and E. mivati/E. mitis

 in broiler chickens.


The NADA is approved as of March 10, 1994, and the regulations are amended in part 558 (21 CFR part 558) by revising  558.4(d)
and adding new  558.555 to reflect the approval. The basis for approval is discussed in the freedom of information
summary.
Semduramicin is a Category I drug which, as provided in  558.4 as amended, does not require a medicated feed application
(form FDA 1900) for making a Type C medicated feed. The maximum concentration of semduramicin permitted in a Type B
medicated feed is 2.25 g/lb (0.05 percent).
In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of 21 CFR part 20 and 21 CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii), a summary of
safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval of this application may be seen in the
Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), rm. 1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, from 9 a.m. to
4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, this approval qualifies for 5 years marketing
exclusivity beginning March 10, 1994, because no active ingredient (including any ester or salt thereof) has been
approved in any other application under section 512(b)(1) of the act.
FDA has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action and has concluded that the action
will not have a significant impact on the human environment and that an environmental impact statement is not required.
FDA's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment,
may be seen in the Docket's Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.


List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 558

Hazard Communication



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Department of Labor.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule; Temporary stay of effective date for wood products.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSHA is staying until August 11, 1994 the coverage of the Hazardous Communication Standard to wood and wood products
which will be processed in a manner which will create wood dust or which are treated with hazardous chemicals. This
will allow more time to prepare labels and MSDS's.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On February 9, 1994 (59 FR 6126), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) published amendments
to the existing Hazard Communication Standard which requires employers to establish hazard communication programs
that would transmit information to employees by means of labels, manufacturer's safety data sheets (MSDS) and training.
The amendment contained minor changes and technical amendments which went into effect March 11, 1994.




One of those amendments made clear that wood products which were to be processed in a manner which would create wood
dust or were treated with hazardous chemicals were covered by the standard. They would not be covered by the exemption
for other wood and wood products in the Hazard Communication Standard.

Warning labels and MSDS were appropriate for wood processed to create wood dust or treated with hazardous chemicals
because of the health hazards that respiration of excess levels of those substances would cause. However, wood and
wood products which only present the hazard of flammability do not need to be labeled because that hazard is common
knowledge. Paragraph (b)(6)(iv) was amended to incorporate this clarification.

As the Hazard Communication standard covers all industries covered by OSHA, that amendment was made in identical
language to 29 CFR 1910.1200(b)(6)(iv) (General Industry), 1915.1200(b)(6)(iv) (Shipyards), 1917.28(b)(6)(iv)
(Marine Terminals), 1918.90(b)(iv)(6) (Longshoring), and 1926.59(b)(6)(iv) (Construction). Agriculture was
covered by cross reference to the General Industry standard.

On March 4, 1994 OSHA was sent a letter by the American Forest and Paper Association which requested that this change
be made effective August 11, 1994 and not March 11, 1994 as specified in the notice. OSHA viewed this change as a clarification
because it was consistent with an interpretation OSHA had followed for several years. However many of its members
had disagreed with OSHA's interpretation and one ALJ decision supported those members' view. Consequently they
had not been labeling or supplying MSDS's when they shipped wood and wood products. It would take many of their members
and other effected employers substantially more than 30 days to develop appropriate labels and MSDS's.

OSHA concludes that this request is reasonable. Efforts by employers would be better spent in the next few months,
from the perspective of worker health, developing and attaching protective labels and supplying MSDS rather than
upon interpretive disputes.

Accordingly OSHA is staying from March 11, 1994 until August 11, 1994 the effective date of that part of Paragraph (b)(6)(iv)
which excludes from the wood dust exemption, wood and wood products which have been treated with hazardous chemicals
or which would be sawed or otherwise processed to create wood dust. This stay applies to all sectors covered by OSHA.

OSHA is adding a note following the regulatory text of the Hazard Communication standard in parts 1910, 1915, 1917,
1918 and 1926 to implement this stay. Agriculture is covered through the cross reference in 29 CFR 1928.21 to the General
Industry standard.

All other amendments to the hazard communication standard became effective March 11, 1994 as stated in the final rule.
Notice and comment is unnecessary pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553 and paragraph 6(b) of the OSH Act because this stay is brief
and will facilitate concentrating efforts to come into compliance.



Authority



This document was prepared under the direction of Joseph A. Dear, Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety
and Health, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210. Under the authority of
section 41 of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. 941), section 107 of the Contract Work

Allowances for Extraordinary Gas Processing Costs


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Minerals Management Service (MMS), Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to retain extraordinary cost provisions.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Royalty Management Program of the Minerals Management Service (MMS) has regulatory provisions for gas processing
cost allowances that exceed normal industry standards. The MMS had intended to develop criteria for the conditions
and practices in the gas processing industry and for technologies that are unusual, extraordinary, or unconventional.
However, after careful analysis of the comments received on the gas valuation regulations, as well as comments concerning
whether extraordinary cost allowance provisions should be developed for its oil, coal, and geothermal product value
regulations, MMS has decided to determine on a case-by-case basis whether an operation is outside of normal industry
operational standards.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background


(a) History of Regulation for Extraordinary Cost Allowances


The MMS gas valuation regulations at 30 CFR 206.158(d)(2)(i) (1993) state that MMS may grant an allowance for extraordinary
costs of processing if the lessee can demonstrate that the costs are, by reference to standard industry conditions
and practice, extraordinary, unusual, or unconventional. The MMS intended to apply this provision to advanced processing
technologies or unusual conditions that are outside of normal industry operational standards.
The MMS published a Notice in the 

Federal Register 

on November 28, 1988 (53 FR 47829), entitled ``Allowances for Extraordinary Costs, Transportation, and Gas Processing''
and solicited comments on what factors would comprise criteria for standard practices and conditions and for assessing
when a project would qualify for an extraordinary cost allowance. The comment period was originally due to close on
January 27, 1989, but MMS, by 

Federal Register 

Notice dated January 25, 1989 (54 FR 3623), extended the due date for public comments to March 15, 1989.

(b) Summary of Comments



In response to the above referenced Notice, MMS received comments from the following entities:




 Industry,

 Industry trade groups or associations,

 State representatives,

 An Indian tribe,

 State/Indian associations,

 A royalty-interest group, and

 Members of Congress.




Many commenters did not provide the data or information requested by MMS necessary to define standard conditions
and practices. Numerous industry, State, and State/Indian association commenters stated that the standard conditions
and practices for the gas processing industry could not be defined since the technology is dynamic. They also stated
that what constitutes extraordinary costs today may become standard in a few years and too many factors influence
the economic and operating characteristics of a processing plant (for example, the location, size, age of a plant,
gas stream composition, and environmental constraints).

One industry commenter commissioned a study on extraordinary gas processing costs and the underlying causes for
such costs. The MMS could not compare the results of this study against other data since few commenters actually offered
their definition of standard conditions for the gas processing industry. Although most industry commenters recommended
criteria for determining whether a gas processing operation is extraordinary, many commenters believed that all
projects should be granted allowances for extraordinary costs on a case-by-case basis rather than by a standard.

State and Indian respondents generally opposed allowances for extraordinary costs, and only a few commented on what
standards would be used to classify a processing technology as extraordinary. Some State commenters reasoned that
the extraordinary cost allowances should focus on high unanticipated costs above normal standards and not on low
revenues generated by the plant.

For oil, coal, and geothermal production, State and Indian respondents unanimously opposed provisions for extraordinary
cost allowances. Many industry commenters supported the extraordinary cost allowances for other minerals. However,
the information provided was not relative for developing extraordinary-cost criteria.

Following the comment process, MMS evaluated all suggestions and submitted a summary to the Royalty Management Advisory
Committee (RMAC) in June 1989 for its review and recommendations. On June 22, 1989, RMAC held a meeting with MMS in Denver,
Colorado, to discuss issues and comments regarding extraordinary cost allowance provisions. The MMS presented
its analysis to RMAC; however, RMAC took no action regarding this issue.



(c) Review of Applications Submitted to MMS



In addition to analyzing the comments received as a result of the Notices in the 

Federal Register

, MMS reviewed the industry applications submitted in the past 6 years requesting extraordinary processing cost
allowances. This review revealed that MMS has received nine requests for extraordinary cost allowances involving
five gas processing plants. Most of the requests involved gas processing situations where processing costs were
high due to the removal of hydrogen sulfide (H

2

S). The MMS determined that gas with a high sulfur content (sour gas) is present throughout various locations around
the continental United States as well as offshore. The H

2

S from many of these areas is further refined to elemental sulfur and sold. The MMS concluded that production of sour
gas is not extraordinary, unusual, or unconventional within the United States, either onshore or offshore.



(d) Approval Granted for Extraordinary Processing Allowances



Since the effective date of the gas valuation regulations (March 1, 1988), MMS has granted one extraordinary processing
cost allowance for the LaBarge Project in Wyoming. As the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA 86-626) observed,
the LaBarge gas stream is atypical in a methane recovery project because only about 22 percent of the feed gas stream
is methane and no liquefiable hydrocarbons are present. The MMS recognized the nature of gas from projects such as
LaBarge and indicated in the preamble to the March 1, 1988, gas valuation regulations (53 FR 1240) that extraordinary
cost allowances be granted for processing such atypical gas streams.

To contend with the unusual composition of the LaBarge Project feed gas stream, the plant design is complex when compared
to typical methane recovery plants. Due to the atypical composition of the LaBarge Project feed gas stream and the
complex nature of the plant, the cost to process the principal product, methane, is extraordinary compared with traditional
methane recovery plants.



MMS Intent



After a review of the comments, as well as the requests for extraordinary cost allowances, MMS has decided to retain
the current extraordinary cost provisions at 30 CFR 206.158(d)(2)(i) and not further define the criteria for assessing
when a project qualifies for an extraordinary cost allowance. This decision will enable lessees to continue applying
for an allowance on a case-by-case basis for advanced processing technologies.

Louisiana Offshore Oil Port: Expansion of Deepwater Port Safety Zone Boundaries



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is expanding the boundaries of the safety zone for the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP). A deepwater
port safety zone constitutes an area within which the erection of structures of mobile drilling operations for the
exploration for or extraction of oil or gas is prohibited. Expanding the safety zone will enlarge the approach to the
terminal portion of the safety zone and provide more unobstructed maneuvering room for vessels arriving and departing
from LOOP. This will reduce the risk of a marine casualty and consequent pollution.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Drafting Information



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Lieutenant Commander Walter (Bud) Hunt, Project Manager,
and Jacqueline Sullivan, Project Counsel, Oil Pollution Act (OPA 90) Staff, (G-MS-1).



Regulatory History



On February 17, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled ``Louisiana Offshore
Oil Port: Expansion of Deepwater Port Safety Zone Boundaries'' in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 8096). The Coast Guard received eight letters commenting on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested,
and one was not held.



Background and Purpose



The Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (33 U.S.C. 1501 

et seq

.) requires the Secretary of Transportation to designate a zone of appropriate size around and including any deepwater
port for the purpose of navigational safety and to protect the marine environment. This responsibility was delegated
to the Coast Guard in 49 CFR 1.46(s).

A deepwater port safety zone is designed to promote safety of life and property, marine environmental protection,
and navigational safety at any deepwater port and adjacent waters. No installations, structures, or uses that are
incompatible with port operations are permitted in a deepwater port safety zone. 33 CFR part 150 establishes the geographic
boundaries of the safety zone for the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) in Annex A and provides for the modification
of safety zone boundaries as experience is gained in deepwater port operations. The LOOP Safety Zone was first established
on December 29, 1980 (45 FR 85644).

On January 16, 1984, LOOP submitted to the Coast Guard a request for a waiver of the requirements of 33 CFR 150.337(a),
which prohibits a tanker from entering or departing a safety zone by other than a designated safety fairway. LOOP submitted
to the Coast Guard chart 11359 and indicated two uncharted areas adjacent to the safety zone which they referred to
as excursion zones. LOOP requested that vessels calling at the deepwater port be provided with additional maneuvering
room by allowing use of these excursion zones when departing or entering the LOOP safety zone. Deviations from the
safety fairway into these zones came to be known as ``excursions.'' On February 20, 1987, the Coast Guard granted for
1 year a waiver of the requirements that tankers enter and leave the safety zone by the safety fairway. Since then, the
Coast Guard has renewed the waiver on an annual basis.

<TEXT>
 

On December 30, 1987, LOOP asked the Coast Guard to make the waiver permanent. On February 8, 1988, the Coast Guard denied
the request on the grounds that future exploration for or extraction of oil or gas might occur within one or both excursion
zones. If such activity took place, the Coast Guard might have to revoke the waiver for the sake of safety.

On January 21, 1992, the Coast Guard published a notice of petition for rulemaking and request for comments in the 

Federal Register

 announcing a request by LOOP that the Coast Guard expand the safety zone that surrounds the deepwater port (57 FR 2236).
LOOP requested that the Coast Guard enlarge the safety zone by adding the two excursion zones and prohibit the erection
of structures within the safety zone. This in effect makes permanent the annual waiver of the requirements of 33 CFR
150.337(a).

The expanded safety zone will include the present excursion zones, broaden the entrance to LOOP, and prohibit the
erection of structures or mobile drilling operations. Enlarging the safety zone will reduce the number of required
vessel maneuverings and eliminate structures from the zone, possibly reducing the risk of accidents and consequent
pollution. This safety zone reflects actual tanker activity at LOOP based on detailed records the Coast Guard has
required LOOP to maintain.

To resolve the potential for conflicting use between the expanded safety zone and oil and gas leases actually within
the new zone, LOOP has agreed to compensate CONOCO, Inc., the lessee of Grand Isle Blocks 53, 58, 59, and 65. CONOCO,
Inc. will then relinquish these blocks to MMS. LOOP will not seek further expansion of the safety zone or oppose any
exploration and production activity outside or adjacent to the expanded safety zone.

On November 2, 1993, in a letter to the Department of Transportation, the MMS stated that it supports the agreement
between LOOP and CONOCO, Inc. MMS stated that it is prepared to prohibit surface occupancy of offshore oil and gas facilities
in the safety zone. However, MMS stated that it may be economically and technically feasible to develop the resources
lying beneath the safety zone by directional drilling. MMS would not prohibit subseabed access provided that surface
facilities are located outside the safety zone. Such subseabed activity would not interfere with vessel activity
in the safety zone.

Under the Deepwater Port Act of 1974, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1509(d)(1)), the Secretary of Transportation is required
to consult with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary
of Commerce prior to issuing the safety zone around any deepwater port for the purposes of navigational safety. The
Coast Guard has informed the noted Departments of the safety zone expansion, and they have taken no exception to the
safety zone as it appears in this final rule.

Discussion of Comments and Changes



The Coast Guard has received eight comments on the NPRM. Six comments endorsed the expansion of the safety zone or reversed
previous comments which raised questions about the safety zone. One comment stated that LOOP should provide assurances
that they will contain their activities to the limits of the safety zone and that LOOP should provide additional equipment
and operational policies necessary to do so. The Coast Guard has determined that LOOP has taken sufficient measures
to assure safe operation of the facility.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration identified four miles of submerged pipelines in the expanded
safety zone. These pipelines have been located in this area at least since 1987 when the excursion zone was first put
into effect. The Coast Guard concludes that the expanded safety zone will not increase the opportunity for disturbance
of submerged pipelines in the safety zone.

The Coast Guard has not revised the final rule based on comments received on the NPRM.



Regulatory Assessment



This rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(F)(1) of Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735;
October 4, 1993), and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that
Order. It has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that Order. It is not a significant regulation
under the ``Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979).

The economic consequences of this rulemaking are minimal. Economic effects include impacts on mineral extraction
and the commercial fishing industry. The expansion is relatively insignificant, comprising an approximate 15 percent
increase in the size of the safety zone.

When the original safety zone was established, it was not expected that there would be significant interference with
mineral extraction or navigation. Due to the relatively small size of the expansion, no impacts on mineral extraction
or navigation are expected in this case either. Access is available via alternative methods such as directional drilling.

This rulemaking will have minimal economic consequences for commercial vessels, including commercial fishing
vessels. Commercial fishing vessels will continue to have restricted use of portions of the safety zone as provided
in 33 CFR Table 150.345(a). Therefore, due to the small additional area involved, the impact on fishing activities
is negligible. No opposition to the NPRM was received from the commercial fishing industry. The Coast Guard did not
receive any comments on the economic consequences of this rulemaking.

In addition, this rulemaking provides permanent safety benefits. Providing additional maneuvering area minimizes
the likelihood of a catastrophic pollution incident resulting from a vessel colliding with any portion of the LOOP
facility. Therefore, the Coast Guard expects that expansion of the safety zone will reduce the environmental hazard.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this safety zone will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small business concerns
under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). The small entities affected by this rule are commercial fishing
activities at the deepwater port. The Coast Guard did not receive any comments on the impact of this rulemaking on small
entities. The impact will be minimal. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501,


et seq.

).

Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has
determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment. LOOP is located beyond State waters where only Federal jurisdiction applies.



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2(c) of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. This rule
will not result in significant impact on the quality of the human environment, as defined by the National Environmental
Policy Act. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated

Safety Zone; Ohio River Mile 468.5 to 473.0 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Temporary final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone on the Ohio River. The regulation is needed to control vessel traffic
in the regulated area while transiting downbound at night during high water conditions. The regulation will restrict
commercial navigation in the regulated area for the safety of vessel traffic and the protection of life and property
along the river.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 





Drafting Information 



The drafter of this regulation is LT Phillip Ison, Project Officer, Marine Safety Office, Louisville, Kentucky.




Regulatory History



In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. In effect, this regulation extends
an existing safety zone which will terminate at 6 p.m. EST on April 1, 1994. Although this regulation continues restrictions
which have been in place for twenty-one days, following normal rulemaking procedures would have been impracticable.
Specifically, the high water periods in the Cincinnati, Ohio area are natural events which cannot be predicted with
any reasonable accuracy. The need to extend the restrictions, and how long they should be kept in place, could not have
been predicted until recently, making it more practical to issue a new regulation instead of extending the current
one. As the river conditions present an immediate hazard to navigation, life, and property, the Coast Guard deems
it to be in the public's best interest to issue a regulation now. 



Background and Purpose



The situation requiring this regulation is high water in the Ohio River in the vicinity of Cincinnati, Ohio. The Ohio
River in the Cincinnati area is hazardous to transit under the best of conditions. To transit the area, mariners must
navigate through several sweeping turns and seven bridges. When the water level in the Ohio River reaches 45 feet,
on the Cincinnati gage, river currents increase and become very unpredictable, making it difficult for downbound
vessels to maintain steerageway. During hours of darkness the background lights of the city of Cincinnati hamper
mariners' ability to maintain sight of the front of their tow. The regulation is intended to protect the public and
the environment, at night during periods of high water, from a potential hazard of large downbound tows carrying hazardous
material through the regulated area. 



Regulatory Evaluation 



This regulation is not major under Executive Order 12291 and not significant under Department of Transportation
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979), it will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities, and it contains no collection of information requirements. 

The Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary.




Federalism Assessment 



Under the principles and criteria of Executive Order 12612, this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 



Environmental Assessment 



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation as an
action required to protect the public and the environment. 



List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 165



Harbors, Marine safety, Navigation (water), Records and recordkeeping requirements, Security measures, Vessels,
Waterways. 



Temporary Regulation 



In consideration of the foregoing, subpart C of part 165 of title 33, Code of Federal Regulations, is amended as follows:

Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Regional Centers Program 



<AGENCY>

 Department of Education.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Waiver of a rule.

 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department waives the rule at 34 CFR 75.261 in order to extend the project period under the Drug-Free Schools and
Communities Act (DFSCA) Regional Centers Program from 48 months to 60 months. This action will allow services under
this program to continue uninterrupted, and will result in the awarding of 12-month continuation awards to each of
the five existing grantees, using fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Regional Centers Program is authorized by sections 5111(a)(1) and 5135 of the DFSCA, which is part of the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). Appropriations for the Regional Centers Program were authorized through September
30, 1993 by the DFSCA. Section 414 of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA) authorizes an automatic extension
of the DFSCA through FY 1994 (September 30, 1994). The Congress is considering reauthorization of the DFSCA, but final
action on the reauthorization is not expected until late in FY 1994. 



In FY 1990, the Department awarded cooperative agreements for five Regional Centers to provide training and technical
assistance services in drug education and prevention to State educational agencies, local educational agencies,
and institutions of higher education. The centers were each given a project period of 48 months, based on the project
period announced in the Friday, September 15, 1989 

Federal Register

. Since FY 1990, these centers have been maintained through continuation awards in three subsequent fiscal years
(FY 1991, FY 1992, and FY 1993). Each center has received approximately $3 million per year. 

Based on the automatic extension authorized under section 414 of GEPA, projects authorized under sections 5111(a)(1)
and 5135 of the DFSCA can be funded in FY 1994 as well. Any funding after FY 1994 would be dependent on future Congressional
action with no guarantee that projects funded under the current authorization could be supported. 

If a new competition under the existing legislation were held in FY 1994, the projects could only be funded for a limited
project period of 12 months. In the past, it has taken new centers up to a year to ``start up,'' given the scope and complexity
of the services they provide and the time it takes to hire qualified staff and develop plans and relationships that
are responsive to clients in their regions. The Assistant Secretary believes that starting new centers in FY 1994
for only 12 months would severely disrupt the quality and level of center services. Holding a competition in FY 1994
would impose considerable costs at the Federal level without a guarantee that the new centers would be able to provide
the technical assistance necessary to school districts, as the Department moves to implement Goals 2000 and the new
ESEA. 

Therefore, the Assistant Secretary, in the best interests of the Federal Government, extends the current projects
for one additional year with the Federal Government bearing the cost. This action is consistent with the President's
mandate to implement cost-effective, cost-saving initiatives. In order to make these cost extensions, the Assistant
Secretary waives the rule at 34 CFR 75.261, which permits extensions of projects only at no cost to the Federal Government.
In consideration of the foregoing, the Assistant Secretary waives 34 CFR 75.261 as applied to the DFSCA Regional Centers
Program during FY 1994. 

On January 18, 1994 the Assistant Secretary published a notice proposing this waiver in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 2549). 



Public Comment 



In the notice, the Assistant Secretary invited comments on the proposed waiver. Seven parties submitted comments
and all supported the proposal to waive the rule and extend the current project period for one additional year. The
Assistant Secretary has made no changes in the waiver since publication of the proposed notice. 



Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 



This waiver has been examined under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and has been found to contain no information
collection requirements. 



Intergovernmental Review 



This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR Part 79. The objective
of the Executive order is to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened federalism by relying on
processes developed by State and local governments for coordination and review of proposed Federal financial assistance.
In accordance with this order, this document is intended to provide early notification of the Department's specific
plans and actions for this program. 



Assessment of Educational Impact 



In the notice proposing this waiver, the Assistant Secretary requested comments on whether the proposed waiver would
require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of
the United States. Based upon the response to the proposed waiver and on its own review, the Department has determined
that this waiver does not require information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority
of the United States.

Preparation Requirements for Letter-Size ZIP+4 and Barcoded Rate Mailings; Correction



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Postal Service.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Correction to final regulations.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document contains corrections to the final regulations which were published March 14, 1994 (59 FR 11886). The
regulations related to requirements for the preparation of the residual portion of letter-size automation rate
mailings.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On March 14, 1994, the Postal Service published a final rule (59 FR 11886-11896) that revised, effective May
8, 1994, the standards for preparing the residual portion of second- and third-class letter-size automation rate
mailings. This rule also eliminated an existing option for preparing the residual portion of First-Class letter-size
automation rate mailings and replaced it with the new options that will be required for second- and third-class letter-size
automation rate mailings. This rule also made tray labeling changes for the qualifying portion of letter-size automation
rate mailings to accommodate one of the new residual preparation methods. It contained a notice under Supplementary
Information that a tray label change was made to AADC trays prepared under DMM M815 to make them consistent with other
trays; however that actual rule change was inadvertently omitted.



Since publishing this final rule, the Postal Service has received comments that the May 8 effective date did not allow
adequate time for the process of developing presort software changes, testing and correcting them, distributing
them to users, and allowing users time to install and test them. Other commenters have requested that they be able to
use the software as soon as they have it ready even if this is before the mandatory compliance date. Accordingly, to
accommodate software vendors and mailers that need additional time to implement these new requirements properly,
the Postal Service is changing the effective date of the final rule to June 12, 1994. Those mailers who wish to begin
preparing mailings in accordance with the provisions of the final rule before such preparation becomes required
on June 12, 1994, may do so, at their option, as soon as they are able.

Since publishing the March 14, 1994, final rule, the Postal Service also received a comment that although the supplementary
information indicated under Labeling Changes that ``The AADC tray label for two-tier package-based preparation
under DMM M815 is revised to change the position of the term LTRS on the second line so that it is consistent with other
tray labels,'' this change was not set forth in the rule changes. Accordingly, the appropriate change to DMM M815 is
set forth in this rule.

In view of the considerations discussed above, the Postal Service hereby adopts the following amendments to the Domestic
Mail Manual, which is incorporated by reference in the Code of Federal Regulations (see 39 CFR 111.1).

SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to subsection (k) of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k), EPA hereby amends its regulations
at 40 CFR part 16 to exempt a system of records from compliance with certain subsections of the Act. The EPA-30
system of records, which was previously published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 12, 1992 (57 FR 36092), is called ``OIG Hotline Allegation System_EPA/OIG'' and is maintained by the EPA
Office of Inspector General (OIG). This amendment is made to maintain the efficiency and integrity of OIG investigations,
audits, or referrals that result from complaints concerning the possible existence of activities constituting
a violation of law, rules, or regulations, mismanagement, gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, or a substantial
and specific danger to the public health or safety. 


EPA published the proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 on November 22, 1993 (58 FR 61638) for a 30-day comment period. No comments were received from the public. This final
rule is identical to the proposed rule.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On July 2, 1986, EPA's final rule exempting several systems of records from compliance with certain subsections of
the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, was published in the 

Federal Register

 (51 FR 24145). EPA claimed a specific exemption for four systems of records under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2).
The exempted systems of records are identified at 51 FR 24146 and 24148 and are codified at 40 CFR 16.14(a)(1). 


EPA is adding a system of records to those systems of records for which a specific exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2)
has already been claimed. The EPA-30 system of records is called ``OIG Hotline Allegation System_EPA/OIG.''
A notice describing that system of records was published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 12, 1992 (57 FR 36092). 
Under the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, 
5 U.S.C. app., EPA's Inspector General has the duty to recommend policies for and to conduct, supervise, and coordinate
activities in EPA and between EPA and other Federal, State, and local governmental agencies with respect to: (1) The
prevention and detection of fraud in programs and operations administered or financed by EPA, and (2) the identification
and prosecution of participants in such fraud. In addition, whenever the Inspector General has reasonable grounds
to believe there has been a violation of Federal criminal law, the Inspector General must report the matter expeditiously
to the Attorney General. 
The OIG Hotline Allegation System, which is operated and maintained by the OIG, Office of Management, Program Management
Division, contains complaints and allegations received from employees of EPA, employees of other Federal agencies,
employees of State and local agencies, and private citizens concerning the possible existence of fraud relating
to Agency programs and operations. The system has been created in major part to support the criminal law enforcement
activities assigned by the Inspector General to the Assistant Inspector General for Investigations. 
In addition to its principal function pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws, the OIG Hotline Allegation
System contains complaints and allegations received from various sources concerning the possible existence of
activities constituting a noncriminal violation of law, rules, or regulations, mismanagement, gross waste of funds,
abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to the public health or safety. Such complaints and allegations
are referred to investigators or auditors in the OIG, to other components of EPA, or to other Federal, State, or local
governmental agencies, as appropriate. 
Under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the head of any agency may promulgate rules to exempt a system of records from certain subsections
of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, if the system of records contains investigatory material compiled for law enforcement
purposes, other than material within the scope of 
5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), subject to certain restrictions. 
Accordingly, EPA is promulgating this rule to exempt the EPA-30 system of records to the extent that the system
of records contains investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, other than material within the
scope of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), from the following subsections of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, as permitted by
5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2): 
5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I), and (f). 
Reasons for exemptions: EPA is exempting this system of records from the above requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974,
as amended, to accomplish the law enforcement functions of the OIG (

e.g.

, to prevent subjects of investigations from frustrating the investigatory process by discovering the scope and
progress of an investigation; to prevent the disclosure of investigative techniques; to fulfill commitments made
to protect confidentiality of sources; to maintain access to sources of information; and to avoid endangering these
sources and law enforcement personnel). Additional reasons for exempting this system of records are set forth in
EPA's final rule pertaining to Privacy Act exemptions published in the 

Federal Register

 of July 2, 1986 (51 FR 24145).

<TEXT>
 

EPA is making this final rule effective upon publication in the 

Federal Register

 to ensure that sensitive information in the EPA-30 system of records is immediately exempt from disclosure
so that the OIG can accomplish the law enforcement functions described above. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3),
EPA believes this reason constitutes the required ``good cause'' to make the rule effective immediately. 



Executive Order 12866 



Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of
the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule
that may: 

(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; 

(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 

(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or

(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order.

EPA has determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866.
OMB received a copy of the proposed rule during the public comment period and provided no comments to EPA.



Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not constitute an information collection request within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

 Therefore, this rule is not subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



Section 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 604(a), requires EPA to prepare a final regulatory flexibility
analysis in connection with any rulemaking for which EPA must publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking. The
required regulatory flexibility analysis must contain a statement of the need for the rule, a summary of the issues
raised by public comments, and a description of alternatives considered. 

Section 605(b) of the Act, however, provides that section 604 of the Act ``shall not apply to any proposed or final rule
if the head of the agency certifies that the rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities.'' Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), EPA certifies
that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule, which
exempts the OIG Hotline Allegation System from certain subsections of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, will have
no economic impact on any businesses, large or small.

Pentachloronitrobenzene; Revocation of Tolerance 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document revokes the interim tolerance for residues of the fungicide pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) in or
on bananas (40 CFR 180.319). EPA is taking this action because there is no registered use for PCNB on bananas, and this
use is not being supported for reregistration.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

: In the 

Federal Register

 of September 22, 1993 (58 FR 49264), EPA issued a proposal to revoke the interim tolerances established under section
408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a, for residues of the fungicide pentachloronitrobenzene
in or on bananas as listed in 40 CFR 180.319. 


EPA established an interim tolerance for PCNB for use on bananas pending the establishment of a permanent tolerance.
However, EPA cannot establish a permanent tolerance for various reasons and as a result is revoking the interim tolerance
in 40 CFR 180.319 for residues of pentachloronitrobenzene in bananas. The establishment of a tolerance under section
408 of FFDCA requires a finding that the tolerance will protect the public health. EPA does not have adequate data to
make such a finding, and does not expect to receive such data because the use of PCNB on bananas is not being supported
for reregistration. Further, there is no registered use of PCNB on bananas, and there is no evidence that it has been
registered for this use in the U.S. for many years. A tolerance is generally not necessary for a pesticide which is not
registered for the particular food use. 
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.
The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule.
Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the revocation of the interim tolerance for
bananas in 40 CFR 180.319 is appropriate and that it will protect the public health. Therefore, the revocation is established
as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation revoking the interim tolerance may, within 30 days after publication
of this document in the 

Federal Register

, file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement
of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary
of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator
determines that the material submitted shows the following: there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there
is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve
one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary;
and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action
requested (40 CFR 178.32).


Executive Order 12866


Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order, i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis,
review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those
actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) planned by
another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs;
or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.

Pesticide Tolerance for Aluminum Tris (O-Ethylphosphonate)



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document establishes a tolerance for residues of the fungicide fosetyl-Al, aluminum tris(

O

-ethylphosphonate), in or on dried hops at 45 parts per million (ppm). This regulation to establish the maximum permissible
level of residue of the fungicide in or on the commodity was requested in a petition submitted by Rhone-Poulenc Ag Co.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of February 9, 1994 (59 FR 5972), EPA issued a proposed rule that pursuant to petitions by Rhone-Poulenc Ag Co., P.O.
Box 12014, 2 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, EPA proposed to establish under sections 408
and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346a and 348) a tolerance for residues of the fungicide
fosetyl-Al, aluminum tris(

O

-ethylphosphonate), in or on dried hops at 45 ppm. 


One comment from the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany was received in response to the proposed rule to establish
a tolerance of 45 ppm for fosetyl-Al in dried hops. The German Embassy strongly supports the reclassification of dried
hops as a raw agricultural commodity. They also support establishing a tolerance for fosetyl-Al in dried hops at 45
ppm. However, the Embassy states that a maximum tolerance of 100 ppm in dried hops is appropriate based on residue data
available from the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, and Germany. The commenter also stated, however, that support
for a higher tolerance should not delay issuance of the 45-ppm tolerance as proposed.
No Codex, Canadian, or Mexican tolerances have been established for fosetyl-Al in dried hops. The 45-ppm level is
based on residue studies submitted by Rhone-Poulenc Ag Co. that were conducted in the United States and represent
U.S. hop-growing practices and U.S. techniques for control of plant diseases. EPA will establish the maximum tolerance
for fosetyl-Al residues at 45 ppm based on this U.S. data. However, any interested party, including the German Embassy,
may petition the Agency to increase this tolerance. After review of supporting data, if the tolerance protects the
public health, EPA would establish the higher tolerance, if appropriate. 

There were no requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

The data submitted relevant to the proposal and other related material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance will protect the public
health. Therefore, the tolerance is established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Phosphorylated Oxoheteromonocycle Polyoxyethylene Alkyl Ether; Phosphorylated Caprolactone, Alkyl Oxoheteromonocycle
and Polyalkylene Polyol Alkyl Ether; Revocation of Significant New Use Rule 
 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is revoking a significant new use rule (SNUR) promulgated under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control
Act (TSCA) for phosphorylated oxoheteromonocycle polyoxyethylene alkyl ether and phosphorylated caprolactone,
alkyl oxoheteromonocycle and polyalkene polyol alkyl ether, based on receipt of new data. The data indicate that
the substances will not present an unreasonable risk to health. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of August 9, 1990 (55 FR 32406), EPA issued two SNURs establishing significant new uses for phosphorylated oxoheteromonocycle
polyoxyethylene alkyl ether (P-89-836) and phosphorylated caprolactone, alkyl oxoheteromonocycle
and polyalkylene polyol alkyl ether (P-89-837). Because of additional data EPA has received for these
substances, EPA is revoking the SNUR. 


I. Background 


The Agency proposed the revocation of the SNUR for these substances in the 

Federal Register

 of September 29, 1993 (58 FR 50895). The background and reasons for the revocation of the SNURs are set forth in the preamble
to the proposed revocation. The Agency received no public comment concerning the proposed revocation. As a result
EPA is revoking the SNUR. 


II. Background and Rationale for Revocation of the Rule 


During review of the PMNs submitted for the chemical substances that are the subject of this revocation, EPA concluded
that regulation was warranted under section 5(e) of TSCA pending the development of information sufficient to make
a reasoned evaluation of the health effects of the substances, and EPA identified the tests considered necessary
to evaluate the risks of the substances. The basis for such findings is referenced in Unit I. of this preamble. Based
on these findings, a section 5(e) consent order was negotiated with the PMN submitter and a SNUR was promulgated. EPA
reviewed testing conducted by the PMN submitter for the substances and determined that the information available
was sufficient to make a reasoned evaluation of the health effects of the substances. EPA concluded that, for the purposes
of TSCA section 5, the substances will not present an unreasonable risk and subsequently revoked the section 5(e)
consent order. The revocation of SNUR provisions for the substances designated herein is consistent with the revocation
of the section 5(e) order. In light of the above, EPA is revoking SNUR provisions for these chemical substances. When
this revocation becomes final, EPA will no longer require notice of any company's intent to manufacture, import,
or process these substances. In addition, export notification under section 12(b) of TSCA will no longer be required.



III. Rulemaking Record 


The record for the rules which EPA is revoking was established at OPPTS-50583 (P-89-836 and P-89-837).
This record includes information considered by the Agency in developing these rules and includes the test data that
formed the basis for this revocation.



IV. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 


EPA is revoking the requirements of this rule. Any costs or burdens associated with this rule will also be eliminated
when the rule is revoked. Therefore, EPA finds that no costs or burdens must be assessed under Executive Order 12866,
the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), or the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

).

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of August 13, 1991 (56 FR 40204), EPA issued a SNUR establishing significant new uses for hydrogenated arylated polydecene
(P-90-1454). Because of additional data EPA has received for this substance, EPA is revoking this SNUR.



I. Background 


The Agency proposed the revocation of the SNUR for this substance in the 

Federal Register

 of September 22, 1993 (58 FR 49271). The background and reasons for the revocation of the SNUR are set forth in the preamble
to the proposed revocation. The Agency received no public comment concerning the proposed revocation. As a result
EPA is revoking this SNUR. 


II. Rationale for Revocation of the Rule 


During review of the PMN submitted for the chemical substance that is the subject of this revocation, EPA concluded
that regulation was warranted under section 5(e) of TSCA pending the development of information sufficient to make
a reasoned evaluation of the health effects of the substance, and EPA identified the tests considered necessary to
make a reasoned evaluation of the risks posed by the substance to human health. The basis for such findings is referenced
in Unit I. of this preamble. Based on these findings, a section 5(e) consent order was negotiated with the PMN submitter
and a SNUR was promulgated. EPA reviewed testing conducted by the PMN submitter for the substance and determined that
the information available was sufficient to make a reasoned evaluation of the health effects of the substance. EPA
concluded that, for the purposes of TSCA section 5, the substance will not present an unreasonable risk and subsequently
revoked the section 5(e) consent order. The revocation of SNUR provisions for the substance designated herein is
consistent with the revocation of the section 5(e) order. In light of the above, EPA is revoking SNUR provisions for
this chemical substance. When this revocation becomes final, EPA will no longer require notice of any company's intent
to manufacture, import, or process this substance. In addition, export notification under section 12(b) of TSCA
will no longer be required. 


III. Rulemaking Record 

The record for the rule which EPA is revoking was established at OPPTS-50592 (P-90-1454). This record
includes information considered by the Agency in developing this rule and includes the test data that formed the basis
for this rule.



IV. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 


EPA is revoking the requirements of this rule. Any costs or burdens associated with this rule will also be eliminated
when the rule is revoked. Therefore, EPA finds that no costs or burdens must be assessed under Executive Order 12866,

Benzenepropanoic Acid, 3-(2

H

-Benzotriazol-2-yl)-5-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxy-, C(7-9)-Branched and Linear Alkyl Esters; Revocation
of a Significant New Use Rule 

 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is revoking a significant new use rule (SNUR) promulgated under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control
Act (TSCA) for benzenepropanoic acid, 3-(2

H

-benzotriazol-2-yl)-5-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxy-, C(7-9)-branched and linear alkyl esters based on receipt
of new data. The data indicate that the substance will not present an unreasonable risk to health. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of August 13, 1991 (56 FR 40204), EPA issued a SNUR establishing significant new uses for benzenepropanoic acid, 3-(2

H

-benzotriazol-2-yl)-5-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4 -hydroxy-, C(7-9)-branched and linear alkyl esters (P-90-1635).
Because of additional data EPA has received for this substance, EPA is revoking this SNUR. 


I. Background 


The Agency proposed the revocation of the SNUR for this substance in the 

Federal Register

 of September 29, 1993 (58 FR 50896). The background and reasons for the revocation of the SNUR are set forth in the preamble
to the proposed revocation. The Agency received no public comment concerning the proposed revocation. As a result
EPA is revoking this SNUR. 


II. Rationale for Revocation of the Rule 


During review of the PMN submitted for the chemical substance that is the subject of this revocation, EPA concluded
that regulation was warranted under section 5(e) of TSCA pending the development of information sufficient to make
a reasoned evaluation of the health effects of the substance, and EPA identified the tests considered necessary to
evaluate the risks of the substance. The basis for such findings is referenced in Unit I. of this preamble. Based on
these findings, a section 5(e) consent order was negotiated with the PMN submitter and a SNUR was promulgated. 
EPA reviewed testing conducted by the PMN submitter for the substance and determined that the information available
was sufficient to make a reasoned evaluation of the health effects of the substance. EPA concluded that, for the purposes
of TSCA section 5, the substance will not present an unreasonable risk and subsequently revoked the section 5(e) consent
order. The revocation of SNUR provisions for this substance designated herein is consistent with the revocation
of the section 5(e) order. In light of the above, EPA is revoking SNUR provisions for this chemical substance. When
this revocation becomes final, EPA will no longer require notice of any company's intent to manufacture, import,
or process this substance. In addition, export notification under section 12(b) of TSCA will no longer be required.



III. Rulemaking Record 


The record for the rule which EPA is revoking was established at OPPTS-50592 (P-90-1635). This record
includes information considered by the Agency in developing this rule and includes the test data that formed the basis
for this revocation.



IV. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 


EPA is revoking the requirements of this rule. Any costs or burdens associated with this rule will also be eliminated
when the rule is revoked. Therefore, EPA finds that no costs or burdens must be assessed under Executive Order 12866,
the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), or the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues this final rule to allocate annually the U.S. Pacific whiting harvest guideline or quota, in 1994 through
1996, between fishing vessels that either catch and process at sea or catch and deliver to at-sea processors, and fishing
vessels that deliver to processors located on shore. In each of the 
3 years, after 60 percent of the annual harvest guideline (or quota) for whiting is taken, further at-sea processing
in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) will be prohibited. The remaining 40 percent (104,000 metric tons (mt) in 1994)
will be reserved initially for fishing vessels that deliver to shore-based processors. On or about August 15, any
amount of the harvest guideline (including any part of the 40 percent initially held in reserve) that is determined
by the Director, Northwest Region, NMFS, not to be needed by the shoreside sector during the remainder of the year will
be made available to the at-sea processing sector. This action is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the
Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) by equitably sharing the harvest guideline between shore-based
and at-sea processors, by contributing to the economies of coastal communities by providing reasonable opportunity
for shoreside processing of the whiting harvest guideline, and by promoting stability in the West Coast fishing industry
by diverting effort from other fully utilized fisheries. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 NMFS issues this final rule to implement a recommendation from the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council)
for a 3-year framework to allocate the annual Pacific whiting harvest guideline or quota between the shoreside and
at-sea industry sectors. The background, problem, and Council recommendation were fully described in the notice
of proposed rulemaking for this action (58 FR 8896, February 24, 1994). Public comments were requested through March
21, 1994. Eleven letters were received and are addressed later in the preamble to this final rule. The comments resulted
in no change to the regulatory text of the proposed rule. 


In summary, the problems the Council identified and is seeking to solve are: Too much fishing and processing capacity
and not enough fish, inequitable distribution of economic benefits among the competing sectors, and regulatory
instability that has prevented the industry from making timely business decisions. 
To resolve these problems, the Council identified the following priorities: (1) Ensure that the shore-based sector
has reasonable opportunity to participate; (2) foster stability of the shore-based processing sector by providing
replacement revenues for other faltering fisheries; (3) help stabilize faltering rural coastal economies by providing
fishing, processing, and supporting industry revenues to replace income declines in other industries; (4) achieve
maximum net benefit to the Nation by putting economic benefits directly into coastal communities and distributing
income impacts/benefits along traditional geographic paths; (5) spread the fishery over time and area, reducing
potential pulse fishery impacts on whiting, salmon, and rockfish stocks; (6) prevent effort shift to other species;
(7) address management of the entire groundfish resource rather than piecemeal; (8) contribute to increased long-term
product yield and employment opportunities by spreading harvest over a longer season; and (9) discourage additional
capital investment in harvesting or processing facilities. 
The Council convened an ad hoc industry subcommittee in July 1993 in Portland, Oregon, to develop an allocation option
that would be acceptable to all sectors. The subcommittee included a representative from each major sector in the
whiting industry: Catcher vessels delivering at-sea, shoreside, and ``at-large''; shoreside processors; catcher/processors;
and mothership processors. The ad hoc committee, after considering a number of alternatives, successfully negotiated
a 3-year agreement that was acceptable to all participants, and subsequently was adopted by the Council and recommended
to NMFS.

The Council recommended that the first 60 percent of the annual whiting harvest guideline be available to all vessels
in open competition with the remaining 40 percent reserved initially for shore-based activities. The Council recommended
that after 60 percent has been harvested, no further at-sea processing be allowed for the remainder of the year or until
August 15, when an additional portion of the harvest guideline would be made available pursuant to a NMFS assessment
of how much of the harvest guideline will be utilized by shore-based processors during the remainder of the year. Any
surplus to shore-based needs would be made available to all permitted vessels on or as soon as practicable after August
15. The Council recommended that the allocation scheme remain in effect for 3 years, 1994-1996. Any Pacific
whiting harvested or processed in state ocean waters (0-3 nautical miles offshore) will be counted toward the
EEZ limits.



Additional Releases


In the preamble to the proposed rule, comments were requested regarding the advisability of a second release of whiting
after August 15 if necessary to ensure full utilization of the resource. The only comments relevant to the release
date preferred a single release on October 15 rather than August 15 (see comment 6 below). A single release has been
preferred by the industry in the past because of the confusion and logistical difficulties associated with multiple
openings. NMFS agrees with the industry in preferring a single release, but recognizes that making accurate projections
of shore-based needs is difficult. If it becomes obvious, after August 15, that shore-based needs have been substantially
over-estimated, NMFS may release whiting at a later date, but only after consultation with the Council and only to
ensure full utilization of the resource. The regulatory text at  663.23(b)(4)(ii), which authorizes the release
of whiting as soon as practicable after August 15, has been revised to authorize additional reserve releases.



Comments and Responses


The comments in 11 letters received during the public comment period ending March 21, 1994, are summarized below.
Three letters opposed all or part of the proposed rule, and eight supported it.



Comments Opposing the Proposed Rule





Comment 1: 

The allocation is not equitable_the benefits and burdens must be shared fairly. The shoreside reserve of 40 percent
(104,000 mt in 1994) is too high, particularly since the shore-based industry has processed only about half this amount
in its highest year. One commenter preferred a shoreside reserve of 35 percent. Another preferred allocations to
be based on actual, demonstrated performance.



Response:

 The Council's recommendation is a negotiated compromise that enables two sectors with differing operating needs
to co-exist. The Council's industry subcommittee agreed to the use of a percentage allocation that benefits each
sector when the harvest guideline is high and burdens each sector when it is low. In the preamble to the proposed rule,
NMFS agreed that the benefit of an increased harvest guideline, as occurs in 1994, should be equitably shared between
the at-sea and shore-based sectors, particularly since it is not expected to result in increased capitalization
of either sector. The relatively high harvest guideline in 1994 results in the shore-based reserve for that year being
higher than previous catch levels. If the entire reserve is not needed by the shoreside sector, the surplus will be
released, increasing the amount available for processing at sea.

The percentage level of the shoreside reserve was debated at great length within the industry subcommittee. A 35-percent
level was considered, but was not supported by the subcommittee. NMFS believes the 40-percent level recommended
by the Council is reasonable.



Comment 2:

 The proposed rule fails to consider that, in the past, shoreside performance has fallen short of its preseason processing
estimates.



Response:

 This final rule sets the shore-based reserve at 40 percent, and is not dependent on an annual preseason processing
estimate. Whiting surplus to shoreside needs will be made available for at-sea processing to assure that the resource
is fully utilized. If the harvest guideline declines, the shoreside reserve may be more in line with past performance
levels.

<TEXT>
 



Comment 3: 

The statement in the preamble to the proposed rule that each sector has the capacity to take a substantial portion,
if not all, of the harvest guideline is inconsistent with the statement in the preamble to the proposed rule that the
shore-based sector will have the opportunity to take more than double its historical catch. 



Response: 

The statements in the proposed rule preamble are not inconsistent. They acknowledge that the historical shoreside
catch has not reached what is believed to be existing shoreside capacity. As explained in the response to comment 1,
the 1994 shoreside reserve is higher than past performance in part due to the large increase in the whiting harvest
guideline and the application of a fixed percentage to that harvest guideline. 



Comment 4: 

The analysis accompanying the rule assumes that the at-sea fleet is not a participant in the fishery. 



Response: 

NMFS disagrees. The EA/RIR contains substantial information regarding recent operations by the at-sea processing
fleet. However, the level of participation by that fleet under the limited entry program, which was implemented on
January 1, 1994, and under various allocation options, still is not known with certainty. The limited entry fishery
established a window period and certain requirements that must be met for a vessel to receive an initial limited entry
permit. Most, if not all, catcher/processors did not meet the qualifications. They are treated the same as other non-qualifying
vessels that operated in the groundfish fishery after the window period. The number and types of vessels that would
attempt to acquire limited entry permits were unknown at the time the analytical documents were prepared. However,
reasonable assumptions were made and catcher/processor participation was considered. 



Comment 5: 

The commenter disagreed with the statement that ``the Council is concerned about the impacts on traditional fishermen
and the rural coastal communities where they reside, focusing on those displaced by Americanization of joint venture
fisheries.'' 



Response: 

This statement in the proposed rule reflects the Council's position as it appears in the EA/RIR. NMFS acknowledges
that Americanization of the whiting fishery, as contemplated under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management
Act (Magnuson Act), provided additional employment in the domestic processing sector. It also resulted in displacement
of those whiting catcher vessels that had delivered to foreign processing vessels but could not find alternative
domestic markets. 



Comment 6:

 Two commenters, one representing the majority of at-sea processing vessels, stated that any release of surplus shoreside
reserve should not be made until October 15, after the end of the pollock ``B'' season in Alaska. 



Response: 

NMFS has not changed the August 15 release date that was part of the negotiated agreement by the industry subcommittee
and recommended by the Council. This date was selected because it provided an equal opportunity for participation
by vessels in the at-sea processing fleet, particularly smaller catcher vessels delivering to motherships, to operate
before weather deteriorates or whiting migrate north to Canadian waters. A later release could disproportionately
benefit catcher/processors that are larger and more capable of fishing successfully in rough weather. With an August
15 release, both mothership and catcher/processor operations would have an opportunity to participate, but may
have to choose between the pollock ``B'' season or the whiting fishery. With some vessels choosing to fish in Alaska,
effort in the whiting fishery in August would be lower than in the spring, which, given the lower amount of whiting that
may be available, would support an orderly fishery. 



Comments Supporting the Proposed Rule: 

Eight letters from the shore-based fishing and processing sector were received in favor of the proposed rule. The
letters supported the negotiated agreement that recognizes the differences in shore-based and at-sea operations,
allows each sector to operate at its maximum efficiency levels, and provides increased stability to coastal communities
and the fishing industry. A comment also was received from an organization representing at-sea processors that supported
the 
40-percent reserve for the shore-based sector. However, as summarized above, this organization did not agree with
the release date or with some of the statements in the proposed rule. 



Response: 

None required. 



Clarification 



This final rule also revises an incorrect cross-reference at 
 663.7, which should read  663.23(b)(4)(iv). This revision was stated correctly in the regulatory text
of the proposed rule, but incorrectly in the preamble. 



Classification 



This final rule has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of Executive Order 12866. 

This final rule is published under the authority of the Magnuson Act, 16 U.S.C. 1801 

et seq

. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), has determined that it is necessary for management of the
Pacific Coast groundfish fishery and that it is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law.

The AA finds good cause under section 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act to make this rule effective upon
filing at the Office of the Federal Register. If this rule is not effective on April 15, 1994, the date that the at-sea
processing fleet may begin operations, or shortly thereafter, preemption of the shoreside processing sector by
the at-sea sector would be a real possibility. Therefore, delaying the effective date of this rule for 30 days is contrary
to the public interest.

Pacific whiting_allocation. 

The following provisions apply 1994 through 1996_

(i) 

The shoreside reserve. 

When 60 percent of the annual harvest guideline for Pacific whiting has been or is projected to be taken, further at-sea
processing of Pacific whiting will be prohibited pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section. The remaining
40 percent of the harvest guideline is reserved for harvest by vessels delivering to shoreside processors. 

(ii) 

Release of the reserve. 

That portion of the annual harvest guideline that the Regional Director determines will not be used by shoreside processors
by the end of that fishing year shall be made available for harvest by all fishing vessels, regardless of where they
deliver, on August 15 or as soon as practicable thereafter. NMFS may again release whiting at a later date if it becomes
obvious, after August 15, that shore-based needs have been substantially over-estimated, but only after consultation
with the Council and only to insure full utilization of the resource. 

(iii) 

Estimates. 

Estimates of the amount of Pacific whiting harvested will be based on actual amounts harvested, projections of amounts
that will be harvested, or a combination of the two. Estimates of the amount of Pacific whiting that will be used by shoreside
processors by the end of the fishing year will be based on the best information available to the Regional Director from
state catch and landings data, the survey of domestic processing capacity and intent, testimony received at Council
meetings, and/or other relevant information. 

(iv) 

Announcements. 

The Assistant Administrator will announce in the 

Federal Register

 when 60 percent of the Pacific whiting harvest guideline has been, or is about to be, harvested, specifying a time after
which further at-sea processing of Pacific whiting in the fishery management area is prohibited. The Assistant Administrator
will announce in the 

Federal Register

 any release of the reserve. In order to prevent exceeding the limits or underutilizing the resource, adjustments
may be made effective immediately by actual notice to fishermen and processors, by phone, fax, Northwest Region computerized
bulletin board (contact 206-526-6128), letter, press release, and/or U.S. Coast Guard Notice to Mariners
(monitor channel 16 VHF), followed by publication in the 

Federal Register

, in which instance public comment will be sought for a reasonable period of time thereafter. If insufficient time
exists to consult with the Council, the Regional Director will inform the Council in writing of actions taken.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Availability of Final Rule



Any person may obtain a copy of this final rule by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation Administration, Office
of Public Affairs (APA-200), 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20591, or by calling the Office of
Public Affairs at (202) 267-3484. Communications must identify the docket number of this amendment.



Background



The decision to amend the specific number of hours of instruction that holders of flight instructor certificates
must complete in an approved FIRC to renew their certificates originated from a petition for exemption submitted
by the AOPA. The AOPA petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for exemption from  61.197(c) of
the FAR to permit holders of flight instructor certificates to renew their certificates by attending an approved
FIRC of 16 hours of ground or flight instruction, or both, in lieu of the current 24 hours required by  61.197(e).
The AOPA fully described its rationale in its petition for exemption.

The FAA agreed with the AOPA's rationale in its petition for exemption. There is a need to streamline current FIRCs
to provide for a condensed weekend renewal program. The majority of certificated flight instructors maintain personal
or professional responsibilities such that weekend renewal is a needed option for the maintenance of their certificate.
The recent advances in instructional technology and training techniques more than compensate for a reduction in
classroom time requirements. The innovative and interactive educational programs, such as the AOPA's ``Trigger
Tapes'' and ``Operation Airspace'' facilitating learning at the application level, allow for a reduction in the
amount of hours that holders of flight instructor certificates must complete in an approved FIRC to renew their certificates
while maintaining the current level of safety.

The FAA determined, however, that rulemaking was necessary to permit holders of flight instructor certificates
to renew their certificates by attending an approved FIRC of fewer hours of ground or flight instruction, or both,
than the 24 hours currently required by the FAR. Therefore, the FAA decided that the appropriate response to the AOPA's
petition for exemption was to propose a change to the existing regulations. The FAA concluded that the current level
of safety would be maintained and was appropriate in light of the recent advances in instructional technology and
training techniques. In addition, the FAA determined that the option to specify the number of hours of instruction
through an FAA approval, as part of the approved renewal program, will offer substantial benefits to the aviation
community; specifically, it will eliminate the burden of the longer 24 hour course, mitigate the current decline
in instructional resources, and offer financial advantages to individual flight instructors. For example, approval
of AOPA's 16 hour course will allow a 1 day reduction in travel expenses to individual flight instructors saving an
average per diem cost of $100.

The AOPA petition for exemption was published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 17, 1993 (58 FR 14466). The FAA received two comments on the petition of which both comments voiced support.
After review of the petition and the submitted comments, the FAA concluded that while the petition had considerable
merit, the AOPA was not unique in its position. Therefore, on September 17, 1993, the FAA issued Notice No. 93-11
(58 FR 48748) that proposed to permit holders of flight instructor certificates to renew their certificates by completing
an approved number of hours of ground or flight instruction, or both, in an approved FIRC.



Discussion of Public Comments 



A. General



The FAA received 47 comments in response to Notice No. 93-11, mostly from certified flight instructors (CFI's).
The following organizations also submitted comments: Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA), AOPA Air Safety
Foundation, Arizona Pilots Association, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Gaits Aviation Seminars, Inc.,
Hoffman Pilot Center, Inc., Richmor Aviation, Skylanes, Inc., and Wisconsin Department of Transportation.

Thirty-three commenters, including the Arizona Pilots Association, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Gaits
Aviation Seminars, Inc., Skylanes, Inc., and the Wisconsin Department of Transportation support the proposal to
amend  61.197(c) of the FAR by permitting holders of flight instructor certificates to renew their certificates
by completing an approved number of hours of ground or flight instruction, or both, in an approved FIRC.

Three commenters, including the AOPA and the AOPA Air Safety Foundation, indicate that while they agree with the proposal
to amend the specific number of hours of instruction that holders of flight instructor certificates must complete
in an approved FIRC to renew their certificates, they believe that 16 hours should be the minimum number of hours in
an approved FIRC and that this minimum requirement should be written into the rule to avoid any misinterpretation.
The FAA has determined that instructional technology and training techniques will continue to change and develop
over time. Therefore, the FAA has concluded that the appropriate response is not to state the specific number of hours
in the rule, which may change over time, but to address the standards and recommended number of hours required for an
approved FIRC through an Advisory Circular that the FAA will develop to ensure that a high level of safety is maintained.


Hoffman Pilot Center, Inc. and one other commenter are opposed to reducing the number of hours currently required
in an approved FIRC. Hoffman believes that reducing the number of required hours in an approved FIRC to 16 hours is a
marketing ploy rather than an accurate accounting for the changing information in the aviation industry. The other
commenter believes the current 24-hour requirement is inadequate and that by going to a reduced number of hours in
an approved FIRC would only serve to make the entire FIRC class ``one large video program.'' The FAA has determined
that reducing the amount of hours that holders of flight instructor certificates must complete in an approved FIRC
to renew their certificates will not have an adverse effect on safety. The FAA has concluded that the recent advances
in instructional technology and training techniques allow for a reduction in the specific number of hours in an approved
FIRC while maintaining the current level of safety. 



B. Cost Impact 



One commenter feels that the FAA overestimated the value of flight instructor time; in the economic evaluation the
FAA assumed that a flight instructor earned approximately $20 per hour, the commenter believes it is more like $11
per hour. The FAA has determined that while some flight instructors earn $11 per hour, other flight instructors earn
$35 per hour. The FAA has concluded that on the average a flight instructor earns $20 per hour and that this is a reasonable
number. 



C. Recommendations 



Richmor Aviation and one other commenter agree with the proposal to allow for approval of the number of hours of instruction
that holders of flight instructor certificates must complete in an FAA approved FIRC to renew their certificate but
points out that a parallel provision in  141.79(c) also needs to be amended to be consistent with  61.197(c).
Section 141.79(c) requires each chief flight instructor in an approved FAA part 141 school, to complete at least once
each 12 months, a flight instructor refresher course consisting of not less than 24 hours of ground or flight instruction,
or both. While  141.79(c) deals with a school setting as opposed to  61.197(c), which deals with the individual,
the FAA has determined that it is a parallel provision with identical issues as those presented in Notice No. 93-11.
Therefore, to afford part 141 chief flight instructors the benefits given to part 61 flight instructors, the FAA will
make a conforming amendment to  141.79(c) that will be reflected in this final rule. The FAA has concluded that
under Section 4(a) of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 553(a), the notice and public comment requirements
of Section 553(b) of the APA are unnecessary.

D. Additional Comments



The FAA received two comments that requested revisions to the rule that are beyond the scope of the notice. One commenter
supports the proposal only if a flight check also is required for renewal of a flight instructor certificate because
requiring classroom time without a flight check does not ensure that the flight instructor can apply the knowledge
learned from the classroom. Another commenter is opposed to the proposal on the grounds that safety would be better
served if the flight instructor were required to demonstrate competency in an aircraft for renewal of the flight instructor
certificate, as opposed to classroom time.

One commenter requests that the word ``she'' be taken out of the amended rule language in  61.197(c), and one
commenter suggests that the FAA should form a task group to study technology advancements in education and their applicability
to the FIRC's. Both commenters agree with the proposal to allow for approval of the number of hours of instruction that
holders of flight instructor certificates must complete in an FAA approved FIRC to renew their certificate. 



International Civil Aviation Organization and Joint Aviation Regulations



The FAA has determined that a review of the Convention on International Civil Aviation Standards and Recommended
Practices is not warranted because flight instructor certification requirements have virtually no bearing on flight
operations internationally.



Paperwork Reduction Act 



This final rule will not change reporting requirements. Therefore, in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511), there are no additional requirements for information collection associated with
this final rule.



Economic Evaluation



This section contains the full regulatory evaluation prepared by the FAA that provides information on the economic
consequences of this regulatory action. This evaluation quantifies, to the extent practicable, estimates of the
costs and benefits to the private sector, consumers, and Federal, State, and local governments.

Executive Order 12866, dated September 30, 1993, directs Federal agencies to promulgate new regulations or modify
existing regulations only if benefits to society for each regulatory change outweigh potential costs. The order
also requires the preparation of an economic analysis of all ``significant regulatory actions'' except those responding
to emergency situations or other narrowly-defined exigencies.

The FAA has determined that this rule is not significant. Therefore, a full regulatory analysis that includes the
identification and evaluation of cost-reducing alternatives to the rule has not been prepared. Instead, the agency
has prepared a more concise regulatory evaluation that analyzes only this rule without identifying alternatives.
In addition to the regulatory evaluation, this section also contains a regulatory flexibility determination required
by the 1980 Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) and an international trade impact assessment. Accordingly, the FAA makes the following economic evaluation of
this rule. Based on the results of its investigation, the FAA has concluded that this final rule is cost-beneficial.

Benefit-Cost Analysis




Current holders of flight instructor certificates may renew their certificates if they successfully complete an
approved FIRC consisting of not less than 24 hours of ground or flight instruction, or both. The FAA has determined,
however, that recent advances in instructional technology and training techniques allow for a reduction in the number
of required instruction hours without compromising safety. The FAA will develop the standards and recommended number
of hours required for an approved FIRC. This will be done to ensure that a high level of safety is maintained.

The benefits of this rule are the cost savings from the reduction in required instructional hours and travel expenditures
for the affected flight instructors. For example, approval of AOPA's 16 hour course would allow a 1 day reduction in
travel expenses to individual flight instructors: assuming an average per diem cost of $100 and that two-thirds of
the annual average of 20,000 flight instructors renewing their certificates through FIRCs would have to travel out
of town, the industry could realize an annual savings of $1.3 million in per diem travel expenses. There also will be
a reduction in foregone earnings. Assuming a flight instructor earns $20 per hour and provides 4 to 8 hours of instruction
per day, the reduction in foregone earnings would be between $1.6 million and $3.2 million annually. In addition,
the FAA believes that individual flight instructors will realize a savings in the cost of the FIRC by the reduction
in the number of required instruction hours.

There will be no incremental costs associated with this final rule since the number of instruction hours required
in a FIRC would be relaxed. The FAA has concluded that there will be no degradation of safety as any reduction in instructional
hours would be the result of advances in instructional technology and training techniques. The FAA believes that
it is the content of the FIRC, not the specific number of hours of instruction in that FIRC, that is important to safety.
Therefore, the FAA has concluded that the final rule is cost-beneficial.



International Trade Impact Analysis



This final rule will have a negligible impact on trade opportunities for U.S. firms doing business overseas or on foreign
firms doing business in the U.S. The final rule primarily affects certificated flight instructors, not businesses
involved in the sale of aviation products or services.

Regulatory Flexibility Determination




The final rule will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on small entities. Flight instructors,
rather than small entities, will be affected by this final rule. Where a flight instructor is also the sole proprietor
of a small business, and exercises the privileges of his or her certificate in operations that are incidental to that
business, the final rule will have a negligible impact.



Federalism Impact




The regulations adopted herein will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this amendment does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Conclusion




For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination
and the International Trade Impact Analysis, the FAA has determined that this final rule is not significant under
Executive Order 12866. In addition, the FAA certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact,
positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act. This rule is not considered significant under Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). For this reason, it has been determined that the expected economic impact of this
amendment is so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation is not warranted.

 Notice of relief from regulatory provisions.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary of Education announces regulatory relief 
from specific regulations governing the Federal Perkins Loan, 
Federal Work-Study (FWS), Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Federal Family Education
Loan (FFEL), Federal Direct Student Loan, and Federal Pell Grant programs, for the 1993-94 and 1994-95
award years, to assist institutions and individuals who suffered financial harm from the California earthquake
of January 1994.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Many institutions of higher education, student financial aid applicants, and recipients have been adversely affected
by the earthquake in California. The President signed the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1994 (Pub.
L. 103-211) on February 12, 1994. The Act authorizes the Secretary to reallocate any excess funds under the Federal
Perkins Loan and the FWS programs from the 1993-94 award year to assist individuals who suffered financial harm
as a result of the California earthquake of January 1994. The Secretary has the authority to reallocate these funds
only to institutions for use in the 1994-95 award year. Institutions will be informed of the application procedures
for obtaining reallocated funds to assist California earthquake victims in a letter issued by the Department to financial
aid administrators.


The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1994, however, does not expressly authorize the reallocation
of funds returned under the FSEOG Program. The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), in section 413D permits
the Secretary, in accordance with regulations, to reallocate excess FSEOG funds returned by an institution to other
institutions. Under current FSEOG regulations (34 CFR 676.4), the Secretary reallocates funds on a 

pro rata 

basis, 

i.e., 

the amount of an institution's fair-share shortfall as a percentage of the fair-share shortfalls of all participating
institutions with an unmet FSEOG request. The Secretary has decided to promulgate standards to allow excess funds
under the FSEOG Program from the 1993-94 award year to be reallocated during the 1994-95 award year to assist
students adversely affected by the California earthquake. The funds will be reallocated to institutions that enroll
students adversely affected by the earthquake and submit applications in the format required by the Secretary. If
the total funds requested exceed the total funds available, the funds will then be reallocated on a 

pro rata 

basis only among these institutions to provide assistance to students whose financial need has increased as a result
of the 1994 California earthquake.
The Secretary recognizes the severe impact the earthquake has had on institutions and their students located in the
designated natural disaster areas. Many institutions and individuals adversely affected by the earthquake are
facing immediate problems concerning the disbursement and repayment of student loans.

The Title IV student financial aid programs affected by this notice are the FFEL Program (consisting of the Federal
Stafford Loan Program, the Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Program, the Federal PLUS Program, and
the Federal Consolidation Loan Program); the Federal Direct Student Loan Program; the Federal Pell Grant Program;
and the Federal Perkins Loan, FWS, and FSEOG programs (known collectively as the campus-based programs). To assist
both institutions and individuals, this notice also provides certain regulatory relief to institutions in their
administration of these student financial aid programs.
The Secretary has already provided certain regulatory relief to lenders and guaranty agencies in the FFEL Program
under section 432(a)(6) of the HEA and 34 CFR 682.406(b) and 682.413(f). The guaranty agency directors were informed
of this relief in a letter dated January 31, 1994.


Covered Individuals


This notice is intended to assist institutions and individuals that have been adversely affected by the California
earthquake of January 1994. This notice will apply to institutions that were unable to maintain normal operations
because they were located in Los Angeles, Orange, or Ventura Counties on the date on which the President declared the
existence of a major disaster. This notice of relief also applies only to individuals who suffered financial harm
from the disaster and, at the time the disaster occurred, were residing, attending an institution of higher education,
or employed in the counties designated as disaster areas (or, in the case of an individual who is a dependent student,
whose parent or stepparent suffered financial harm from such disaster and resided or was employed in such an area at
that time). This notice of regulatory relief will be applicable for awards made under the Title IV programs and collection
activities conducted under the Federal Perkins Loan Program during the 1993-94 and 1994-95 award years
(the periods from July 1, 1993 to June 30, 1994 and July 1, 1994 to June 30, 1995).





Note: 

For further updates to the list of designated disaster areas, institutions may contact the Department on its toll-free
number at 1-800-433-3243 between 9 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. Individuals
who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call 1-800-730-8913 between 9 a.m. and
5:30 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday.



The Secretary provides the following enforcement relief from the regulations governing the student financial aid
programs under Title IV of the HEA:


I. 34 CFR Part 668_Student Assistance General Provisions


A. 34 CFR 668.19 Financial Aid Transcript


Under current regulations, before a student who previously attended another eligible institution may receive any
Title IV, HEA program funds, the institution to which the student is transferring must make an effort to obtain the
student's financial aid transcript. The Secretary is waiving the requirement to obtain financial aid transcripts
before disbursing funds for individuals who attended institutions covered by this notice for the 1993-94 and
1994-95 award years. If the financial aid transcript is not available as a result of damage caused by the California
earthquake, the institution may disburse Title IV funds. Any institution affected by this situation must document
in the student's file that the financial aid transcript is unavailable due to damage stemming from the natural disaster.
In addition, the student will still be expected to provide statements concerning all prior financial aid received,
and the institution will be expected to retain this information in the student's file.


B. 34 CFR 668.51-668.61 Subpart E_Selection of Applicants for Verification


The Secretary is waiving verification requirements under 
34 CFR 668.51-668.61 during the 1993-94 and 1994-95 award years for those applicants who are selected
for verification and whose records were lost or destroyed because of the California earthquake. The institution
must document in the student's file that the records are unavailable due to damage stemming from the natural disaster.
For these students, Verification Status Code ``S'' may be used when reporting a Federal Pell Grant disbursement.


II. 34 CFR Part 690_Federal Pell Grant Program


34 CFR 690.83 Submission of Reports


The Secretary modifies the deadline in 34 CFR 690.83(a)(1)(i) that an institution submit all SAR Payment Vouchers
(or the equivalent) for an award year by September 30 following the end of the award year in which the grant is made. The
Secretary will extend this reporting date, on a ``case-by-case'' basis, for institutions affected by the California
earthquake.

III. 34 CFR Part 674 and 676_Federal Perkins Loan and FSEOG Programs 



A. Federal Perkins Loan Program 



1. 34 CFR 674.31 Promissory Note 



Under 34 CFR 674.31(b)(2), the terms of a student's promissory note require that repayment of a loan must begin six
(6) or nine (9) months after a borrower ceases to be at least a half-time regular student and that the repayment period
normally ends 10 years later. The Secretary is modifying this provision that specifies the commencement of a borrower's
repayment period to provide that any borrower who was in an ``in-school'' status at the time the natural disaster occurred
and was unable to complete course requirements or enroll in classes due to the earthquake will continue to be in an ``in-school''
status until such time as the borrower withdraws or until the end of the 1993-94 award year, whichever is earlier.
The institution must document this reason for continued ``in-school'' status in the student's file. 



2. 34 CFR 674.42 Contact With the Borrower 



The Secretary will not require an institution to comply with the provisions of  674.42(b) that require an institution
to make contact with the borrower during an initial or postdeferment grace period if that grace period coincides with
the California earthquake. These requirements shall be suspended for a period of time not to exceed the earlier of
either the date on which the institution is able to resume normal contact with the borrower or June 30, 1994. An institution
must document the reason for suspension of these activities in the borrower's file. 



3. 34 CFR 674.41-674.50 Subpart C_Due Diligence 



The Secretary will not enforce 34 CFR part 674, subpart C_Due Diligence. An institution may suspend the collection
activities for borrowers already in default at the time of the natural disaster. These requirements shall resume
on July 1, 1994. An institution must document the reason for suspension of these activities in the borrower's file.




4. 34 CFR 674.34-674.37 Deferment of Repayment 



The Secretary modifies the provisions for hardship deferment in 34 CFR 674.34(i), 674.35(e), and 674.36(e) and authorizes
an institution to grant an administrative hardship deferment to a borrower who is in repayment at the time of the natural
disaster but who is unable to continue to repay the loan due to the disaster. Interest will accrue during any period
of administrative hardship deferment. 34 CFR 674.37 requires that a borrower submit a written request for deferment.
Under this administrative hardship deferment, a borrower may request this deferment orally and will not be required
to submit a deferment documentation form to be considered eligible for this deferment. The administrative hardship
deferment may be granted for a period of time not to exceed the earlier of either the date on which the borrower is able
to resume making payments on the loan or 
June 30, 1995. Documentation must be maintained according to the governing regulations.

B. FSEOG Program 



34 CFR 676.4 Allocation and Reallocation 



For the 1994-95 award year, FSEOG funds returned by institutions from the 1993-94 award year will be reallocated
to institutions that enroll students adversely affected by the 1994 California earthquake and submit applications
in the format required by the Secretary. If the total funds requested exceed the total amount of funds available, the
funds will then be reallocated on a 

pro rata 

basis only among these institutions to provide assistance to students whose financial need has increased as a result
of the earthquake. 



IV. 34 CFR Part 682_Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program 



A. 34 CFR 682.604 Processing the Borrower's Loan Proceeds and Counseling Borrowers 



To assist affected individuals, the Secretary modifies the requirement in 34 CFR 682.604(c)(2) that loan proceeds
be delivered to the borrower within 45 days of the institution's receipt of the check but will instead permit the institution
to deliver loan proceeds to the borrower up to 120 days from the institution's receipt of the check. Documentation
must be maintained according to the governing regulations. The Department still expects delivery of a borrower's
loan proceeds as soon as possible. 

Also, because some institutions may have to delay opening or have ceased operation for an undetermined period of time,
the Secretary authorizes lenders not to disburse loan checks to institutions or to parent PLUS borrowers in the affected
areas until the lenders receive revised disbursement schedules from the affected institutions. The Secretary instructs
guaranty agencies and lenders to revise information on loan periods, graduation dates, and so forth, on the loan applications
related to these disbursements as the information becomes available. This change means that a borrower need not reapply
for the loan. This change also will allow a student to receive his or her loan proceeds according to a schedule that fits
the institution's new academic schedule. 



B. 34 CFR 682.605 Determining the Date of a Student's Withdrawal 



The Secretary modifies the requirement in 34 CFR 682.605(b) to permit an institution affected by the disaster to determine
that the student has withdrawn within 90 days (instead of 45) after the expiration of the academic term for an institution
that uses academic terms, except that 60 days (instead of 30) after the first day of the next scheduled term may be used
in the case of a summer break, and 50 days (instead of 25) after the student's last date of attendance may be used for an
institution that measures academic progress in clock hours or credit hours, but does not use a semester, trimester,
or quarter system.

C. 34 CFR 682.607 Payment of a Refund to a Lender 


The Secretary modifies the deadlines by which an affected institution shall pay a refund that is due to a lender, within
60 days after the student's withdrawal as determined under 34 CFR 682.605(b)(1)-(3) or within 30 days in the
case of a student who does not return to the institution at the expiration of an approved leave of absence under 34 CFR
682.605(c). Instead, the Secretary will require the institution to pay a refund to the lender within 120 days (instead
of 60) after the student's withdrawal or within 60 days (instead of 30) after the last day of the leave of absence. 


D. 34 CFR 682.610 Records, Reports, and Inspection Requirements for Participating Schools 


The Secretary modifies the deadline in 34 CFR 682.610(c) that an institution complete and submit required Student
Status Confirmation Reports (SSCRs) to the Secretary or guaranty agency within 30 days of the institution's receipt
of the report but will instead require completion and submission of these reports within 90 days. Reports of changes
of borrower status if the institution does not expect to submit its next SSCR within the next 60 days may also be submitted
within 90 days (instead of 30 days). 


Waiver of Rulemaking 


In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act, 20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A), and the
Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity
to comment on proposed regulations. However, the severe impact of the earthquake in California has caused a national
emergency that has been recognized by the Congress. The Secretary, recognizing the severe devastation of the California
earthquake victims, finds that soliciting further public comment with respect to this notice of relief from regulatory
requirements is impracticable and contrary to the public interest under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). 


Executive Order 12866 


This notice has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the Secretary
has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 
The potential costs associated with this notice are those resulting from statutory requirements and those determined
necessary for providing emergency relief during a natural disaster. This notice provides relief from administrative
burden associated with information collection requirements. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 


The Secretary certifies that this notice will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. The small entities affected by this notice are small institutions of postsecondary education. This notice
provides temporary regulatory relief and will not increase institutions' workload or costs associated with administering

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule implements section 622(a) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. Section 622(a) provides
public housing agencies (PHAs) with the option, subject to the requirements of this part, to designate public housing
projects, or portions of public housing projects, for occupancy by disabled families; elderly families; or mixed
populations (i.e., disabled families and elderly families). 


This final rule also amends existing regulations, which currently provide for preference for elderly families and
disabled families, and discretionary preference for near-elderly families in ``public housing projects for the
elderly''_that is, public housing projects that house mixed populations (``mixed population projects''). This
final rule continues to provide for preference for disabled families and elderly families in ``mixed population
projects.'' However, certain amendments were made to include new and revised definitions pertaining to ``family''
as set forth in section 621 of the 1992 Act, and to provide for recognition of the designated housing process.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background_Proposed Rule


On January 7, 1994 (59 FR 1244), the Department published a proposed rule that would implement section 622(a) of the
Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-550, approved October 28, 1992) (the 1992 Act). Section
622(a) amended section 7 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (the 1937 Act) (42 U.S.C. 1437e) to provide public
housing agencies (PHAs)

1

 with the option, subject to certain requirements, to designate public housing projects, or portions of public housing
projects for occupancy by (1) disabled families; (2) elderly families; or (3) mixed populations (``designated housing'').
(Section 7 of the 1937 Act, previously titled ``Congregate Housing'' was retitled ``Designated Housing'' by the
1992 Act. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the references to section 7 in this preamble are to section 7 as amended
by section 622(a) of the 1992 Act.)

The January 7, 1994 proposed rule incorporated the statutory requirements for obtaining approval to designate public
housing for occupancy by disabled families or by elderly families, and supplemented the statutory requirements
with regulatory ones. By the expiration of the public comment period on March 8, 1994, 101 comments were received.
Approximately another 200 comments were received within the two weeks following the expiration of the public comment
period. All comments timely submitted were reviewed and considered. In order not to delay final rulemaking on designated
housing, the Department made every effort to review the 200 comments received after the close of the public comment
period. The Department believes that the comments addressed in the preamble to this rule reflect the major concerns
and issues raised by all commenters. 

The commenters included housing authorities, associations representing housing authorities, elderly persons,
organizations representing the interests of elderly persons, persons with disabilities, organizations representing
persons with disabilities, State and local offices on aging, and State and local offices that address such matters
as mental health, human services and rehabilitative services. The majority of the commenters were housing authorities.


A number of commenters expressed support for the Department's proposed implementation of section 622, and praised
the Department's efforts to strike a balance between section 622 and the civil rights protections for persons with
disabilities contained in the Fair Housing Act, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with
Disabilities Act. However, the majority of the commenters were highly critical of the proposed rule. While the commenters
in favor of the proposed rule were primarily persons with disabilities, their advocacy organizations, and State
and local offices that address disability issues, supporters of the proposed rule also included housing authorities.
While the commenters opposed to the rule were predominantly housing authorities, associations representing housing
authorities, elderly persons and their advocacy organizations, and State and local offices that address elderly
issues, these commenters were joined by persons with disabilities and their advocacy organizations in voicing objections
to sections of the proposed rule. 

The provisions in the proposed rule that received the greatest criticism were those provisions that addressed the
allocation plan and the supportive service plan requirements. The commenters stated that the Department made both
plans unnecessarily complex and unduly burdensome, with the result being that it would be impossible for PHAs to obtain
approval to designate housing for elderly families or disabled families. 

The Department is appreciative of all comments submitted on the January 7, 1994 proposed rule. While many commenters
simply expressed their general support or opposition to the proposed rule, other commenters carefully reviewed
the rule, and offered detailed and helpful comments on regulatory implementation of section 622. The Department
is aware that PHAs and other members of the public are anxious to have final regulations issued for section 622, and
that the rulemaking process has taken longer than anticipated or desired. The Department believes, however, that
this final rule, which takes into consideration public comment, improves the designated housing process and better
serves PHAs and the families that they house. 



II. Clarification of Relationship of Designated Housing Process to Statutes Prohibiting Nondiscrimination Against
Elderly Persons or Persons With Disabilities 



Certain questions and issues raised by a few commenters made the Department aware that there may be some misunderstanding
about the obligations of PHAs that operate designated housing under statutes that contain civil rights protections
for elderly persons and persons with disabilities. 

Notwithstanding the permissibility of PHAs to designate public housing projects for occupancy by elderly families
or by disabled families, PHAs must comply with section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Fair Housing Act,
the Age Discrimination Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and other applicable civil rights statutes and
their implementing regulations. Section 622 does not alter the obligations and requirements imposed on PHAs by these
statutes and their implementing regulations. 

For example, a PHA may not deny an elderly person who also is a person with disabilities admission to a designated project
for elderly families, in whole or in part, on the basis of the elderly person's disability. Similarly, a PHA may not
deny a person with disabilities admission to a designated project for disabled families on the basis of the person's
age. 

The Department also notes that several commenters criticized the proposed rule on the basis that it appeared overly
concerned with the housing needs of non-elderly disabled families. The Department does not believe that the concern
for the housing needs for non-elderly disabled families as expressed in the proposed rule, and in this final rule,
is unfounded or inconsistent with the statute. 

The Department is aware, as was the Congress in enacting this legislation, that the majority of projects to be designated
will be for elderly families, and the group that will be most affected by this designation will be non-elderly disabled
families. Even without the requirement to submit a supportive service plan in addition to the allocation plan, persons
with disabilities are not demanding their own separate housing projects as are elderly families. Thus, out of concern
that non-elderly disabled persons may have public housing assistance reduced as a result of designation of projects
for elderly families, the Congress requires in section 622 that a PHA, in planning how it will allocate its housing
resources among the families that it serves, must secure additional housing resources ``that will be sufficient
to provide assistance to not less than the number of non-elderly disabled families that would have been housed if occupancy
in such units were not restricted pursuant to this section.'' The proposed rule's concern, and that of this final rule,
that persons with disabilities not be under-served by the designated housing process is not inconsistent with the
statute.

III. Overview of the Final Rule


This section provides a summary of the significant changes made to the designated housing process by this final rule
in response to public comment. This section also discusses those provisions of the proposed rule about which substantial
comments were received requesting change, and for which the Department declined to adopt the recommended change.



Additional Housing Resources 


Inclusion of Additional Housing Resources for Which PHAs ``Plan To Apply'' 


The final rule revises   945.103 and 945.203 which address additional housing resources. As revised,
these sections provide that additional housing resources that a PHA may use to meet the housing needs of non-elderly
disabled families who would have been housed in a project but for its designation as a project for elderly families
include ``housing resources for which the PHA plans to apply during the period covered by the allocation plan and that
it has a reasonable expectation of obtaining.'' 
The commenters on this provision are correct that the statute permits inclusion in the allocation plan of housing
resources for which the PHA ``plans to apply.'' The statute also provides that projections contained in the allocation
plan must be ``reasonable''. Thus, in including in an allocation plan a description of those housing resources for
which the PHA intends to apply, the PHA must have a reasonable expectation of obtaining these housing resources. Additionally,
the time period within which the PHA plans to apply for additional housing resources should be limited, and the regulation
limits the time period to that period covered by the allocation plan. 
By ``reasonable expectation of obtaining,'' the Department means that circumstances and factors relevant to the
PHA's application for additional housing resources, indicate that the PHA has a reasonable chance to obtain these
additional resources. For example, if the Department intends to make 3,000 units available on a competitive basis
in a given region, and the PHA applies for 2,500 units, the chance that the PHA will be awarded 2,500 of the 3,000 units
to be competitively distributed is not reasonable. 
Commenters who requested the inclusion of ``planned'' housing resources in the allocation plan noted that these
housing resources can be further addressed in the biennial updates of the allocation plan. For example, if a PHA relies
upon using housing resources for which it intends to apply, and subsequently fails to apply for the housing resources,
or applies but was unsuccessful in obtaining the additional housing resources, the PHA must account for the lack of
the additional housing resources in the biennial update of the allocation plan. Depending upon the reasons that the
``planned'' additional housing resources were not obtained, the Department can take appropriate action, including
changes in the designation of the project, or require the PHA to take appropriate action at the time of review of the
biennial update. 


Additional Housing Resources Must Be Those Owned or Controlled, or To Be Owned or Controlled by PHAs 

The Department did not adopt the suggestion of several commenters that the final rule include housing resources owned
by other entities that are willing to work in conjunction with the PHA. As noted above, the statute is clear that the
housing resources to be addressed in the allocation plan are those that a PHA owns or controls, or will eventually own
or control. Section 622 provides that a PHA must have ``a plan for securing sufficient additional resources that the
agency owns, controls, or has received preliminary notification that it will obtain, or for which the agency plans
to apply * * *.'' 


Revision to List of Examples of Additional Housing Resources for Persons With Disabilities 

The final rule removes the majority of the examples of additional housing resources that a PHA could utilize to provide
housing assistance to the non-elderly disabled persons that would have been housed in a project were it not for designation
of the project as a project for elderly families. On further consideration, the examples of additional housing resources,
which did not constitute an all inclusive list, are more appropriately included in a notice or Handbook. The final
rule retains examples of those additional housing resources that will probably be utilized by the majority of PHAs
as additional housing resources. 
For the benefit of commenters who found the list helpful, the possible options for additional housing resources for
persons with disabilities include but are not limited to the following: 
(1) Normal turn-over of units in existing projects; 
(2) Providing local preferences for a specific number of non-elderly disabled persons for a specific general occupancy
project or projects, in accordance with the preference provisions of 24 CFR 960.211; for mixed population projects,
as provided in 24 CFR part 960, subpart D; or for section 8 certificates and vouchers. Within the context of the PHA's
overall preference system, there must be a demonstration that the preference will result in the desired increase
in the number of non-elderly disabled persons housed; 
(3) Convert a project that currently houses mixed populations to general occupancy project, which provide a more
integrated setting; 
(4) Allocation of a certain number of existing or new public housing units or section 8 certificates or vouchers, which
will be accompanied by a supportive services package, which may be achieved by the PHA entering into an agreement with
a supportive service provider to make these units or certificates or vouchers available in exchange for the provider
delivering supportive services to disabled families. Clients of the service provider delivering the supportive
services may not be provided these units or certificates or vouchers before other non-elderly disabled families
already in occupancy or on the PHA's waiting list; 
(5) Use of modernization funds to reconfigure units and buildings to appropriate sizes or uses for non-elderly disabled
families; 
(6) Designation of projects for occupancy only by disabled families (projects designated for occupancy by disabled
families must have a supportive service plan in accordance with the requirements of  945.205);

(7) Allocation to non-elderly disabled families of units in other projects owned or controlled by the PHA that will
be vacated by elderly families who will relocate to the project designated for occupancy by elderly families; 
(8) Use of public housing development funds, or funds appropriated for major reconstruction of obsolete public housing
to provide housing for disabled families; 
(9) Use of all or a portion of net increases in units available for occupancy in a project as a result of the rehabilitation
of vacant units in this project which had been uninhabitable. 


Projects Subject to the Requirements of Part 945 


Clarification of Exemption From Designation Requirements for Mixed Population Projects Under Part 960 

The majority of commenters understood that a PHA with a project that houses a mixed population of elderly families
and disabled families (``mixed population project''), and that intends to continue to house a mixed population of
elderly families and disabled families, is 

not

 required to comply with the designation requirements of new part 945. Other commenters stated that the proposed rule
was not clear whether mixed population projects were required to comply with the part 945 designation requirements.

The final rule includes additional language to clarify that mixed population projects are exempt from the designation
requirements of part 945. The final rule also clarifies that the fact that a mixed population project houses persons
with disabilities does not require a supportive service plan, as does a project that is designated for occupancy by
disabled families under part 945. 


Supportive Services Required Only for Designated Housing for Disabled Families 

Several commenters expressed confusion about when supportive services are required by the designated housing process.
PHAs are required by statute, and by this regulation, to provide or obtain supportive services only for projects designated
for occupancy by disabled families. However, in designating a project for elderly families, the PHA must consider
the needs of non-elderly disabled applicants for services currently provided in the project to be designated for
elderly families. 
Section 7(d) provides, in relevant part, that ``in designing, developing, otherwise acquiring and operating, designating
and providing housing and assistance under this title, each public housing agency shall meet to the extent practicable,
the housing and service needs of eligible families applying for assistance under this title as provided in any allocation
plan of the agency approved under subsection (f).'' 
In an effort to reflect ``the extent practicable'' language of section 7(d),  945.103 of the proposed rule contained
a paragraph (paragraph (d)) which stated that the requirements of  945.205 to submit a supportive service plan
for approval to designate public housing for disabled families was not to be construed to mean that PHAs may provide
supportive services only to those disabled families occupying designated housing for disabled families. The purpose
of paragraph (d) in  945.103 was to encourage PHAs that may be currently providing supportive services to elderly
families occupying public housing to continue to provide those services. The fact that a PHA may be able to deliver
supportive services, or is currently delivering supportive services to elderly families, or to disabled families
not occupying a designated project does not bring the PHA within the scope of the requirements of part 945. 
Because of the confusion over this issue expressed by a number of commenters, the final rule removes paragraph (d)
in  945.103 from the final rule. The Department, however, continues to encourage PHAs to meet to the extent practicable
the housing and supportive service needs of all eligible families applying for assistance.

New and Revised Definitions 



Defining ``Mixed Population Project''



The final rule provides a definition for ``mixed population project.'' ``Mixed population project'' is defined
to mean a public housing project reserved for occupancy by elderly families and disabled families. As discussed in
the preceding section, these projects are not required to meet the designation requirements of part 945, but must
be reserved for occupancy by elderly families and disabled families in accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR
part 960. 



Revising the Definitions for the Various Categories of ``Families''



The final rule also introduces a new term to clarify the specific category of families under discussion. Instead of
referring frequently, and awkwardly, as was done in the proposed rule to ``families who are members of the group for
whom the project is to be designated for occupancy,'' the final rule uses the term ``designated family.'' 

``Designated family'' is defined to mean the category of families for whom a project has been designated. Depending
upon the designation to be made, designated families will be either elderly families or disabled families. 

The final rule provides, as did the proposed rule, definitions for the statutory terms ``families,'' ``elderly families,''
``disabled families,'' and ``near-elderly families,'' but the final rule defines these terms in their singular
context rather than the plural context. Additionally, the final rule makes some clarifying changes to these definitions.


``Elderly family'' is defined to clarify that an elderly family may include one or more elderly persons with disabilities,
and members of the family who are not elderly. 

``Near-elderly family'' is defined to clarify that a near-elderly family may include one or more near-elderly persons
with disabilities, and members of the family who are not near-elderly. 

``Disabled family'' is revised to clarify that this term includes a person with disabilities who is also elderly or
near-elderly. An elderly person with disabilities would be eligible to reside in a designated project-disabled,
designated project-elderly, or a mixed population project, subject, of course, to availability of units in these
projects, and the person's place on the waiting list. 

As noted in the preamble to the January 7, 1994 proposed rule, the definitions for ``family,'' ``elderly family,''
and related terms are currently contained in 24 CFR part 912, entitled ``Definition of Family and Other Related Terms;
Occupancy by Single Persons.'' Part 912, however, has not yet been amended to reflect the revised definitions provided
by section 621 or to add the new terms defined in section 621. Under separate final rulemaking, part 912 will be amended
to include several of the revised and new definitions set forth in section 621 (and which are included in this final
rule). When the part 912 rule is published in final, the Department will amend the regulations in part 945 to remove
the definitions from part 945 and to cross-reference to the definitions in part 912. The advantage in keeping these
definitions in part 912 (which was established to define ``family'' and related terms) is that part 912 offers a convenient
location to place the definitions for terms that are applicable to all public housing programs. 



Revised Definition of ``Service Provider''



In response to the many public comments that objected to the ``licensing requirement'' for service providers, the
final rule revises the definition of ``service provider'' to remove the requirement that the service provider must
be licensed under State or local law. In lieu of this requirement, the final rule provides that the service provider
be ``qualified and experienced'' in the provision of supportive services. ``Qualified'' means that if the type of
supportive services to be delivered by the service provider requires a State or local license, the service provider
must be in compliance with these laws. 



Revised Definition of Supportive Services



In response to public comment, specifically by persons with disabilities, the definition of ``supportive services''
is revised to clarify that this term refers to non-housing services available to persons residing in a development
for which there is a need and demand by disabled families. The qualifier of ``non-housing'' before the word ``services''
is to clarify that supportive services do not include plumbing, minor repair and maintenance of dwelling units that
the housing authority is required to provide under the lease. The provision of supportive services in a designated
project does not relieve the PHA of its obligation to provide similar services in other developments for persons with
disabilities as required by 24 CFR part 8. 

The inclusion of the phrase ``for which there is a need and demand'' is to emphasize that PHAs should not designate public
housing projects for occupancy by disabled families unless the disabled families served by the PHA and to whom the
PHA intends to offer occupancy in the designated project clearly indicate a need and demand for the proposed supportive
services. The consensus among commenters who indicated that they were persons with disabilities or who represented
the interests of persons with disabilities was that designated housing for disabled families is not the preferred
residential setting of persons with disabilities. 



Allocation Plan_Development and Contents



The final rule significantly consolidates and streamlines the information required to be included in the allocation
plan, without, however, reducing information necessary to determine the possible adverse impact that the designation
process may have on elderly families or disabled families, particularly non-elderly disabled families. 



Removal of Allocation Plan Objectives



Section 945.203(a)(2) of the proposed rule contained language that encouraged PHAs, in developing their allocation
plan to strive to provide, regardless of the designation to be made, as broad a range of housing choice as possible to
elderly families and disabled families with respect to the level of supportive services, and availability of accessible
units. Additionally, this section stated that PHAs should strive to provide, regardless of the designation to be
made, housing for disabled families in the most integrated setting possible.

<DOCNO> FR940413-0-00078 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940413-0-00026 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Several commenters stated that although these objectives are laudable, their inclusion in a regulation is inappropriate,
and at variance with the statutory requirements. Other commenters stated that the inclusion of these objectives
in the rule added to the complexity of the rule because it was unclear whether these objectives were intended to be advisory
or mandatory, and it was unclear whether a PHA could designate a project for elderly families if these objectives were
not met. A few commenters stated that the final rule should be revised to require compliance with these objectives.


The objectives listed in  945.293(a)(2) of the proposed rule are advisory and not mandatory. The Department
agrees with the commenters that these objectives are laudable, but acknowledges that these objectives are just that_``objectives''
and not ``requirements''. Accordingly, to comply with the statute and minimize confusion concerning what is required
to be addressed in the plan, and what is not, the final rule removes these objectives from the regulation. The Department
is confident that without the regulatory reminder, PHAs will strive to meet these objectives. The Department's confidence
is based in part on the improved public participation procedures for allocation plan development required by this
final rule, and which are discussed below. The Department believes that these procedures will provide PHAs with valuable
input on proposed allocation plans, including any possible problems, and options for expanding housing choice and
creating integrated settings. 



Revised Consultation Procedures for the Plan Development



A number of commenters criticized the ``public consultation process'' of the proposed rule on the basis that the rule
simply mirrored the statutory language, and failed to provide adequate guidance on the extent of consultation involved.
The Department found merit in the commenters' criticism and the final rule provides for a two-stage consultation
process. 

The first consultation occurs at the pre-plan development stage, and the final rule specifies the parties that must
be consulted at a minimum. The second consultation occurs after plan development, but before submission of the plan
to the Department. The final rule requires the PHA to provide for review and comment on the allocation plan by all members
of the public. This two-stage consultation process was recommended by several commenters. 

For the first stage of the consultation process, the final rule requires the PHA to consult with the State or unit of
general local government where the project is located. (In response to public comment the phrase ``where the project
was located'' was changed from the proposed rule phrase of ``in whose jurisdiction the area served by the PHA is located.'')
The final rule also provides for PHAs to consult with representative advocacy groups, where these groups exist, for
each of the following categories of families: Disabled families, elderly families and families with children. The
final rule establishes consultation with public housing residents (again in the pre-plan development stage) by
requiring consultation with the representatives of the residents of the buildings proposed for designation, as
a minimum requirement. 

For the second stage of the consultation process, the final rule provides for public participation review and comment
on the plan. The commenters stated that this type of public participation process would provide all families affected
by the designation with the opportunity to express their support, voice their objections, and offer comments on the
proposed allocation plan. The Department agrees with the commenters, and the final rule requires that following
completion of the draft allocation plan (and the draft of any update of the allocation plan) the PHA shall: 

(1) Issue public notices regarding its intent to create designated housing and the availability of the draft allocation
plan; 

(2) Contact those parties, with whom the PHA is required by regulation to consult, and other individuals and agencies
that expressed an interest in the PHA's plan; 

(3) Allow not less than 30 days for public comment on the draft allocation plan; 

(4) Make free copies of the draft allocation plan available upon request and in accessible format, when appropriate;
and 

(5) Conduct at least one public meeting on the draft allocation plan.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940413-0-00079 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940413-0-00026 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The requirement to consult with certain groups and individuals, and the requirement to provide public participation
in the development of the allocation plan is to assist the PHA in better identifying issues, problems, and benefits
involved in the proposed action. However, the final decision concerning the project to be designated, and how the
PHA proposes to allocate its available housing resources rests with the PHA. 



Submission of Summary of Comments, and Not Transcripts



The final rule continues to allow PHAs to submit a summary of comments received on the allocation plan. A few commenters
stated that submission of a summary of the comments is in conflict with the statutory requirement. 

The statute provides, in relevant part, that the allocation plan shall include ``any comments of agencies, organizations
or persons with whom the PHA consults.'' The Department believes that the statutory language is sufficiently broad
to permit submission of a summary of the comments received on the allocation plan. The PHA must maintain the original
comments on file, and must make these comments available for inspection by the Department and the public. 

Other commenters stated that the proposed rule was unclear whether transcripts of meetings were required, and if
transcripts were required, the commenters stated that this requirement is too burdensome. In referring to transcripts
of meetings in the proposed rule, the Department did not intend to require a transcript of a meeting. Rather, the proposed
rule intended to require retention of a transcript if a PHA decided to have a transcript made of a meeting. The final
rule, however, removes all references to meeting transcripts. If taken, the PHA should maintain the transcript on
file, together with comments received on the allocation plan, to be made available for inspection by the public. Comments
made at a meeting by members of the public should be included in the summary of comments. 



Retention of Five Year Recordkeeping Requirement for Comments



Several comments complained that the five year recordkeeping requirement for the retention of comments submitted
on the allocation plan was too lengthy a period. The commenters suggested that a two-year retention period should
be sufficient. 

The Department disagrees with the commenters. PHAs should maintain the original comments received on the allocation
plan to cover at least two biennial updates. The Department believes that the five-year record retention period is
in the best interest of PHAs, and is not unduly burdensome. 



Removal of Requirement To Discuss Advantages and Disadvantages of Designation



The final rule removes the requirement for the PHA to address in the allocation plan the advantages and disadvantages
that the choice of designation is expected to have on families served by the PHA. The Department agrees with the commenters
that the advantages and disadvantages should be apparent by the information provided in the allocation plan. 



Retention of Requirement To Document the Number of Families Who Will Be Denied or Delayed Housing



A few commenters requested that the final rule not include the statutory requirements for PHAs to ``document the number
and duration of instances in which housing assistance for eligible applicants will be denied or delayed by the agency
because of a lack of appropriately designated units.'' The Department declines to remove this requirement from the
rule because it is a statutory requirement. 



Clarification That Delays of Concern Are Those That Are Caused by the Designation Process



In response to public comment, the final rule clarifies that the denial of or delay in housing assistance with which
the Department is concerned in part 945 is that which results from the designation of project. Delays that are caused
by matters unrelated to the designation process are not those that will result in re-evaluation of the appropriateness
of a PHA's designation of a project. For example, as one commenter noted, some PHAs have very low turn-over in their
projects that results in denial of or delay in housing assistance that is unrelated to the designation process. Also,
a PHA that implements stricter screening procedures can be expected to have an increased rate of denial of housing
assistance among all applicants. 



Determining the Extent of Denial of or Delay in Housing Assistance



Several commenters indicated that they were uncertain what the statute meant by ``excessive,'' and requested the
Department define ``excessive'' in terms of a number or percentage. Instead of defining this term, the Department
has replaced ``excessive'' with ``substantial.'' 

As discussed in the previous section, there may be a variety of circumstances having nothing to do with the designation
of housing that may give rise to delays in housing assistance. The Department is interested in knowing whether the
designation of project under part 945 is causing a denial of or delay in housing assistance for a substantial number
of tenants. That is, has the number of applicants denied housing assistance increased as a result of the designation,
or (or perhaps also) has there been an increase (a lengthening) in the duration of time an applicant must wait for housing
assistance as a result of the designation. 



Revision to Requirement To Maintain Access to Similar Services and Housing Facilities



The proposed rule required PHAs to describe the steps to be taken to ensure that disabled families (if a project was
to be designated for elderly families) and elderly families (if a project was to be designated for disabled families)
maintain access to services and housing facilities similar to those that otherwise would have been available to them
at the project if the project had not been designated. 

A number of commenters objected to this requirement on the basis that the regulatory language was too broad, and it
would be impossible for PHAs to guarantee similar access to all services and amenities available to them before designation.
The Department agrees with the commenters, and has revised this section of the allocation plan. The rule now requires
PHAs to describe the steps taken to facilitate access to supportive services provided by other agencies at the designated
project.

<TEXT>
 

This section, however, imposes an affirmative duty on a PHA to fund at least the same level of supportive services needed
and requested by non-elderly disabled families that the PHA funds for elderly families in the designated project.




Revision to Requirement Concerning Accessible Units



The proposed rule required the PHA to describe the steps to be taken to replace any accessible units that will be unavailable
as a result of the designation. A few commenters noted that PHAs are already mandated by section 504 to assess and provide
for accessibility needs, and recommended this provision refer to the PHA's obligations under section 504 obligations.


The Department agrees, and final rule requires the PHA to describe the steps taken by the PHA to affirmatively meet
its obligations under 24 CFR part 8 to respond to any need for accessible units that will no longer be available to applicants
who need these units. 



Removal of Requirement To Provide Information on Existing Occupancy Policy and Procedures



The final rule also removes the requirement for the PHA to provide information on the PHA's existing occupancy policies
and procedures, and to include a description of the PHA's HUD-approved Tenant Selection and Assignment Plan. With
respect to the PHA's admission policies and procedures, the final rule requires the PHA to describe any changes the
PHA intends to make in its admission policies to accommodate the proposed designation. 



Allocation Plan Approval or Disapproval



Approval of Plan Because of HUD Failure To Respond Within Timeframes



The final rule clarifies that if HUD fails to approve or disapprove an allocation plan within the timeframes imposed
by statute, and set forth in this regulation, an allocation plan will be considered approved. 



Time Limits on Resubmission of Disapproved Allocation Plans




The proposed rule provided that if the Department disapproves an initial allocation plan, a PHA shall have a period
of not less than 45 days following notification of disapproval to submit amendments to the plan, or to submit a revised
plan. ``A period of not less than 45 days'' is the language used in the statute. A few commenters read this provision
to mean that only 45 days would be permitted. Other commenters requested that there be no time limitation imposed on
the resubmission of an allocation plan. 


The final rule continues to provide PHAs, consistent with the statute, with a period of at least 45 days to submit amendments
to the plan or to submit a revised plan. The Department, however, declines to adopt the suggestion of some commenters
that there be no time limitation on submission of a revised plan. In fact, on further consideration, the Department
has decided to impose a maximum time limit on when a disapproved plan may be resubmitted. The Department believes that
the passage of a substantial period of time may affect the data originally reported in the allocation plan, and may
make it necessary for the PHA to hold another public meeting. Accordingly, the final rule provides that PHAs will have
a period of no less than 45 days, and no more than 90 to resubmit an initial allocation plan originally disapproved.


The Department believes that 90 days represents a reasonable maximum period within which to submit a revised plan.
An allocation plan that may require more than 90 days to make it an approvable plan, in all likelihood, indicates serious
underlying problems with the plan. Accordingly, the PHA and the families that it houses are better served by restarting
the allocation plan development process. 

The Department declines to apply, as one commenter suggested, one time limit to all revised plans. Some revisions
required of allocation plans may take minimal time on the part of the PHA, and therefore 45 days will be sufficient,
while other revisions may require use of the longer 90-day period. 



Designated Housing for Disabled Families



The final rule makes several changes to  945.205 that addresses the supportive service plan component for obtaining
approval to designate projects for disabled families. To obtain approval to designate a project for disabled families,
section 622 requires submission of an allocation plan and a supportive service plan. 



Supportive Service Plan Is Statutory Requirement



Many commenters objected to the requirement to submit a supportive service plan in order to obtain approval for designated
housing for disabled families. The commenters stated that it is not only unfair to disabled families, it is unfair
to PHAs. Several commenters stated that this requirement reinforces the stereotype that persons with disabilities
have special needs and are incapable of living independently. Other commenters stated that if the supportive service
plan is going to be required for housing for disabled families, it also should be required for housing for elderly families.


The requirement to submit a supportive service plan for designated housing for disabled families is a statutory requirement,
not a regulatory one. However, the Department has made changes to this provision of the final rule with the intention
of minimizing the administrative burden, and with the intention of clarifying when this type of housing should be
considered as an alternative housing for persons with disabilities. 



Demonstrated Need and Demand for This Housing



 The final rule provides that HUD will approve designation of a project for disabled families only where there is a clear
demonstration of both a need and demand for such designation, and in the absence of such demonstrated need and demand,
PHAs should provide for the housing needs of disabled families in the most integrated setting possible. The inclusion
of a demonstration or evidence that there is a clear need and demand for housing that is limited to persons with disabilities
is in response to commenters from the disability community who stressed that this type of housing should not be the
automatic alternative to designated housing for elderly families.

<DOCNO> FR940413-0-00081 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940413-0-00026 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Admission to Designated Projects for Disabled Families Need Not Be Based on Need for Services



Although the designation of a project for disabled families should arise only where there is a real need and demand
for this type of housing (i.e., where persons with disabilities express the need or demand for the services to be provided)
once the project is established, admission to this project is not to be conditioned on a person with disabilities needing
or opting for the service. A person with disabilities who chooses to reside in this project, and is next on the waiting
list, should not be denied occupancy because the person does not need or have any interest in using the services to be
provided to this project. 



Non-Contiguous Units Encouraged but Not Required



A few commenters objected to the proposed rule's implied prohibition against designating contiguous units. Designation
of contiguous units is, by no means, prohibited by this final rule. 

The Department recognizes that where projects are designated for occupancy by elderly families, the units or floors
designated will, in all likelihood, be contiguous, reflecting the preference of elderly families to reside in proximity
to one another. As stated earlier in this preamble, the preference of the persons with disabilities who commented
on this rule is to reside in an integrated setting, and not be limited to projects that house only disabled families,
or that house only disabled families and elderly families. Thus, the reference to non-contiguous units in the regulation
is to encourage PHAs to consider more integrated settings for persons with disabilities. 



Clarification of When Service Provider Must Be Licensed



As discussed earlier in this preamble, the final rule removes the requirement that service providers must be licensed,
unless licensing for the type of service to be provided is required by State or local law. 



Consultation Procedures for Supportive Service Plan



The final rule provides the same consultation process for the supportive service plan that is required of the allocation
plan. For PHAs that intend to designate a project for disabled families the consultation process for the supportive
service plan may be performed concurrently with the allocation plan. 



IV. Discussion of Public Comments 



Many of the issues raised by commenters have been addressed in section III of this preamble, which provided a summary
of the principal features of the designated housing process as implemented by this final rule. Therefore, these issues
are not re-addressed in this section. This section discusses additional issues raised by the commenters, and the
Department's response to these issues. These comments may or may not have prompted additional, but less significant,
changes to the rule. The comments are discussed in the context of the particular subpart or section of the rule to which
they pertain. 

In addition to not discussing issues already addressed in section III of the preamble, the following does not discuss
comments that were either generally laudatory or generally critical of the proposed rule, either of style or substantive
comment, or that offered editorial suggestions, or suggestions regarding format that would not affect the meaning
of the regulatory provisions. 



Section 945.105 Definitions





Comment: 

Two commenters recommended that the definition of ``persons with disabilities'' be revised to eliminate the implication
that these persons must have multiple disabilities to qualify as a ``person with disabilities.'' Their suggested
term was ``person with one or more disabilities.'' 



Response: 

The term ``person with disabilities'' is the term used in section 622, and is also the term used in the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) (although, as discussed in the next response, the definition for this term is not identical
in section 622 and the ADA). The Department believes that the definition for this term makes clear that to qualify as
a person with disabilities, the individual need not have more than one disability.

<PARENT> FR940413-0-00026 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Comment: 

Two commenters stated that the definition of ``person with disabilities'' should be revised to conform to the definition
provided in the Americans with Disabilities Act. 



Response: 

The definitions for the various categories of ``persons'' and ``families'' used in section 622 of the 1992 Act, are
provided in section 621 of the 1992 Act. The final rule reflects the definition for ``person with disabilities'' set
forth in section 621. Additionally, neither the Americans with Disabilities Act or section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973 amended the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 to replace the 1937 Act's definition of ``persons with disabilities.''




Comment: 

One commenter stated that the age distinction for ``near-elderly person'' is too low and should be raised to 55. Two
commenters stated that the definition of ``disabled families'' should include an age restriction, such as 55 or 50
years of age. Another commenter stated that the definition of ``elderly family'' should exclude any child under the
age of 55. 



Response: 

The statute defines all of these terms (``near-elderly person,'' ``disabled family'' and ``elderly family'') and
the Department is without authority to adopt the recommendations made by these commenters. 

Section 621 defines ``near-elderly person'' as a person who is at least 50 years of age, but below the age of 62. 

The statute does not provide for an age restriction in the definition of ``disabled family'' nor does it exclude as
an ``elderly family'' a family with children who are neither elderly or near-elderly. In fact in the final rule, the
definition of ``disabled family'' rule clarifies that this term includes persons and other members of the family
who may be elderly, near-elderly, or who are neither elderly, or near-elderly. The definition of ``elderly family''
clarifies that this term includes persons and other members of the family who may be persons with disabilities or who
are neither elderly nor near-elderly. 



Comment: 

One commenter requested that the Department provide a definition for ``accessible'' when used in the context of a
dwelling unit. 



Response: 

The definition section of the final rule includes a definition for ``accessible unit.'' The final rule provides that
the term ``accessible unit'' has the meaning given this term under the second definition of ``accessible'' in 24 CFR
8.3, which is a definition familiar to PHAs. 



Section 945.203 

Allocation plan



Comment: 

Two commenters requested that the final rule require PHAs to explain the methods used in arriving at information required
by the allocation plan. 



Response: 

The Department declines to impose this requirement on PHAs. Much of the information required by the allocation plan
will be derived from the PHA's waiting list, or from the locality's CHAS, or other local housing needs survey. Members
of the public that may be interested in determining how a PHA arrived at the information disclosed in its allocation
plan may inquire about this at the public meeting to be held on the allocation plan. Some of the information will be derived
from the PHA's self-evaluation under section 504. 



Comment: 

Several commenters supported the use of the CHAS as a source of information required to be included in the allocation
plan, but other commenters stated that the CHAS is not a useful source of information or is not required in their jurisdictions.




Response: 

The statute specifically includes the CHAS as a source of data for the allocation plan. For localities where there
is no CHAS, the final rule provides for use of any other local housing needs survey. 



Comment: 

One commenter stated that in determining additional housing resources that are needed to house non-elderly disabled
persons, the rule should clearly state that if the same number of units would be offered to the applicant group not allowed
in designated units, as would have been offered before the designation, then no new units are needed.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940413-0-00083 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940413-0-00026 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response: 

The Department believes that this point need not be explicitly stated in the rule. The statute and this final rule require
the PHA to disclose its plan for securing additional housing resources that will be sufficient to provide assistance
to not less than the number of non-elderly disabled families that would have been housed but for the designation. If
the PHA has the ``additional'' housing resources on hand, and need not secure other housing resources, then this is
what the PHA will state in its allocation plan.



Comment:

 One commenter stated that it was trivial for the Department to require the PHA to describe any incentives offered to
implement voluntary transfers to achieve the objectives of the designation.



Response:

 The Department is interested in how a PHA is successful in motivating families to move to a designated project, or motivating
families to move from a project proposed to be designated. Additionally, the information provided by PHAs on this
matter may be useful to other PHAs.



Comment:

 Many comments were received on the types of additional housing resources to be provided to non-elderly disabled families.
Persons within the disability community were divided on what constitutes acceptable additional housing resources.
Some commenters stated that section 8 certificates and vouchers were not suitable housing resources for persons
with disabilities. The majority of individual commenters (as opposed to advocacy organizations) requested the
use of more section 8 certificates and vouchers for persons with disabilities. Other commenters stated that replacing
public housing units with residency in a group home, or shared housing is not comparable to residency in a private apartment
and should not be acceptable.



Response:

 The statute provides for consideration of a variety of alternative housing resources for non-elderly disabled families,
including section 8 certificates and vouchers, mixed housing, congregate housing, shared housing, and group homes.
Accordingly, the Department cannot exclude consideration of use of these types of housing assistance by regulation.
The final rule, however, provides for greater public input in the allocation plan than did the proposed rule. This
provides an opportunity for persons with disabilities, and their representatives, to voice their objections, if
any, to the additional housing resources for non-elderly disabled families proposed to be used by the PHA. The Department
will look very carefully at any plan about which there were strong objections raised by persons with disabilities.



Comment:

 A few commenters asked how the allocation plan is to indicate that it gave fair consideration of comments received
on the allocation plan.



Response:

 The PHA should explain how it did or did not revise its plan in response to public comment. Generally, the Department
will be interested in a PHA's response to substantial negative comment on a proposed allocation plan.



Comment:

 Three commenters objected to the fact that the proposed rule did not include a list of various housing options for elderly
families.



Response:

 As noted earlier in this preamble, the Congress and the Department anticipate that most, if not all, allocation plans
will provide for designation of public housing projects for occupancy by elderly families. This is why the statute
specifically requires PHAs to address housing resources that will be available for non-elderly disabled families.
In the event a PHA designates a project for occupancy by disabled families, and the designation will result in denial
of or delay in housing assistance to elderly families, then the PHA must address this issue in its allocation plan.



Comment:

 Nine commenters stated that approval or disapproval of an allocation plan should be based only on the statutory requirements.
Another commenter stated that the only basis for disapproval should be an indication that there will be disparate
waiting times for groups waiting to be housed. Three commenters stated that the rule should make clear that the Department
will not approve an allocation plan which fails to promote fair housing or which is submitted by a PHA for which there
is documented history of discrimination against various types of families. 



Response:

 The Department has made only a few editorial changes to  945.203(d) which addresses the allocation plan approval
criteria. This section tracks the statutory language. The statute provides that the allocation plan shall be approved
if the Department determines that based on the plan ``and the comments submitted on the plan''_``the information
contained in the plan is complete and accurate and the projections are reasonable, implementation of the plan will
not result in excessive vacancy rates, and the plan (as described in the statute) can reasonably be achieved.'' The
fact that the approval section of the regulation may focus on particular information to be contained in the plan (and
the completeness and accuracy of this information), or emphasize the reasonableness of certain projections to be
made does not mean that the Department has departed from the statutory approval criteria.



Comment:

 One commenter suggested that the final rule require that a PHA whose plan has been disapproved by the Department, must
undergo public review and comment before resubmission of the plan to the Department.



Response:

 As discussed in section III of this preamble, the Department shared the concern expressed by the commenter, and has
revised the provision in the rule that addresses when a revised plan may be submitted. The rule now provides that if
a revised plan is submitted within the period set by the Department which will be no less than 45 days, but no more than
90 days, the PHA need not undergo a second consultation process. However, after 90 days, the Department is concerned
that factors and data may have changed that will affect families served by the PHA, and that therefore make it necessary
for the PHA to once again invite public review and comment. Accordingly, the Department established a maximum time
limit of 90 days.



Comment:

 Three commenters requested that the final rule provide for PHAs to follow the same public participation requirements
on updated plans that govern the initial plans.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940413-0-00084 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940413-0-00026 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response: 

The final rule imposes (as did the proposed rule) the same public participation requirements on updated plans, as
imposed on initial allocation plans. This is a statutory requirement. Section 622 provides that ``in preparing the
initial allocation plan, 

or updates of a plan, 

for submission under this section, a public housing agency shall consult with * * *.'' 



Comment: 

Three commenters stated that the requirement to submit updated allocation plans every two years is burdensome. 



Response: 

The requirement to submit biennial updates is a statutory requirement. 



Comment: 

Two commenters stated that the Department exceeds its statutory authority in providing that projects for which updated
plans were disapproved will revert to occupancy status before designation. 



Response: 

The Department disagrees with the commenter. The Congress would not have required PHAs to submit updated plans every
two years if the Congress were not concerned that there may be instances in which designated housing is a failure. That
is, the Congress was concerned that the number of families who have been denied housing assistance, or the delay in
providing housing assistance has increased substantially as a result of designated housing, to cite two examples
of concern. If one of these consequences were to occur, the Department cannot permit the PHA to continue to operate
designated housing for which the impact is adverse for a substantial number of families or a protected class of families.
However, the Department has revised the final rule to clarify that disapproval of the updated plan will not result
in automatic reversal of a designated project to its predesignation occupancy status. As with the initial allocation
plan, there may be factors that a PHA can, and is willing to change, that will correct the situation and minimize the
adverse impact of the designated housing process on the families served by the PHA. 


Section 945.205 Designated housing for disabled families 





Comment: 

One commenter stated that the two year commitment for a service provider may be in violation of some State laws that
permit only one-year contracts. 



Response: 

The Department is sympathetic to this situation. However, the statute requires that a designated project for disabled
families cannot be approved without a supportive service plan. The Department must have some assurance that if it
approves the designated project for disabled families, the supportive services will remain in place at least until
the PHA submits its updated allocation plan. 



Comment: 

Nine commenters stated that it will be difficult if not impossible to identify the supportive service needs of disabled
families. These commenters stated that HUD must keep in mind that PHAs can no longer require disclosure of specific
disabling conditions. 



Response: 

The Department recognizes the difficulties for PHAs to identify the specific disabling condition of persons with
disabilities, and the designated housing process does not impose this type of investigation on PHAs. The designated
housing process, as implemented by this final rule, intends for PHAs to informally survey residents and potential
residents about service needs and desires. The Department's experience, generally, is that the public is not shy
about expressing needs and desires. From this survey, the PHA should be able to determine the services that residents
actually need and demand, and those that the PHA believes that it can reasonably provide. 



Comment: 

Two commenters stated that the PHA should be required to document the need for specific supportive services it intends
to provide. 



Response: 

As discussed in Section III of the preamble, the revisions made to the approval process for designated housing for
disabled families impose this type of requirement. The final rule provides that designated housing for disabled
families will be approved if the allocation plan meets the requirements of  945.203 and demonstrates both a
need and a demand for designated housing for disabled families. The need and demand will be based on the information
provided in the supportive service plan that will (or should) evidence the need and demand for the services to be provided
to families occupying this project. 



Comment: 

Six commenters stated that the final rule should provide that supportive services not be linked to a project, but must
be portable. 



Response: 

For designated housing for disabled families, the supportive services are project specific. (However, the units
in the project that constitute the designated housing need not be contiguous; and the Department encourages non-contiguous
units.) The project specific aspect recognizes that if projects are designated for disabled families the designation
in itself establishes ``separate housing'' for the designated families, even if non-contiguous units comprise
the designated housing. Whenever the PHA undertakes designation of a project for disabled families, the Department
wants assurance that there are sufficient numbers of persons with disabilities who are current tenants or applicants
on the waiting list who express a need and demand for housing that provides supportive services (i.e., designated
housing for disabled families). 



Comment: 

Eleven commenters stated that the rule must clarify that designated projects for disabled families are also available
to persons not needing, or opting for supportive services. 



Response: 

As discussed in section III of the preamble, the final rule makes this clarification. 



Comment: 

One commenter stated that the final rule should require PHAs to determine which disabled families will occupy designated
housing for disabled families. 



Response: 

The final rule requires PHAs, as part of the approval process for designated housing for disabled families, to demonstrate
the need and demand for this type of housing. The Department believes that this requirement will address the concern
expressed by the commenter.

Comment: 

Seven commenters requested that the final rule clarify what is meant by residential supervision. The commenters
stated that they did not want PHAs to use residential supervision to provide a more restrictive type of public housing
for persons with disabilities. 



Response: 

``Residential supervision'' refers to the assistance provided by a person or persons who either lives at the designated
project for disabled families, or makes himself or herself available to persons with disabilities who may need assistance
on a 24-hour or on-call basis. Generally, residential supervision assistance is provided to persons who, as a result
of seizures or paralysis, for example, may need assistance to be provided on a flexible basis (e.g., on-call) and to
be available within proximity to where the person resides. The specific need for residential supervision must be
documented in the supportive service plan. 




Section 945.303 Requirements governing occupancy in designated housing 





Comment: 

One commenter requested that the final rule contain regulations to permit expedited removal of disruptive tenants.




Response: 

The Department's regulations in 24 CFR part 966, governing lease and grievance procedures in public housing, already
address this issue. 



Section 945.301 Operating designated housing 






Comment: 

Two commenters stated that the requirement to operate designated housing in conformance with civil rights laws should
be extended to the allocation plan development stages. 



Response: 

The Department agrees with this comment, and this section of the final rule provides that ``the application procedures
and operation of designated projects'' shall be in conformity with the applicable civil rights and nondiscrimination
statutes. Conformity with applicable civil rights and nondiscrimination statutes includes submission of the needs
assessment and transition plan required by 24 CFR 8.25. 



Part 960, Subpart D_Preference for Disabled Families and Elderly Families in Public Housing Projects for Disabled
Families and Elderly Families 





Comment: 

One commenter stated that the proposed rule did not make clear that elderly housing under part 960 is not the same as
elderly housing under part 945. 



Response: 

The Department believes that the editorial changes made to part 960 in the final rule clarify the distinction between
projects meeting the requirements of part 945, and those meeting the requirements of part 960. 
For example, the Department has changed the title to subpart D to read ``Preferences for Elderly Families and Disabled
Families in Mixed Population Projects'' and uses this term ``mixed population project'' throughout the subpart
D. Use of the term ``mixed population project'' should clarify that projects meeting the requirements of subpart
D house both elderly families and disabled families. 



Comment: 

Six commenters stated that reference in  960.407 to the 10 percent limitation on families without a Federal
preference should be revised to read ``50 percent.'' 



Response: 

The Department has not yet issued its final regulation on Federal preferences. Once the Federal preferences final
rule is published, the Department will make a conforming amendment to part 960, subpart D to reflect the 50 percent.




Comments on the Information Collection Requirements 





Comment: 

Ten commenters stated that the Department grossly underestimated the time for completion of the allocation plan.




Response: 

The Department believes that the substantial changes made to the allocation plan requirements by this final rule
bring the plan more in line with the estimated burden hours. 




Other Comments and Recommendations 





Comment: 

Three commenters stated that they expect the most vigorous possible oversight by the Department of the allocation
planning process, not only at the first step of initial approval, but biennial updates. 



Response: 

The Department has every intention to monitor, through careful review of initial allocation plans and biennial updates,
the operation of designated housing, and its impact on families served by PHAs that operate designated housing. Monitoring
also will include monitoring and compliance reviews under section 504, investigations of complaints under section
504, the Fair Housing Act, and other civil rights authorities. 



Comment: 

Four commenters stated that the final rule should require PHAs to preserve some mixed-use or general occupancy housing
for persons with disabilities. 



Response: 

The Department certainly encourages, but cannot require, PHAs to maintain mixed-used or general occupancy projects
for persons with disabilities. 



V. Other Matters 


Environmental Impact 



A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment was made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24
CFR part 50, which implements section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) at the time
of development of the proposed rule. This Finding of No Significant Impact remains applicable to this final rule,
and is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk,
Office of the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW.,
Washington, DC 20410.

Executive Order 12866




This final rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 as a significant regulatory
action. Any changes made in this rule as a result of that review are clearly identified in the docket file, which is available
for public inspection in the Office of HUD's Rule's Docket Clerk, room 10276, 451 Seventh St. SW., Washington, DC.





Impact on Small Entities




The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this final rule
before publication and by approving it certifies that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The final rule establishes the requirements and procedures by which PHAs may designate
projects, or portions of projects, for occupancy only by (1) elderly families, (2) disabled families, or (3) disabled
families and elderly families. The rule incorporates the requirements established by statute for such designation.
The designation of housing for occupancy by elderly families, disabled families, or disabled families and elderly
families is an option provided to, not a requirement imposed on, PHAs by this rule. 




Executive Order 12606, The Family



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
final rule would not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being
within the meaning of the order. This final rule implements the designation process provided by section 622 of the
1992 Act, the purpose of which is to assist PHAs in meeting the housing and supportive service needs of disabled families
and elderly families. The supportive services provided by PHAs to disabled and elderly families are expected to assist
these families in avoiding possible institutionalization, and to reduce unnecessary stress and financial burden
on these families. Thus, the supportive services component of the program is anticipated to have a beneficial impact
on disabled families and elderly families. 



Since the designation process, however, provides for elderly-only housing and disabled-only housing, there is
the possibility that the designation process authorized by section 622 of the 1992 Act would limit the availability
of housing for (1) disabled families (if a PHA designates elderly family-only housing), (2) elderly families (if
a PHA designates disabled family-only housing) or (3) families with children (if a PHA designates disabled families
and/or elderly family-only housing), and thus adversely impact the maintenance and well-being of these families.
(Although it should be noted that PHAs would be required to admit eligible elderly families with children to designated
projects for elderly families, and admit eligible disabled families with children to projects designated for disabled
families.) The final rule, however, provides certain protections for all family types, including the protection
provided by HUD's review and approval of a PHA's housing allocation plan. The purpose of this review is to ensure that
the availability of public housing, and other housing resources available to the PHA, is not reduced for any of these
families, especially non-elderly disabled families. Thus, the impact on family maintenance and well being that
may result from the designation process, as implemented by the Department through this rule, would not be significant
within the meaning of the order. 




Executive Order 12612, Federalism





The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that this final rule would not have substantial, direct effects on States, on their political subdivisions, or on
their relationship with the Federal government, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various
levels of government. The is limited to implementing the procedures under which PHAs may opt, subject to certain requirements
and procedures, to designate public housing projects, or portions of public housing projects, for occupancy by elderly
families, disabled families, or disabled families and elderly families. 




Regulatory Agenda




This rule was listed as sequence number 1635 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations, published on October
25, 1993 (58 FR 56402, 56448) under Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Subpart A_General 



 945.101 

Purpose. 




The purpose of this part is to provide for designated housing as authorized by section 7 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937
(42 U.S.C. 1437e). Section 7 provides public housing agencies with the option, subject to the requirements and procedures
of this part, to designate public housing projects, or portions of public housing projects, for occupancy by disabled
families, elderly families, or mixed populations of disabled families and elderly families. 




 945.103 

General policies. 




(a) 

Agency participation. 

Participation in this program is limited to public housing agencies (PHAs) (as this term is defined in 24 CFR 913.102)
that elect to designate public housing projects for occupancy by disabled families, elderly families, or disabled
families and elderly families, as provided by this part. 


(b) 

Eligible housing_

(1) 

Designation of public housing. 

Projects eligible for designation under this part are public housing projects as described in the definition of ``project''
in  945.105. 


(2) 

Additional housing resources. 

To meet the housing and supportive service needs of elderly families, and disabled families, including non-elderly
disabled families, who will not be housed in a designated project, PHAs shall utilize housing resources that they
own, control, or have received preliminary notification that they will obtain (e.g., section 8 certificates and
vouchers). They also may utilize housing resources for which they plan to apply during the period covered by the allocation
plan, and that they have a reasonable expectation of obtaining. PHAs also may utilize, to the extent practicable,
any housing facilities that they own or control in which supportive services are already provided, facilitated or
coordinated, such as mixed housing, shared housing, family housing, group homes, and congregate housing. 


(3) 

Exemption of mixed population projects. 

A PHA with a public housing project with a mixed population of elderly families and disabled families that plans to
house them in such project in accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR part 960, subpart D, is not required to meet
the designation requirements of this part. 


(c) 

Family Participation in designated housing_

(1) 

Voluntary participation. 

The election to reside in designated housing is voluntary on the part of a family. No disabled family or elderly family
may be required to reside in designated housing, nor shall a decision not to reside in designated housing adversely
affect the family with respect to occupancy of another appropriate project. 


(2) 

Meeting stated eligibility requirements. 

Nothing in this part shall be construed to require or permit a PHA to accept for admission to a designated project a disabled
family or elderly family who does not meet the stated eligibility requirements for occupancy in the project (for example,
income), as set forth in HUD's regulations in 24 CFR parts 912 and 913, and in the PHA's admission policies.

the designated project for elderly families, the PHA must provide the same level of services, upon the request of non-elderly
disabled families. 

(iv) If a project is being designated for elderly families, identify the additional housing resources that the PHA
determines will be sufficient to provide assistance to not less than the number of non-elderly disabled families
that would have been housed by the PHA if occupancy in units in the designated project were not restricted to elderly

<TEXT>
 

(A) Normal turnover in existing projects; 

(B) Existing housing stock that previously was not available to or considered for non-elderly disabled families.
Examples are dwellings in general occupancy (family) projects that are reconfigured to meet the dwelling size needs

(D) Housing for which the PHA plans to apply during the period covered by the allocation plan, and which it has a reasonable
expectation of obtaining. 

(v) Where a project is being designated for elderly families, explain how the PHA plans to secure the required additional
housing resources. In the case of housing for which the PHA plans to apply, the PHA must provide sufficient information
about the housing resource and its application to establish that the PHA can reasonably expect to obtain the housing.


(vi) Describe incentives, if any, that the PHA intends to offer to: 

(A) Families who are members of the group for whom a project was designated to achieve voluntary transfers 

to 

the designated project; and 

(B) Families who are not members of the group for whom a project was designated to achieve voluntary transfers 

from 

the project proposed to be designated; 

(d) 

Criteria for allocation plan approval.

 945.205 

Designated housing for disabled families. 



(a) 

General. 

(1) In general, HUD will approve designated projects for disabled families only if there is a clear demonstration
that there is both a need and a demand by disabled families for such designation. In the absence of such demonstrated
need and demand, PHAs should provide for the housing needs of disabled families in the most integrated setting possible.


(2) To designate a project for disabled families, a PHA must submit the allocation plan required by  945.203
and the supportive service plan described in paragraph (b) of this section. 

(3) In its allocation plan, 

(i) The PHA may not designate a project for persons with a specific disability; 

(ii) The designated project does not have to be made up of contiguous units. PHAs are encouraged to place the units in
the project, whether contiguous or not, in the most integrated setting possible. 

(4) The consultation process for the allocation plan provided in  945.203(b) and consultation process for
the supportive service plan provided in this section may occur concurrently. 

(5) If the PHA conducts surveys to determine the need or demand for a designated project for disabled families or for
supportive services in such project, the PHA must protect the confidentiality of the survey responses. 

(b) 

Supportive Service Plan. 

The plan shall describe how the PHA will provide or arrange for the provision of the appropriate supportive services
requested by the disabled families who will occupy the designated housing and who have expressed a need for these services.


(1) 

Contents of plan. 

The supportive service plan, at a minimum, must: 

(i) Identify the number of disabled families who need the supportive services and who have expressed an interest in
receiving them; 

(ii) Describe the types of supportive services that will be provided, and, if known, the length of time the supportive
services will be available; 

(iii) Identify each service provider to be utilized, and describe the experience of the service provider in delivering
supportive services; 

(iv) Describe how the supportive services will be provided to the disabled families that the designated housing is
expected to serve (how the services will be provided depends upon the type of service offered; e.g., if the package
includes transportation assistance, how transportation assistance will be provided to disabled families);
