Foreign-Trade Zone 141_Rochester, NY; Application for Subzone Status, Gleason Corporation Plant (Gear Production
Machinery), Rochester, NY 



An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the County of Monroe, New York, grantee
of FTZ 141, requesting special-purpose subzone status for the manufacturing plant (gear production machinery)
of the Gleason Corporation (Gleason), located in Rochester, New York (``The Gleason Works''). The application was
submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations
of the Board (15 CFR part 400). It was formally filed on March 28, 1994. 

The Gleason Works (37 acres/721,371 sq.ft.) is located at 1000 University Avenue, in central Rochester (Monroe County),
New York. The facility (777 employees) is used to produce spiral bevel and parallel axis gear manufacturing equipment,
including gear generators, hobbers, grinders, sharpeners, testers, and gear lapping equipment (duty rate range:
4.4_5.8%). Components purchased from abroad (some 12% of total) include ball screws (HTS

#

 8483.40.8000, duty rate_5.7%) and process controllers (HTS

#

 8537.10.0030, 5.3%). The finished machinery is used in the automotive, aerospace, truck and heavy equipment industries.
Some 50 percent of the equipment is exported. 

Zone procedures would exempt Gleason from Customs duty payments on the foreign components used in export production.
On its domestic sales, Gleason would be able to choose the duty rates that apply to finished gear production equipment
for the foreign components noted above. The application indicates that the savings from zone procedures would help
improve Gleason's international competitiveness. 

In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been appointed examiner to investigate the
application and report to the Board. 

Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall
be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is on June
13, 1994. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during
the subsequent 15-day period (to June 27, 1994). 

A copy of the application and the accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following
locations:

 


U.S. Department of Commerce Branch Office, 111 East Avenue, suite 220, Rochester, New York 14604,

Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide from Japan: Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



On April 9, 1993 (58 FR 18374), the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 notices of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review.'' In response to the request made by Petitioners, Chemetals
Inc. and Kerr-McGee Chemical Corporation, the Department initiated the administrative review on May 27, 1993 (58
FR 30767) of the antidumping duty order on Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide (EMD) from Japan on April 17, 1989 (54 FR
15244). The review covers one manufacturer/exporter of the subject merchandise to the United States, Tosoh Corporation
(TOSOH) during the period, April 1, 1992, through March 31, 1993. The Department is conducting this review in accordance
with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act).

As a result of this review, the Department has preliminarily determined to assess antidumping duties of 77.43 percent


ad valorem 

based on best information available (BIA) for the period of review.

Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.



Scope of Review



Imports covered by the review are shipments of electrolytic manganese dioxide. EMD is manganese dioxide (MnO

2

) that has been refined in an electrolysis process. During the review period, such merchandise was classifiable under
subheading 2820.10.000 of the 

Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States 

(HTSUS). The HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written description remains
dispositive.

On January 6, 1992, the Department published a final scope ruling, 

Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide from Japan; Final Scope Ruling 

(57 FR 395; January 6, 1992), in which it affirmed that high-grade chemical manganese dioxide (CMD-U) is a ``later-developed
product'' and is included within the scope of the order on EMD from Japan. For a detailed discussion of that ruling,
see 

Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide from Japan; Preliminary Scope Ruling 

(56 FR 56977; November 7, 1991).

Preliminary Results of the Review 



This review covers EMD entries into the United States by one manufacturer/exporter, TOSOH. Given the TOSOH did not
respond to the Department's questionnaire, we consider it to be an uncooperative respondent, and have assigned to
it a margin based on best information available. Our practice, for uncooperative respondents, is to apply as BIA the
higher of (1) the highest of the rates found for any firm in the less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation or prior
administrative reviews, or (2) the highest rate found in this review for any firm (see 

Final Results of Administrative Review: Antifriction Bearings (other than Tapered Roller Bearings) from France

 (58 FR 39729, 39739, July 26, 1993)). Therefore, we used, as BIA, the highest of the rates found for any firm in the 

Final Determination of the Antidumping Duty Investigation of EMD from Japan

 (54 FR 8778, March 2, 1989), which is 77.43 percent.

As a result of this review, we preliminarily determine that the following margin exists for the review period:






The Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries for the
period of review. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service.

Furthermore, the deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise entered, or
withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of this administrative
review, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act. A cash deposit of estimated antidumping duties based on margins
for the period of April 1, 1992, through March 31, 1993, shall be required on all shipments of subject merchandise from
Japan, as follows:

(1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed company will be that established in the final results of this administrative
review;

(2) For previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be
the company-specific rate published for the most recent period;

(3) If the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a prior review, or the original LTFV investigation, but the
manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer
of the merchandise; and

(4) If neither the exporter nor the manufacturer is a firm covered in this or any previous review conducted by the Department,
the cash deposit rate will be the ``all other'' rate established in the LTFV investigation (54 FR 8778) of 73.30 percent,
as discussed below.

On May 25, 1993, the Court of International Trade, in 

Floral Trade Council 

v. 

United States,

 822 F. Supp. 766 (1993), and 

Federal Mogul Corporation 

v. 

United States, 

839 F. Supp. 864 (1993), decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company it can only be changed
through an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is
appropriate to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for
correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders.

In proceedings governed by antidumping findings (

i.e.,

 proceedings originally investigated by the Treasury Department), unless we are able to ascertain the ``all others''
rate from the Treasury LTFV investigation, the Department adopts the ``new shipper'' rate established in the first
final results of administrative review published by the Department of Commerce (or that rate as amended for correction
of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) as the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of establishing cash deposits
in all current and future administrative reviews.

Because this proceeding was investigated by the Department of Commerce, it is governed by an antidumping duty order.
Therefore, the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of this review will be 73.30 percent, the ``all others'' rate established
in the LTFV investigation (54 FR 8778).

These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next
administrative review.

This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file
a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during
this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.



Public Comment



In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments in at least seven copies must be submitted to
the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration no later than April 25, 1994, and rebuttal briefs, no later than
May 5, 1994. The Department will publish the final results of the administrative review including the results of its
analysis of issues raised in any case or rebuttal brief. We will hold a public hearing, if requested, to afford interested
parties an opportunity to comment on arguments raised in case or rebuttal briefs. Tentatively, the hearing will be
held on May 12, 1994, at 1:30 p.m. at the U.S. Department of Commerce, room 3708, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue,
NW., Washington, DC 20230. Parties should confirm by telephone the time, date, and place of the hearing 48 hours before
the scheduled time.

Interested parties who wish to request a hearing, or to participate if one is requested, must submit a written request
to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, room B-099, within ten
days of the publication of this notice. Requests should contain: (1) The party's name, address, and telephone number;
(2) the number of participants; and (3) a list of the issues to be discussed. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), oral
presentations will be limited to issues raised in the briefs.

This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On December 3, 1993, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of its administrative review of
the antidumping duty order on sweaters wholly or in chief weight of man-made fiber from Korea. The review covers 69
manufacturers/exporters and the period April 27, 1990 through August 31, 1991. 



We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on our preliminary results. Based on our analysis of the comments
received we have changed the results from those presented in the preliminary results of review.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background 



On September 24, 1990, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (55 FR 39036) the antidumping duty order on sweaters wholly or in chief weight of man-made fiber (MMF sweaters) from
Korea. On September 30, 1991, the petitioner, the National Knitwear & Sportswear Association (NKSA), requested
that we conduct an administrative review, in accordance with section 353.22(a) of the Department's regulations
(19 CFR 353.22(a)). We published the notice of initiation of the antidumping duty administrative review on October
18, 1991 (56 FR 52254), covering the period April 27, 1990 through August 31, 1991. On December 3, 1993 the Department
published the preliminary results in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 63920). The initiation notice named 69 companies. Of these 69 companies, the following six companies were selected
to be analyzed, using sampling techniques: Chunji Industrial Company, Ltd. (Chunji), Kee Ryung Industrial Company,
Ltd. (Kee Ryung), Suhcheon Company, Ltd. (Suhcheon), Tae Kwang Industrial Company, Ltd. (Tae Kwang), Young Woo &
Company, Ltd. (Young Woo), and Yurim Company, Ltd. (Yurim). The other companies included in the sample pool have received
a rate which is the simple average of the margins of these six companies. The Department has now conducted the review
in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). 



Scope of the Review 



Imports covered by this review are shipments of MMF sweaters from Korea. MMF sweaters are defined as garments for outerwear
that are knitted or crocheted, in a variety of forms including jacket, vest, cardigan with button or zipper front,
or pullover, usually having ribbing around the neck, bottom, and cuffs on the sleeves (if any), encompassing garments
of various lengths, wholly or in chief weight of man-made fiber. The term ``in chief weight of man-made fiber'' includes
sweaters where the man-made fiber material predominates by weight over each other single textile material. This
excludes sweaters 23 percent or more by weight of wool. It includes men's, women's, boys', or girls' sweaters, as defined
above, but does not include sweaters for infants 24 months of age or younger. It includes all sweaters as defined above,
regardless of the number of stitches per centimeter, provided that, with regard to sweaters having more than nine
stitches per two linear centimeters horizontally, it includes only those with a knit-on rib at the bottom.

Garments which extend below mid-thigh or cardigans that contain a sherpa lining or heavy-weight fiberfill lining,
including quilted linings, used to provide extra warmth to the wearer, are not considered sweaters and are excluded
from the scope of the review. Also specifically excluded from the scope are sweaters assembled in Guam that are produced
from knit-to-shape component parts knit in and imported from Korea and entering under Harmonized Tariff Schedule
(HTS) item number 9902.61. 
The subject merchandise is currently classifiable under HTS item numbers 6110.30.30.10, 6110.30.30.15, 6110.30.30.20,
6110.30.30.25, 6103.23.00.70, 6103.29.10.40, 6103.29.20.62, 6104.23.00.40, 6104.29.10.60, 6104.29.20.60,
6110.30.10.10, 6110.30.10.20, 6110.30.20.10, and 6110.30.20.20. This merchandise may also enter under HTS item
numbers 6110.30.30.50 and 6110.30.30.55. The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes
only. The written description remains dispositive. 


Analysis of the Comments Received 


We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results of review. We received collective
comments from Chunji, Kee Ryung, Suhcheon, Tae Kwang, Young Woo, and Yurim. No interested party submitted a rebuttal.



Comment 1: 


Respondents argue that the Department's excessive reliance on constructed value (CV) distorted the calculation
of the dumping margins. They contend that the Department should rely on CV as the basis for foreign market value (FMV)
only with respect to U.S. sales for which there are no similar, above-cost, contemporaneous models sold in the third-country
market. They note that 19 U.S.C. 1677b(a)(1) directs the Department to base FMV on home market prices or, if home market
sales are inadequate, third-country prices, unless there are insufficient sales above cost in the appropriate market.

Respondents claim that the Department's use of the ``10/90/10'' test on a product-specific basis is inappropriate
and contrary to the mandate of the antidumping statute because it leads the Department to disregard infrequent below-cost
sales. As respondents explain the test, if between 10 and 90 percent of third-country sales are below cost, the Department
excludes below-cost sales, basing FMV on the remaining above-cost sales. If over 90 percent of third-country sales
are below cost, the Department excludes all third-country sales and bases FMV entirely on CV. Below-cost sales are
included in the calculation of CV if the volume of such sales is less than ten percent. Respondents claim that in past
cases, including the original investigation, the Department has applied the 10/90/10 test on total sales of such
or similar merchandise, and argue that this approach contemplates that, under some circumstances, all sales of certain
models may be below cost because the sales may be of obsolete or end-of-the-year models. They argue that when the test
is applied on a product-specific basis, the sales of such models will almost always be disregarded in calculating
the FMV even though, viewed in the aggregate, they are infrequent in number. 
Respondents state that the Department has recently begun applying a two-tiered 10/90/10 system in which first the
Department applies the test, called the ``macro test,'' to total third-country sales; if the macro test indicates
that between 10 and 90 percent of total sales are below cost, the Department then applies a second 10/90/10 test, called
the ``micro test,'' to each individual model sold in the third country. Respondents go on to say that, more recently,
the Department has in several cases applied only the micro test. 
Respondents contend that the Department's reliance solely on the micro test is particularly distortive in this proceeding,
because there is frequently only one sale for each individual product. In many instances, therefore, the third-country
product will be either totally above or totally below cost, even though only an insignificant fraction of total third-country
sales may be below cost. They argue that the Department should have used the alternate third-country price data for
the next most similar model in calculating the FMV since they have provided ample third-country price data for the
top three most similar models. 
Respondents also contend that the Department, in considering only one particular third-country model as ``such
or similar merchandise,'' compounds its bias for CV. Respondents claim that a large number of physical differences
in sweaters make precise systemization and quantification of such differences for model matching purposes impossible.
Identification of a single best match is, therefore, highly arbitrary. They argue that, by contrast, pricing and
cost are not arbitrary because exporters face the same cost curve and compete based on relative mark-up. They contend
that for their six firms there are, on average, 50 third-country models within a 20 percent cost range for each U.S.
model. Respondents also claim that the Department's refusal to use prices for alternative third-country merchandise
is tantamount to finding that there is only one ``such or similar'' third-country match for each U.S. model. 
Respondents ask that for the final results the Department use CV only if there are insufficient above-cost sales of
similar products in the third country. They suggest that the Department implement this method by dropping all below-cost
third-country sales before creating its product concordance, thereby matching U.S. sales only to above-cost third-country
sales.

Department's Position:

 
We disagree with respondents that we relied excessively on CV. Specifically, we disagree with their claim that a ``macro''
test, rather than a model-specific, or ``micro,'' test, is the appropriate method of determining what below-cost
sales should be disregarded. Section 773(b) of the Tariff Act directs us to disregard below-cost sales in calculating
FMV. As FMV is based on a model-specific comparison and focuses on the prices actually used for FMV, employing a model-specific
methodology is the most appropriate approach to the 10/90/10 test. For this reason, we have rejected using the ``macro''
test and have only tested individual models for sales below-cost. 


 We also disagree with respondents' argument that we should drop all below-cost third-country sales before creating
our product concordance, or model-match groupings. Section 771(16) of the Tariff Act defines such or similar merchandise
and provides a hierarchy of preferences for determining which merchandise sold in the foreign market is most similar
to the merchandise sold in the United States. Whether a model is sold in the home market or third countries at prices
below cost is not a criterion for determining what is most similar merchandise under the statute. Therefore, we rejected
the product concordances proposed by respondents, which eliminated most similar models when those models were sold
at prices below cost. 


 In determining whether third-country sales were made at prices below the cost of production (COP), we compared the
sales prices of each model to its COP. Below-cost sales were disregarded on a model-specific basis in accordance with
the 10/90/10 rule. If we found that less than 10 percent of the sales of a model were made at less than cost, we included
all third-country sales of that model in the calculation of FMV. If between 10 and 90 percent of third-country sales
of a specific model were made at less than cost, we disregarded those sales made at less than cost and used the above-cost
sales in the price comparisons. If more than 90 percent of third-country sales of a model were made at less than cost
we disregarded all sales of that model. 


 For the preliminary results, where there were more than one equally similar model, in accordance with our model match
criteria as set out in Appendix V of our questionnaire, we selected a single most similar model, based on the cost differences
between the third-country and U.S. models. That is, we selected the one with the lowest cost difference. If more than
90 percent of the sales of a model chosen as the most similar third-country model were below cost, we used CV as the basis
of FMV. For these final results, rather than choose the single most similar model based on cost differences, we used
the pool of equally similar models as long as those models were within the 20 percent cost differential. When there
was more than one equally similar above-cost model, we adjusted the FMV of each model for differences in merchandise,
and then weight averaged the results. If any of these models were found to be below cost, we excluded them from our analysis
and used only the above-cost models. 


 

Comment 2:

 
Respondents argue that in calculating COP for the final results, the Department should use the respondents' 1990
selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) rather than the 1990-91 average SG&A. They contend
that most sales in this review were produced in 1990, and because MMF sweater production and shipments vary from season
to season, SG&A for a full fiscal year should be used. 


 

Department's Position:

 We agree with the respondents that we should use SG&A expense data from full fiscal years to account for seasonality.
All the data which were averaged for the preliminary review results were, in fact, full fiscal year data, derived from
the companies' annual financial statements. We disagree, however, with respondents' argument that we should rely
exclusively on 1990 SG&A. For the final results for Kee Ryung, Suhcheon, Young Woo, and Yurim, whose fiscal years
are also the calendar year, the period of review includes an equal number of months from each of the fiscal years and,
therefore, we have continued to use a simple average of 1990 and 1991 SG&A. For Chunji, we have continued to add
Chunji's SG&A for the fiscal year July 1, 1990 through June 30, 1991, to the average of its related company's SG&A
for the fiscal/calendar years 1990 and 1991. Twelve of the 16 review months occurred during the July 1, 1990 through
June 30, 1991 period; of the remaining four months, we have data only for the two months in the prior fiscal year, but
not for the two months in the subsequent fiscal year. Thus, it is appropriate to only use SG&A expenses from the
one fiscal year for Chunji. For Tae Kwang, we used a weighted average SG&A, weighted three-fourths for the fiscal
year covering the period September 1, 1990 through August 31, 1991, and one-fourth for the fiscal year covering the
period September 1, 1989 through August 31, 1990, since twelve months of the review period occurred in the first fiscal
year, and four months occurred in the second. 


 

Comment 3:

 
Respondents state that the Department incorrectly adjusted for the value added tax (VAT), by increasing reported
costs such as foreign inland freight, foreign brokerage, containerization, commissions and packing, by 10 percent
for both the U.S. and third-country sales. Respondents contend that VATs ``paid'' on purchases of goods and services
are not costs because they are rebated upon payment and thus do not constitute an expense to the company.

They state that the VAT adjustment probably did not affect dumping margins where net U.S. prices were compared to net
third-country prices, but it likely resulted in more below-cost sales which, in turn, increased the dumping margin.
They state that the Department should recalculate costs and exclude the relevant VATs. 


 

Department's Position:

 We agree with respondents and have changed our calculations accordingly. 


 

Comment 4:

 
Respondents contend that the Department should not include U.S. and third-country sample sales and resales in its
dumping calculations. Resales occurred when a customer cancelled an order, and the manufacturer found another buyer
for the merchandise. They argue that these sales did not occur in the ordinary course of trade and that their inclusion
affected the dumping margins. They claim that sample sales and resales are unrepresentative of sales routinely undertaken
by Korean companies, and that the inclusion of such sales is patently unfair, as they are not a means of price discrimination,
but of promoting sweater sales and disposing of small volumes of cancelled orders. 


 Respondents argue that the Department has in the past excluded small quantity/high price sales when the transactions
in question are ``trial sales for evaluation'' or ``sales of sample merchandise'' and are ``not for consumption but
rather for evaluation purposes.'' To support this argument they cite Tapered Roller Bearings; Finished and Unfinished,
and Parts Thereof, From Japan; Final Results of Antidumping Administrative Review, 57 FR 4951, 4959 (February 11,
1992) (TRBs from Japan), and Granular Polytetrafluoroethylene Resin from Japan; Final Results of Antidumping Duty
Administrative Review, 58 FR 50343, 50345 (September 27, 1993) (PTFE from Japan). 


 

Department's Position:

 It is our established practice not to exclude sample sales or resales in the U.S. market in administrative reviews,
and respondents provide no justification for doing so in this case. There is no statutory or regulatory authority
for excluding U.S. sales from review. Section 353.46(a) provides for the exclusion of sales made outside the ordinary
course of trade from the calculation of FMV; however, no such provision is made for disregarding sales made outside
the ordinary course of trade from the calculation of U.S. price. In a less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation
we have the discretion to eliminate unusual sales from our analysis; in an administrative review, however, the statute
and the regulations require that we analyze all U.S. sales, except when sampling techniques are used. (See 19 U.S.C.
1677f-1; 19 C.F.R. 353.59 (1994). See, also, Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews and Revocation
in Part of an Antidumping Duty Order; Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof
From France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Romania, Singapore, Sweden, Thailand, and the United Kingdom, 58 FR 39729, 39776
(July 26, 1993) and Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review; Portable Electric Typewriters from
Japan, 56 FR 14072, 14079 (April 5, 1991).) In PTFE from Japan we noted that, historically, the Department has considered
all transactions to be sales whenever ownership transfers to an unrelated party. Due to the peculiar nature of PTFE
resin, the consideration of transfer of ownership was inapplicable, because samples of resin, once used in testing,
could not be returned in the original form to the seller. In the present case, sample sales made in the United States
involved a transfer of ownership between parties, and respondents have not shown the existence of any special circumstances,
such as obtained in PTFE from Japan, that would cause us to deviate from our practice. TRBs from Japan, which respondents
cite, does not address sample sales and resales in the United States. 


 We have in the past excluded sales outside the ordinary course of trade only in the home and third-country markets for
administrative reviews. In order for us to exclude sales, a firm must provide substantial evidence that such sales
are outside the ordinary course of trade. (See Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review; Antifriction
Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts From France, et al. 57 FR 28360, 28395 (June 24, 1992).) Respondents
in this case have not provided convincing evidence that third-country sample sales and resales were outside the ordinary
course of trade. 


 For the final results, we attempted, when possible, to match sample sales in the United States to sample sales in the
third country, and resales in the United States to resales in the third country, within the constraints of our model-matching
criteria.

Final Results of Review



As a result of our review, we determine that the following margins exist:






The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
Individual differences between U.S. price and FMV may vary from the percentages stated above. The Department will
issue appraisement instructions on each exporter directly to the Customs Service.

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of this notice of final results
of review for all shipments of MMF sweaters from Korea entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or
after the publication date, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit rates for the reviewed
companies will be those established in the final results of this administrative review; (2) for previously investigated
companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the
LTFV investigation; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review or the LTFV investigation, but the manufacturer
is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established in the LTFV investigation for the manufacturer of the merchandise;
and (4) the cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters will be the ``all others'' rate of 1.30 percent
established in the final notice of LTFV investigation of this case, in accordance with the Court of International
Trade's decisions in 

Floral Trade Council

 v. 

United States,

 822 F.Supp 766 (1993), and 

Federal-Mogul Corporation and the Torrington Company

 v. 

United States,

 839 F.Supp 864 (1993). Since the margin for Tae Kwang is less than 0.50 percent and, therefore, 

de minimis

 for cash deposit purposes, the Department will instruct customs to collect a cash deposit of zero antidumping duties
on entries from Tae Kwang. These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of
the final results of the next administrative review. 
This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 


Notification to Interested Parties 


This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their responsibility
concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d).
Timely written notification of return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order
is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is a sanctionable violation. 
This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 
19 CFR 353.22.

 Notice of intent to make a noncompetitive financial assistance award.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 The Department of Energy (DOE), Richland Operations Office (RL) announces that pursuant to Public Law 95-224
and section 646 of the Department of Energy Organization Act, it intends to make a discretionary financial assistant
award based on the criterion set forth in 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(B) to the Yakima Indian Nation (YIN), Toppenish, Washington,
under Cooperative Agreement Number DE-FC06-94RL 12914. The primary purpose of the cooperative agreement
is the replenishment of chinook salmon in the Columbia River. This one year effort will have a total estimated cost
of $170,000, of which $120,000 will be provided by DOE and $50,000 will be provided by YIN.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 In support of the transformation within the Department of Energy as it redirects its focus from a primarily mission-oriented,
inward-facing agency to a service-oriented, customer-driven agency, the Secretary of Energy has implemented plans
for supporting economic development and community assistance activities around DOE sites affected by changing
program missions. Each Operations Office has been charged with notifying the public of available facilities, technology
partnership opportunities and economic development and diversification programs for the purpose of stimulating
local economic growth through community partnerships. In addition, as part of the cleanup and restoration mission
for the Hanford Site and the nearby Columbia River, plans for replenishing, replacing and enhancing the stock of returning
chinook salmon to this area are encouraged. With the closure of all nuclear reactors on the Hanford Site, a number of
facilities have become available for use by others. The Yakima Indian Nation is proposing to use water treatment pools
located at the site of the former 100 Area K-E reactor for the purpose of rearing and acclimating one-half million upriver
bright fall chinook salmon. It is anticipated that some portion of the juvenile fall chinook salmon reared and released
as a result of this project will return as adults. These returning adults will contribute to the area economy by increasing
the salmon available for tribal, commercial, and sports fishermen. In addition, some of these returning adults will
spawn naturally to continue the cycle for future generations. The ultimate goal is to restore the chinook salmon to
its historic level in the Columbia River. The Yakima Indian Nation, as co-manager of the Columbia River salmon resources,
has coordinated the development of the project with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife, the National
Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The project has also been authorized and endorsed
by the 1993-94 Columbia River Production Agreement in which the Yakima Indian Nation was identified as the lead
agency for implementing this project.

<DOCTITLE>Climate Change Action Plan; Regional Roundtables</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of roundtables. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. DOE is announcing the first two in a series of regional roundtables to solicit comments and feedback from stakeholders,
which include state and local officials, utility representatives, industry representatives, public interest
groups and other interested parties on the Climate Change Action Plan, the Clinton Administration's blueprint for
stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 19, 1993, President Clinton made a national commitment to stabilizing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
at 1990 levels by the year 2000. The blueprint for achieving this goal is known as the Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP),
a volume of 46 emissions-reducing ``actions'' the U.S. will take during the remainder of the decade. The Plan is founded
on the principle that cost-effective energy efficiency programs provide energy cost reductions that more than offset
the investment to increase efficiency. The CCAP focuses on and accelerates the implementation of the Energy Policy
Act of 1992. As a result, the overall Plan is estimated to require no net increase in Federal funding as it creates jobs,
reduces home and business energy bills, and induces over $60 billion in new domestic investment. 



The Department of Energy's (DOE's) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy has the responsibility for implementing
the renewable energy and energy efficiency actions in the President's plan. An executive summary of the Plan may be
obtained by calling DOE, (202) 586-7541. Several other Federal agencies and offices have important implementation
responsibilities for the remaining actions and for other aspects of the Plan. 



DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and the National Association of State Energy Officials will
conduct regional roundtables to solicit comments and feedback on the Climate Change Action Plan. 
The purpose of the roundtables is to describe and solicit feedback on DOE's preliminary proposals to implement its
actions under the Plan. Rather than design individual implementation plans, however, DOE has examined its implementation
responsibilities from the standpoint of comprehensiveness, integration, and leverage. As a result, DOE has developed
an implementation approach that has the potential to integrate all CCAP activities, not only into DOE's programs,
but also into other energy efficiency activities and programs. 



Through these roundtables DOE hopes to begin soliciting input from a wide variety of stakeholders. The agency seeks
feedback on the comprehensive strategy as well as specifics of proposed implementation activities. Comments or
questions from the public may be submitted in person or in writing at the roundtable. Following the roundtable, written
comments or questions may be sent to the address listed above. For several of the actions, DOE presents several implementation
options rather than a single proposed implementation plan. In these instances, DOE seeks input that will help guide
our selection of one of these options. 



The roundtable format will provide a forum for representatives from state and local governments, utilities, industry,
public interest groups and other interested parties to provide comments. The roundtable format is sufficiently
flexible to allow participants to offer comments, either on specific actions or on the entire package, through the
use of breakout sessions for key groups of actions. All comments will be considered. Facilitators will be provided
for each session. A copy of a summary of the roundtable proceedings may be obtained by calling or writing to the address
listed above.

PacifiCorp Electric Operations; Availability of Environmental Assessment


April 7, 1994.


In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for a new license for the existing Cutler Project, located on the Bear River in Cache and Box Elder Counties,
Utah, near Logan, and has prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the project. In the EA, the Commission's staff
has analyzed the existing and potential future environmental impacts of the project and has concluded that issuance
of a new license for the project, with appropriate environmental protection and enhancement measures, would not
constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.
Copies of the EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.

<DOCTITLE>Northwest Pipeline Corp., et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings </DOCTITLE>


April 5, 1994. 


Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 


1. Northwest Pipeline Corp.


[Docket No. CP94-316-000] 



Take notice that on March 30, 1994, Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest), 295 Chipeta Way, Salt Lake City,
Utah 84158, filed in Docket No. CP94-316-000 a request pursuant to   157.205, 157.211 and
157.216 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.211, and 157.216) for authorization
to replace certain metering facilities at its Wenatchee Meter Station (Wenatchee Station) in Chelan County, Washington
to maintain the ability to accommodate its existing firm maximum daily delivery obligations (MDDO) to Cascade Natural
Gas Corporation (Cascade), under Northwest's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-433-000
pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 

Northwest states that its Wenatchee Station has a maximum design delivery capacity of approximately 19,334 Dt/d
(at 225 psig) from Northwest's Wenatchee Lateral into Cascade's distribution system. Northwest further states
that it is presently contractually obligated to deliver up to 12,214 Dt per day to Cascade at the Wenatchee delivery
point, (8,740 Dt/d of transportation which is provided under a Rate Schedule TF-1 agreement pursuant to Subpart
G of Part 284, and 3,474 Dt/d of storage which is provided under a Rate Schedule SGS-1). 
Northwest is specifically proposing to replace four obsolete regulators (two 4 inch regulators and two 2 inch regulators),
with two new 2 inch regulators. Northwest avers that replacing the four obsolete regulators with the two new 2 inch
regulators will decrease the maximum design capacity of the Wenatchee Station from 19,334 Dt/d to approximately
12,367 Dt/d at a pressure of 225 psig. It is stated that the smaller design capacity still will be adequate to deliver
the current MDDO of 12,214 Dt/d at the Wenatchee point. It is further stated that during the past four years, the actual
peak day deliveries have not exceeded the proposed design capacity of this delivery point.

Northwest states that the total cost of replacing the described facilities at the Wenatchee Station is estimated
to be approximately $13,325, including the cost of removing the old facilities. It is stated that since the proposed
facility upgrade is necessary to replace obsolete equipment, Northwest will not require any cost reimbursement
from Cascade. 



Comment date

: May 20, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 



2. Trunkline LNG Co.


[Docket No. CP87-418-003] 



Take notice that on March 29, 1994, Trunkline LNG Company (TLC), P.O. Box 1642, Houston, Texas 77251-1642, filed
in Docket No. CP87-418-003 an application pursuant to section 7(c) 
of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's regulations thereunder for a certificate amendment and clarification
of the applicable tariff provisions to the existing authorization 
wherein TLC provides liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal service to Pan National Gas Sales, Inc. (Pan National).
TLC is not requesting a change in the shipping cost currently included in the Cost of service calculation specifically
designed for shipment of Algerian LNG to TLC. TLC is requesting authorization to utilize a shipping cost of $27,937
per day plus actual port costs for affiliated shipping of non-Algerian LNG or the actual shipping cost, when using
non-affiliated shipping. TLC also requests clarification that TLC is authorized to provide terminal service to
Pan National, regardless of the origin of the LNG, or in the alternative, the necessary amendment to allow such transactions.




Comment date:

 April 26, 1994, in accordance with the first paragraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 



3. Southern Natural Gas Co.


[Docket No. CP94-321-000] 



Take notice that on March 31, 1994, Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern), Post Office Box 2563, Birmingham, Alabama
35202-2563, filed in Docket No. CP94-321-000 a request pursuant to   157.205 and 157.211
of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205 and 157.211) for authorization to modify
its operations at an existing meter station in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana required to implement an interruptible
transportation service for Natural Gas Clearinghouse, under the blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP88-316-000,
pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection.

Southern proposes to modify an existing receiving station in order to deliver gas to Wichita River Oil Corporation
(Wichita) for use as gas lift gas at its production facilities in Jefferson Parish Louisiana. Southern plans to modify
the meter station on its 4-inch Three Bayou Bay Line in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, by reversing the existing 2-inch
meter to enable Southern to deliver gas to Wichita at that location. Southern estimates that the cost of modifying
the meter station is approximately $10,100 for which Wichita has agreed to reimburse Southern. 

Southern states that it will transport gas to Wichita pursuant to the existing service agreement between Southern
and Natural Gas Clearinghouse under Southern's rate schedule IT. Natural Gas Clearinghouse has requested transportation
of the gas for delivery at the meter station by having the meter station added as a delivery point to the service agreement
under Southern's tariff. Southern further states that Wichita anticipates receiving on average 200 Mcf of natural
gas per day and 4,000 Mcf per year at the proposed facilities. Southern states that the operation of the proposed facilities
will have no significant effect on its peak day or annual requirements.

<DOCTITLE>Missouri; Final Program Determination of Full Adequacy of State/Tribal Municipal Solid Waste Landfill Permit Program
</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of final determination of full program adequacy for Missouri's application. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal
solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator waste will
comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate
issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation
Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve State/Tribal landfill permit
programs. EPA intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus,
these determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, State/Tribes
may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have
an important benefit. Approved State/Tribal permit programs provide interaction between the State/Tribe and the
owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in State/Tribes
with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by 40 CFR part 258. To the extent the
State/Tribal permit program allows such flexibility, 40 CFR part 258 will apply to all permitted and unpermitted
MSWLF facilities. 


Missouri applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA reviewed Missouri's application
and proposed a determination that Missouri's MSWLF permit program is adequate to ensure compliance with 40 CFR part
258. After consideration of all comments received, EPA is today issuing a final determination that Missouri's program
is adequate.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A. Background 



On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by
the Hazardous and Solid Waste amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure
that facilities comply with the Federal Criteria under 40 CFR part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that
EPA determine the adequacy of State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply
with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing
a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs
must satisfy to be determined adequate. 
The EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of the STIR. EPA interprets
the requirements for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permit or other forms of prior approval
to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing
MSWLFs that are technically comparable to 40 CFR part 258. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue a
permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also must
provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA. Finally,
EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement authorities
to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program. 
EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation
outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for the evaluation when it proposes the STIR. EPA expects
States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives full approval to
a MSWLF program.

B. State of Missouri 


On September 17, 1993, Missouri submitted an application for adequacy determination for Missouri's municipal solid
waste landfill permit program. On November 19, 1993, EPA published a tentative determination of adequacy for all
portions of Missouri's program. Further background on the tentative determination of adequacy appears at 58 FR 61090
(November 19, 1993). 
Along with the tentative determination, EPA announced the availability of the application for public comment and
the date of a public hearing on the application. The public hearing was held on January 4, 1994. Additionally, Missouri
Department of Natural Resources (MDNR), Solid Waste Program provided a public availability session immediately
following that public hearing to discuss issues relating to specific sites and enforcement actions. 
The EPA received the following comments on its tentative determination of full program adequacy for Missouri's MSWLF
permit program. Several comments not directly relating to the program adequacy tentative determination, e.g.,
those relating to a specific facility and enforcement action by MDNR, were deferred to MDNR's public availability
session that followed the public hearing. EPA's response to the comments relating to the tentative determination
follows each comment below: 
One commenter asked if the STIR had been finalized. 


EPA response:

 EPA is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule that will provide procedures by which the EPA
will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill permit programs. The STIR is currently used as a guidance
document by states, tribes and the EPA regions in interpreting and complying with the requirements of 40 CFR part 258.

One commenter asked how changes in the federal regulations will impact an approved state. 


EPA response: 

The states will be provided a mechanism and time frames for upgrading their programs to comply with federal regulations.

Another commenter asked how changes in an approved state's regulations will impact the state's approval. 


EPA response: 

A state that changes its regulations and becomes more stringent is required under the Memorandum or Agreement that
is part of the application, to keep EPA's regional office informed. A state that enacts less stringent requirements
may endanger its approval or partial approval. 
One commenter asked if EPA provides funding to the state under subtitle D. 


EPA response: 

EPA provides funding for certain training and demonstration grants. However, these funds may not be expended for
staff salaries or costs to operate the state agency's basic permit program. 
One commenter asserted that the state has traditionally been responsive to the environmental needs under the regulations
and has been in the forefront as far as staying in step with technology. For example, liquids and hazardous wastes were
banned from Missouri solid waste landfills before it became a federal requirement and therefore the contaminant
levels in leachate produced by Missouri landfills are less than in other states. 


EPA response: 

EPA is aware that Missouri imposed this requirement before it was required by the federal regulations. EPA's approval
of MDNR's program is not intended to prevent the state from taking advantage of technological advancements or imposing
more stringent requirements. 
One commenter asked, with regard to the MDNR inspection and enforcement program, when offenses are committed over
and over again for a particular facility why the offender is given repeated chances to comply and not considered an
habitual violator. 


EPA response: 

EPA deferred this response to the MDNR staff at the hearing, who stated that under the state of Missouri's rules a landfill
operator must have some sort of formal enforcement action, e.g., abatement order or court order, taken against it
before they would be classified an habitual violator. Additionally, EPA responded that the application by the state
described the requisite elements of an inspection and compliance program that are required for state program approval.

One commenter asked what sort of activity warrants formal enforcement action. 


EPA response: 

EPA deferred this response to MDNR staff who were present at the public hearing, who stated that when an owner/operator
has significant ongoing violations which it refuses to address at the site, it is at this point that formal enforcement
action begins.

One commenter asked what is industrial waste under the regulations. 



EPA response:

 As defined in 40 CFR 258.2, Definitions, ``Industrial solid waste means solid waste generated by manufacturing or
industrial processes that is not a hazardous waste regulated under subtitle C of RCRA.'' The MDNR definition of solid
waste as written in the 1993 revision of RSMo 260.200(25) includes industrial waste. RSMo 260.200(25) states, ```

Solid Waste

', garbage, refuse and other discarded materials including, but not limited to, solid and semisolid waste materials
resulting from industrial, commercial, agricultural, governmental, and domestic activities, but does not include
hazardous waste as defined in   260.30 to 260.432, recovered materials, overburden, rock, tailings,
matte, slag or other waste material resulting from mining milling or smelting;'' EPA finds that these definitions
as they categorize industrial waste are consistent with each other. 

One commenter concerned about the integrity of ground-water testing asked whether EPA requires that ground water
testing be done by MDNR or by independent laboratories. 



EPA response:

 The regulations at 40 CFR Part 258.53, Ground-water sampling and analysis requirements, place the responsibility
of ground-water sampling on the landfill owner or operator. Samples are generally analyzed by independent laboratories.
The landfill owner or operator must place detailed information in the operating record on the sampling and analysis
plan. This information must include procedures and techniques for: (1) Sample collection; (2) Sample preservation
and shipment; (3) Analytical procedures; (4) Chain of custody; and (5) Quality assurance and quality control. This
procedure ensures the integrity of the sampling and analysis process. MDNR requires that landfills either perform
their own sampling or contract with a third party to sample all monitoring wells for a list of constituents that includes
all the constituents required by the federal rule, plus six additional constituents. The state requirements for
sample collection, sample preservation and shipment, analytical procedures, chain of custody and quality assurance/quality
control are identical to the federal regulations. 

Several comments were received voicing the concerns about MDNR's funding and its ability to operate an effective
enforcement program. 



EPA response:

 EPA deferred this response to MDNR staff at the hearing, who stated that they have adequate resources to cover MDNR's
responsibilities. MDNR added that no state can have an inspector at a landfill at all times, but that it conducts quarterly
inspections and periodic inspections as a result of complaints. EPA responded that MDNR's program is viewed as adequate.


One commenter questioned if 60 mil. thickness was the minimum requirement for the flexible membrane landfill liners
and if it was adequate for ground water protection. 



EPA response:

 The regulations at 40 CFR  258.40 (b) state that ``* * * the uppermost component of the composite
liner must consist of a minimum 30-mil flexible membrane liner.'' Also, those regulations state that the ``flexible
membrane liner components consisting of high density polyethylene (HDPE) shall be at least 60 mil. thick.'' Appendix
E of 40 CFR part 258 states, ``Based on EPA's experience with these liner materials, these are the minimum thicknesses
necessary to ensure adequate liner performance, including being able to withstand the stress of construction and
to ensure that adequate seams can be made.'' 

One commenter asked what MDNR is going to do about enforcing leachate treatment requirements. 



EPA response:

 EPA deferred this response to MDNR staff at the hearing, who stated that MDNR conducts quarterly inspections and periodic
inspections as a result of complaints. EPA considers this an adequate enforcement response. 

A commenter asked whether the state has a requirement for the number of personnel to work at landfills of a certain size?




EPA response:

 EPA deferred this response to MDNR staff at the hearing, who stated that Missouri requires that owner/operators of
a landfill employ a sufficient number of personnel to ensure that the landfill will be properly operated in accordance
with their approved operating plans and will not cause a public nuisance or health hazard. The owner/operator is also
required to have at least one certified solid waste technician. These individuals are provided training by MDNR in
the proper operation and construction of landfills. The department does not require additional personnel based
on the amount of waste received.

A commenter asked what constitutes a random inspection by MDNR. 



EPA response: 

EPA deferred this response to MDNR staff. According to MDNR waste received at a landfill should be inspected by an individual
who has been trained to recognize hazardous and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) wastes. The loads can be spot-checked,
e.g., every third truck. This inspection is a supplement to an inspection of waste by equipment operators at the working
face to ensure that hazardous and other prohibited wastes are not deposited at any sanitary landfills. 

A commenter asked what are the time frames in which the public should be notified of an application or public hearing.




EPA response: 

EPA deferred this response to MDNR staff at the hearing, who stated that the public is required to be informed by a governmental
body at least 24 hours in advance of a public meeting (section 610.020, RSMo.). The MDNR Solid Waste Management Program
(SWMP) attempts to inform the public of impending hearings at least 30 days in advance of any public hearing. 

A commenter stated that she would like to know prior to the public hearing what is acceptable in a public hearing on a
permit or application. She wanted to be informed prior to the hearing whether there are certain issues which will not
be addressed in the public hearing and if there is a certain format in which issues are to be addressed. 



EPA response: 

EPA deferred this response to MDNR staff at the public hearing. They stated that at a public hearing on a permit MDNR
is only allowed to consider comments that relate to the technical suitability of a site. The department cannot legally
consider adjacent property values, traffic impacts, land use compatibility, or other non-technical considerations.
Missouri law is designed to consider these concerns at the local level before receipt of an application by the department.
The department allows citizens to comment on any issue related to a landfill permit application. However, because
of time constraints of a public hearing, the department tries to focus on comments that the department has the statutory
authority to address. 

A commenter asked how long the public comment period is on a permit application. 



EPA response: 

EPA deferred this response to MDNR staff present at the public hearing, who stated that there is not a statutory time
frame for public comment on a proposed sanitary landfill. The SWMP allows a period of at least 30 days and extending
the public comment period through two weeks from the date of the public hearing. However, comments received by the
program that have a direct impact on the technical review of a project are accepted and considered up to the date of a
permit decision. 

One commenter recommends that there should be some kind of requirement on the distance a landfill may be located from
a residence. 



EPA response: 

EPA deferred this response to MDNR staff present at the public hearing, who stated that the department does not have
the statutory ability to regulate the distance from a landfill to an adjacent property owner's building. However,
there is a requirement that the disposal area of a sanitary landfill cannot be any closer than fifty feet (50
') from the boundary of the landfill property. Additionally, the federal regulations do not contain a buffer
zone between a disposal area and adjacent residences. 

One commenter asked what citizens who are dissatisfied with the operation of a landfill should do. 



EPA response: 

If there are concerns having to do with the operation of the landfill itself, it is appropriate to contact MDNR. EPA
added, if the issues involve problems off the site, they are generally outside the jurisdiction of the department.
These are issues which fall under the jurisdiction of the local government. 

Two commenters at the public hearing, when asked by MDNR staff at the public hearing whether or not they supported approval
of Missouri's landfill permit program, stated that because the state is better equipped than EPA to run a well regulated
program, they supported approval of MDNR's program. However, the commenters were concerned that MDNR be made aware
of problems they saw in its enforcement program, and improving its program. 



EPA response: 

EPA believes that the responses of the MDNR staff at the public hearing, and the fact that MDNR held a public availability
session immediately following the hearing, demonstrates MDNR's willingness to improve its enforcement and public
involvement obligations under an approved program. Whatever deficiencies may be alleged in enforcement at a particular
site, EPA concludes that overall MDNR is committed to enforcement at each permitted facility and to undertake meaningful
public involvement in its permitting. 



C. Decision 



After reviewing the public comments, I conclude that Missouri's application for adequacy determination meets all
of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, Missouri is granted a determination
of adequacy for all portions of its municipal solid waste permit program.

Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce
40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained in the preamble to the final
MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal program approved
by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991). 

Today's action takes effect on the date of publication. EPA believes it has good cause under section 553(d) of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(d), to put this action into effect less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. All of the requirements and obligations in the State's/Tribe's program are already in effect as a matter of State/Tribal
law. EPA's action today does not impose any new requirements that the regulated community must begin to comply with.
Nor do these requirements become enforceable by EPA as federal law. Consequently, EPA finds that it does not need to
give notice prior to making its approval effective. 



Compliance With Executive Order 12866 



The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order
12866. 



Certification Under The Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This notice,
therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

<DOCTITLE>Receipt of Application for Emergency Exemption to use 2,4-D; Solicitation of Public Comment </DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has received a specific exemption request from the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (hereafter referred
to as the ``Applicant'') for use of the pesticide 2,4-D (EPA Reg. No. 264-2) to control Common waterplantain
on up to 20,000 acres of wild rice in Minnesota. In accordance with 40 CFR 166.24, EPA is soliciting public comment before
making the decision on whether or not to grant the exemption. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator
may, at her discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency
conditions exist which require such exemption.



The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific exemption for the use of the herbicide, 2,4-D,
available as Weedar 64 (EPA Reg. No. 264-2) from Rhone-Poulenc Ag Company, to control Common waterplantain
(waterplantain) which develops a dense leaf canopy in wild rice fields and can, in extreme cases, reduce wild rice
yields by more than 90 percent. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of this request.


According to the Applicant, waterplantain is found in nearly all Minnesota fields which have been cropped continuously
to wild rice. Established waterplantain grows from old root stocks early in the spring and plants emerge from the water
two to three weeks before wild rice. The emergence of waterplantain prior to wild rice negatively impacts the early
stages of the rice's development. Knowledgeable experts indicate that it is not unreasonable for fields infested
with waterplantain to experience 50 percent yield losses. No herbicides are currently registered for use on wild
rice because of a ruling by EPA that disallowed chemicals that are registered for use on ``rice'' to be used on wild rice
because of differences in taxonomy and growing practices of the two crops. Non-chemical control by hand-weeding
or mechanical cultivation is not practical due to necessary flooding of wild rice fields.

Under the proposed exemption a maximum of one application could be applied, at a rate of 8.0 fl. oz. of product (0.25
lb. a.i.) per acre. A maximum of 1,375 gal. of product or 5,500 lbs. a.i. could be applied in 1994. Applications would
be made between May 1 and July 31, 1994.

This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing section 18
require that the Agency publish notice of receipt in the 

Federal Register

 and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption if an emergency exemption has been requested
or granted for that use in any 3 previous years, and a complete application for registration of that use has not been
submitted to the Agency [40 CFR 166.24 (a)(6)]. Exemptions for this use of 2,4-D on wild rice in Minnesota have
been requested and granted for the past 4 years, and an application for registration of this use has not been submitted
to the Agency.

Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject to the Field Operations Division at the
address above. The Agency will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining
whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture.

<DOCTITLE>Granular Carbofuran; Proposed Decision to Deny FMC Corp's Request for Reinstatement of the Corn and Sorghum Uses;
Proposed Decision to Grant an Extension of the Phase-Out Period for Use on Rice; Call for Reduced Risk Alternatives
to Control Rice Water Weevil </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 FMC Corporation and grower groups have requested reinstatement of the corn and sorghum uses, and extension of the
phase-out period for the rice use of granular carbofuran. These three uses of granular carbofuran are currently being
phased out according to the terms of an Agreement in Principle between FMC Corp. and EPA that concluded the Special
Review of granular carbofuran. This notice announces EPA's proposed decision to deny FMC's request for reinstatement
of the use of granular carbofuran on corn and sorghum, and to grant FMC's request for an extension to the phase-out period
for rice. EPA's proposed decision to extend the rice use is subject to 40 CFR 154.35 because the extension of use might
increase avian risk, which was the basis of the Special Review of granular carbofuran. EPA is proposing an extension
of the use of granular carbofuran on rice because there are currently no efficacious alternatives available.
 


In conjunction with the proposed extension of the phase-out period of granular carbofuran on rice, EPA is encouraging
the registration of reduced risk alternatives to control rice water weevil. Specifically, EPA is asking pesticide
manufacturers who are currently developing data in support of the rice registration or who are giving consideration
to pursuing a rice registration in the near future, to inform the Agency of their plans. EPA will provide incentives
for manufacturers if they have adequate data to support their claims of reduced risk. EPA is also calling for data on
integrated pest management (IPM) strategies and non-chemical control methods for rice water weevil. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



I. Background 



The Special Review of granular carbofuran was initiated in October 1985 (50 FR 41938), based solely on acute risk to
avian species. In January, 1989, EPA's Preliminary Determination (54 FR 3744, January 25, 1989) proposed to cancel
all uses based on the finding that the risks of granular carbofuran outweighed the benefits of continued use. EPA presented
its proposed decision for public comment, to the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Scientific
Advisory Panel (SAP), and to the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The SAP generally supported EPA's avian risk
assessment methodology and the Agency's proposal to cancel all uses where efficacious alternatives were available.
USDA provided information related to the use of granular carbofuran that EPA subsequently incorporated into its
final benefits assessment. The ``Granular Carbofuran Conclusion of Special Review Technical Support Document,''
available in the OPP Docket, contains EPA's detailed response to the SAP, USDA, and public comments received in response
to EPA's Preliminary Determination.

While the Agency was preparing to finalize the proposed cancellation, FMC Corporation, the sole registrant of granular
carbofuran, entered into negotiations with EPA. The result of the negotiations was an Agreement in Principle signed
on May 13, 1991, which provided for phasing out 99 percent of the use of granular carbofuran over a 4-year period.

The conclusion of the granular carbofuran Special Review (56 FR 64621, December 11, 1991) was based on amendments
to the granular carbofuran registrations, including geographic restrictions, label changes, and phase-out of
major uses, submitted to the Agency by FMC that implemented the terms and conditions of the Agreement in Principle.
EPA determined that these amendments brought the risks and benefits of granular carbofuran into balance such that
the Special Review could be concluded.

The Agreement in Principle provided for the complete phase-out of granular carbofuran use by September 1, 1994, with
the exception of five crops where minor amounts are used. Thus, pursuant to the Agreement in Principle, corn and sorghum
were deleted from the granular carbofuran labels effective September 1, 1993. FMC has amended its label to delete
the rice use effective September 1, 1994. The Agreement provides that beginning September 1, 1994, granular carbofuran
will be labeled for use only on the following sites: bananas (in Hawaii only), cucurbits (pumpkins, cucumbers, watermelons,
cantaloupes, and squash), dry-harvested cranberries, pine progeny tests, and spinach grown for seed.

No more than a total of 4.5 million pounds of active ingredient (ai) in granular formulation was to have been sold in
the United States between September 1, 1991 and August 31, 1994, with an additional limit of no more than 400,000 pounds
ai to be sold between September 1, 1993 and August 31, 1994.

Remaining stocks of granular carbofuran in the hands of growers and distributors labeled for use on corn and sorghum
may be sold and used until September 1, 1994, i.e., 1 year after the deletions of those uses from the registrations.
Similarly, granular carbofuran labeled for use on rice, in the possession of growers and distributors, may be used
until September 1, 1995.

FMC submitted label amendments embodying the terms and conditions of the Agreement in Principle. EPA published a
notice (56 FR 33286) pursuant to section 6 (f) of FIFRA announcing the schedule for deletion of granular carbofuran
uses on July 19, 1991.

The Agreement in Principle stipulated that EPA would provide FMC with the opportunity for a meeting with the Director
of the Office of Pesticide Programs regarding the risks and benefits of the corn, sorghum and rice uses of granular
carbofuran prior to the effective dates of deletion of those uses from the label. FMC met with EPA on October 6 and 12,
1993, to present information in support of reinstating the corn and sorghum uses and extending the phase-out period
of the rice use. All materials submitted by FMC as well as minutes of the October 6th and 12th meetings can be found in
the OPP Docket. EPA has reviewed the material presented by FMC and other interested parties related to these three
uses as input to this proposed decision.

Granting any of FMC's requests would necessitate modification to the terms and conditions of the granular carbofuran
registrations that were agreed upon by EPA and FMC, and that provided the basis for conclusion of the Special Review.
Although EPA's proposed decision to deny FMC's request for modification that would allow additional use of granular
carbofuran on corn and sorghum does not represent a change to the terms and condition of the registration, EPA is, nonetheless,
offering a final opportunity for growers and others affected by the decision to come forward with relevant information.




II. Arguments Put Forth by FMC in Support of Continued Use of Granular Carbofuran on Corn, Sorghum, and Rice



Materials submitted by FMC in support of their request to continue the use of granular carbofuran on corn, sorghum,
and rice are available for public viewing in the OPP Public Docket. These materials include minutes of the October
6 and 12 meetings with EPA. In its submissions, FMC contends that, in terms of benefits: 

1. Taking into account changes to the 1990 Farm Bill would significantly increase benefits estimates. 

2. Annual economic impacts due to the loss of granular carbofuran for corn and sorghum are considerably higher than
EPA estimated in the Final Benefits Analyses. 

3. The use of granular carbofuran provides indirect benefits of $50 to $100 million per year in hunting and recreational
revenue, resulting from waterfowl habitat preservation in rice growing areas. 

In terms of risks, FMC contends that: 

1. EPA's previous avian risk assessment was inadequate to determine the impact of granular carbofuran on bird populations.
FMC submitted a protocol for a study intended to assess the probability of adverse effects from the use of granular
carbofuran on populations of local and migratory bird species. 

2. No additional kill incidents have occurred since 1991 from granular carbofuran used at planting on corn, sorghum,
or rice. Relatively few bird kill incidents have occurred considering the more than 20 years of granular carbofuran
use. 

3. Cluster analysis would show granular carbofuran relatively low in risk compared to alternatives, if all risk endpoints
were considered. 



III. Other Public Comments Received After the Conclusion of the Special Review



In addition to the material submitted by FMC, EPA has received and considered information from others affected by
the phase-out of granular carbofuran. These comments are summarized below.

In a letter to EPA dated March 10, 1992, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) supported EPA's decision to phase-out
most uses of granular carbofuran, because the phase-out was likely to prevent the deaths of untold numbers of migratory
birds in the United States each year. However, FWS also indicated that they believed that there are no conditions under
which granular carbofuran can be used without presenting unreasonable risk. The FWS supported full cancellation
of all pesticide products containing carbofuran. The FWS letter stated that the continued registration of carbofuran
poses conflict with several Federal wildlife statutes including the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Bald and Golden
Eagle Protection Act, and the Endangered Species Act. An attachment to the letter listed additional bird kill incidents,
many not previously reported to EPA.

EPA received numerous letters from Senators and Congressmen from corn, sorghum, and rice producing states supporting
continued use. EPA received one letter from the National Corn Growers Association in support of continued use on corn.

The National Grain Sorghum Producers submitted a letter with extension bulletins attached, and subsequently met
with EPA on September 20, 1993 to outline the importance of several chemicals, including carbofuran, to grain sorghum
production.

The U.S. Rice Environmental Committee met with the Agency on June 18, 1992. They subsequently submitted a package
to EPA that included: An analysis of potential chemical and non-chemical alternatives for control of rice water weevil;
letters from State agencies, regional and National wildlife organizations attesting to improvement in application
procedures and product stewardship to mitigate avian risk and the importance of rice fields as wildlife habitat;
and letters from individuals and grower cooperatives attesting to the economic benefits of granular carbofuran
use.

Letters from the California Environmental Protection Agency and the California Department of Fish and Game specifically
support the U.S. Rice Environmental Committee's position to retain the use of granular carbofuran on rice. Letters
from the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and
Parks, the Missouri Department of Conservation, and the FWS Wildlife and Habitat Management Office in St. Charles,
Arkansas emphasized the importance of rice lands as habitat for migratory waterfowl, but did not state a position
on the continued use of granular carbofuran.

It should be noted that during the comment period for the Preliminary Determination, many local, State, and National
wildlife organizations wrote in support of EPA's proposal to ban all uses of granular carbofuran. These include the
National Wildlife Federation, Defenders of Wildlife, the Rachel Carson Council, the International Crane Foundation,
and the Canadian Wildlife Service. The National Audubon Society, favored immediate suspension for all uses except
rice. They expressed concern about the possible effect of cancellation on wildlife habitat in California.

EPA received letters from the following State wildlife and resource agencies in support of the Preliminary Determination
to cancel granular carbofuran: the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, the Virginia Department of Natural
Resources, the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation, the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission,
the Minnesota State Department of Natural Resources, the Louisiana Wildlife Federation, the Arizona Game and Fish
Department, the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Game, the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission,
the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, the Arizona Game and Fish Department, the Missouri Department of Conservation,
and the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks. 



IV. EPA Response



EPA's detailed response to issues raised by FMC and other commentors is contained in a memo titled, ``Analysis and
Recommendation RE: FMC's Proposal to Reinstate the Use of Granular Carbofuran on Corn, Sorghum, and Rice.'' The memo
is available in the OPP Docket. With respect to benefits, major points are summarized as follows: 

1. Changes in agricultural policy, specifically to crop support programs, have been significant since EPA and others
initially evaluated the benefits of granular carbofuran use. However, the higher benefits estimates generated
by FMC are primarily attributable to their claim of large yield loss estimates for corn and sorghum. EPA finds insufficient
evidence in FMC's submission to support FMC's high yield loss estimates. 

2. FMC's economic analyses for corn and sorghum did not consider all available alternatives or all available efficacy
data. In both cases, limited regional impacts were presented as national. For the sorghum analysis, FMC used the least
effective alternative to calculate potential losses. All of these factors contributed to the higher estimates used
by FMC. 

3. EPA did not consider indirect benefits from hunting revenue, because these benefits are not unique to carbofuran.
FMC's estimate of $50 to $100 million is exaggerated due to their use of several implausible assumptions regarding
the use of economic multipliers and the relationship between granular carbofuran treated rice fields and total waterfowl
habitat. 

With respect to risk, major points are summarized as follows: 

1. EPA's risk assessment did not emphasize impacts on bird populations. EPA's concern with granular carbofuran is
based on its high acute toxicity to birds, field studies, and incident reports documenting widespread and repeated
mortality to many species of birds, including eagles, hawks and other predators. Incidents of both primary and secondary
poisonings have been observed and documented in many different geographic areas, associated with many different
use sites, and under varying environmental conditions. Legal precedent exists for pesticide regulatory decisions
based on recurrent kills as an unreasonable adverse effect (

Ciba-Geigy Corp. 

v. 

EPA

, 847 F.2d 277, 5th Cir. 1989). 

2. FMC has not provided documentation of systematic monitoring of specific use sites to substantiate claims of reduced
avian risk and elimination of kill incidents. Only letters of a testimonial nature have been provided. Six additional
wildlife kill incidents have been reported to EPA since the conclusion of the Special Review in 1991. Species killed
include a bald eagle, Canada geese, and red-tailed hawks. 

3. EPA's assessment did address the comparative risk of alternatives in the 1991 Technical Support Document for the
conclusion of the Special Review. 



V. EPA's Proposed Decision on Corn and Sorghum



EPA finds no basis for reinstating either the corn or sorghum uses in the information provided by FMC and other commentors.
EPA disagrees with the assumptions supporting FMC's claims of yield losses higher than those estimated by the Agency.
FMC did not consider all available alternatives nor did they include all available efficacy data in their analysis.
In its Final Benefits Analysis for Sorghum, EPA found that there are efficacious alternatives available for all corn
and sorghum uses, except for a very limited area of Nebraska during high chinchbug infestation years. These findings
are based on efficacy tests conducted by universities and state agricultural agencies. Material presented by sorghum
growers contained no actual data to substantiate claims of high anticipated yield losses.

No new data or information has been put forth that would substantively change the risk/benefit decision that formed
the basis for the Agreement in Principle. Therefore, EPA proposes to deny FMC's request to reinstate the corn and sorghum
uses of granular carbofuran.

Pursuant to 40 CFR 154.35, EPA is not required to solicit comment on this decision to deny FMC's request for reinstatement
of the corn and sorghum uses, since this decision would not modify the previous Agreement in Principle between FMC
and EPA that concluded the Special Review. Because individuals affected by this decision have come forward and indicated
that they were unaware that granular carbofuran would no longer be available for use on corn and sorghum in 1994, EPA
will consider additional, new, and relevant data submitted to the Agency during the comment period for this notice.
EPA is providing this additional comment period even though public comment on the decision to cancel all uses of granular
carbofuran has been solicited previously in the Special Review Preliminary Determination (54 FR 3744). EPA responded
to comments received at that time in the ``Granular Carbofuran Conclusion of the Special Review Technical Support
Document'' available in the OPP Docket. EPA requests that any additional comments be focused on new and substantive
data. See unit IX, of this notice, for a discussion of the specific data that are most useful to EPA. 



VI. EPA Proposed Decision on Rice



EPA is proposing an extension to the current phase-out schedule for granular carbofuran use on rice because there
are still no registered alternative chemical controls for rice water weevil, and there are currently no applications
in the registration pipeline for this use. The absence of alternatives was a consideration in the decision that concluded
the Special Review and continues to be of concern to the Agency.

EPA is also concerned that non-chemical control options, specifically draining fields and eliminating vegetation
on field edges (clean farming), may not provide effective control of rice water weevil and may compromise wildlife
habitat initiatives that conservation groups have implemented with rice growers. EPA is soliciting additional
data on these practices and on other pest control strategies that could reduce use of granular carbofuran while at
the same time maintaining or enhancing wildlife habitat in rice growing areas.

EPA is proposing a maximum 2 year extension to the current phase-out schedule for the use of granular carbofuran on
rice. The Agency notes that the current phase-out schedule has already allowed substantial time for the development
and implementation of alternative control methods, since the issuance of the Preliminary Determination in 1989.

EPA further proposes that any extension of the use of granular carbofuran on rice be subject to the following conditions:


1. Production and sales by FMC will be limited to 250,000 pounds of active ingredient (ai) sold in granular formulations
per year for the 1995 and 1996 use seasons for use on rice and the five minor uses stipulated in the Agreement in Principle.
FMC must direct 2,500 pounds of the total 250,000 pounds ai to the areas where the five minor use crops are grown during
the 1995 and 1996 use seasons. For the purpose of the proposed extension, the 1995 ``use season'' begins September
1, 1994 and ends August 31, 1995. Similarly, the 1996 use season begins September 1, 1995 and ends August 31, 1996. 

2. Existing stocks in the possession of dealers and growers may be used on rice until September 1, 1997. 

3. Production and sales by FMC will be limited to 2,500 pounds ai per year for use only on the five sites stipulated in
the Agreement in Principle for 1997 and subsequent years. 

4. No production and sales by FMC will be allowed for use on rice during the 1996 growing season, however, if a FIFRA section
3 registration for an alternative to control rice water weevil appears imminent at the end of the 1995 growing season.
On or before September 1, 1995, EPA will assess the prospect for registration of alternatives to control rice water
weevil and advise FMC and other interested parties if production and sales of granular carbofuran for use on rice will
be allowed for the 1996 growing season. EPA's assessment of the registration prospect for alternatives will include:
The product's efficacy in controlling rice water weevil; the completeness of the data base; and, the Agency's finding
that the product presents less risk to the environment and human health than granular carbofuran. 

5. For each use season, during any period of extension, FMC must submit to EPA by October 15, a report containing FMC's
granular carbofuran production and sales totals for domestic use for the immediately preceding use season. FMC will
provide EPA with batch numbers and keys for granular carbofuran product produced for the 1995 and 1996 domestic use
seasons to facilitate identification of product by year. 

6. FMC may be required to implement label changes or other measures to reduce avian risk during the period of extension.
These may include but are not limited to: endangered species bulletins; user education and stewardship programs;
and, scouting to determine infestation levels prior to application.

The FWS may issue a new Biological Opinion during the 90-day comment period for this Notice. The Opinion is the
result of an ongoing consultation between EPA and FWS regarding the potential of carbofuran to adversely affect endangered
species. The Opinion or other comments from the FWS could influence EPA's decision on extending the use of granular
carbofuran on rice. 

7. All terms and conditions of the May 1991 Agreement in Principle will apply in the case of the extension, except the
specific phase-out schedule and production limits for the rice use.

EPA views the proposed extension of the phase-out of granular carbofuran on rice as a transitional measure. The U.S.
Rice Environmental Committee has provided documentation of on-going research on both chemical and non-chemical
controls for rice water weevil. In addition, the Committee has promoted cooperative efforts between rice growers
and environmental organizations to enhance wildlife habitat in rice growing areas. The Agency will make every effort
to encourage the registration and use of environmentally sound alternative control measures for rice water weevil.
However, growers and others affected by the phase-out of granular carbofuran on rice are advised that EPA has already
allowed substantial time for the development and adoption of alternative pest control methods. For this reason,
extensions beyond those proposed in this notice are most unlikely. EPA has not changed the basic conclusions outlined
in the granular carbofuran Special Review Final Determination, specifically, that the use of granular carbofuran
on rice poses unreasonable risk to avian species. 



VII. Incentives for Development and Registration of Reduced Risk Alternatives to Control Rice Water Weevil



EPA is committed to reducing risk from pesticide use by eliminating or limiting the use of the most dangerous pesticides,
promoting the registration of reduced risk chemical alternatives, and promoting the development and implementation
of integrated pest management strategies.

In the case of rice water weevil, EPA notes that many chemicals have been tested and shown promise in controlling this
pest. However, no manufacturers have yet pursued registrations for this use. In order to promote registrations of
reduced risk alternatives for control of rice water weevil, EPA is soliciting letters indicating interest or intent
to register products for this use, from manufacturers of new active ingredients, as well as active ingredients already
registered on other sites. The Agency encourages registrants who can demonstrate that their products present less
risk to the environment and human health than does the use of granular carbofuran to control rice water weevil to come
forward now.

The letters, indicating interest or intent, should provide rationale for claims of reduced risk that are organized
and presented according to the ``Guidelines for Content of Reduced-Risk Rationales'' found in Pesticide Regulation
(PR) Notice 93-9. The ``Guidelines'' contained in PR Notice 93-9, in this instance, are being used for
formatting purposes only. It should be noted that PR Notice 93-9 applies only to applicants seeking to register
new active ingredients, and should not be confused with the call for safer alternatives for the control of rice water
weevil that applies to both new active ingredients and new uses of active ingredients registered on other sites.

The letters of interest should also indicate when an application could be submitted. If registrants cannot provide
a precise schedule, they should give an approximation of when they believe their section 3 application and tolerance
requests will be submitted. EPA will treat information supplied by registrants as confidential, if the registrant
so requests. Unit X of this notice, outlines procedures for submitting confidential business information.

Respondents need not submit actual registration applications at this time. EPA intends to evaluate the letters/rationales
received in response to this notice to determine which ones may qualify for special consideration as reduced risk
pesticides. If the rationale provided demonstrates the opportunity for risk reduction, EPA will notify the registrant
that the Agency will consider this factor in determining review priority for their registration application for
the rice use. However, when registration packages are submitted, they must include all relevant data necessary for
EPA to complete a risk assessment and make a regulatory decision.

EPA is willing to consider other incentives that may apply in specific cases, for example, waiving tolerance fees
for small businesses seeking registrations for biological pesticides. The Agency encourages registrants to suggest
other reasonable incentives that may apply to their case that would stimulate their interest in coming forward sooner
rather than later with registrations for the rice use.

EPA recognizes the cost of developing additional data for an aquatic food use such as rice may be a potential barrier
to registering reduced risk alternatives. The Agency encourages pesticide user groups, including grower organizations,
to consider the option of providing assistance in developing the data required to support registration of alternatives
to control rice water weevil. Assistance provided by user groups could range from participation in efficacy, crop
residue, and phytotoxicity studies, to direct funding of environmental or human safety studies.

EPA is also interested in data on the effectiveness of biological, cultural and integrated pest control strategies
for rice water weevil. Material related to alternatives and incentives should be sent to the contact designated at
the beginning of this notice. 



VIII. Coordination with USDA



EPA is working with USDA to improve existing procedures to ensure that all affected end users are notified of EPA's
proposed pesticide actions and are provided with the opportunity to contribute information relevant to those actions
in a timely manner. EPA is also working with USDA to provide information to researchers on pesticides which have triggered
environmental or human health concerns, so that this information can be used in identifying needs for research and
development of alternatives. 



IX. Public Comments



In the course of the Special Review of granular carbofuran, and in Special Reviews in general, EPA has relied on certain
categories of data. Data used for Special Review decisions are derived from studies using controlled, scientific
methods.

For the benefits assessments these data include: comparative product performance (efficacy) data, particularly
data on yield loss and market grade losses; quantitative usage data; data related to the distribution and life cycle
of crop pests; and historic data on pest damage and levels of infestation. Comparative product performance data is
generated from side-by-side trials of carbofuran and its alternatives. Performance tests compare the ability of
products to control a specific pest and some also evaluate the effects on yield.

Data considered in the granular carbofuran Special Review avian risk assessment include: laboratory toxicity data;
toxicity and relative risk of alternative pest control measures; field studies; monitoring programs; and poisoning
incidents associated with direct and secondary exposure to carbofuran. Field studies and monitoring both require
systematic observation by technicians trained to recognize abnormal bird behavior and other evidence of exposure.
In order to be scientifically valid, field studies should be conducted according to established protocols for survey
methods, searching techniques and timing, and documentation of environmental conditions and application practices.
The incident data used by EPA in the granular carbofuran Special Review generally involve laboratory analysis of
bird carcasses to determine cause of death.

Commentors are advised that data related to the categories listed above will be most useful to the Agency in reviewing
the proposed regulatory decision on granular carbofuran. Letters of a testimonial nature without supporting, scientifically
derived data are of limited utility.

The following information would also be useful to the Agency: 

1. Letters of intent or interest in registering new or existing chemicals for control of rice water weevil, as described
in unit VII of this notice. 

2. Data on additional measures that could be adopted to reduce avian risk. 

3. Information from growers or organizations with knowledge of effective, non-chemical or IPM strategies for control
of rice water weevil. 

4. Data on the long-term impacts of population growth and geographic distribution of rice water weevil. 

5. Data on the effectiveness of clean farming in controlling rice water weevil, and the schedule of vegetation removal
in relation to bird use of rice fields. 

6. State agricultural and wildlife agencies are encouraged to comment on methods to further reduce the use of granular
carbofuran in rice growing areas through prescriptive use or other measures, and on how to monitor enforcement of
label restrictions more effectively.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability of Reregistration Eligibility Decision documents; opening of public comment period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This Notice announces the availability of the Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) documents for the following
active ingredients from List A, List C and List D, and this notice also starts a 60-day public comment period.
The REDs for the chemicals listed are the Agency's formal regulatory assessments of the health and environmental
data base of the subject chemicals and present the Agency's determination regarding which pesticidal uses are eligible
for reregistration.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Agency has issued Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) documents for the pesticidal active ingredients
listed below. Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended in 1988, EPA is conducting
an accelerated reregistration program to reevaluate existing pesticides to make sure they meet current scientific
and regulatory standards. The data base to support the reregistration of each of the chemicals listed below is substantially
complete. EPA has determined that all currently registered products subject to reregistration containing these
active ingredients are eligible for reregistration. 




List A -



Case 0632    Barium Metaborate Monohydrate; 
Case 0577    Methiocarb;






List C -



Case 3084    Lithium Hypochlorite;
Case 3070    Ethanolamine;






List D -



Case 4015    Bromine;
Case 4064    Mineral Acids;
Case 4072    Peroxy Compounds; 
Case 4097    Vegetable and Flour Oils; 





To request a copy of any of the above listed RED documents, or a RED Fact Sheet, contact the OPP Pesticide Docket, Public
Response and Program Resources Branch, in Room 1132 at the address given above or call (703) 305-5805. All registrants
of products containing one or more of the above listed active ingredients have been sent the appropriate RED documents
and must respond to labeling requirements and product specific data requirements (if applicable) within 8 months
of receipt. Products containing the other active ingredients will not be reregistered until adequate product specific
data have been submitted and all necessary product label changes are implemented.

The reregistration program is being conducted under Congressionally mandated time frames, and EPA recognizes both
the need to make timely reregistration decisions and to involve the public. Therefore, EPA is issuing these REDs as
final documents with a 60-day comment period. Although the 60-day public comment period does not affect
the registrant's response due date, it is intended to provide an opportunity for public input and a mechanism for initiating
any necessary amendments to the RED. All comments will be carefully considered by the Agency. If any comment significantly
affect a RED, EPA will amend the RED by publishing the amendment in the 

Federal Register.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On February 2, 1994, EPA received an application from Northrup King Company for an Experimental Use Permit (EUP) for
a transgenic plant pesticide. This is the fifth EUP application under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide
Act for testing with a pesticidal substance that is produced in a plant. The Agency has determined that this application
may be of regional and national significance. Therefore in accordance with 40 CFR 172.11(a), the Agency is soliciting
public comments on this application. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On February 2, 1994, EPA received an application for an EUP from Northrup King Company, 7500 Olson Memorial Highway,
Golden Valley, MN 55427. The application was assigned EPA File Symbol 67979-EUP-R. Northrup King proposes
to test a 

d

-endotoxin (expressed from a modified gene of the soil microbe 

Bacillus thuringiensis

 subspecies 

kurstaki

) as expressed in a series of corn lines from April 15, 1994 to May 1, 1995. Corn grown under this permit will not be permitted
to enter commerce, therefore no petition for a temporary tolerance was submitted in conjunction with this EUP. 


Several small-scale field experiments have been conducted under permits granted by the United States Department
of Agriculture. Further testing is now required in order to further assess the commercial potential of the transgenic
corn. Specific testing proposed under this application include plantings in yield trials, efficacy trials, breeding
nurseries, and production nurseries. A maximum of 45 acres are proposed for planting. The planted seed will contain
approximately 0.013 grams of the 

d

-endotoxin. Included in the program are the states of Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota,
Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, and Wisconsin and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico. 
Upon review of the Northrup King application, any comments received in response to this notice, and any other relevant
information, EPA will set conditions under which the experiments will be conducted. Any issuance of an EUP will be
announced in the 

Federal Register

.

<DOCTITLE>Receipt of an Application for an Experimental Use Permit for Use of Bromoxynil on Herbicide Tolerant Cotton Plants
</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On February 18, 1993, EPA received from Rhone-Poulenc Ag Co. an application for an Experimental Use Permit (EUP) and
a petition for a temporary tolerance for the use of Buctril Gel which contains the herbicide bromoxynil, on cotton
plants genetically modified to be tolerant to this herbicide. On June 4, 1993, the EUP was accepted for a period of 1
year with the provision that the crop be destroyed or used only for research purposes. The registrant has requested
that the EUP be extended on a crop destruct basis until the temporary tolerance is established. Due to recent interest
in the introduction of genetically modified herbicide tolerant plants into commercial agriculture, the Agency
has determined that this application may be of regional and national significance. Therefore, in accordance with
40 CFR 172.11(a), the Agency is soliciting public comments on this application. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On February 18, 1993, an application for an EUP and a Petition for Temporary Tolerance was received from Rhone-Poulenc
Ag Co., P.O. Box 12014, 2 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709 for the use of Buctril Gel, which contains
the herbicide bromoxynil, on cotton plants genetically modified to be tolerant to the herbicide. The EUP was requested
for a period of 2 years. Data submitted in support of the temporary tolerance were insufficient to grant the temporary
tolerance for the 1993 growing season. The EUP was subsequently issued on June 4, 1993, (EPA Reg. No. 264-EUP-93)
for a 1-year period with the provision that the food or feed derived from the experimental program would be destroyed
or fed only to experimental animals for testing purposes, or otherwise disposed of in a manner which would not endanger
man or the environment. Since the temporary tolerance for bromoxynil has not yet been established, the registrant
requested on March 14, 1994, that the EUP be extended for a period of 1-year under the previous provisions, which
would not allow food or feed to be sold, while the issues concerning the temporary tolerance are being resolved. 


The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 of September 8, 1993 (58 FR 47249), of their receipt of a petition for determination of nonregulated status of genetically
engineered cotton lines. This notice and the referenced petition contain information related specifically to the
genetic modification of the herbicide tolerant cotton plants which will be treated under this EUP.

The purpose of the EUP as stated on the product label is to evaluate the control of certain broadleaf weeds in transgenic
Bromotol cotton. Applications of the product can be made by ground equipment only to transgenic Bromotol cotton that
has been genetically modified for crop tolerance to postemergence over-the-top applications of bromoxynil.

The objectives for the 1994 testing program are stated to be: (1) Evaluate product efficacy on major broadleaf weeds
that infest cotton, (2) compare weed control with commercial standard weed control systems on cotton, (3) verify
transgenic seed purity during seed production, and (4) compare Buctril weed control system with commercial standard
weed control systems of cotton in major cotton growing areas using standard commercial production methods and varieties.

The application for the 1994 EUP request use of 4,000 pounds of the active ingredient bromoxynil on a total of 4,000
acres of cotton. Testing is proposed for the states of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.

Upon review of the EUP extension request, any comments received in response to this notice and any other relevant information,
EPA will decide whether to issue or deny the EUP extension. If issued, EPA will set conditions under which the experiments
are to be conducted. Any issuance of an EUP by the Agency will be announced in the 

Federal Register

.

EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs has a Public Docket Room where a copy of the EUP application deleted of all ``Confidential
Business Information'' will be available for public inspection. The Public Docket Room is located at Rm. 1128, Crystal
Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA; the hours of operation are from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through
Friday, excluding legal holidays.

ACTION:

 Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces Agency approval of applications submitted by Stine Microbial Products., to register the pesticide
products Blue Circle and SMP PcpWi containing an active ingredient not included in any previously registered products
pursuant to the provisions of section 3(c)(5) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA),
as amended. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA issued a notice, published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 29, 1991 (56 FR 24190), which announced that Stine Microbial Products, 4722 Pflaum Road, Madison, WI 53704,
had submitted applications to register the pesticide products Blue Circle and SMP PcpWi (EPA File Symbols 63950-R
and 63950-E), ~containing the active ingredient

 Pseudomonas cepacia

 type Wisconsin at 3.8 percent for both, an active ingredient not included in any previously registered products.

~~

The applications were approved on December 28, 1992, as Blue Circle as a seed treatment on various crops prior to planting
(EPA Reg. No. 63950-1) and SMP PcpWi for manufacturing use only (EPA Reg. No. 63950-2). 
~~The Agency has considered all required data on risks associated with the proposed use of

 Pseudomonas cepacia

 type Wisconsin, and information on social, economic, and environmental benefits to be derived from use. Specifically,
the Agency has considered the nature of the chemical and its pattern of use, application methods and rates, and level
and extent of potential exposure. Based on these reviews, the Agency was able to make basic health safety determinations
which show that use of

 Pseudomonas cepacia

 type Wisconsin when used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice, will not generally cause
unreasonable adverse effects to the environment. 
More detailed information on these registrations is contained in a Chemical Fact Sheet on

 Pseudomonas cepacia

 type Wisconsin. 
A copy of this fact sheet, which provides a summary description of the chemical, use patterns and formulations, science
findings, and the Agency's regulatory position and rationale, may be obtained from the National Technical Information
Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161.

Article III


Voting


Section 1. Affirmative Vote Required


Action on any matter shall require the affirmative vote of at least two (2) Members, except as provided in Article II,
Section 4.


Section 2. Votes To Be Recorded


The vote of each Member, including the Chairman, on a question shall be recorded in the minutes.


Section 3. Notational Voting


(a) Nothing in these Rules shall preclude the transaction of business by the circulation of written items (``notational
votes'') to the Members, provided all Members participate, in writing, in the disposition of the item pursuant to
Article III, section 3(c).
(b) 

Matters that may be decided by notational vote. 

The Board may consider any matter that comes before it by use of notational voting procedures; however, it is best used
only for routine and noncontroversial items. Any Member may submit an item to the Secretary for distribution as a notational
vote.
(c) 

Notational vote ballots and material. 

Upon submission of an item for notational vote, the Secretary shall provide each Member a complete package of all relevant
information and a notational vote ballot sheet (indicating the Member making the motion, the substance of the motion,
and the deadline for return of the vote) upon which each Member can indicate his/her position by voting in the following
manner:
(1) To approve;
(2) To disapprove;
(3) To abstain; or
(4) Not appropriate for notational vote.
(d) 

Modifications, amendments, and withdrawals. 

No partial concurrences or amendments are appropriate; however, a Member may suggest a revision to the proponent,
subject to compliance with the Government in the Sunshine Act, and the proponent may withdraw his motion at any time
prior to receipt by the Secretary of the votes of all Members or the end of the time period provided for on the ballot sheet.
(e) 

Time limits to vote. 

Within ten (10) business days of receipt, or earlier if circumstances require, each Member shall act on the matter
by returning the ballot sheet. Failure to return a ballot sheet by the date requested on the sheet will result in the
vote being recorded as ``not voting'', which causes the motion to fail pursuant to Article III, section 3(a).

(f) 

Veto of notational voting procedure. 

In view of the public policy of openness reflected in the Government in the Sunshine Act and the desire to allow any Member
to present viewpoints to the other Members, any Member can veto the use of the notational voting procedure for the consideration
of any particular matter by voting ``not appropriate for notational vote''.
(g) 

Disclosure of results. 

A summary of any action taken by notational vote shall be provided by the Secretary to the Members, Chief Executive
Officer, and Chief Operating Officer, and shall be reflected in the appropriate minutes of the Board. Public disclosure
is determined by the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552).
(h) 

Authority to designate staff to initial. 

If the conduct of agency business so requires, and the Member has been apprised of the contents of any notational vote,
a Member who is absent from the office may authorize a staff member to initial the item for him/her, as long as the Member
has a designation memorandum on file with the Secretary.


Section 4. Telephone Conference

Article VII


Board Operational Responsibilities

Section 1. General



The purpose of this article is to ensure the efficient operation of the Farm Credit Administration (FCA), the FCA Board
(Board), and the Chief Executive Officer of the FCA (CEO) concerning operational responsibilities. This rule shall,
by itself, neither preclude the CEO from bringing to the Board issues on which this rule does not require Board action,
nor preclude the Board from involving itself in matters not addressed herein. The Board might, for example, be involved
in operational matters that become, in the Board's view, policy matters as a result of special congressional attention.



Section 2. Documents and Communications



(a) 

CEO responsibilities.

 The CEO is responsible for ensuring the accomplishment of the goals set by the Board within the constraints imposed
by statue, regulation, Board policy, precedents, sound management practices, and budget resource limitations.
The CEO will ensure effective and efficient mechanisms that accomplish the desired goals. Those mechanisms include
the development of specific objectives, action plans, budgets, procedures, administrative policies, communications
with Farm Credit institution employees and directors, and other activities as needed. Proposed actions that are
inconsistent with existing Board policy require Board approval. It is understood that a substantial part of the CEO's
and staff's jobs requires the exercise of sound judgement in applying statutory, regulatory, Board policy, and precedential
guidance to specific situations, and in most cases the Board does not expect to take part in applying existing guidance
to specific situations. There may be situations where an interpretation of existing guidance would constitute the
formulation of policy; the CEO should refer such interpretations to the Board.

(b) 

Approval, review, and consultation.

 The FCA Board is responsible for determining the agency's position on policy matters affecting the agency's mission.
The FCA Board typically expresses its position through the approval of regulations and Board Policy Statements that
define the goal(s) to be accomplished. Board Policy Statements and Bookletters should be reviewed at least every
five (5) years.

Proposed and final FCA regulations, Board actions, and minutes of Board meetings must be approved by the Board. The
promulgation of regulations adopted by the Board shall be in compliance with the requirements of the Farm Credit Act
of 1971, as amended, and the Administrative Procedure Act. 

Federal Register

 notices must be approved by the Board, except for announcements and notices that merely make public prior actions
that have been taken by the Board. The following are examples of 

Federal Register

 notices that need not be approved by the Board: Notices concerning effective dates or technical corrections of regulations,
notices of meetings or hearings, notices publishing Board Orders and Policy Statements, and notices informing the
public of the amendment or cancellation of Farm Credit institution charters.

Bookletters, memoranda, bulletins, and other mass mailings to Farm Credit institutions (except documents listed
in Attachment A) must be reviewed by the Board prior to distribution. Documents may be added to or deleted from Attachment
A by Board vote.

The issuance of a ``no action'' letter is a policy matter requiring Board approval. For the purposes of this statement,
a ``no action'' letter is a statement to a Farm Credit institution that, notwithstanding any other provision of law
or regulation, the Board will take no action against the institution solely because it engaged in conduct specified
in the letter.

Authority to promulgate internal administrative issuances, including FCA Policies and Procedures Manual (PPM)
issuances, rests with the Chairman as CEO and may be delegated to the Chief Operating Officer. The CEO shall provide
the Board with final drafts of PPM issuances and other administrative issuances for an appropriate consultative
period if those issuances relate to examination and supervision, audits, internal controls, the budget, the strategic
planning process, regulation development, or personnel matters relating strictly to promotion or pay.

(c) 

Signature authority.

 Authority to sign official Board documents, including, but not limited to, proposed and final regulations, 

Federal Register

 notices, Board actions, no-action letters, and minutes is delegated to the Secretary to the Board (Secretary). Documents
executed by the Secretary or an alternate will be signed under the caption ``By Order of the Board'' and reflect the
title of ``Secretary of the Board,'' or ``Acting Secretary of the Board'' as appropriate. The Chairman has the authority
to sign bookletters, memoranda, bulletins, and other mass mailings to Farm Credit Institutions, and such authority
will not be delegated to others (except for documents listed in Attachment A). 

(d) 

Correspondence.

 The Chairman shall, as required by section 5.10(a)(3) of the Farm Credit Act of 1971 (Act), approve and sign correspondence
to Members of Congress, correspondence responding to White House referrals, or other correspondence on behalf of
the Board or the agency. The Chairman may delegate approval and signature authority for such correspondence to FCA
Office Directors when the subject matter involves congressional or White House case work. When the subject matter
involves the presentation of an agency position or policy relative to regulations, legislation, etc., the Chairman
may not delegate authority, and the correspondence must be approved by the Board, except that the Board need not approve
a previously approved response or a restatement of previously adopted Board policy. Board approval does not apply
when the Chairman is speaking only for him or herself and includes the appropriate disclaimer. Likewise, on similar
matters, Board Members should include appropriate disclaimers. The Chairman or the Chairman's designee has authority
to sign acknowledgements or interim responses without Board approval, provided such responses contain no policy
statements or only previously approved statements. 

(e) 

Authentication and certification of records and documents.

 The Chairman shall designate who is authorized and empowered to execute and issue under the seal of the FCA, statements
authenticating copies of, or excerpts from, official records and files of the FCA; and to certify, on the basis of the
records of the FCA, the effective periods of regulations, orders, instructions, and regulatory announcements;
and to certify, on the basis of the records of the FCA, the appointment, qualification, and continuance in office of
any officer or employee of the FCA, or any conservator or receiver acting under the direction of the FCA. The designated
official(s) may be further empowered to sign official documents and to affix the seal of the FCA thereon for the purpose
of attesting the signature of officials of the FCA. 



Section 3. Financial and Strategic Management 



(a) 

Budget approval.

 The CEO shall, consistent with the provisions of the Act, other law and regulations, and applicable policy, oversee
the development of budget proposals and cause the expenditure of funds within approved budgets to meet the agency's
mission and objectives. The Board will approve an object class budget for the agency as a whole and a budget for each
office. Any change to the object class budget for the agency as a whole will be approved by the Board. However, reallocation
of funds between object classes within an office that has a 

de minimis

 effect (less than 2%) on the agency total for the object class need not be approved by the Board. 

(b) 

Procurement.

 The CEO has the authority, consistent with FCA and federal policies and practices, to purchase or negotiate to purchase
necessary services and/or materials for the operations of the agency. The Board shall exercise its authority to approve
procurements through its approval of the budget. The objectives of single procurements in excess of $100,000 shall
be made clear in conjunction with the budget approval process. For procurements outside of the Budget approval process,
the Board shall approve expenditures and statements of work for amounts in excess of $100,000. 

(c) 

Strategic planning.

 The Board has authority for the oversight and approval of strategic planning, including budgetary and regulatory
planning, and will exercise its involvement in these areas via the Strategic Planning Committee (Committee). The
Committee will consist of the Board Members' Executive Assistants, the Chairman's Executive Assistant, and the
Chief Operating Officer. The Committee shall be coordinated by the Chief Operating Officer. The Committee shall
make periodic reports to the Board regarding its activities. 

(d) 

Information resources. 

To ensure a reasonable return of efficiency and effectiveness given the costs of the investment, information and
information resources will be managed to assure that the agency collects and disseminates the information necessary
to the effective discharge of the agency's mission; that information activities reflect the goals and priorities
in the agency's strategic and operational plans; and that investment decision in information resources be made on
a life-cycle basis so that overall costs and benefits are weighed rather than simply the initial costs and benefits.

To ensure this objective, oversight of major automation purchases, projects, and policies at FCA will be overseen
by an IRM Steering Committee of senior officials to provide oversight, review, and validation of IRM initiatives.
The committee will consist of the Chief Operating Officer, and the Office Directors of the Offices of Examination,
Special Supervision and Corporate Affairs, Resources Management and General Counsel, one rotating member chose
from the other FCA offices and the Chief of the Information Resources Division. The COO shall chair the committee.

 


Section 4. Human Resources 
 


The CEO has authority, consistent with the Act, FCA policy and budget, and federal personnel rules to hire the personnel
necessary to carry out the objectives of the agency. Each Board Member is entitled to appoint staff within the constraints
of the adopted budget for the Office of the Board. Consistent with the Act, the Board shall approve the appointment
of the ``heads of major administrative divisions,'' which the Board interprets to mean the Chief Operating Officer
and career Office Directors. The Chairman has authority to appoint the Secretary and noncareer (political) Office
Directors but does so with the understanding that all Agency representations by such staff are on behalf of the Board.

 
(a) 

Organization chart.

 Consistent with its mandate to approve regulations and the appointments outlined above, the Board shall approve
the FCA organizational chart down to the Office level along with relevant functional statements for each Office.
Authority to make organizational changes within any Division shall rest with the CEO, and may be delegated to the COO
or Office Directors. 
 
(b) 

Chief Operating Officer (COO). 

The COO shall report to the Chairman as CEO regarding all matters established to be CEO responsibilities as listed
in this Policy Statement, including such administrative items as approval of leave, etc. The COO shall report to the
Board regarding matters on which it has retained responsibility. The same shall be said for the Secretary and the Director
of the Office of Congressional and Public Affairs. 
 
(c) 

Inspector General (IG). 

The IG shall report to the Chairman as CEO and agency head. The CEO shall be responsible for overseeing the audit resolution
process. However, the CEO must obtain Board approval of resolutions where the issue would normally require Board
action. The CEO (through his/her designee) shall be responsible for implementation and audit followup. The Chairman
will provide a briefing in the appropriate setting for the Board on the Inspector General's Semi-Annual Report to
Congress within ten (10) working days of the Chairman's transmittal of the Report to Congress. The Chairman will ask
the IG and Audit Followup Official to discuss the status of any unresolved audit recommendations, unimplemented
management decisions, and other issues identified in the Semi-Annual Report. Consistent with its budgetary responsibility,
the Board must approve all audit resolutions that result in a cumulative cost to the Agency in excess of $25,000 per
audit. This requirement applies to audits commenced after May 1, 1993. 
 
(d) 

Director, Office of Secondary Market Oversight. 

The Director shall report to the FCA Board regarding general policy and rulemaking issues and to the FCA Chairman as
CEO relating to administrative activities of the Office.

(e) 

General Counsel. 

The General Counsel shall report to the Chief Operating Officer concerning administrative matters and to the Board
regarding matters of agency policy. Additionally, the General Counsel, by the nature of the position, shall, as appropriate,
maintain special advisory relationships in confidence as necessary with individual Board members. The General
Counsel shall keep the Board fully informed of all litigation where the Agency is involved.
(f) 

Performance appraisals. 

Each Board member is responsible for appraising the performance of his or her staff. The Chairman, after consultation
with the other Board members, is responsible for the appraisal of the performance of the Secretary to the Board. The
Chairman as CEO, after consultation with the other Board members, is responsible for appraising the performance
of the COO, the Inspector General, the Director of OCPA, the Director of OSMO, and the EEO Officer. The COO is responsible
for appraising the performance of the career Office Directors and other staff that report directly to him or her. The
CEO, in consultation with the other Board members, is responsible for reviewing the performance appraisals conducted
by the COO. All performance appraisals will be conducted in accordance with the procedures set forth in the agency's
PPM.


Section 5. Litigation


The CEO has authority to undertake litigation to defend the agency, consistent with established Board policy. The
Board will approve litigation where the agency is plaintiff, will approve recommendations to the Justice Department
to pursue an appeal, and will approve positions advanced in litigation that conflict with existing Board policy or
establish a significant new policy.


Section 6. Examinations


Consistent with the Act, the Board shall adopt an annual Schedule of Examination and approve the policy scope of examination.
The Chief Examiner shall report quarterly to the Board on the status of implementing the schedule and other information
associated with the execution of OE's strategic plan. Included in that report shall be a discussion of general trends
and significant examination issues and concerns. This report may be given in conjunction with the quarterly review
of System performance.


Article VIII


Board Member and Related Expenses


Section 1. Pre-Confirmation Travel


Travel expenses incurred by an FCA Board nominee that are solely for the purpose of attending his or her Senate confirmation
hearings will be considered personal expense of the nominee and will not be reimbursed by FCA. However, consistent
with existing General Accounting Office interpretations, the FCA will pay for a nominee's travel expenses to the
Washington, DC metropolitan area (including lodging and subsistence), if payment is approved, in advance whenever
practicable, by the Chairman or Acting Chairman based on a determination that the nominee's travel is related to official
business that will result in a substantial benefit to the FCA. That determination will be made on a case-by-case basis
and is within the sole discretion of the Chairman or Acting Chairman. The same standards and policies that apply to
the reimbursement of Board members' travel expenses will apply to the reimbursement of nominee's expenses. As part
of the documentation for the approval process, the Chairman or Acting Chairman must execute a written finding that
a nominee's travel would substantially benefit the FCA.
Travel that may result in substantial benefit to the FCA could include meetings, briefings, conferences, or other
similar encounters between the nominee and FCA Board members, office directors, other senior agency officials,
or other senior congressional and executive branch officials, for the purpose of developing substantive knowledge
about the FCA, its role, its interaction with other Government entities, or the institutions that it regulates. Meetings
or briefings of this nature may enable a nominee to more quickly and effectively assume leadership of the agency after
confirmation by the Senate and could thus substantially benefit the agency.


Section 2. Board Member Relocation


Board members will be reimbursed by FCA for travel and transportation expenses incurred in connection with relocation
to their first official duty station. Expenses for which reimbursement will be allowed generally include, but are
not limited to the following:
(a) Travel and per diem for the Board member;
(b) Travel, but not per diem for immediate family of the Board member;
(c) Mileage if privately owned vehicle is used in travel; and
(d) Transportation and temporary storage of household goods.
Each relocation will be considered separately and all rates and allowances will be determined at the time of authorization,
notwithstanding the limitations of 5 U.S.C., Chapter 57 and the Federal Travel Regulations. Reimbursement of additional
expenses may be authorized if warranted by specific circumstances. Board members will be issued a specific prior
written authorization by the Chief of the Human Resources Division detailing the expenses that may be reimbursed
and will be required to execute a one year service agreement.


Section 3. Representation and Reception


The Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended, authorizes the expenditure of Farm Credit Administration (FCA) funds for
official representation and reception expenses. Expenditures of funds for official representation and reception
expenses shall not exceed any statutory limitation placed on the expenditure of such funds. Additionally, use of
the representation and reception fund is discretionary and the Board may determine in any fiscal year that it will
spend no funds for official representation and reception activities. Furthermore, the official representation
and reception fund shall be a fund of last resort and shall not be used for expenditures that can properly be classified
as another type of agency expenditure.
All expenditures of funds for official representation and reception expenses shall be in accordance with the guidelines
contained in this rule. Furthermore, all such expenditures shall be consistent with the decisions of the Comptroller
General of the United States pertaining to official representation and reception expenses, except that no expenditure
of representation and reception funds shall be made for paying expenses of FCA or other Federal Government employees
at any official representation and reception function.

<TEXT>
 

Official functions falling within the representation and reception fund category would be activities of the FCA
Board or of individual members of the Board, acting in their official capacity as representatives of the FCA, that
involve extending official courtesies to public and foreign dignitaries on occasions associated with the mission
of FCA. Expenses for such activities could include, for example:
Food and beverages, either formal meals, snacks or refreshments; receptions; banquets; catering services; tips
and gratuities; invitations; rental of facilities and incidental equipment; and supplies and services that are
incurred in hosting such functions.
Typical examples of proper expenditures of FCA representation and reception funds include:
(a) The FCA Board hosting an FCA-sponsored reception for non-Government personnel, e.g., presidents and chief executive
officers of Farm Credit System associations; or
(b) A Board member hosting and paying for the lunch of a representative of the Farm Credit Council when the purpose of
the lunch is to discuss Farm Credit business.
No expenditure of representation and reception funds may be made for activities relating solely to personal entertainment,
such as attendance at a sporting event or a concert or for expenditures generally regarded as personal obligations.
Before expenditures for official representation and reception expenses are made by the FCA Board or individual members
of the Board, approval shall be obtained from the Chairman of the Board. FCA-006 form, ``Official Representation
and Reception Expense,'' shall be submitted, through the Secretary to the Board, to the Chairman for approval. After
approval by the Chairman, the Secretary to the Board will submit the request to the FCA Certifying Official for final
approval. If circumstances necessitate expenditures for official representation and reception expenses without
prior approval by the chairman, form FCA-006 shall be submitted, through the Secretary to the Board, to the Chairman
with an attached explanation of why prior approval could not be obtained. If the expenditure is not approved by the
Chairman or the FCA Certifying Official, the party making the expenditure will be responsible for all costs associated
with the expenditure.


Article IX


Amendments


Section 1


The business of the Board shall be transacted in accordance with these Rules as the same may be amended from time to time:
Provided, however, that upon agreement of at least two (2) Members convened in a duly called meeting, the Rules may
be waived in any particular instance, except that action may be taken on items at a Special Meeting only in accordance
with Article V, Section 3(b), hereof.


Section 2


These Rules may be changed or amended by the concurring vote of at least two (2) Members upon notice of the proposed change
or amendment's having been given at least thirty (30) days before such vote.

<DOCTITLE>Statement of Policy on System Institution Activities Involving the Potential for Nonexclusive Territories </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Farm Credit Administration. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Statement of policy; request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Farm Credit Act of 1971 (1971 Act) gives the Farm Credit Administration (FCA) broad powers to issue and amend the
charters of Farm Credit System (System) institutions and regulate the exercise of their powers. In most instances
since 1933 the FCA has issued charters and regulations that authorize institutions to provide their services in exclusive
territories. The FCA Board has determined that since the agency may be requested to issue nonexclusive charters in
the future or to modify the regulations governing out-of-territory activities, the FCA Board should adopt a policy
statement setting forth its views on nonexclusive territories. The FCA Board is requesting comments on its views.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The 1971 Act authorizes the FCA to issue and amend the charters of System institutions and regulate the exercise of
their powers. Included in this authority is the ability for the FCA to issue or amend charters or promulgate regulations
that would result in increased competition among System institutions. The issue of competition among System institutions
arises, typically, in two types of situations. First, charters could be issued authorizing two or more System institutions
to extend the same types of credit services to the same types of customers in the same geographic territories; such
charters have typically been issued as a result of mergers or other chartering actions requested by institutions.
Second, institutions could be authorized by regulation to engage in certain activities outside of their chartered
territories. 



Background 



Although the FCA has broad authority to issue charters that authorize two or more institutions to serve the same territory,
exclusive charters have been the general practice since 1933.

1

 The exceptions to this general practice are worth noting. Prior to the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 (1987 Act),
at least four types of competition existed at various times as follows: 




(1) Nonexclusive Charters 



The 1916 Federal Farm Loan Act (1916 Act) authorized the creation of numerous National Farm Loan Associations, predecessors
to the Federal land bank associations (FLBAs). Few, if any, of these associations had exclusive territories. Most
of the charters involving nonexclusive territories were issued prior to 1933. At one time, there were about 5,000
FLBAs. As a result of mergers and territorial realignments, only a few FLBA charters with nonexclusive territories
remain, all in the Texas District. 



(2) Competition Between Short- and Long-Term Lenders



The potential for intra-System competition has always existed between the long-term lender (Federal land bank/FLBA)
and the short- and intermediate-term lender (Federal intermediate credit bank/production credit association/agricultural
credit association) (FICB/PCA/ACA) serving the same territory because of overlapping lending authorities. 



(3) Specialized Association Charters 



In the early days of the System, FCA granted certain associations authority to finance specific commodities over
wide geographical areas (often statewide) resulting in the issuance of charters with the same territory as other
associations in the area. Only two of these specialized lending charters remain: two ACAs on the east coast have full
authority in an exclusively chartered area and very limited authority in broader areas. 



In addition, a small number of other nonexclusive charters were granted. Very few of the other nonexclusive charters
granted during this early period still exist, and they are primarily located in New Mexico, a small area of California,
and Nevada. 



(4) Competition Created By Statute 



The 1916 Act created parallel long-term mortgage credit systems to serve both commercial banks and direct retail
customers: A system of cooperative mortgage banks and a system of joint stock land banks owned by investors. The former
evolved into the Federal land banks (now the farm credit banks or agricultural credit banks) and the latter no longer
exist.

In addition to these existing forms of competition, the 1987 Act contained several provisions that have resulted
in competition among System institutions:

(1) Section 411


This section provided that PCAs and FLBAs sharing substantially the same territory were required to vote on whether
to merge. These mergers led to five ACAs with nonexclusive charters in areas where the parties merging did not have
identical territories. The FCA Board also provided any association that no longer had exclusive territory as a result
of such mergers an opportunity to become an ACA. Several of the associations affected by these ``411 mergers'' subsequently
became ACAs. 





(2) Section 413



This section required a merger vote by the 13 banks for cooperatives (BCs). Eleven of the 13 banks voted to merge, resulting
in the creation of three BCs with the same territory. 



(3) Section 433



This section authorized certain associations to change their affiliation from one Farm Credit Bank (FCB) to another.
The district FCB from which the association shifted retained its chartered authority to continue to serve the area
through other existing or newly created associations. However, competitive charters cannot be issued in these areas
unless the affected parties give their consent. So far, no competitive association charters have resulted from this
provision. 

In addition to these statutory authorities, there are certain restraints on the FCA's authority to issue competitive
charters. 


First, following passage of the 1987 Act, the FCA Board granted charters to institutions serving the same territory
in those situations arising from mergers that were specifically required to be voted on by the 1987 Act or as necessary
to provide for a level playing field as a result of those mergers. However, because of concerns surrounding the potential
for competitive situations arising from the 1987 Act, the FCA Board determined it would not issue competitive charters,
other than as required by statute, until it had thoroughly reviewed the issue. 

Second, the law specifies certain circumstances in which the FCA may only grant competitive charters if all of the
institutions affected by the proposed charter grant their approval. Those circumstances involve: 

(1) The territories where associations changed their affiliation from one FCB to another in accordance with section
433 of the 1987 Act; and 

(2) The States of Mississippi, Alabama, and all of Louisiana except the territory served by the Northwest Louisiana
PCA. 


With the exception of those situations discussed above where an institution must obtain the consent of another institution,
the law does not prohibit institutions from requesting ``competitive charters.'' Indeed, the 1971 Act does not directly
address the issue of competition among System institutions. Instead, the Act concerns itself with the purposes,
operating objectives, and authorities of the System and its regulator. When the agency receives these requests it
must act on them, based on an analysis of all relevant facts, and arrive at a reasonable conclusion that is consistent
with the purposes of the Act. In the first few years after passage of the 1987 Act, most of the FCA's decisions involving
competitive issues were associated with the merger of unlike associations to become ACAs. In the last few years, the
competitive issues coming before the FCA have involved banks as well as associations. In addition to matters involving
charters, competition issues have arisen in the context of out-of-territory authorities provided for by regulations.
By this policy statement, the FCA Board now expresses its views on how the agency will approach decisions that may involve
competition among System institutions. 



Recent Analysis 



In 1990, the FCA contracted with consultants to review the issue of competition within the System and provide the FCA
Board with options to consider. In 1991, as a part of its legislative initiative, the FCA Board recommended to Congress
that the 1971 Act be amended to require that ACA charters contain exclusive territory. In 1992, the FCA Chairman appointed
FCA Board Member Gary C. Byrne to lead an internal work group focusing on the issue. This work group analyzed competition
from several perspectives and developed a set of recommendations for agency action in the absence of legislative
changes.

<TEXT>
 

FCA staff identified advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to the general question of competition
within the System and also considered several challenging situations that may (or have) come before the agency:
(1) An association not properly serving its territory;
(2) An association wanting to merge, but potential mergers would involve a charter with nonexclusive territories
as a result of an inability to establish congruent territory; and (3) An eligible customer with operations in two or
more association territories wishing to choose which association would best serve his/her needs. 


Opinion Interviews 


FCA staff interviewed representatives of some of the System institutions that currently have the authority to compete.
The purpose of the interviews was to gain insight into how competition is working within the System. Among those interviewed,
there was no consensus on either the benefits or disadvantages of competition. 
Some interviewees questioned whether ``competition'' should exist in the current environment. There was agreement
among institution managers that customer loyalty to the System plays a big part in maintaining business relationships
and, as a result, competing institutions should not do anything that would damage the System's reputation. Most respondents
wanted to preserve the funding benefits of the System's Government-sponsored-enterprise (GSE) status. Some association
managers wanted to be able to shop for funding from different System banks. Several operational problems relating
to the accommodation of competition in the current environment were cited: joint and several liability; System institution
board representation; size differential; and common funding through a bank jointly owned by competitors. 
In addition to these interviews, FCA staff conducted a limited survey of System farmer-customers, directors, and
managers. The sample was relatively small, consisting of 51 respondents of 135 randomly selected, so no definitive
conclusions were drawn. The survey was done to get a sense of the nature and extent of support for, or opposition to,
intra-System competition. Six questions on the survey represented various positions the agency could take relative
to the competition issue. Additionally, the survey respondents were provided the opportunity to write in any comments
on the issue and include those comments as part of the survey. 
The results of the survey indicated no clear consensus for or against competition. The farmer-customers surveyed
were somewhat more likely to favor competition than were the managers and directors. Most System institution managers
surveyed were opposed to competition; however, the directors believed that some form of competition would be justified
if the farmer-customers were not being adequately served. The only area of consensus was opposition to chartering
a new association within the territory already being served by an existing association. 


Competition in the Larger Market 


FCA staff also reviewed the economic literature on competition. System institutions are participants in the agricultural
credit market, which is a part of the broader financial credit market. The financial credit market, generally, is
among the most competitive markets in the world, in that no one market participant can control price and availability.
While this general competitiveness appears to be true for the agricultural credit market as a whole, there are exceptions
in some geographical areas and specialty submarkets. Staff concluded that Government action should not normally
be required to ensure that competitive markets for agricultural credit exist, and that Government action might be
appropriate if the agricultural credit market in a specific geographical area or agricultural credit submarket
were noncompetitive. 
Because System institutions compete in the broader agricultural and general credit markets, increasing the amount
and nature of competition between and among System institutions could only improve the availability, terms, and
price of credit for eligible customers if the overall market for agricultural credit in a certain area were noncompetitive.
Therefore, when the local market for agricultural credit is already competitive, the additional economic benefits
of increased competition, including competition among System institutions, are likely to be relatively small (although
there may be other, noneconomic reasons for such competition). Conversely, when the local market for agricultural
credit is not competitive, the economic benefits of increased competition, including competition among System
institutions, are likely to be relatively large (although there may be other, noneconomic reasons for avoiding such
competition). 
Finally, the FCA attempted to determine if there were lessons to be learned or knowledge to be gained by looking at competition
between the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and the Federal National Mortgage Association
(Fannie Mae). These two GSEs carry an implicit Federal government guarantee. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae both serve
the same market for secondary housing loans and, although both have existed for some time, they have only competed
directly against each other since 1990. 
Interviews were conducted with representatives from the two GSEs, the Federal government oversight agency, independent
rating agencies, and those who do business with both companies. Almost all of the participants believed that competition
between the two had yielded extremely productive results, both in the way of new products for housing consumers as
well as investors.

The interviewees expressed little concern that the newly acquired ability to compete could force one GSE out of business,
thus triggering some Federal response. However, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are a duopoly for the market they serve.
Between the two, they clearly control the single-family housing, conventional loan secondary market_an enormous
market to begin with_which shows every sign of continued growth. Because of the nature of the market, its size, its
growth, and the limited number of market participants, vigorous innovation and competition are not surprising.

After considering the work group's analysis, the FCA Board concluded that the FCA's current policy of granting exclusive
charters, with limited exceptions, has been generally effective in facilitating the delivery of agricultural credit
and related services to eligible customers. However, the FCA Board also recognizes that its current position does
not provide for consideration of competitive charters, even if such charters would provide customers with lower
cost or higher quality agricultural credit. Consequently, the FCA Board proposes to modify its current policy on
competition to authorize the issuance of competitive charters when doing so would enhance, beyond the status quo,
the availability of the highest quality, lowest cost credit and credit service, on a safe and sound, financially sustainable
basis, to eligible customers. The FCA Board invites your comments on the following statement. 


Proposed Policy Statement on System Institution Activities Involving the Potential for Nonexclusive Territories



Competition between Farm Credit System institutions can potentially occur as a result of the Farm Credit Administration's
(FCA) authority to issue nonexclusive charters and, in some situations, by regulation. As a general rule, the FCA
grants charters and issues regulations which do not provide for intra-System competition. The FCA Board continues
to endorse this general practice of noncompetitive territories as being reasonable for a cooperatively owned enterprise
that competes with a variety of other credit suppliers. 
Nevertheless, the degree to which the FCA's authority can influence the level of territorial exclusivity is guided
by the overall purposes and, in some cases, the specific direction of the Farm Credit Act of 1971 (Act). Briefly stated,
the Act seeks to provide for a customer-owned system of cooperative lending institutions that can provide sound and
constructive credit and credit services for agriculture, certain types of rural housing, and utilities while maintaining
high levels of safety and soundness as measured by sustained financial viability. If a System institution were to
propose a territorial structure or lending authority different from current practice, the FCA's response would
be based on how the new proposal meets the purposes of the Act. There may be limited circumstances under which some form
of competition would result in higher quality, lower cost service to customers, on a safe and sound, financially sustainable
basis. 
The purpose of this policy statement is to provide a consistent framework within which the FCA may respond to issues
that involve the potential for competition as a result of either charter, regulation, or other request submitted
by System institutions. 
The FCA Board recognizes that System institution boards may occasionally seek to alter their charters or expand authorities
beyond current boundaries to enhance efficiencies or to provide better service to customers. Prior to formally submitting
requests, the FCA encourages the adjacent institutions involved to resolve any territorial disputes that may result
from the request in a fair and amicable manner. Considerable guidance is provided in FCA regulations concerning routine
charter amendments, territorial transfers, and out-of-territory lending. Additionally, the FCA Board encourages
the development of innovative proposals to address territorial and competitive issues that are not covered by existing
regulation. These may range from one institution granting permission for the other institution to lend to its customers,
to reciprocal agreements to compete in each other's territory, to providing some form of compensation for ceded territory,
or to enter into some form of joint venture. The FCA will provide assistance, upon request, to enable System institutions
to reach agreements on such matters. Naturally, such innovative agreements must be consistent with the Act and FCA
regulations. 
In the event agreements are not reached, based on the purposes of the Act, the standard for addressing each request
involving territorial issues with the potential for intra-System competition is consistent with what is used in
deciding all charter requests, that is:



Determine whether or not the proposal will enhance, beyond the status quo, the availability of the highest quality,
lowest cost, credit and credit service on a safe and sound, financially sustainable basis to eligible customers.



In determining whether or not the above standard is met, the FCA will analyze a range of factors, as each is deemed relevant
to the situation, as outlined in the following categories:

1. Finance and Management 



(a) Whether the financial and managerial capacity exists to provide competitive services and generate sufficient
earnings so the new enterprise can continue on a sustainable basis. 

(b) The degree to which it is evident that the proposal could adversely affect the cost of funds to either the specific
institutions involved or the System as a whole. 

(c) Whether the proposal will adversely affect the institutions involved, thus creating potential liability for
the Farm Credit System Insurance Fund and/or subsequently for banks under joint and several liability. 



2. Market Conditions 



(a) Whether there is significant information that the market involved is being inadequately served by a System institution.


(b) The extent to which the market involved is being served by other credit sources. 



3. Participant Opinion 



(a) The views and concerns of the affected System institutions, including, as appropriate, the views of customer-shareholders,
recognizing that significant disagreement between members of a cooperative system has the potential for adverse
consequences regarding matters for which they are mutually responsible. 

Depending upon the situation, other factors, such as the degree to which the FCA's discretion is affected by statutory
or judicial considerations or the opinions of outside oversight parties, might also affect the FCA's decision. 

The FCA intends to apply this analysis, on a case-by-case basis, to requests that involve charters where two institutions
would be serving all or part of the same territory. Similarly, the FCA will apply the same analysis should future efforts
occur to promulgate regulations that would expand or change the authorities of institutions to engage in out-of-territory
activities. 

In the case of charter requests, to ensure that it obtains all of the necessary information, the FCA will develop procedures,
including a checklist, regarding the submission of materials. The procedures will include mechanisms that will
enable the FCA to solicit and consider the views of System institutions affected by a proposed request. Consistent
with the procedures provided, the requesting institution will be expected to make its case that the standard outlined
in this policy will be met. The FCA recognizes that, by their nature, some of the factors listed would be addressed by
the agency rather than the requesting institution. 

While this policy is designed to address the broader issues of the potential for intra-System competition, several
years ago the FCA determined that it would temporarily avoid acting on requests for competitive charters until it
completed its review of the matter and issued a policy. This policy is designed to achieve that objective. Therefore,
following the development of these procedures, the FCA Board will be in a position to entertain charter requests involving
the potential for competition in accordance with the principles contained in this statement.

The FCA recognizes that System institutions continue to undergo structural change in their effort to best meet the
System's mission. The agency realizes the importance of these changes and will consider each request promptly. 



Specific Request for Comments 



The FCA Board intends to evaluate any matter involving competition among System institutions that comes before it
by balancing all relevant factors on a case-by-case basis. The FCA Board specifically invites comments on the factors
set forth in the proposed policy statement and on the appropriate analysis of such factors, and asks for suggestions
for additional factors or analyses that should be considered by the FCA Board. 

No one factor is likely to be dispositive in any given matter, and the FCA Board has set only one specific criterion or
standard that must be met in each proposal involving increased competition among System institutions_that the proposal,
if approved, would lead to a net overall improvement in the availability, quality, and price of credit and credit services
to eligible customers. The FCA Board invites suggestions on the information it should require and the procedures
it should use to determine the ``availability, quality, and price of credit and credit services'' when it is considering
a matter involving competition among System institutions.

<DOCTITLE>Private Radio Bureau Seeks Comments on Daniel R. Goodman's, and Robert Chan's Requests for Rule Waivers To Extend
the Construction and Loading Deadlines Applicable to Certain Conventional SMR Licenses</DOCTITLE>



April 6, 1994.



Daniel R. Goodman, Court-appointed Receiver (Receiver) for Metropolitan Communications Corp., Nationwide Digital
Data Corp., Columbia Communications Services Corp., and Stephens Sinclair Ltd., seeks waiver of the Commission's
Rules on behalf of approximately 4000 conventional-SMR licensees (``Consumers'') that were allegedly defrauded
by these Receivership companies. Dr. Robert Chan seeks similar relief for the five conventional SMR licenses he acquired
via two of the Receivership companies.
The Receiver requests waiver of 47 CFR 90.633 to extend the eight-month construction and operation deadline applicable
to the licenses held by the Consumers. The Consumers obtained their licenses via the Receivership companies' offerings
and sales of investments in SMR licenses, applications, and filing services. The Receiver pleads that, according
to the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC's) Complaint filed in U.S. District Court on January 11, 1994, the Receivership
companies allegedly defrauded and mislead the Consumers as to the FCC's Rules. As a result, the Consumers obtained
approximately 4000 conventional SMR licenses, which are now on the verge of cancelling automatically because the
stations will not be constructed within eight months from the grant date, as required by  90.633.
The Consumers paid $7000 for each license they obtained via the Receivership companies and, according to the Receiver,
could lose an aggregate sum of approximately $28 million if these licenses cancel. If the Commission grants these
licensees a new eight-month period to construct, operate, and load their stations, the Receiver plans to facilitate
transactions whereby stations first would be constructed and managed by existing SMR operators and then assigned.
Each individual licensee may decide whether to enter any transaction presented by the Receiver.

Noting the FTC actions against the Receivership companies, Dr. Chan states that the Receivership companies he dealt
with do not have the capability to construct stations in time for him to meet  90.633. Dr. Chan therefore requests
a one-year extension for each of his five licenses, stating that he has now taken over all of the business and engineering
activities for his stations in an attempt to facilitate construction and operation.

The Receiver tendered a $105 filing fee; Dr. Chan did not tender a filing fee. By requesting public comments on the instant
requests, we clarify that the Commission is not ruling on the adequacy of the filing fees tendered.
The Private Radio Bureau solicits comments on all aspects of these two proposals. Comments should be filed on or before
May 13, 1994. Reply comments should be filed on or before May 27, 1994. Comments and reply comments should be addressed
to: Rules Branch, Land Mobile and Microwave Division, Private Radio Bureau, room 5202, STOP 1700A1, Federal Communications
Commission, Washington, DC 20554.

Copies of Dr. Chan's and the Receiver's filings may be obtained from the Commission's duplicating contractor, International
Transcription Service, Inc. (ITS), 2100 M Street, NW., suite 140, (202) 857-3800. A copy is also available for
public inspection in room 5202, 2025 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20554.

Announcement of Cooperative Agreement to Case Western Reserve University 



Summary



The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds to
continue, on a sole source basis, a Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-Related Tuberculosis Demonstration cooperative
agreement on applied drug efficacy and preventive therapy (ADEPT) with Case Western Reserve University (CWRU).
Approximately $500,000 will be available in FY 1994 to support this project. It is expected the award will begin on
August 1, 1994, for a 12-month budget period within a 5-year project period. Funding estimates may vary and are subject
to change. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and availability
of funds. 

The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to improve the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of tuberculosis
in persons infected with HIV through demonstration and applied research. Applied research, as used in the context
of this announcement, means the process of developing and evaluating practical operational approaches and solutions
to tuberculosis problems. 

The CDC will (1) Provide consultation and technical assistance in planning, implementing, and evaluating strategies
and protocols, (2) Provide up-to-date scientific information on tuberculosis and HIV-infection and related diseases,
(3) Assist in data management, analysis, and the evaluation of programmatic activities, and (4) Assist in the preparation
and publication of results. 

The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality
of life. This announcement is related to the priority areas of HIV Infection and Immunization and Infectious Diseases.
(For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the Section 

WHERE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

) 



Authority



This program is authorized under sections 301(a) and 317(k)(2) of the Public Health Service Act, [42 U.S.C. 241(a)
and 247b(k)(2)], as amended.

Smoke-Free Workplace 



The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 



Eligible Applicant 



Assistance will be provided only to CWRU for this project. No other applications are solicited. The program announcement
and application kit have been sent to CWRU. 

CWRU is the most appropriate and qualified agency to provide the services specified under this cooperative agreement
because: 

1. In 1991, CWRU was the only applicant funded through the competitive announcement 

#

114, ADEPT/HIV-Related Tuberculosis Demonstration. The study being conducted is a trial of preventive therapy
in HIV-infected persons in Uganda; regimens being followed in the current study are novel chemotherapy regimens
requiring long-term follow up of patients to determine the efficacy of these drugs. CWRU currently has enrolled more
than 600 tuberculin-positive patients in the study. During the initial months of recruitment, the investigators
found a significant number of immunocompromised patients unable to respond to skin test antigens (anergic). Since
October 1993, these patients are being enrolled in the study to assess whether they are at even higher risk for the development
of tuberculosis and whether preventive treatment would be effective. As of November 1993, 11 anergic patients were
participating in the trial. Enrollment into the study is continuing; however, there will not be sufficient time in
the current project period to complete the enrollment of 1200 nonanergic and 500 anergic patients and follow these
patients for the 2 years necessary to collect meaningful data on the efficacy of the preventive therapy regimens.
Without continuing the project for an additional 5 years, the data collected to date will be of limited usefulness
in assessing the efficacy of the regimens evaluated in this study. 

2. The work under this cooperative agreement will be conducted in the Republic of Uganda. Uganda has one of the highest
prevalences of HIV and tuberculous dually-infected persons in the world. The CWRU project is able to enroll 20 nonanergic
and 5 anergic patients each week; no other known sites have access to sufficient patients to enroll at this rate. This
rate of enrollment is necessary to ensure that sufficient numbers of patients are enrolled to provide statistically-valid
results within a relatively short period of time. The CWRU research team also has established relations with Ugandan
institutions that should ensure the success of a high-quality trial. Results on the efficacy of preventive therapy
regimens in HIV-infected persons are needed to aid in the elimination of tuberculosis in the United States, as outlined
in ``A Strategic Plan for the Elimination of Tuberculosis in the United States.'' 

3. CWRU possesses proven scientific and managerial competence in treating TB patients and in conducting clinical
research trials. Many of the patients in the current cohort have been followed for as long as a year with very few patients
lost to follow up. CWRU has been successful in other CDC-funded clinical trials involving the long-term follow-up
(2 years or more) of HIV-infected persons. 

4. To date, CDC has provided over $1,000,000 to establish this cohort. Use of this cohort will be less expensive and
provide more timely results than to begin enrollment of another cohort at a different site. Additionally, no other
known site can provide enrollment at the rate necessary to adequately assess the treatment regimens. 

5. The current spread of TB demands new methods for combating this disease. The results of this study will add significantly
to the body of information on the efficacy of specific regimens in preventing tuberculosis in HIV-infected persons.
The rifampin-containing regimens may provide options for preventing tuberculosis in HIV-infected persons exposed
to INH-resistant organisms.

Notification of a new system of records.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act, the Public Health Service (PHS) is publishing a notice of a
new system of records, 09-25-0172, ``Clinical Research: National Center for Human Genome Research,
HHS/NIH/NCHGR.'' We are also proposing routine uses for this new system.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) proposes to establish a new system of records: 09-25-0172, ``Clinical
Research: National Center for Human Genome Research, HHS/NIH/NCHGR.'' Established as of October 1, 1989, the National
Center for Human Genome Research (NCHGR) is the focal point within the NIH and the Department of Health and Human Services
for the development of research policy and long-range planning for the NIH component of the Human Genome Project.
NCHGR's Division of Extramural Research funds research in laboratories throughout the country in chromosome mapping,
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing, database development, technology development, and studies of the ethical,
legal, and social implications of genetics research. NCHGR's newly established Division of Intramural Research
plans to focus on technologies for finding disease genes, developing DNA diagnostics and gene therapies. The Division
will serve as a hub for NIH-wide human genetics research and enhance the work of investigators in other Institutes
who are searching for specific genes and studying their function in health and disease. This system of records will
be used by NIH to support clinical research aimed at understanding the genetic basis of human disease, its diagnosis
and treatment.


The system will comprise records that contain information identifying participants (such as name, address, Social
Security number), medical records (including psychosocial evaluations), progress reports, correspondence,
epidemiological data, research findings, and records on biological specimens, (e.g., blood, urine, and genetic
materials). Provision of the Social Security number is voluntary.
The amount of information recorded on each individual will be only that which is necessary to accomplish the purpose
of the system. The records in this system will be maintained in a secure manner compatible with their content and use.
NIH and contractor staff will be required to adhere to the provisions of the Privacy Act and the HHS Privacy Act Regulations.
The System Manager will control access to the data. Only authorized users whose official duties require the use of
such information will have regular access to the records in this system. Authorized users are HHS employees, and contractors
responsible for implementing the clinical research. Researchers authorized to conduct research on biological
specimens will have access to the system through the use of encrypted identifiers sufficient to link individuals
with records in such a manner that does not compromise confidentiality of the individual.
Records will be stored in file folders, computer tapes, computer diskettes, microfiche, and file cards. Manual and
computerized records will be maintained in accordance with the standards of Chapter 45-13 of the HHS General
Administration Manual, ``Safeguarding Records Contained in Systems of Records,'' supplementary Chapter PHS hf:
45-13, the Department's Automated Information System Security Program Handbook, and the National Institute
of Standards and Technology Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS Pub. 41 and FIPS Pub. 31).
Data stored in computers will be accessed through the use of keywords known only to authorized users. Rooms where records
are stored are locked when not in use. During regular business hours, rooms are unlocked but are controlled by on-site
personnel. Depending upon the sensitivity of the information in the record, additional safeguard measures are employed.

The routine uses proposed for this system are compatible with the stated purposes of the system. The first routine
use permitting disclosure to a congressional office is proposed to allow subject individuals to obtain assistance
from their representatives in Congress, should they so desire. Such disclosure would be made only pursuant to a request
of the individual. The second routine use allows disclosure to the Department of Justice to defend the Federal Government,
the Department, or employees of the Department in the event of litigation. The third routine use allows disclosure
to contractors and subcontractors for the purpose of processing, maintaining and refining records in the system.
Contracting for such services is advisable because the agency lacks necessary internal resources and because processing
or refining the records using contractors will be cost-effective. The contractors will maintain and will be required
to ensure that subcontractors maintain Privacy Act safeguards with respect to such records. The fourth routine use
permits disclosure of a record for an authorized research purpose under specified conditions.
The following notice is written in the present, rather than future tense, in order to avoid the unnecessary expenditure
of public funds to republish the notice after the system has become effective.

Categories of records in the system: 
 


Information identifying participants (such as name, address, Social Security number), medical records (including
psychosocial evaluations), progress reports, correspondence, epidemiological data, research findings, and
records on biological specimens, (e.g., blood, urine, and genetic materials). 
 


Authority for maintenance of the system: 
 


42 U.S.C. 287c, ``National Center for Human Genome Research,'' stating that the purpose of NCHGR is to characterize
the structure and function of the human genome, including the mapping and sequencing of individual genes, as well
as planning and coordinating the research goal of the Genome project; reviewing and funding research proposals;
developing training programs; coordinating international genome research; communicating advances in genome
research to the public; and reviewing and funding research to address the genome project's ethical and legal issues.

 


Purpose(s): 
 


These records are used to support clinical research aimed at understanding the role of the structure and function
of the human genome in human disease, diagnosis and treatment. 
 


Routine uses of records maintained in the system, including categories of users and the purposes of such use: 
 


1. Disclosure may be made to a congressional office from the record of an individual in response to an inquiry from the
congressional office made at the request of that individual. 
 
2. In the event of litigation where the defendant is (a) the Department, any component of the Department, or any employee
of the Department in his or her official capacity; (b) the United States where the Department determines that the claim,
if successful, is likely to affect directly the operations of the Department or any of its components; or (c) any Department
employee in his or her individual capacity where the Department of Justice has agreed to represent such employee,
for example, in defending a claim against the Public Health Service, based upon an individual's mental or physical
condition and alleged to have arisen because of activities of the Public Health Service in connection with such individual,
the Department may disclose such records as it deems desirable or necessary to the Department of Justice to enable
that Department to present an effective defense, provided that such disclosure is compatible with the purpose for
which the records were collected. 
 
3. NIH may disclose records to Department contractors and subcontractors for the purpose of collecting, compiling,
aggregating, analyzing, or refining records in the system. Contractors maintain, and are also required to ensure
that subcontractors maintain, Privacy Act safeguards with respect to such records. 
 
4. A record may be disclosed for a research purpose, when the Department: (A) Has determined that the use or disclosure
does not violate legal or policy limitations under which the record was provided, collected, or obtained; (B) has
determined that the research purpose (1) cannot be reasonably accomplished unless the record is provided in individually
identifiable form, and (2) warrants the risk to the privacy of the individual that additional exposure of the record
might bring; (C) has required the recipient to (1) establish reasonable administrative, technical, and physical
safeguards to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of the record, (2) remove or destroy the information that identifies
the individual at the earliest time at which removal or destruction can be accomplished consistent with the purpose
of the research project, unless the recipient has presented adequate justification of a research or health nature
for retaining such information, and (3) make no further use or disclosure of the record except (a) in emergency circumstances
affecting the health or safety of any individual, (b) for use in another research project, under these same conditions,
and with written authorization of the Department, (c) for disclosure to a properly identified person for the purpose
of an audit related to the research project, if information that would enable research subjects to be identified is
removed or destroyed at the earliest opportunity consistent with the purpose of the audit, or (d) when required by
law; (D) has secured a written statement attesting to the recipient's understanding of, and willingness to abide
by these provisions.

Policies and practices for storing, retrieving, accessing, retaining, and disposing of records in the system:

Storage:



Records may be stored in file folders, computer tapes and diskettes, microfiche, and file cards.



Retrievability:



Records are retrieved by name, Social Security number, or other identifying numbers, keywords, and parameters of
individual patient health or medical record data.



Safeguards:



1. 

Authorized users: 

Data on computer files is accessed by keyword known only to authorized users who are NIH or contractor employees who
have a need for the data in performance of their duties as determined by the System Manager. A list of authorized users
will be maintained and updated periodically. Researchers authorized to conduct research on biological specimens
will have access to the system through the use of encrypted identifiers sufficient to link individuals with records
in such a manner that does not compromise confidentiality of the individual. Access to information is thus limited
to those with a need to know. 

2. 

Physical safeguards: 

Rooms where records are stored are locked when not in use. During regular business hours rooms are unlocked but are
controlled by on-site personnel. Depending upon the sensitivity of the information in the record, additional safeguard
measures may be employed. 

3. 

Procedural and technical safeguards: 

Data stored in computers is accessed through the use of keywords known only to authorized users. A password is required
to access the terminal and a data set name controls the release of data to only authorized users. All users of personal
information in connection with the performance of their jobs (see Authorized Users, above) protect information
from public view and from unauthorized personnel entering an unsupervised office. Contractors and subcontractors
who maintain records in this system are instructed to make no further disclosure of the records except as authorized
by the System Manager and as permitted by the Privacy Act. Privacy Act requirements are specifically included in contracts
and in agreements with grantees or collaborators participating in research activities supported by this system.
HHS project directors, contract officers, and project officers oversee compliance with these requirements. 

These practices are in compliance with the standards of Chapter 45-13 of the HHS General Administration Manual,
``Safeguarding Records Contained in Systems of Records,'' supplementary Chapter PHS hf: 45-13, and the Department's
Automated Information System Security Program Handbook, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology
Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS Pub. 41 and FIPS Pub. 31). 



Retention and disposal:



Records are retained and disposed of under the authority of the NIH Records Control Schedule contained in NIH Manual
Chapter 1743, Appendix 1_``Keeping and Destroying Records'' (HHS Records Management Manual, Appendix B-361),
item 3000-G-3(b), which allows records to be kept as long as they are useful in scientific research. Refer
to the NIH Manual Chapter for specific disposition instructions.

HOPE for Public and Indian Housing Homeownership Program (HOPE 1); Award Based on Procedural Error 

 

<AGENCY>
agency:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD.

 

 </AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action:

 Notice of award based on procedural error. 

 



 
</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 This notice announces an award of a HOPE 1 grant of $24,882,854 to the New Community Corporation in Newark, New Jersey.
This award is made after a determination by the Department that a procedural error was made in processing applications
under a HOPE 1 Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA) published on October 6, 1992.

 

 </SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 After re-examining the procedures used to process applications submitted in response to a NOFA for the HOPE 1 program
published on October 6, 1992, the Department has concluded that it made a ``procedural error'' with respect to one
applicant. Section 415(b)(5) of the HOPE 1 Program Guidelines states: ``Procedural errors discovered after notification
of approved applicants which, if corrected, would result in approval of an application which was not approved will
be corrected by funding the application from any unused amounts or `off the top' from amounts available for implementation
grants in the next funding round.'' HUD has determined that it made a procedural error in reviewing the HOPE 1 implementation
grant application submitted by the New Community Corporation for a portion of the Hayes Homes public housing development
in Newark, New Jersey. The Department established a minimum score in that competition by using the lowest score awarded
to a funded application in the previous funding round. This minimum score disqualified the New Community Corporation
from being funded in the competitive round. 

 

Upon further examination, HUD concluded that it made an error in its method of establishing the minimum score, since
New Community Corporation was rated on only eight selection criteria and the minimum score used was based upon applications
rated under nine criteria. (New Community Corporation was only rated under eight criteria because it was the only
eligible applicant in the funding round and the ninth criterion, which was intended to compare the cost-per-unit
among multiple applicants, could not be applied in the case of a sole applicant competition.) Accordingly, HUD determined
that in establishing the minimum score, it should have pro-rated the score awarded to the lowest funded application
from the previous competitive round. Since New Community Corporation would have been eligible for funding but for
HUD's failure to pro-rate the minimum score, it is funding New Community Corporation's application. 

 The Department will utilize unused amounts from appropriations for fiscal years 1992 through 1994 to fund the $24,882,854
awarded to the New Community Corporation as outlined below. The Department will allocate $9,592,854 from unused
funds appropriated in fiscal years 1992-93 to fund a portion of the $24,882,854 that is being awarded to the New
Community Corporation under this notice. The remaining $15,190,000 of the grant will be funded using amounts appropriated
for the HOPE program in 1994. 

 On August 2, 1993, the Department published a NOFA announcing the availability of $182,047,160 in funding for implementation
grants for the HOPE 1 program (58 FR 41126). On September 1, 1993, the Department published an amendment to the NOFA
increasing the funding being made available by $24,000,000 from $182,047,160 to $206,047,160 due to the conclusion
of the processing of a reprogramming request (58 FR 46209). The funds were appropriated by the Departments of Veterans
Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriation Acts for fiscal year 1992 (Pub.
L. 102-139, approved October 28, 1991) and fiscal year 1993 (Pub. L. 102-389, approved October 6, 1992).
In its fiscal year 1994 appropriations bill for HUD, Congress rescinded $45,000,000 from the amounts remaining available
for the HOPE 1 program under the Department's fiscal year 1992 appropriation (Pub. L. 102-139) and $130,000,000
from the amounts remaining available under the Department's fiscal year 1993 appropriation (Pub. L. 102-389)
for a total recision of $175,000,000 in the amount of funds made available under the previously published NOFA and
amendment. On January 13, 1994, the Department published a second amendment to the August 2, 1993 NOFA decreasing
the amount available by $175,000,000 from $206,047,160 to $31,047,160 (59 FR 1968). Of the $31,047,160 available
under the NOFA, $9,692,854 will be used to fund a portion of the $24,882,854 that is being awarded to the New Community
Corporation pursuant to this notice. The remainder of the grant will be funded using amounts appropriated for the
HOPE program in 1994. 

 In the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriation
Acts for fiscal year 1994 (Pub. L. 103-124, approved October 28, 1993), Congress appropriated a combined total
of $109,190,000 for the following programs: The HOPE for Public and Indian Housing Homeownership program (HOPE 1),
the HOPE for Homeownership of Multifamily Units program (HOPE 2), the HOPE for Homeownership of Single Family Homes
program (HOPE 3), and the HOPE for Youthbuild Program. In the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1994 (Pub.
L. 103-211, approved February 12, 1994), $66,000,000 was rescinded from the $109,190,000 appropriated for
fiscal year 1994, leaving $43,190,000. Of the $43,190,000 remaining subsequent to the rescission, the Department
is allocating $15,190,000 to the HOPE 1 program. The entire HOPE 1 allocation of $15,190,000 will be utilized to fund
the portion of the grant awarded to the New Community Corporation not funded using amounts available under the Fiscal
Year 1992-93 appropriations.

NOFA for Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction in Priority Housing: Category I and Category II Grants: Amendment



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Secretary_Office of Lead-Based Paint Abatement and Poisoning Prevention, HUD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of amendment of NOFA and application submission deadline.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces a deadline of June 30, 1994, for applications for Category II, Stage One Lead-Based Paint Hazard
Reduction grants in the NOFA document that was published in the 

Federal Register 

on June 4, 1993 (58 FR 31848).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On June 4, 1993, the Department published a Notice of Funding Availability for this program (58 FR 31848). A notice
correcting a date applicable to Category II grants was published on June 14, 1993 (58 FR 32958). This notice is for the
purpose of establishing a deadline of June 30, 1994, for the receipt of applications for Category II, Stage One, Lead-Based
Paint Hazard Reduction grants.



The Department has established this deadline for all Category II applicants because it has determined that the Category
II Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Grant Program is superseded by the Environmental Protection Agency Grant Program
authorized by the Residential Lead-Based Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (title X, Pub. L. 102-550; approved October
28, 1992) (title X). Section 1021 of title X amends the Toxic Substances Control Act, 15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq. (TSCA),
by adding a new title IV, Lead Exposure Reduction. Title X gives the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the primary
responsibility for establishing State training, certification or accreditation programs.

Section 1011(g) of title X authorizes the Secretary to make grants of up to $200,000 to establish State training, certification,
or accreditation programs that meet the requirements of section 402 of the TSCA. Under section 402, the EPA is to promulgate
final regulations by April 28, 1994, governing lead-based paint activities, ``to ensure that individuals engaged
in such activities are properly trained; that training programs are accredited; and that contractors engaged in
such activities are certified.'' Section 402 also supersedes the provisions set forth under the headings ``Lead
Abatement Training and Certification'' and ``Training Grants'' in title III of the Departments of Veterans Affairs
and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1992 (Pub. L. 102-139). Under
section 404(g) of the TSCA, the Administrator of the EPA is authorized to make grants to States to develop and carry
out authorized State programs.

The new deadline will apply to all potential applicants. In addition to this notice in the 

Federal Register, 

the Department is sending direct notification of the deadline change to all parties that have requested an application.



Correction of Publication



Accordingly, FR Doc 93-13101, NOFA for Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction in Priority Housing: Category I and
Category II Grants, published in the 

Federal Register 

on June 4, 1993 (58 FR 31848), is amended by revising the Category II, State One deadline dates, as follows:

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice is to advise that the following public lands in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, have been examined and found
suitable for classification for conveyance to the Lindrith Baptist Church under the provisions of the Recreation

T. 25 N., R. 3 W.,


Sec. 22, NE1/4NW1/4NW1/4.



The area described contains 20 acres.



The lands would not be leased prior to being patented to the Lindrith Baptist Church. A patent under the Recreation
and Public Purpose Act is consistent with current BLM land use planning and would be in the public interest. The lands
are not needed for Federal purposes.
The patent, when issued, will be subject to the following terms, conditions and reservations:
1. Provisions of the Recreation and Public Purposes Act and to all applicable regulations of the Secretary of the Interior.
2. A right-of-way for ditches and canals constructed by the authority of the United States Act of August 30, 1890, 26
Stat. 391, 43 U.S.C. 945.
3. All minerals shall be reserved to the United States, together with the right to prospect for, mine, and remove the
minerals.
4. Those rights for a pipeline granted to El Paso Natural Gas Company by right-of-way NMNM 021486.
5. Any other reservation that the authorized officer determines appropriate to ensure public access and proper management
of Federal lands and interest therein.
Detailed information concerning this action is available for review at the office of the Bureau of Land Management,
Rio Puerco Resource Area, 435 Montano NE., Albuquerque, New Mexico.
Upon publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register,

 the lands will be segregated from all forms of appropriation under the public laws, including the general mining laws,
except for conveyance under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act and leasing under the mineral leasing laws. For
a period of 45 days from the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register,

 interested persons may submit comments regarding the proposed conveyance or classification of lands to the District
Manager, Bureau of Land Management, 435 Montano NE, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87107.




CLASSIFICATION COMMENTS: 

Interested parties may submit comments involving the suitability of the land for a cemetery. Comments on the classification
are restricted to whether the land is physically suited for the proposal, whether the use will maximize the future
use or uses of the land, whether the use is consistent with local planning and zoning, or if the use is consistent with
State and Federal programs.




APPLICATION COMMENTS: 

Interested parties may submit comments regarding the specific use proposed in the application and plan of development,
whether the BLM followed proper administrative procedures in reaching the decision, or any other factor not directly
related to the suitability of the land for cemetaries.


Any adverse comments will be revised by the State Director. In the absence of any adverse comments, the classification
will become effective 60 days from the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register.

ACTION:

 Closure of a portion of a Commission hearing to the public. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Upon the request of two respondents and petitioners in the above-captioned final investigations, the Commission
has unanimously determined to conduct a portion of its hearing scheduled for April 12, 1994, 

in camera. See

 Commission rules 201.13 and 201.35(b)(3) (19 CFR 201.13 and 201.35(b)(3)). The remainder of the hearing will be open
to the public.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Commission believes that unusual circumstances are present in these investigations so as to make it appropriate
to hold a portion of the hearing 

in camera.

 This decision is made in light of the desirability of affording a full discussion at the hearing of business proprietary
information (BPI) concerning (1) the condition of the domestic industry or industries; (2) confidential pricing,
capacity, and capacity utilization data; and (3) confidential data regarding profitability, cost of goods sold,
and sales, general and administrative expenses relating to a small number of domestic producers. In making this decision,
the Commission nevertheless reaffirms its belief that whenever possible, its business should be conducted in public.

 




Authority:

 The General Counsel has certified, pursuant to Commission Rule 201.39 (19 CFR 201.39) that, in her opinion, a portion
of the Commission's hearing in the above-captioned investigation be closed to the public to prevent the disclosure
of business proprietary information.

 


By order of the Commission.

Controlled Substances: Notice of Proposed 1994 Aggregate Production Quotas



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Drug Enforcement Administration, Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed revised aggregate production quotas for 1994.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice proposes revised 1994 aggregate production quotas for controlled substances in Schedules I and II, as
required under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) (21 U.S.C. 826) requires that the Attorney General establish aggregate
production quotas for all controlled substances listed in Schedules I and II. This responsibility has been delegated
to the Administrator of the DEA by  0.100 of title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations.




On October 8, 1993, a notice of the 1994 established aggregate production quotas was published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 52508). The notice stipulated that the Administrator of the DEA would adjust the quotas in early 1994 as provided
for in title 21, Code of Federal Regulations,  1303.23(c). These aggregate production quotas represent those
amounts of controlled substances that may be produced in the United States in 1994 and do not include amounts which
may be imported for use in industrial processes.


The proposed revisions are based on a review of 1993 year-end inventories, 1993 disposition data submitted by quota
applicants, estimates of the medical needs of the United States submitted to the DEA by the Food and Drug Administration
and other information available to the DEA.


Therefore, under the authority vested in the Attorney General by section 306 of the CSA of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 826) and delegated
to the Administrator by section 0.100 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations, the Administrator of the DEA hereby
proposes the following changes in the 1994 aggregate production quotas for the listed controlled substances, expressed
in grams of anhydrous acid or base.

All interested persons are invited to submit their comments and objections in writing regarding this proposal. A
person may object to or comment on the proposal relating to any of the above mentioned substances without filing comments
or objections regarding the others. If a person believes that one or more of these issues warrant a hearing, the individual
should so state and summarize the reasons for this belief.

In the event that comments or objections to this proposal raise one or more issues which the Administrator finds warrant
a hearing, the Administrator shall order a public hearing by notice in the 

Federal Register

, summarizing the issues to be heard and setting the time for the hearing.

The Office of Management and Budget has determined that notice of aggregate production quotas are not subject to centralized
review under Executive Order 12866.

Rules establishing aggregate production quotas for controlled substances in Schedules I and II are required by statute,
fulfill United States obligations under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, and other international
treaties, and are essential to a criminal law enforcement function of the United States. Without the periodic establishment
and adjustment of aggregate production quotas, pharmaceutical manufacturers in the United States could not lawfully
produce a wide variety of medically necessary pharmaceutical drugs.

These actions have been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612
and it has been determined that this matter raises no Federalism implications which would warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

The Administrator hereby certifies that this action will have no significant impact upon small entities whose interests
must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. The establishment and revision of annual
production quotas for Schedules I and II controlled substances is mandated by law and by the international obligations
of the United States. Such quotas impact predominantly upon major manufacturers of the affected controlled substances.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of funds and solicitation for grant application (SGA).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration, under Title IV of the Job Training Partnership
Act, is seeking grant applications to test better ways of providing effective employment and training services to
out-of-school youth who are economically disadvantaged. This grant solicitation consists of two separate competitions_(1)
single site grants in which new untested ideas for a youth program will be implemented at one site, or an existing youth
program will be pilot-tested in a different site; and (2) multi-site grants in which an existing small-scale youth
program will be pilot-tested in five or more additional sites. The Department may award an evaluation contract to
an outside contractor to evaluate grantees' performance which will require grantees' cooperation.



Applications may be submitted for both the single site and multi-site grants. All information required to 

submit

 a proposal is contained in this announcement.

The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) of the Department of Labor (DOL) announces the availability of
funds to conduct innovative pilot projects aimed at out-of-school youth.

This announcement consists of three parts: Part I_Background, Part II_Application Process and Part III_Reporting
Requirements.



Part I_Background



It is the Department of Labor's experience that few out-of-school youth programs supported by the Job Training Partnership
Act (JTPA) have been effective. JTPA programs in general appear to have no positive impact on the earnings, employment,
criminal involvement, or welfare dependency of male and female out-of-school youth.

Current JTPA Title II-C programs spend an average of $2,800 per youth and last perhaps four or five months. It
may well be that this is too small and too short term of an investment to expect to turn around the lives of economically
and educationally disadvantaged youth. We also believe that new and different approaches to serving the needs of
youth should be tested.

The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) believes that more comprehensive and innovative second-change
approaches need to be designed and tested that focus on the needs of youth, particularly, out-of-school youth, on
a variety of fronts. This solicitation is a pilot effort by the Department and ETA to move in that direction. In both
the single site and multi-site grants, the Department is particularly looking for models that are more comprehensive
and intensive than are typically now provided by JTPA Title II-C.

Ideally, the development of new approaches to serving youth occurs in several stages_

(1) An idea or model is developed;

(2) The idea is put into practice at one site, and then perhaps at a second site with some modifications;

(3) The model program is then pilot-tested a several sites;

(4) The model program then enters a demonstration stage in which it is formally evaluated using random assignment
of program applicants to treatment and non-treatment group at several sites; and

(5) If the random-assignment evaluation results come out positive, the model program is replicated widely across
the country. This grant announcement covers stages (2) and (3) of this process_the pilot-testing of a new approach
at a first or second site or at multiple sites.



Part II_Application Process



A. Eligible Applicants



All private for-profit, non-profit organizations, educational institutions, and state and local governments
can apply for both the single site and multi-site grants. However, any award made as a result of this solicitation will
be non-fee bearing.



B. Funding



Funding for this solicitation is authorized under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) title IV-D pilot
and demonstration funds. The Department has set aside $1 million for a number of single site pilot project grants,
and $1 million for one multi-site pilot project grant.



C. Application Procedures



All Information Required To Submit A Proposal is Contained in This Announcement.



1. Submission of Proposals



An original and three (3) copies of the proposal shall be submitted. Applicants should clearly label their proposals
to indicate whether they are applying for a single site or multi-site grant. The proposal shall consist of a of two (2)
separate and distinct parts: Part I shall contain the cost proposal which includes the following items: Standard
Form (SF) 424, ``Application for Federal Assistance:'' (See Appendix A) and SF 424A, ``Budget'' (See Appendix B).
Also, the budget shall include on a separate page(s) a detailed cost analysis of each line item in the budget.

Part II shall contain a technical proposal that demonstrates the offeror's capabilities in accordance with the Statement
of Work of this solicitation. No cost data or reference to price shall be included in the technical proposal. In order
to assist offerors in the preparation of their proposals and to facilitate the expeditious evaluation by the panel,
proposals should be organized and presented in the same sequential order as the Evaluation Criteria in part II(F)
of this solicitation.



2. Hand Delivered Proposals



Proposals must be mailed at least five days prior to the closing date. However, if proposals are hand delivered, they
must be received at the designated place by 2 p.m., Eastern time by May 16, 1994. All overnight mail will be considered
to be hand delivered and must be received at the designated place by the specified closing date. Telegraphed and/or
faxed proposals will not be accepted. Failure to adhere to the above instructions will be a basis for a determination
of non-responsiveness.

3. Late Proposals



Any proposals received at the office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt will
not be considered unless it is received before award is made and it_

(1) Was sent by U.S. Postal Service registered or certified mail not later than the fifth calendar day before the date
specified for receipt of application (e.g. an offer submitted in response to a solicitation requiring receipt of
applications by the 20th of the month must have been mailed by the 15th);

(2) Was sent by U. S. Postal Service Express Mail Next Day Service_Post Office to Addressee, not later than 5 p.m. at
the place of mailing two working days prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals. The term ``working days''
excludes weekends and U. S. Federal holidays.

The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a late proposal sent either by U.S. Postal Service
registered or certified mail is the U.S. postmark both on the envelop or wrapper and on the original receipt from the
U.S. Postal Service. Both postmarks must show a legible date or the proposal, shall be processed as if mailed late.
``Postmark'' means a printed, stamped, or otherwise placed impression (exclusive of a postage meter machine impression)
that is readily identifiable without further action as having been supplied and affixed by employees of the U.S. Postal
Service on the date of mailing. Therefore, applicants should request the postal clerk to place a legible hand cancellation
bull's eye postmark on both receipt and the envelope or wrapper.

The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a late proposal sent by ``Express Mail Next Day Service_Post
Office to Addressee'' is the date entered by the post office receiving clerk on the ``Express Mail Next day Service_Post
Office to Addressee'' label and the postmark on both the envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt from the U.S.
Postal Service. ``Postmark'' has the same meaning as defined above. Therefore, applicants should request the postal
clerk to place a legible hand cancellation bull's eye postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper.

Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice or telegram (including mailgram) received at any time before award.
Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative. If the representative's identity
is made known and the representative signs a receipt for the proposal before award.



4. Period of Performance



The period of performance under this grant will be 12 months from the date of grant execution.



5. Option To Extend



Based on the availability of funds, effective program operation and the needs of the Department, the grants may be
funded for up to two additional years.

D. Matching Requirements



The Department of Labor funding under these awards shall equal 80 percent of the total grant cost. The awardee shall
provide not more than 10 percent from other federal sources and the remainder from non-federal sources. The matching
funds can be in cash or in-kind.



E. Statement of Work



Proposed projects for single site pilot projects can be either an existing project or a new innovative idea for serving
out-of school youth. Projects proposed for a multisite pilot should already exist. Grants funded under this competition
must include an evaluation component that tracks the implementation and operation of the pilot sites and the outcomes
of participants. If the pilot sites appear to be successful, the Department at some later point may wish to formally
evaluate these models through the random assignment of program applicants to treatment and non-treatment groups.



1. Single Site Grant Competition



Under this part, the Department will provide a number of small grants to pilot-test new approaches to serving out-of-school
youth in an initial site or a second site. These models will not be formally evaluated at this stage. This generally
should be seen as an initial pilot project stage, which may eventually lead to pilot-testing in multiple sites and
later to formal demonstration and evaluation. Applicants for these grants should explain in their proposals why
the idea they plan to implement has the potential for serving out-of-school youth effectively.

If it is a new idea to be tried for the first time, justification as to why the model should be successful in meeting the
needs of youth should be provided in the proposal. If it is an existing program to be pilot-tested in a second site, documentation
should be provided regarding the characteristics of enrollees in the existing program, services provided, and outcomes.
The proposal should also demonstrate an understanding of what else has been tried in serving out-of-school youth,
and how the suggested model differs from other approaches.

The application should include an evaluation component to document the implementation and operation of the pilot
project. The evaluation should not include random assignment of program applicants, but should document the characteristics
of youth served, services provided, how the services were provided and outcomes of participants.



2. Multi-Site Grant Competition



Under this part, the Department wants to pilot test a structured model that holds promise for serving out-of-school
youth. Applicants under this part should make a strong case that the model they are proposing holds promise for serving
out-of-school youth effectively. The model being proposed should already be in operation in at least one site.

Evidence should be provided in the proposal that the model is being successfully implemented at the existing site.
The proposal should also demonstrate an understanding of what else has been tried in serving out-of-school youth,
and how the suggested model differs from other approaches. Documentation should be provided as to number of youth
served, types of services provided, and outcomes.

The multi-site pilot project that will be funded here should be seen as a preliminary stage to formal demonstration
and evaluation. The model can be implemented in approximately five pilot sites across the country, within a State
or local districts within a large metropolitan area. The sites do not need to be identified at the time the application
is made.

Applications under this part should include an evaluation component that tracks the implementation and operation
of the program model in the pilot sites. The evaluation should not include random assignment of program applicants,
but should document the characteristics of youth served, services provided, and outcomes of participants.



3. Program Model for Both Single and Multi-Site Grants



If the applicant proposes to pilot-test a new idea that has never been tried before, the proposal should discuss why
the proposed model holds promise for serving out-of-school youth effectively. The proposal should delineate the
key elements of the model to be implemented, and provide detailed plans as to the site in which it will be operated, the
organization that will run the program, the population of youth who will be the focus of the program, what services
will be provided, and what other agencies will coordinate with the project.

If the applicant is proposing to pilot-test an existing program in an additional site or in multiple sites, the proposal
should discuss what the program does, who it serves, how it provides the service, what and who are involved, and the
outcomes. It should discuss the dynamics of replicating the program in another community and the projected differences
between the initial and new communities.

It should also discuss the flexibility of the program and how it will be adapted to address the needs in the community
where replication will occur. The proposal should discuss the planning, staff development, and implementation.
The applicant should discuss preliminary communication with sites in which the pilot testing may occur, but no formal
selection needs to be made by the time of application.

The proposal should demonstrate an understanding of the needs of youth. If a national organization is applying for
a multi-site pilot project, the applicant should demonstrate intimate understanding of how the proposed model operates
and what the key elements are that need to be replicated in the pilot sites. 

Applicants should discuss how their model addresses the multiple problems of youth, such as involvement in crime,
drugs, and alcohol; poor educational backgrounds; teenage pregnancy; lack of access to college; and lack of employment
opportunities. Note that one mode is not necessarily expected to address all of these needs. 



4. Target Population for Both Single and Multi-Site Grants 



Economically disadvantaged, out-of-school youth ages 14-21 are the focus for the single site and multi-site
grants. Out-of-school youth can include both high school dropouts and high school graduates. 



5. Project Design for Both Single and Multi-Site Grants 



The projects can focus on any number of solutions to problems facing out-of-school, economically disadvantaged
youth. This solicitation is seeking both new ideas and ideas that have already been developed with a history of success.


The ideas must have measurable outcomes and services must be provided in an organized and high-quality manner. The
services can be provide through the school system, through a recreation center in the community, or through a community
center. It must, however, be able to attract the youth to be served and it must be easily assessable. Applicants are
asked to: 

a. Describe the program and its measurable goals/outcomes and strategy, including services to be provided to accomplish
the goals; 

b. Identify the key elements of the model that distinguish it and that would need to be part of any replication effort.

Applicants are advised that discussions may be necessary in order to clarify any inconsistencies in their application.
The panel results are advisory in nature to help establish a competitive range. The Grant Officer will make final awards
based on what is in the best interests of the Government.






1. Quality of Program Model To Be Pilot-Tested






Proposals will be evaluated based on the applicant's justification that the proposed model can have a long-term difference
in the lives of out-of-school youth. The model should be intensive and comprehensive enough to turn around the lives
of youth. If the model is already in existence, discuss its effectiveness in serving youth. (30 points).





2. Quality of Implementation Plan for Pilot-Testing the Model





The plan should be structured for pilot-testing the program model. For single site pilot-tests under part II(E),
the proposed site should be identified, and plans in place to implement the program. Matching funds should be committed,
and the program operator identified. Coordination with other agencies should also be identified.




For multi-site pilots under Part II(E), the pilot sites do not need to be identified, but a structured plan needs to
be presented as to how sites will be selected, and what coordination with other agencies will be sought. Coordination
with other agencies should also be identified. (30 points).




3. Experience of Grant Applicant






Applicants should describe the experience both of the organization and of the staff that will be involved in the pilot
program in dealing with out-of-school youth. An applicant should describe the success rate of the organization with
such programs. (20 points).









4. Evaluation Approach and Planned Outcomes






The pilot project is intended to result in a measurable increase in outcomes for out-of-school, economically disadvantaged
youth in the grantee's area. The discussion must include a clear description of the project performance goals and
accomplishments and what outcome measures and planned evaluation approach will be used to assess how well the program
has met its objectives. (15 points).







5. Need for Project in Pilot Sites





An applicant should describe the level of need for this project in the proposed pilot sites. It should discuss the population,
such as age, gender, educational level, the project will serve. It should describe the economic and social dynamics,
such as poverty, crime, school-drop-out, and teenage pregnancy rates, of the geographic area to be served. (5 points).

<DOCTITLE>Job Training Partnership Act: Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker Programs; Proposed Planning Estimates</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Employment and Training Administration, Labor.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed State planning estimates and allocation formula; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Employment and Training Administration is publishing the proposed State planning estimates for Program Year
(PY) 1994 (July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995) for Job Training Partnership Act section 402 migrant and seasonal farmworker
programs, the allocation formula, and the rationale used in arriving at the planning estimates.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

As required by section 162 of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), the Employment and Training Administration
publishes for comment the proposed State planning estimates for JTPA, section 402 migrant and seasonal farmworker
programs in PY 1994. JTPA section 402 grantees were selected for a two-year designation period on July 1, 1993. Program
Year 1994 is the second year of that designation period. Grantees which have performed satisfactorily during the
first year of the designation period will be awarded grants in the second year after submittal of acceptable grant
plans but without further competition.


Allocations




The allocations set forth in the appendix to this notice reflect the allocation formula described below. For PY 1994,
$85,576,000 were appropriated for migrant and seasonal farmworker programs.

<DOCNO> FR940413-2-00109 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940413-2-00058 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

This amount is an increase of $7,273,000 above the appropriation for PY 1993. Each year since 1987, additional funds
have been included to meet the demand for training and employment services to Special Agricultural Workers (SAWs)
who became eligible for the program as a result of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. In addition, the reports
of the House of Representatives and the Senate Committees on Appropriations on the Department of Labor's 1994 appropriations
state that the committees expect the Department to continue the farmworker housing program. The Department concurs
with this request.


The allocation formula is being applied to $81,148,000. The remaining $4,428,000 of the PY 1994 section 402 appropriation
is being held in the section 402 national account to fund the housing program ($3,000,000), the Hope, Arkansas, Migrant
Rest Center ($300,000), and other training and technical assistance projects.



Allocation Formula




The $81,148,000 formula total was allocated according to the following formula:


(1) $74,752,033 was allocated on a State-by-State basis. This is the same amount as was allocated for each State for
PY 1993. This ensures programmatic stability by providing a funding base for each State at its PY 1993 level.


(2) $6,395,967 was allocated on a State-by-State basis. Thirty percent of this portion of the appropriation was based
on the relative numbers of migrant and seasonal farmworkers in each State, as shown by 1980 Census data; and 70 percent
was based on the relative numbers of SAWs in each State, as shown by the most recent Immigration and Naturalization
Service data. This provides an equitable distribution of the additional funds available for PY 1994 for programmatic
needs generated by the SAW program.



Formula Allocations in Out Years




For Program Year 1995 and beyond, the Department intends to update the allocation formula to incorporate more current
data on the farmworker population. To this end, in April 1994, a special task force was convened to explore options
for revising the formula and its bases. Findings from this task force will be reflected in future notices of planning
estimates.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), Employment and Training Administration (ETA) is soliciting proposals on a competitive
basis for grants for projects to implement and enhance community-based microenterprise activities. For purposes
of this solicitation, the term ``microenterprise'' means a commercial enterprise with five (5) or fewer employees,
one (1) or more of whom owns the enterprise, and each of the owners of the enterprise is economically disadvantaged,
as defined in section 4(8) of JTPA. 



The intent of these grants is to provide effective business-related training and provide technical assistance and
support to owners or potential owners of microenterprises. The grants are being awarded pursuant to section 499 of
the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA). 

This announcement consists of five parts: Part I_Background, Part II_Application Process, Part III_Statement
of Work, Part IV_Evaluation Criteria, and Part V_Reporting Requirements. 



Part I_Background



Pursuant to section 499 of JTPA, the Secretary of Labor awards grants to States to implement and enhance community-based
microenterprise activities. Section 499 of JTPA also states that such activities shall be for the benefit of economically
disadvantaged persons. 

Accordingly, ETA intends to allocate approximately $1.5 million to States to implement and enhance community-based
microenterprise activities. The statute specifies that such funds shall be used (nothwithstanding the restrictions
of section 141(q) of JTPA) to:




(1) Train program staff in such entrepreneurial activities as business plan development, business management,
resource inventory design, and marketing approaches, and other activities necessary to provide effective training
to persons developing a microenterprise;

(2) Provide to owners or potential owners of a microenterprise such technical assistance (including technical assistance
with respect to business planning, securing funding, marketing, and production of marketing materials) and other
assistance as may be necessary to develop microenterprise activities; and

(3) Provide other microenterprise support (such as peer support program and counseling).

<TEXT>
 

A State may specify a political subdivision (county, city, town, township, parish village, etc.) or economic division
such as a Service Delivery Area, an Enterprise Community or an Empowerment Zone as the focus of training activity in
its proposal.


B. Submission of Proposals


An original and three (3) copies of the proposal shall be submitted. The proposal shall consist of two (2) separate
and distinct parts.
Part I shall contain the cost proposal, consisting of the following items: Standard Form (SF) 424, ``Application
for Federal Assistance'' (Appendix No. 1) and SF 424A, ``Budget'' (Appendix No. 2). Also, the budget shall include
on a separate page(s) a detailed enumeration of how the matching requirement will be fulfilled. The individual signing
the SF 424 on behalf of the State shall represent the responsible financial and administrative entity for the grant
should that proposal result in an award.
Part II shall contain a technical proposal that demonstrates the applicant's capabilities in accordance with the
Statement of Work contained in this announcement. Applicants are strongly encouraged to submit a technical proposal
of less than thirty (30) pages in length (exclusive of appendices) which sets forth the applicant's explanation of
how it proposes to accomplish the elements described in the Statement of Work.

they shall be received at the designated place by 2 p.m., Eastern Time by June 13, 1994. All overnight mail will be considered
to be hand-delivered and must be received at the designated place by the specified closing date. Telegraphed and/or
faxed proposals will not be honored. Failure to adhere to the above instructions will be a basis for a determination
of nonresponsiveness.

<TEXT>
 

D. Late Proposals




Any proposal received at the office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt will
not be considered unless it is received before award is made and it_





(1) Was sent by U.S. Postal Service registered or certified mail not later than the fifth calendar day before the date
specified for receipt of application (e.g., an offer submitted in response to a solicitation requiring receipt of
applications by the 20th of the month must have been mailed by the 15th); or


(2) Was sent by U.S. Postal Service Express Mail Next Day Service_Post Office to Addressee, not later than 5 p.m. at
the place of mailing two working days prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals. The term ``working days''
excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.





The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a late proposal sent either by U.S. Postal Service
registered or certified mail is the U.S. postmark both on the envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt from the
U.S. Postal Service. Both postmarks must show a legible date or the proposal shall be processed as if mailed late. ``Postmark''
means a printed, stamped, or otherwise placed impression (exclusive of a postage meter machine impression) that
is readily identifiable without further action as having been supplied and affixed by employees of the U.S. Postal
Service on the date of mailing. Therefore, applicants should request the postal clerk to place a legible hand cancellation
``bull's eye'' postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper.


The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a late proposal sent by ``Express Mail Next Day Service_Post
Office to Addressee'' is the date entered by the post office receiving clerk on the ``Express Mail Next Day Service_Post
Office to Addressee'' label and the postmark on both the envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt from the U.S.
Postal Service. ``Postmark'' has the same meaning as defined above. Therefore, applicants should request the postal
clerk to place a legible hand cancellation ``bull's eye'' postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper.



E. Withdrawal of Proposals




Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice or telegram (including mailgram) received at any time before award.
Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an applicant or an authorized representative thereof, if the representative's
identity is made known and the representative signs a receipt for the proposal before award.

F. Period of Performance


The period of performance will be fifteen (15) months from the date of execution.



G. Funding


DOL has set aside up to $1.5 million to be disbursed, contingent upon resources being available for this purpose. It
is anticipated that grant awards will be in the $250,000 to $300,000 range.



H. Option to Extend


Based on the availability of funds, effective program operation, and the needs of the Department, the grant(s) may
be extended for up to one (1) additional year.



I. Matching Requirement


In order to receive a grant award, an applicant must include matching non-Federal contributions in an amount equal
to 100 percent of Federal funds to be provided.



Part III_Statement of Work



The primary goal of this initiative is to assist economically disadvantaged individuals in establishing and maintaining
microenterprises. Proposals must contain a clear statement of the need for such a project, together with the identification
of the proposed service delivery strategy to accomplish the primary goal and to meet this stated need. They should
also enumerate sources of start-up capital for new microenterprises, such as community-based credit providers.

Proposals should detail new methods and techniques for the States to focus on the entrepreneurial training needs
of disadvantaged individuals. The Department is aware that most States already possess some organizational capacity
and staffing to assist generally in the formation and development of small business activity, most notably through
the Small Business Development Centers described in the next segment.

An applicant should not attempt simply to add to this existing State assistance. Rather, and applicant must demonstrate
in its proposal how the proposed training is necessary in assisting economically disadvantaged individuals to establish
and maintain microenterprises.



A. Activities



The proposal should present a clear discussion of what activities related to microenterprise and economic development
are already functioning within the State and how this new initiative will link those activities and add a new dimension
to them. Examples of such activities include:




(1) Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities as authorized by Title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993. Their mission is to provide favorable Federal income tax treatment and other incentives to encourage
the conduct of trades or businesses and general economic development within designated areas.

(2) Small Business Development Centers (SBDC) as authorized by the Small Business Act of 1953 as amended. Their stated
mission is to provide management assistance to prospective and small business owners through one-on-one counselling
and specialized training efforts.

(3) Economic Development Districts (EDD) as authorized by the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965,
as amended. EDDs serve as the structural entities for formulating and implementing economic development plans and
activities within boundaries.




These examples represent some of the types of existing activities and resources that may be considered in developing
a proposal under this solicitation.

<TEXT>
 

B. Resources 



Applicants are strongly encouraged to be exhaustive in examining available related resources and ongoing activities
in order to maximize the potential impact of a microenterprise. The resources that the State will provide to meet the
100 percent matching requirement should be discussed in some detail providing a clear understanding of what is to
be provided and what the relevance/linkage of these resources is to the activities proposed and to successfully meeting
the primary goal of the project. 



C. Services and Techniques 



Applicants shall specify the services and techniques they propose to provide to meet the goal of aiding economically
disadvantaged individuals with microenterprises. Examples of key services and techniques that may be included
in a proposal are:




(1) Recruitment and screening. This is an important element both in identifying program staff to be trained as trainers
and in identifying and selecting individuals who show potential for owning an microenterprise.

(2) Case management. This would involve assigning an individual who provides guidance in all aspects of program participation
and other services to microenterprise owners. 

(3) Follow-up. Enrollment in and successful completion of a microenterprise training program may well be only the
initial challenges facing the entrepreneur. A structured follow-up program involving such counseling and supportive
services as deemed appropriate is a critical aspect of the program. 


(4) Mentoring. This could involve assigning a volunteer businessperson from the community to serve in a one-on-one
relationship with the new entrepreneur. Such volunteer service may not be considered for meeting the 100 percent
matching requirement. 



Part IV_Evaluation Criteria 



Prospective applicants are advised that the selection of grantees for award is to be made after careful evaluation
of proposals by a panel of specialists within DOL. The panelists will evaluate the proposals in accordance with the
elements set forth in the Statement of Work. The panel results are advisory in nature and not binding on the Grant Officer.




A. Ability to Conduct and Monitor the Microenterprise Activities (45 Points)



(1) The proposal must describe in specific terms the service delivery strategy that the applicant would utilize to
implement its ideas. The applicant must clearly state, particularly when discussing staff training for implementation
of proposed microenterprise activities, how this activity will create a new capacity for the State to conduct such
training. The proposal must provide assurances that resources under this grant will not be used to substitute for
an ongoing commitment to maintain an economic development capacity. (30 points) 

(2) The application must also contain a clear statement of the need for such a project, including the degree to which
the service delivery strategy will assist in meeting that need. (15 points)




This overall discussion will be the measure for determining the ability to conduct and monitor such activities.

B. Evidence of State Commitment, As Shown Through Existing or Proposed Related Programs and Support (25 Points)


This section must include a detailed discussion of the coordination and linkages between programs and community
organizations, as well as a discussion of the organizational capacity which the State intends to devote to this project.
The emphasis under this criterion will be on programmatic resources which might enhance the training aspects of a
project. As noted earlier, it is recognized that most applicants have some form of economic development capacity
already in place.



C. Evidence of Linkage(s) to Private, Community-Based Credit and Technical Assistance Providers (10 Points)


Discussion of what financial resources are available to provide new microenterprises with start-up capital, such
as a consortium of banks which have pledged to assist in this process.



D. Size of Non-Federal Matching Fund Contributions (10 Points)


In order to receive a grant award, an applicant, at a minimum, must include matching non-Federal contributions in
an amount equal to 100 percent of Federal funds to be provided. Applicants who propose to provide the minimum amount
for matching non-Federal contributions will receive five (5) points under this criteria. If the non-Federal contributions
are greater than 100 percent of the Federal funds to be provided, applicants may receive up to an additional five (5)
points under this criteria.

The cost proposal must contain a detailed discussion of the size, nature, and quality of the non-Federal match. Proposals
not presenting a detailed discussion of the non-Federal match or not meeting the statutory requirement of a 100-percent
match will be considered nonresponsive.



E. Cost (10 points)


The cost effectiveness of the project as indicated by cost per participant and cost per activity in relation to services
provided and outcomes anticipated.

Offerors are advised that discussions may be necessary in order to clarify any inconsistencies in their applications.
The panel's evaluations are only advisory to the Grant Officer. The final decisions for grant award will be made by
the ETA Grant Officer, after considering the panelists' scoring decisions. The Grant Officer's decisions will be
based on what he or she determines is most advantageous to the Federal Government.



Part V_Reporting Requirements


The Grantee is required to provide reports and documents listed below:



A. Quarterly Financial Reports


The grantee shall submit to the Grant Officer's Technical Representative (GOTR), within 30 days following the end
of each quarter, three (3) copies of a quarterly Financial Status Report (SF 269), until such time as all funds have
been expended or the period of availability has expired.



B. Quarterly Progress Reports


The grantee shall submit to the GOTR within 30 days following the end of each quarter, three (3) copies of a quarterly
progress report which provides a detailed account of services provided during each quarter of grant performance.
Reports shall include the following in brief narrative form:




(1) A description of overall progress of work activities accomplished during the reported period.

(2) An indication of current problems, if any, which may delay performance and any proposed corrective action.

at a minimum a description of:




(1) The programs that have been established and developed with such funds, including a description of the persons
participating and the microenterprise developed;

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), Employment and Training Administration (ETA), under Title IV, part D, of the Job
Training Partnership Act (JTPA) is soliciting proposals for the development of model training materials to assist
high school students who may not attend college to learn about the carpentry trade and how to perform in it and, in so
doing, to facilitate their entry into the work force.



Funding for this solicitation will come from Title IV, part D of JTPA. DOL has set aside up to $300,000 for this competitive
procurement. As a result of this solicitation, one (1) award will be made for a period of fifteen (15) months with the
possibility of two (2) option years.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This announcement consists of five parts: Part I_Background, Part II_Application Process, Part III_Statement
of Work, Part IV_Evaluation Criteria, and Part V_Reporting Requirements.



Part I_Background







Seventy-five percent of America's young people do not achieve a college degree. Many of these young people are not
equipped with the basic academic and occupational skills needed in an increasingly complex labor market. It is well
established that the low-skill, high-paying manufacturing jobs that once provided decent employment for relatively
unskilled Americans no longer exist.




Therefore, many high school graduates do not find stable, career-track jobs for five to ten years after graduation.
In today's highly competitive global economy, business performance is determined in large part by the knowledge
and skills of workers. The technological pressures make employers reluctant to take a chance on inexperienced high
school graduates whose diplomas signal nothing about their skills, knowledge, and ability to perform increasingly
difficult work.




The lack of effective tools to aid high school students gain the necessary skills to enable them in making the transition
from school to work successfully has also had a significant economic impact on those students. In the 1980s, the gap
in earnings between high school graduates and college graduates doubled; for those without high school diplomas,
the gap grew even wider.



Congress took cognizance of this lack of a comprehensive and effective school-to-work transition system in report
language accompanying the Department of Labor's Fiscal Year 1993 appropriation legislation in referring to programs
that would benefit high school students who may not attend college. Such programs would ideally offer junior and senior
year high school students the opportunity to begin learning a trade while still in school and, upon their graduation,
they would have the opportunity to be placed in a full-time registered apprenticeship program.







In addition, school-to-work programs assist students in making the transition from school to a good first job on a
high skill, high wage career track. Combining learning at the worksite with learning in school, school-to-work programs
establish a partnership between schools and employers and prepare students for either a high quality job requiring
technical skills or further education and training.





Part II_Application Process





A. Eligible Applicants






The award under this competition will be made to a non-profit organization.





B. Submission of Proposal







An original and three (3) copies of the proposal shall be submitted. The proposal shall consist of two (2) separate
and distinct parts:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940413-2-00120 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940413-2-00060 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Part I shall contain the cost proposal, consisting of the following items: Standard Form (SF) 424, ``Application
for Federal Assistance,'' and SF 424A, ``Budget'' (Appendix A). Also, the budget shall include on a separate page(s)
a detailed cost analysis of each line item in the budget.

Part II shall include a technical proposal that demonstrates the offeror's capabilities in accordance with its Statement
of Work contained in this announcement. Applicants are strongly encouraged to submit a technical proposal of less
than thirty (30) pages in length (exclusive of appendices) which sets forth the applicant's explanation of how it
proposes to accomplish the elements described in the Statement of Work.

No cost data or reference to price shall be included in the technical proposal. In order to assist applicants in the
preparation of their proposals and to facilitate the expeditious evaluation by the review panel, proposals should
be organized and presented in the same sequential order as the Evaluation Criteria in Part IV of this announcement.



C. Hand-Delivered Proposals



Proposals must be mailed at least five (5) days prior to the closing date. However, if proposals are hand-delivered,
they shall be received at the designated place by 2 p.m., Eastern Time by May 16, 1994. All overnight mail will be considered
to be hand-delivered and must be received at the designated place by the specified closing date. Telegraphed and/or
faxed proposals will not be honored. Failure to adhere to the above instructions will be a basis for a determination
of nonresponsiveness.



D. Late Proposals



Any proposal received at the office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt will
not be considered unless it is received before award is made and it_




(1) Was sent by U.S. Postal Service registered or certified mail not later than the fifth calendar day before the date
specified for receipt of application (e.g., an offer submitted in response to a solicitation requiring receipt of
applications by the 20th of the month must have been mailed by the 15th); or

(2) Was sent by U.S. Postal Service Express Mail Next Day Service_Post Office to Addressee, not later than 5 p.m. at
the place of mailing two working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals. The term ``working days''
excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.




The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a late proposal sent either by U.S. Postal Service
registered or certified mail is the U.S. postmark both on the envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt from the
U.S. Postal Service. Both postmarks must show a legible date or the proposal shall be processed as if mailed late. ``Postmark''
means a printed, stamped, or otherwise placed impression (exclusive of a postage meter machine impression) that
is readily identifiable without further action as having been supplied and affixed by employees of the U.S. Postal
Service on the date of mailing. Therefore, applicants should request the postal clerk to place a legible hand cancellation
``bull's eye'' postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper.

The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a late proposal sent by ``Express Mail Next Day Service_Post
Office to Addressee'' is the date entered by the post office receiving clerk on the ``Express Mail Next Day Service_Post
Office to Addressee'' label and the postmark on both the envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt from the U.S.
Postal Service. ``Postmark'' has the same meaning as defined above. Therefore, applicants should request the postal
clerk to place a legible hand cancellation ``bull's eye'' on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper.



E. Withdrawal of Proposals



Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice or telegram (including mailgram) received at any time before award.
Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an applicant or an authorized representative thereof, if the representative's
identity is made known and the representative signs a receipt for the proposal before award.



F. Period of Performance



The period of performance will be 15 months from the date of the grant award.



G. Funding



DOL has set aside up to $300,000 for this competitive procurement.



H. Option To Extend



Based on the availability of funds, effective program operation and the needs of DOL, the grant may be extended for
up to two option years.

Part III_Statement of Work



The primary focus of this grant will be to develop model materials, including interactive videos and slides, in carpentry
aimed at facilitating the transition from school to a registered apprenticeship program appropriate for use by all
high school juniors and seniors not planning to attend college. For purposes of this solicitation, a ``registered
apprenticeship program'' is defined as one registered by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training in the Department
of Labor or by a State apprenticeship agency recognized and approved as the appropriate body for State registration
and approval of local apprenticeship programs and agreements for Federal purposes.



A. Deliverables



The principal deliverable for this grant shall be a comprehensive curriculum for an instructional program in carpentry.
The deliverable shall include:




1. Phased sets of interactive video materials that will provide a substantial introduction to carpentry;

2. Accompanying materials to include supplemental workbooks and testing materials to enable the student to progress
on a self-paced basis and to evaluate his or her own progress in the course; and

3. Certification testing materials including hands-on projects to enable an instructor to determine whether the
student has gained enough knowledge to receive credit for that portion of the curriculum.




While not mandatory, favorable consideration will be given to those proposals which include an additional certification
process that also provides a student entry into a registered apprenticeship program after successfully completing
the secondary school curriculum.

In demonstrating various tasks associated with carpentry, the materials should take into account recent technical
advances in the development of tools and materials and appropriate safety and health standards and procedures that
are in consonance with the use of those tools and materials. Within budgetary and other relevant constrains, the materials
developed should be state of the art, taking full advantage of modern audio-visual instructional technology.



Part IV_Evaluation Criteria



Prospective offerors are advised that the selection of the grantee for the award is to be made after careful evaluation
of proposals by an evaluation panel within DOL. Each panelist will evaluate the proposals based on the following factors:



A. Technical Approach (40 Points)



The proposal shall describe in detail the curriculum to be established which is aimed at facilitating the transition
from school to a registered apprenticeship program. In addition, if the proposal contains a certification process
which provides that a student who successfully completes the secondary school curriculum will be afforded entry
into a registered apprenticeship program, the process should be fully explained.



B. Coordination and Linkages (20 Points)



The proposal should enumerate established or proposed linkages with existing registered apprenticeship programs
and with regional and national associations representing secondary education.



C. Organizational Capacity (20 Points)



The proposal must provide a background description of how the particular entity which will have responsibility for
this project is organized and the types and quality of services it provides. Background in general areas related to
training and apprenticeship such as labor-management relations or in specific areas such as in-depth experience
in apprenticeable crafts should be enumerated. Specific examples of projects similar to the one proposed for support
that offeror has administered should be included.



D. Experience (20 Points)



The proposal must identify proposed staff and provide a discussion of staff experience in the areas of apprenticeship
programs and their capacity to develop model training materials, including interactive videos and slides. It should
also enumerate the facilities needed to conduct the project. These resources should be adequate to the work described
in the application. The staff would have the required skills and demonstrated ability to produce the expected outcomes.
The staffing pattern must clearly link responsibilities to project tasks.

Applicants are advised that discussions may be necessary in order to clarify any inconsistencies in their applications.
The panel results are advisory in nature and not binding on the Grant Officer. The final decision on the award will be
based on what is most advantageous to the Federal Government as determined by the ETA Grant Officer.

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF LABOR</USDEPT>



<USBUREAU>Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration</USBUREAU>





Grant of Individual Exemptions; Operating Engineers Pension Trust, et al. 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, Labor. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Grant of individual exemptions. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code). 


Notices were published in the 

Federal Register

 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, DC. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have
complied with the requirements of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for
a hearing, unless otherwise stated, were received by the Department. 
The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor. 


Statutory Findings 


In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and the procedures set forth in 29
CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990) and based upon the entire record, the Department makes
the following findings: 
(a) The exemptions are administratively feasible; 
(b) They are in the interests of the plans and their participants and beneficiaries; and 
(c) They are protective of the rights of the participants and beneficiaries of the plans.

Operating Engineers Pension Trust (the Plan) Located in Pasadena, California 


[Prohibited Transaction Exemption No. 94-30; Application No. D-8865] 


Exemption 


The restrictions of section 406(a) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the
Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through (D) of the Code, shall not apply to the leasing by the Plan of mobile
home lots (the Lots) at mobile home parks (the Parks) owned and to be owned by the Plan to active participants (the Actives)
in the Plan who are parties in interest thereto within the meaning of section 3(14)(H) of the Act because they are employees
of employers who contribute to the Plan, provided: (a) leases with Actives will be on the same basis as transactions
engaged in with the general public, utilizing standard form lease agreements and with rental rates determined according
to the existing market; (b) the transaction will cover only those Plan participants who are parties in interest because
they are employees of a contributing employer to the Plan, and no Lots will be leased to Plan fiduciaries, officers,
directors or 10 percent shareholders of contributing employers to the Plan or to persons who are parties in interest
for any reason other than that they are employees of a contributing employer; (c) the leases ordinarily will be for
relatively short, one year terms, and the Plan will adjust rental rates annually based on experience with market conditions;
(d) no Lot will be leased to an Active unless the lease is approved by Buss-Shelger Associates (the Manager), the independent
fiduciary who will also monitor such lease to assure that its terms, and enforcement thereof, are at least as favorable
to the Plan as those the Plan could obtain in similar transactions with unrelated parties; (e) neither Mr. Ronald L.
Buss, President of the Manager, nor the Manager is related to any employer who contributes to the Plan or to the International
Union of Operating Engineers or its Local Union No. 12 (collectively, the Union), and the Manager does not derive any
of its income from the Union or from any such employer; (f) no more than 50 percent of the Lots in the Parks will be leased
to Actives; and (g) no more than 1 percent of Plan assets will be involved in leases to Actives. 


Written Comments 


In the Notice of Proposed Exemption (the Notice), the Department invited all interested persons to submit written
comments and any requests for a hearing on the proposed exemption. The applicant represents that interested persons
were provided with a copy of the Notice, plus a copy of the supplemental statement (the Supplemental Statement), as
required pursuant to 29 CFR 2570.43(b)(2), either through first class mailing of such documents or through publication
of such documents in the bi-monthly Union newsletter, ``News-Record.'' The newsletter was also distributed to various
Union offices and hiring halls. All written comments and requests for a hearing were to have been received by the Department
by February 1, 1994, based on an anticipated publication date of December 17, 1994, for the newsletter containing
the Notice and the Supplemental Statement. Subsequently, the applicant notified the Department that the publication
of the newsletter had been delayed and that the newsletter was not actually mailed to interested persons until January
5, 1994. In light of this fact, the Department determined to extend the comment period on the proposed exemption until
February 28, 1994, to ensure that all interested persons had sufficient time to comment on the proposed exemption.
In this regard, the Department required the applicant to notify interested persons of the extended comment period
by enclosing a notice of extension of time to comment (the Notice of Extension of Time) with each monthly report form
mailed to contributing employers, by asking employers to post the Notice of Extension of Time or distribute it to employees,
and by posting the Notice of Extension of Time together with a copy of proposed exemption in all Union offices and hiring
halls. In a letter dated January 31, 1994, the applicant notified the Department that it had completed notification
to all interested persons as required by the Department.

As of the close of the comment period on February 28, 1994, the Department had received one letter from an interested
person commenting on the proposed exemption and requesting a hearing. In the opinion of the commentator the transaction
involved a highly speculative investment in real property that would jeopardize the ability of the Plan to provide
stable retirement pension income to participants and beneficiaries. 

The Department forwarded a copy of the commentator's letter to the applicant and requested that the applicant address
in writing the concerns raised by the commentator. In response, the applicant stated that the general concern of the
commentator regarding the Plan's purchase of the Lots and construction of the Parks was not at issue in the application,
as relief was requested only for the lease of the Lots to Actives who are parties in interest solely because they are
employees of contributing employers to the Plan. With respect to the leasing of Lots to Actives by the Plan, the applicant
points out that no fiduciary or other party in interest except Actives will be allowed to lease Lots from the Plan. Further,
an independent fiduciary will be required to review the leases to Actives and the number of such leases will be limited.
The transactions would involve a very small percentage of the assets of the Plans. In the opinion of the applicant,
the requested exemption would make the Plan's investment more productive by increasing the rental income to the Plan
and would permit the Actives to decide whether to live in one of the Parks, rather than being prohibited from doing so.


With respect to the purchase of the Lots by the Plan and construction of the Parks, the applicant maintains that such
an investment by the Plan was not a prohibited transaction and did not require an exemption. In the opinion of the applicant,
there is substantial evidence in the application file which addresses the propriety and attractiveness of the purchase
by the Plan of the Lots and the construction of the Parks, which took into account the Plan's portfolio and the general
investment objective to achieve the highest rate of return commensurate with safety of principal over the long term.
In this regard, it is represented that the investment satisfied the Plan guidelines requiring diversification and
profitability, and that the Board of Trustees made such determination, after considering independent professional
investment advice. 

In addition to commenting on the transaction, the commentator requested the Department schedule a hearing on the
matter. The Department notes that in its final regulation on procedures for filing and processing prohibited transaction
exemption applications, 29 CFR 2570.46, there is no provision for a hearing unless the exemption is from the fiduciary
self-dealing prohibitions of section 406(b) of the Act. This exemption does not grant relief from section 406(b)
of the Act. Further, the Department does not believe that any issues have been raised which would require the convening
of a hearing. 

Accordingly, after giving full consideration to the record, including the comment by an interested person and the
responses of the applicant, the Department has determined to grant the exemption, as described herein. In this regard,
the comment submitted to the Department has been included as part of the public record of the exemption application.
The complete application file, including all supplemental submissions received by the Department, is made available
for public inspection in the Public Documents Room of the Pension Welfare Benefits Administration, room N-5507,
U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210. 

For a more complete statement of the facts and representations supporting the Department's decision to grant this
exemption refer to the Notice published on October 29, 1993, 58 FR 58190.

CS Holding and its Worldwide Affiliates Headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland 



[Prohibited Transaction Exemption 94 -31; Exemption Application No. D-9605] 



Exemption 



CS Holding and each of its affiliates (collectively, CS Holding), except Banque Leu Luxembourg (BLL), shall not be
precluded from functioning as a ``qualified professional asset manager'' pursuant to Prohibited Transaction Exemption
84-14 (PTE 84-14, 49 FR 9494, March 13, 1984) solely because of a failure to satisfy Section I(g) of PTE 84-14,
as a result of affiliation with BLL, including any current or future affiliate of CS Holding, other than BLL, which
is, or in the future may become, eligible to serve as a QPAM under PTE 84-14. 



Effective Date:

 This exemption is effective as of December 17, 1993. 



For a more complete statement of the facts and representations supporting the Department's decision to grant this
exemption, refer to the notice of proposed exemption published on February 9, 1994 at 59 FR 6049.

 


WRITTEN COMMENTS: 

The Department received one written comment and no requests for a hearing. The comment was submitted on behalf of the
applicant, CS Holding, in supplementation of the Notice of Proposed Exemption (the Notice). The matters addressed
in the applicant's comment are summarized as follows: 



1. The Notice indicated that the location of CS Holding and Affiliates is New York, New York. The applicant states that
the corporate headquarters of CS Holding is actually located in Zurich, Switzerland, and its affiliates operate
in a variety of worldwide locations. Accordingly, the exemption heading has been amended to include this information.


2. The operative exemption language in the Notice concluded with the following phrase: ``* * * including
any current or future affiliate of CS Holding, other than BLL, which in the future may become eligible to serve as a QPAM
under PTE 94-14.'' The applicant requests, in the interests of completeness and accuracy, that the words ``is
or'' be inserted between the words ``which'' and ``in''. In response to this request, the operative exemption language
in the final exemption includes the requested insertion, and the phrase reads as follows: ``* * * including
any current or future affiliate of CS Holding, other than BLL, which is, or in the future may become, eligible to serve
as a QPAM under PTE 94-14.'' 

3. The Notice states that the proposed exemption was requested ``on behalf of CS Holding affiliates that are banks,
investment banking firms, or registered investment advisers which are or may become eligible to serve as QPAMs.''
The applicant comments that it is more accurate to state that the proposed exemption was requested ``on behalf of CS
Holding affiliates that include banks, investment banking firms, and investment advisers which are, or may become,
eligible to serve as QPAMs.'' 

After consideration of the entire record, the Department has determined to grant the exemption, as supplemented
by the applicant's comment.

General Information 



The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 

(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions
to which the exemptions does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act,
which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of
the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive
benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries; 

(2) These exemptions are supplemental to and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/or the Code,
including statutory or administrative exemptions and transactional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction
is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited
transaction; and

(3) The availability of these exemptions is subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

<USDEPT>UNITED STATES NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Biweekly Notice </DOCTITLE>


Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses 
Involving No Significant Hazards Considerations 


I. Background 


Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended
(the Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new
provision of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately
effective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves
no significant hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing
from any person. 
This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from March 21, 1994, through
April 1, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14884). 


Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to 
Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards 
Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing 


The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.

Date of amendment requests:

 February 18, 1994 


Description of amendment requests:

 The proposed amendment would modify Technical Specifications (TS) 5.3.1, Fuel Assemblies, and TS 5.6.1, Criticality.
In addition, the proposed Amendment would add a new Technical Specification 3/4.9.13, Boron Concentration-Storage
Pool, and its associated BASES. This proposed amendment is requested to allow credit to be taken for burnup of spent
fuel assemblies in establishing storage locations within the PVNGS spent fuel pools. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensees have provided their analysis about the issue of no significant hazards
consideration, which is presented below: 


Standard 1

_Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
This amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. Radiological consequences of the fuel handling accident are not impacted by the formation of new storage
regions since the fuel assembly design is unchanged. However, even though the probability of occurrence of a fuel
misplacement error has increased slightly, the consequences are markedly reduced by the crediting of 2150 ppm of
soluble boron in the spent fuel storage pool. The increase is also not significant because of the types of administrative
controls being put into place in Regions 2 and 3. Furthermore, a fuel assembly misplacement error is not considered
an accident, as defined in the UFSAR. 


Standard 2_

Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
This amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. No changes are being made to the fuel assemblies or the storage racks, and controls will be employed to control
the placement of assemblies in Regions 2 and 3. As such, there is no possibility of a new or different kind of accident
being created. The existing design basis covers all possible accident scenarios in the spent fuel storage pool. 


Standard 3

_Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
This amendment request will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. There is no reduction in the
margin of safety since a k

eff

 less than or equal to 0.95 is met under all analyzed conditions using conservative assumptions which do not credit
the soluble boron in the spent fuel storage pool except under some accident conditions, as allowed by NRC guidelines.
The original mechanical analyses are unchanged for thermal and seismic/structural considerations, as these analyses
were originally performed for a fully loaded spent fuel storage pool. 
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensees' analysis and, based on that review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of application for amendment request:

 March 11, 1994 


Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendments would revise Technical Specification 3/4.7.D, ``Primary Containment Isolation Valves.''
The proposed amendments will add check valves installed in the reference leg instrumentation line. The valves have
been installed as part of the modifications required to meet NRC Bulletin (IEB) 93-03. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

 

(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because:

The proposed license amendment adds the reference leg backfill check valves to the Technical Specifications. As
such, the proposed amendment does not change the probability nor does it change the consequences of any previously
evaluated accident for Dresden and Quad Cities Stations. 
The proposed modifications (and proposed Technical Specification amendments) add reference leg backfill instrument
lines and check valves to the reactor vessel level instrumentation. The proposed modifications will eliminate the
phenomenon described in IEB 93-03 (dissolved gases in the [Reactor Vessel Instrumentation System] RVLIS piping
may produce uncertainties in the level instrumentation during RPV depressurization) by providing degassed Control
Rod Drive (CRD) water to the RVLIS reference leg piping. The proposed design ensures that a continuous column of water,
free of non-condensible gases is maintained in the RVLIS reference leg piping. As such, the proposed modifications
do not affect any accident precursors or initiators. Therefore the proposed modifications for the reference leg
backfill instrument lines do not increase the probability of any previously evaluated accidents for Dresden Station
and Quad Cities Station. 






The proposed plant modifications for the reference leg backfill check valves will not increase the radiological
consequences of any previously evaluated accident. The radiological impact from a reference leg backfill instrument
line break is bounded by Dresden's and Quad Cities' Instrument Line Break analysis (UFSAR Section 15.6.2). Therefore,
the proposed plant changes will not increase the consequences of any previously evaluated accident. 
(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because:

The proposed modification connects the non-safety-related CRD system to each safety-related division of RPV instrumentation
and Feedwater Level Control System. The backfill check valves will eliminate the potential for reference leg leakage
if CRD piping integrity is lost. These check valves are classified as safety-related and will be maintained and controlled
such that overall plant safety is maintained. The addition of the reference leg backfill check valves to the Technical
Specifications does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident for Dresden Station or Quad Cities
Station. 
(3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because: 
Primary containment integrity is not compromised by the addition of a pair of check valves that provide isolation
for the reference leg backfill lines. These valves have been demonstrated to meet the intent of the criteria specified
in General Design Criterion (GDC) 55. The maintenance and control applied toward all the reference leg backfill check
valves ensures that overall plant safety is maintained. Therefore, the addition of the reference leg backfill valves
to Technical Specification 3.7.D.1 and 3.7.D.2 does not reduce the margin of safety for Dresden Station or Quad Cities
Station.

 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of application for amendment request:

 March 26, 1993 


Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendments would revise Technical Specification 3/4.6 for Dresden and Quad Cities Stations to allow
Single Loop Operation (SLO) with the recirculation loop suction and discharge valves open. The amendments would
also delete outdated and unnecessary portions of Technical Specification 3.6.H for Dresden, Units 2 and 3, and provide
more consistency to the BWR Standard Technical Specifications (NUREG-0213, Revision 4). 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

 

Commonwealth Edison has evaluated this proposed amendment and determined that it involves no significant hazards
considerations. According to 10 CFR 50.92(c), a proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant
hazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: 
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or 
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or 
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 


The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because:

 
The proposed change to delete the requirement to close the suction valve of the idle loop during SLO potentially affects
two transient or accident analysis previously evaluated. The first is the Loss-of-Coolant Accident (LOCA) which
has been analyzed for the full range of break sizes, from a small rupture, where the makeup flow is greater than the coolant
loss rate, to the largest, a highly improbable circumferential recirculation line break. The design basis LOCA at
Dresden and Quad Cities is the double-ended guillotine break in a recirculation line. LPCI is one of the Emergency
Core Cooling Systems that would be initiated to flood the core following the Design Basis LOCA accident. 
The LOCA analysis for Quad Cities, Units 1 and 2, takes no credit for closure of the recirculation suction valve to properly
direct LPCI flow into the lower plenum of the reactor. Instead, the LPCI loop selection logic is relied upon to automatically
close the recirculation discharge valve of the selected intact loop. For Dresden, Units 2 and 3, LPCI is not credited
to inject because the limiting failure is the LPCI injection valve. The LOCA ECCS analyses previously performed for
SLO remain applicable and the severity of a postulated LOCA event has not increased. The proposed changes do not physically
change the plant in any manner that would increase the probability of a LOCA. 
The second transient considered is the inadvertent startup of an idle recirculation pump in an unisolated loop. This
event is precluded, however, when the loop is unisolated because the discharge valve must be closed for the pump to
start. To further decrease the probability of the occurrence of this transient, Section 3.6.H.3.e is added to require
the pump to be electrically prohibited from starting. In addition, leaving the loop unisolated results in an increase
in the temperature of the water in the loop, and a correspondingly lower reactivity insertion should the transient
occur. For these reasons, neither the probability nor the consequences of an inadvertent idle pump start have increased.

The additional requirements introduced in Section 3.6.H.5.a-b and 4.6.H.5 to monitor temperatures between the
two loops and the reactor coolant do not cause an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident because
they limit stresses in the vessel and primary piping system to acceptable levels. 
The procedures that are currently followed at Dresden, Units 2 and 3, regarding inadvertent entrance into a region
of instability, defined as Region A, B, and C in Reference (e), are more conservative than those recommended by the
NRC Bulletin, and do not allow operation in the stability regions defined in the Dresden Technical Specifications.
Removing Sections 3.6.H.3.b-c and Section 4.6.H.3 only removes outdated material from the Dresden Technical Specifications
and does not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
The removal of Section 3.6.H.4 allowing operation without forced circulation below 25% of rated power at Dresden,
Units 2 and 3, will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. This change
is conservative because it will prohibit operation in a condition susceptible to instabilities. This section also
is not included in the Standard Technical Specifications. In the same manner, Section 2.1.A.4 is removed from the
Quad Cities Technical Specifications. 






The removal of Section 3.6.H.3.a from the Dresden Technical Specifications will not increase the probability or
consequences of an accident, because a one-pump run-up transient is bounded by the two-pump run-up transient. 
The change in initiation time for SLO requirements for Quad Cities from 12 hours to 24 hours does not represent a significant
change, and still allows adequate time to implement the requirements. Therefore, no increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident will be caused by this change. 
For the reasons stated above, no increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated
is introduced by the proposed changes. 


The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated because:

 
The proposed change to eliminate the requirement to close the recirculation suction valve of the idle recirculation
loop during SLO only removes unnecessary conservatism which is not required to ensure proper LPCI injection into
the vessel during a LOCA. The LPCI loop selection logic already ensures that the intact loop's recirculation pump
discharge valves will close when selected for LPCI injection. Since all ECCS functions will continue to perform as
designed, no new accident scenarios are created. Also, by requiring the idle loop to be electrically prohibited from
starting, the possibility of a new event is not created. 
Section 3.6.H.5.a-b and 4.6.H.5 provide for temperature monitoring prior to starting an idle pump, and monitoring
to maintain acceptable primary system stress levels. Since the changes [do] not adversely affect the performance
of any safety related systems, no new accident scenarios are created. 
The change eliminating the requirements for actions when a region of instability is entered during SLO will not create
a new or different type of accident because procedures are already in place that are consistent with NRC guidance in
this area. These procedures are more conservative than the current Technical Specifications. 
The removal of Section 3.6.H.4 (Dresden) and Section 2.1.A.4 (Quad Cities) does not create the possibility of a new
or different kind of accident because the units will not be allowed to operate without forced circulation with these
sections removed, and Section 3.6.H.4 added. The possibility of accidents occurring from operating in this mode
has been eliminated, and no new types of accidents are created. 
There is no possibility of a new type of accident being created from the removal of Section 3.6.H.3.a from the Dresden
Technical Specifications. The analysis behind the reduced flow MCPR curves provides more thermal margin during
SLO than two-loop operation, because the one-pump run-up transient is less severe than the two-pump run-up transient.

The speed requirement change (Section 3.6.H.3.d for Dresden) for the operating recirculation pump prior to idle
loop startup is in a conservative direction, and no new types of accidents are created. 
The increase in allowed time to initiate SLO requirements for Quad Cities (Section 2.1.A.4) does not represent a significant
change, and still allows adequate time to implement necessary requirements. No new types of accidents are created
by this change. 


The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because:

 
The change to eliminate the requirements to close the recirculation suction valves of the idle loop during SLO maintains
the assumptions of the LOCA analyses. The LPCI loop selection logic will automatically close the recirculation pump
discharge valve of the unbroken loop to ensure proper LPCI injection. Therefore, the current MAPLHGR limits at Dresden
and Quad Cities will continue to ensure that Appendix K criteria are satisfied. 
During normal dual loop operation, LPCI loop selection logic is relied upon to close the discharge valve of the unbroken
loop following a LOCA. This function is performed during SLO, provided the discharge valve and the logic that automatically
closes this valve upon the occurrence of a LOCA signal remain operable. Since the assumptions of the accident analysis
are preserved by the proposed change, there is no reduction in any safety margin. 
The safeguards in place preventing the inadvertent start of an idle recirculation pump are more than adequate protection
against this transient. Three concurrent failures are required for this transient to occur. The transient would
also be less severe due to the warmer water in the loop. Therefore, no reduction in a margin of safety will occur with
this change. 
The addition of Sections 3.6.H.5.a-b and 4.6.H.5 will not decrease margin to safety, since the temperature monitoring
requirements will maintain acceptable stresses in the primary system during idle pump starts. 
For Dresden, the current procedures for entrance into a region of stability provide more margin to safety than the
current Technical Specifications require, because operation in a stability region is not allowed. 
The elimination of Section 3.6.H.4 in the Dresden Technical Specifications and Section 2.1.A.4 in the Quad Cities
Technical Specifications will not decrease a margin of safety because it prohibits operations in a potentially unstable
region. This change is in a conservative direction. 
The elimination of Section 3.6.H.3.a in the Dresden Technical Specifications does not cause a decrease in margin
to safety, because there is more thermal margin to SLO than two-loop operation. 
Changing the active loop speed requirement from 65% to 43% prior to idle loop startup for Dresden is in the conservative
direction; therefore, margin to safety is increased. 
The increase in allowed time to initiate SLO requirements for Quad Cities still provides adequate time to implement
these requirements, and is not a significant change. Margin to safety is not decreased by this change. 
Margin of safety does not, therefore, decrease due to the proposed Technical Specification amendment.

 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

 March 11, 1994 


Description of amendment requests:

 The proposed amendments would provide surveillance requirements for new hydraulic snubbers, which will be installed
on the Main Steam Lines (MSLs) during the current Unit 1 refueling outage. This outage began on March 13, 1994, and it
is scheduled to end on July 3, 1994. These snubbers will also be installed on Unit 2 during the Unit 2 refuel outage (Q2R13)
currently scheduled for the first quarter of 1995. 
The amendment request would also change the Snubber Visual Inspection Intervals and Corrective Actions in Technical
Specifications Sections 3.6.1 and 4.6.1 to the format and content of the BWR Standardized Technical Specifications
(STS), as revised by the provisions of Generic Letter (GL) 84-13 ``Technical Specification for Snubbers'',
dated May 3, 1984 and GL 90-09 ``Alternative Requirements for Snubber Visual Inspection Intervals and Corrective
Actions'', dated December 11, 1990. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

 

Commonwealth Edison Company has evaluated the proposed Technical Specification Amendment and determined that
it does not represent a significant hazards consideration. Based on the criteria for defining a significant hazards
consideration established in 10 CFR 50.92, operation of Quad Cities Station Units 1 and 2 (Quad Cities) in accordance
with the proposed amendment will not: 
(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because:

The proposed changes adopt the format and content of the BWR-STS, as modified by the provisions of GL 84-13 and
GL 90-09. As such, these proposed changes are administrative in nature and have no effect on the accident analyses
or system operation. 
The proposed schedule for snubber visual inspection intervals described in GL 90-09 will maintain the same
level of confidence as the existing schedule as documented in Generic Letter 90-09, Alternative Requirements
for Snubber Visual Inspection Intervals and Corrective Actions, dated December 11, 1990. Also, the surveillance
requirement and schedule for snubber functional testing remains the same providing a 95 percent confidence level
that 90 to 100 percent of the snubbers operate within the specified limits. The proposed visual inspection schedule
is separate from functional testing and adds to the confidence level that the installed snubbers will serve their
design function and are being maintained operable. Accident analyses assume that snubbers are initially operable.
Compliance with the Technical Specification Surveillance Requirements for functional testing in conjunction
with the revised visual inspection schedule assures continued operability of the snubbers. Therefore, no initial
assumptions are being changed and thus neither the probability nor consequences of any accidents previously evaluated
are significantly increased. 
(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because:

The proposed changes adopt the format and content of the BWR-STS, as modified by the provisions of GL 84-13 and
GL 90-09. As such, these proposed changes are administrative in nature and have no effect on the accident analyses
or system operation. 
The proposed schedule for snubber visual inspection intervals will maintain the same level of confidence as the existing
schedule as documented in Generic Letter 90-09, Alternative Requirements for Snubber Visual Inspection Intervals
and Corrective Actions, dated December 11, 1990. Also, the surveillance requirement and schedule for snubber function
testing remains the same providing a 95 percent confidence level that 90 to 100 percent of the snubbers operate within
the specified limits. The proposed visual inspection schedule is separate from functional testing and adds to the
confidence level that the installed snubbers will serve their design function and are being maintained operable.
As a result, the supported piping, components, etc. will be maintained operable, so that supported safety systems
will perform as designed. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident is not created. 
(3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because: 
The proposed changes adopt the format and content of the BWR-STS, as modified by the provisions of GL 84-13 and
G[L] 90-09. As such, these proposed changes are administrative in nature and have no effect on the accident analyses
or system operation. In addition, the proposed amendment maintains the same level of confidence as the current technical
specification that snubbers are operable through the current snubber functional testing and the revised snubber
visual inspection 






schedule and the associated corrective action requirements. Therefore the proposed changes do not impact the margin
of safety.

Date of amendment request:

 February 25, 1994 


Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendment will add a new Technical Specification 3/4.7.12, ``Ultimate Heat Sink.'' 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

 

The proposed changes do not involve an SHC [significant hazards consideration] because the changes would not: 
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
The ultimate heat sink (Connecticut River) provides the cooling water necessary to ensure the removal of the normal
heat loads and normal cooldown loads of the plant and to mitigate the effects of accidents at the plant within acceptable
limits. By placing a technical specification limit on the maximum temperature of the ultimate heat sink for plant
operation, CYAPCO will assure that sufficient heat removal capacity is available. The intake structure draws water
from the ultimate heat sink for circulation by the service water system and circulating water system. By adding this
new requirement to the technical specifications, CYAPCO will ensure that the design basis, as stated in the Final
Safety Analysis Report, for the ultimate heat sink is not violated. 
The change does not affect any initiating event. Thus, the change does not affect the probability of occurrence of
any design basis accidents previously evaluated. 
There are no adverse impacts on the design basis accidents due to the addition of the ultimate heat sink temperature
limitation. This administrative change has no effect on the consequences of the previously evaluated accidents.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. 
Currently, the Haddam Neck Plant controls the ultimate heat sink temperature limit to less than 90
 F for Mode 1, 2, 3, and 4 via a plant procedure. The proposed change institutes a technical specification in place
of this administrative control. 
As such, the administrative change is consistent with the current plant practice and has no effect on plant operation.
Since there are no changes in the way the plant is operated, there is no possibility of an accident of a different type
than previously evaluated due to the change. 
3. Involve a reduction in a margin of safety. 
The proposed change does not impact the physical protective boundaries, nor does it affect the performance of safety
systems. There is no degradation in operability and surveillance requirements for the ultimate heat sink. Therefore,
there will be no adverse impact on the margin of safety as defined in the basis for any technical specifications.

 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Docket No. 50-247, Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 2, Westchester
County, New York 




Date of amendment request:

 January 28, 1994 


Description of amendment request:

 This amendment request is an additional followup to the amendment request of May 29, 1992, published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 8, 1992, (57 FR 30242) which changed the Technical Specifications Section 1.0, Definitions, to accommodate
a 24-month fuel cycle and which proposed the extension of the test intervals for specific surveillance tests. This
amendment proposes extending the surveillance intervals to 24 months for leak testing containment isolation valves.
The changes requested by the licensee are in accordance with Generic Letter 91-04, ``Changes in Technical Specification
Intervals to Accommodate a 24-Month Fuel Cycle.'' In addition, the request corrects an administrative error.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

 

1. A significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated will not occur.

It is proposed that the interval between leakage tests of the containment isolation valves listed in the Technical
Specifications be revised from 24 months to 24 months (+25%), consistent with an exemption request to 10 CFR [Part]
50 Appendix J for type C tests which requests an identical extension in the interval between tests. 
The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously analyzed
accident. These changes propose extending the surveillance intervals for containment leakage testing. The changes
do not involve any physical changes to the plant or alter the way equipment functions. Other system testing (e.g.,
on-line tests) provides assurance of system operability. An evaluation of past equipment performance provides
additional assurance that the longer surveillance intervals will not degrade system performance. The 25% increase
in the surveillance interval for type C leak rate testing is compensated for by a proportionate increase in the margin
between specified leakage limit and the allowable leakage limit. Valves that are sealed with fluid are exempted from
the 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix J leakage requirements. The Technical Specifications establish separate acceptance
criteria for such cases base[d] on system design considerations. Additionally, in most cases, containment isolation
valve redundancy (two valves in series) provides additional assurance that actual leakage would be lower than the
test results would indicate. 
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated has not been created.

The proposed license amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. These changes
propose extending the surveillance intervals for containment leakage testing. The changes do not involve any physical
changes to the plant or alter the way equipment functions. Other system testing (e.g., on-line tests) provides assurance
of system operability. An evaluation of past equipment performance provides additional assurance that the longer
surveillance intervals will not degrade system performance. The 25% increase in the surveillance interval for type
C leak rate testing is compensated for by a proportionate increase in the margin between specified leakage limit and
the allowable leakage limit. Also, containment isolation valve redundancy (two valves in series) provides additional
assurance, in most cases, that leakage would be lower than the test results would indicate. 
3. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety? 
The proposed change[s] does[do] not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. These changes propose
extending the surveillance intervals for containment leakage testing. Other system testing (e.g., on-line tests)
provides assurance of system operability. An evaluation of past equipment performance provides additional assurance
that the longer surveillance intervals will not degrade system performance. The 25% increase in the surveillance
interval for type C leak rate testing is compensated for by a proportionate increase in the margin between specified
leakage limit and the allowable leakage limit. Also, containment isolation valve redundancy (two valves in series),
in most cases, provides additional assurance that leakage would be lower than the test results would indicate.

 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

County, North Carolina 




Date of amendment request:

 November 11, 1993 


Description of amendment request:

 The amendments would change the Technical Specification (TS) surveillance requirements for the emergency core
cooling system (ECCS) subsystems. Specifically, the changes would revise the minimum developed head requirement
for the centrifugal charging pumps (CCPs), the safety injection pumps (SIPs), and the residual heat removal pumps
(RHRPs); revise the sum of the minimum injection flowrates for the CCPs, SIPs, and the RHRPs; and revise the total maximum
pump flowrate (runout limit) for the CCPs and the SIPs. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

 

(Amendment would not) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
The TS [technical specification] changes proposed by this amendment request are not considered to be initiators
of any Design Basis Accidents (DBA). During normal operation the SIPs and the RHRPs are in standby, they are not operating.
In the event of an accident resulting in an Engineered Safeguard (ES) actuation, the pumps would start to provide flow
to the reactor vessel. The minor changes proposed for these pumps (SIPs and RHRPs) would not cause any accidents or
events that have been previously evaluated. 
During normal operation, a CCP is operating. The proposed minor changes provided by this submittal only impact the
performance of these pumps in response to an ES actuation. The proposed changes do not affect, in any way, how these
pumps are operated during normal operation. As such, the minor changes proposed for the CCPs would not cause any accidents
or events that have been previously evaluated. Accordingly, the proposed TS changes would not increase the probability
of an accident that has been previously evaluated. 
The purpose of the ECCS subsystem is to ensure sufficient flow is provided to the core in the event of a LOCA [loss of coolant
accident], that is to mitigate the consequences of a LOCA. A LOCA analysis was performed to determine the impact of
the proposed TS changes. The analysis was performed in accordance with the NRC approved LOCA methodology for McGuire
Nuclear Station. The results of the analysis demonstrate that the acceptance criteria of 10 CFR 50.46 are still satisfied.
Further, the purpose of the proposed TS changes are to prevent runout of the ECCS subsystem pumps during the injection
and recirculation phases of a LOCA. Accordingly, the proposed TS changes would not increase the consequences of an
accident that has been previously evaluated. 
(Amendment would not) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any kind of accident previously
evaluated. 
The proposed TS changes would not require any modifications to any structures, systems or components at McGuire Nuclear
Station. Some minor changes to certain testing procedures for the ECCS subsystem pumps would be necessary. These
minor changes would only involve specific values identified within the procedure and would not result in any changes
on how the test would be performed. No other changes to procedures on how the station is operated or maintained would
occur. Accordingly, the proposed TS change would not create a new or different kind of accident than what has been previously
evaluated. 
(Amendment would not) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
The results of the analysis that was performed to determine the impact of the proposed TS changes would have in mitigating
a LOCA indicate that the acceptance criteria of 10 CFR 50.46 are still satisfied. The analysis that was performed demonstrate
that the Peak Clad Temperature (PCT) would remain below 2200
 F. The proposed changes ensure that the ECCS subsystem pumps will be operated within the limits specified by
the manufacturer. Accordingly, the proposed TS changes would not significantly reduce any margins of safety.

 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request:

 The amendments would add four instruments to the Technical Specification (TS) Tables 3.3-10 and 4.3-7
as part of the accident monitoring instrumentation, and delete five instruments from the TS Tables that are not part
of the accident monitoring instrumentation. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

 

1. Will operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed change involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated? 
RESPONSE: No 
This proposed change does not involve any significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident
previously evaluated because no changes in the types, categories, hardwares and setpoints of the instruments involved
were made; only the designation of which instruments should be listed in the T/S [technical specification] Tables
and labeled as PAM [Post-Accident Monitoring] in the control room is changed through this proposed change. 
2. Will operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed change create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated? 
RESPONSE: No 
This proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated because no changes in the types, categories, hardwares and setpoints of the instruments involved were
made; only the designation of which instruments should be listed in the T/S Tables and labeled as PAM in the control
room is changed through this proposed change. 
3. Will operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed change involve a significant reduction in a margin

Unit No. 1, Pope County, Arkansas 




Date of amendment request:

 March 3, 1994 


Description of amendment request:

 This amendment removes restrictions from the Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit No. 1 (ANO-1) technical specifications
(TSs) that prohibit use of the auxiliary building crane to move spent fuel shipping casks. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

 

Criterion 1_Does Not Involve a Significant Increase in the Probability or Consequences of an Accident Previously
Evaluated. 
The ANO procedures, load paths, crane equipment certification, operator training and other related heavy load handling
topics were evaluated as part of the control of heavy loads issue and 





found acceptable. Spent fuel cask handling is discussed in Section 9.6.2.6 of the ANO-1 SAR [safety analysis
report], which shows that the cask will never travel over spent fuel. ANO-1 SAR Section 9.6.2.6 further evaluates
the unlikely event of a cask drop accident and shows that the consequences are acceptable. Deletion of TS 3.8.15 to
allow handling of a spent fuel shipping cask by the auxiliary building crane will have no actual impact on the cask drop
or any other previously analyzed accident and therefore, does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. 


Criterion 2_Does Not Create the Possibility of a New or Different Kind of Accident from any Previously Evaluated.

The proposed amendment will allow handling of a spent fuel shipping cask by the auxiliary building crane where [sic]
previously prohibited pending NRC evaluation of the spent fuel cask drop accident and crane design. The cask handling
methods and cask drop accident are discussed and evaluated in ANO-1 SAR Section 9.6.2.6. Additionally, the
NRC performed an independent evaluation of the radiological consequences of a cask drop accident, as documented
in the ANO-1 SER [safety evaluation report] dated June 6, 1973. The evaluation of the unlikely event of a cask
drop accident included assessment of equipment failures and has shown the consequences to be within acceptable bounds.
Since no new accident scenarios can be identified related to the proposed amendment request, this change is bounded
by the analysis described in the SAR and does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any
previously evaluated. 
Criterion 3_Does Not Involve a Significant Reduction in the Margin of Safety. 
Although allowing use of the Auxiliary Building crane where [sic] previously prohibited by the TS could increase
the possibility of a cask drop accident, the margin of safety is preserved in that the acceptable consequences of the
cask drop accident evaluation in SAR Section 9.6.2.6 are not affected by this change. The proposed amendment request
will not adversely affect the adequacy and conservatism of the cask drip accident evaluation. Therefore, the cask
handling issue at ANO-1 continues to exhibit an acceptable margin of safety and does not involve a significant
reduction in the margin of safety.

 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request:

 February 22, 1994 


Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendments will relocate the instrument response time limits for the Reactor Protective System and
Engineered Safety Features Actuation System from the Technical Specifications (TS) to the Updated Safety Analysis
Report for both units. The proposed changes are line-item TS improvements and conform to the guidance given in Enclosures
1 and 2 of NRC Generic Letter 93-08. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

 

Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.92, a determination may be made that a proposed license amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of
a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. Each standard is discussed as follows: 
1. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

 

The proposed amendments for St. Lucie Units 1 and 2 simply relocate tables of response time limits for instrumentation
of the Reactor Protective System (RPS) and Engineered Safety Features Actuation System (ESFAS) from the Technical
Specifications (TS) to the Updated Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). The proposed amendments conform to the guidance
given in Enclosures 1 and 2 of USNRC Generic Letter 93-08 (GL 93-08). Neither the response time limits nor
the surveillance requirements for performing response time testing will be altered by this submittal. The overall
RPS and ESFAS system functional capabilities will not be changed and assurance that actions of the protective and
engineered safety features systems are completed within the time limits assumed in the accident analyses is unaffected
by the proposed TS changes. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment will not
involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

 

2. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.



The proposed amendment will not change the physical plant or the modes of plant operation defined in the Facility License.
The change does not involve the addition or modification of equipment nor does it alter the design or operation of plant
systems. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

 

3. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. 



The measurement of instrumentation response times at the frequencies specified in the TS provides assurance that
actions associated with the protective and engineered safety features systems are accomplished within the time
limits assumed in the St. Lucie Units 1 and 2 accident analyses. The response time limits, and the measurement frequencies
remain unchanged by the proposed amendments. The proposed changes do not alter the basis for any other Technical Specification
that is related to the establishment of or maintenance of a nuclear safety margin. Therefore, operation of the facility
in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

 

Based on the discussion presented above and on the supporting Evaluation of Proposed TS Changes, FPL has concluded
that this proposed license amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. 
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request:

 February 28, 1994.


Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendments will delete the minimum frequency criteria prescribed for quality assurance audits from
Administrative Controls sections 6.5.2.8 and 6.8.4 of the Technical Specifications (TS). Audit periodicity will
thereby be controlled by the program described in the Florida Power and Light Company (FPL) Topical Quality Assurance
Report. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.92, a determination may be made that a proposed license amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of
a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. Each standard is discussed as follows: 
1. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
The proposed amendment relocates administrative control criteria for minimum audit frequencies from the facility
Technical Specifications to the FPL Quality Assurance (QA) Program. The QA Program is described in the FPL Topical
Quality Assurance Report pursuant to 10CFR50, Appendix B. The change does not alter the bases upon which assurance
is provided that safety-related activities are performed correctly nor does it involve the conditions and assumptions
utilized in the analyses of plant transients and accidents. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with
the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 
2. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
The proposed amendment will not change the physical plant or the modes of plant operation defined in the Facility License.
The change does not involve the addition or modification of equipment nor does it alter the design or operation of plant
systems. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
3. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. 
The proposed amendment does not alter the bases for assurance that safety-related activities are performed correctly
or that compliance with the required Limiting Conditions for Operation will be achieved. The change does not alter
the basis for any Technical Specification that is related to the establishment of or maintenance of a nuclear safety
margin. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. 
Based on the discussion presented above and on the supporting Evaluation of Proposed TS Changes, FPL has concluded
that this proposed license amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. 
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Georgia 




Date of amendment request:

 March 1, 1994.


Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendments would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3.2.4, ``Quadrant Power Tilt Ratio,'' to add

an exception to the requirements of TS 3.0.4. Specifically, to add ACTION statement ``d. The provisions of Specification
3.0.4 are not applicable.'' 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination

: In 1992, the Vogtle TSs were amended in accordance with the recommendations of Generic Letter 87-09 to revise
the wording of TS 3.0.4 and to delete from TS 3.2.4 the statement that the provisions of TS 3.0.4 are not applicable.
With the revised wording of TS 3.0.4, the statement of the non-applicability of the provisions of TS 3.0.4 was redundant
for many individual specifications, and its deletion caused no change in ACTION requirements. However, in the case
of TS 3.2.4, the deletion had the unintended effect of prohibiting power escalation above 50% rated thermal power
(RTP) whenever the quadrant power tilt ratio (QPTR) exceeds 1.0.2. This unnecessarily delays power escalation.
The proposed amendment would correct this error and restore the originally intended meaning of TS 3.2.4. The intent
of TS 3.2.4 is to permit the escalation of reactor power above 50% RTP for limited times and 






under specified conditions when the QPTR is greater than 1.02. 


With the original requirements of TS 3.2.4 restored, plant operation and power escalation during startup would be
the same as previously approved. Therefore, the proposed change (1) does not involve a significant increase in the
probability or consequences or an accident previously evaluated, (2) does not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident than previously evaluated, and (3) does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

 

1. The proposed change to the Technical Specifications does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because it 
does not allow operation in a condition that is not already allowed by the Technical Specifications. 
2. The proposed change to the Technical Specifications does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of
accident from any accident previously evaluated because it will not allow operation under conditions different
from those already allowed by the technical specifications. 
3. The proposed addition to the Technical Specifications does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of
safety because the action requirements will continue to be met in the same manner as currently required by the Technical
Specifications.

 

Accordingly, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request:

 The purpose of the request is to require the TMI-1 annual radioactive effluent release report for the previous
calendar year be required to be submitted prior to May 1 of each year. Changing the TMI-1 due date to prior to May
1 can enable the licensee to combine the reports for TMI-1 and TMI-2 into a single report with a common due
date. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

 

1. Submission of the annual radioactive effluent release report on or before April 30 each year in accordance with
the change, as compared to the current requirement of March 1, does not involve a significant increase in the probability
of occurrence or the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The date on which the report is due has no impact
on plant operations or effluents. It does not change the control of plant activities or the monitoring of plant effluents.

2. Operation of TMI-1 in accordance with the proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed amendment has no impact on plant operations,
plant effluents or the control of plant operations or effluents. Therefore, there is no potential to create a new or
different kind of accident. 
3. Operation of TMI-1 in accordance with the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in
a margin of safety. There is no specified margin of safety in regards to the due date for the annual radioactive effluent
release report.

 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

GPU Nuclear Corporation, et al., Docket No. 50-289, Three Mile Island Nuclear Station, Unit No. 1, Dauphin County,
Pennsylvania 




Date of amendment request:

 March 2, 1994.


Description of amendment request:

 The purposes of the request are to change the plant Technical Specifications (TS) to modify Operational Safety Instrumentation
requirements to specify completion times which allows for performance of maintenance or surveillance within a reasonable
time and to be consistent with the allowable outage time for other safety-related equipment when only one train is
affected. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

 

1. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in
the probability of occurrence or the consequence of an accident previously evaluated. 
The proposed amendment permits time to restore instrumentation channels to operable status which is consistent
with existing times allowed for outage of other safety-related equipment affecting one train. With regard to the
1 hour timeclock, this time is sufficient to perform the required action necessary to restore minimum required conditions.
Allowing 6 hours to reduce reactor power in an orderly manner without challenging plant systems is reasonable, based
on operating experience. Thus, the proposed amendment maintains an adequate degree of equipment availability without
requiring unnecessary initiation of a plant shutdown for partial equipment outages. 
Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
2. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
The proposed amendment affects the [Reactor Protection System] RPS and the [Engineered Safeguards Actuation System]
ESAS by providing timeclocks to perform corrective actions. During this timeclock period the safety function of
the RPS can still be completed by the remaining minimum required channels. If an accident occurred while one ESAS train
was inoperable due to faulty pressure switches or a faulty manual actuation channel, the redundant train would complete
the safety function. The proposed time allowed for the pressure switches in one train or the faulty manual actuation
channel to be out of service is bounded by the allowable time for other safety-related equipment such that only one
train is affected. The proposed 8 hour timeclock associated with the [Reactor Building] RB purge radiation monitor,
RMA-9, provides adequate time to confirm a problem exists and perform minor troubleshooting. The containment
isolation function for the RB purge valves would still be maintained by a redundant 4 psig ESAS signal and a redundant
reactor trip containment isolation signal. 
Therefore, the proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different accident. 
3. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. 


As noted in the Bases for Specification 3.5.1, every reasonable effort will be made to maintain all safety instrumentation
in operation. If RPS or ESAS instrumentation is found to be inoperable or require maintenance to assure reliability,
the proposed amendment will allow the performance of maintenance and surveillance in a reasonable time period. The
change does not result in a significant reduction in a margin of safety for the RPS because the automatic functions
and various alternative manual trip methods are still available. Also, this change does not result in a significant
reduction in a margin of safety for the ESAS because at least one train of safety features is required for continued
operation within the specified timeclocks with automatic and manual trip functions. 
Thus, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.

 






The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request:

 March 11, 1994. 


Description of amendment request:

 The purposes of the request are to (1) change the plant Technical Specifications (TS) to specify an allowable outage
time for the Emergency Feedwater (EFW) Pumps during surveillance activities and (2) change the requirement to test
redundant components for operability to a requirement to ensure operability based on verification of completion
of appropriate surveillance activities. 
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:

 

1. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in
the probability of occurrence or the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
The proposed amendment specifies an allowable outage time for testing of the EFW pumps. Also, this proposed change
reflects the current NRC staff position regarding the need for additional testing to assure OPERABILITY. The allowable
outage time this change provides for EFW pump testing is acceptable because the operator action required to make the
motor driven EFW pump OPERABLE is minimal and can be performed in a very short time by the Control Room Operator who is
continuously present during the time by the motor-driven EFW pump is in the Pull-To-Lock position. 
The changes affecting OPERABILITY determinations of redundant train/components for reactor building isolation
valves and the control room air treatment systems reflect the current NRC staff position. Verifying that the required
periodic surveillance testing is current and there are no known reasons to suggest the redundant train/component
is inoperable, provides adequate assurance of system OPERABILITY. 
Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
2. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
The proposed amendment specifies an allowable outage time and deletes unnecessary redundant equipment testing.
These changes do not change system operational requirements or response to system transients. Therefore, the proposed
amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. 
3. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. 
The proposed amendment specifies an allowable outage time and replaces redundant equipment testing with verification
that surveillance is current as an adequate means to ensure OPERABILITY. These changes do not involve any activities
associated with the margin of safety envelope. Thus, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment
does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Units 1 and 2, Matagorda County, Texas 




Date of amendment request:

 March 16, 1994. 


Description of amendment request:

 The licensee proposes to amend the South Texas Project technical specifications (TS) by modifying TS 3.4.9.3, ``Reactor
Coolant System_Overpressure Protection Systems,'' Figure 3.4-4, ``Nominal Maximum Allowable PORV Setpoint
for the Cold Overpressure System,'' for the cold overpressure mitigation system (COMS) with a revised setpoint curve.
The proposed amendment would account for the pressure losses of the reactor coolant flow through the reactor core
with either two or four reactor coolant pumps (RCP) operating. It was determined that the original COMS setpoint curve
neglected reactor coolant pressure losses due to flow through the reactor core with the RCPs operating. The resulting
pressure at the reactor vessel downcomer at the elevation equivalent to the core mid-plane was higher than the pressure
at the sensing point located in the residual heat removal system suction line connected to the reactor coolant system
(RCS) hot leg. The proposed amendment would lower the power 
operated relief valve (PORV) setpoint limit by a quantity equal to the pressure difference between the pressure at
the reactor vessel downcomer at the elevation of the core mid-plane and the pressure at the location of the residual
heat removal system pressure transmitters. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

 

(1) The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously
evaluated accident. 
The presently existing pressurizer Power Operated Relief Valves (PORVs) setpoints, provided by the Cold Overpressure
Mitigation System Curve (Figure 3.4-4) of Technical Specification 3.4.9.3, are nonconservative in that they
do not account for reactor coolant pressure losses due to flow through the reactor core with Reactor Coolant Pump (RCPs)
in operation. When RCP operation is considered, the pressure at the reactor vessel downcomer, at an elevation equivalent
to core midplane, is higher than the pressure sensing point located in the Residual Heat Removal System suction line
connection to the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) hot leg. Houston Lighting & Power Company became aware of this
condition and re-analyzed the Cold Overpressurization Event for the South Texas Project. The re-analysis has resulted
in modifications to Figure 3.4-4 of Technical Specification 3.4.9.3. The re-analysis reduced the PORVs setpoint
to account for the pressure losses and provides for a setpoint for two Reactor Coolant Pump operation and for four Reactor
Coolant Pump operation. 
The proposed decrease in the PORVs setpoint reduces the pressure versus temperature limit for the RCS under start-up
and shut-down operations. The decreased PORV setpoints for post-overpressure incidents will ensure that RCS pressure
will be maintained within acceptable limits during low temperature water solid operation for both two and four pump
operation. 
The proposed change is based on a re-analysis which accounts for reactor coolant pressure losses through the reactor
core. Reflecting actual reactor coolant pressure losses and adjusting the PORV setpoint as necessary has no adverse
effect on the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Therefore, the proposed changes
not only do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated,
but actually maintain the original design basis. 
(2) The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The proposed decrease in the PORV setpoints ensures that staggered operation of the two PORVs are maintained, thus
minimizing the potential for large pressure undershoots resulting from multiple valve operation which may compromise
the Reactor Coolant Pump No. 1 Seal integrity. It also restricts the total number of discharge ports at any given moment
to that absolutely necessary for pressure control. In addition, operation of either PORV provides the required design
basis relief capacity and the required redundancy necessary to meet single failure criteria. 
The proposed change is the result of a re-analysis of a previously evaluated accident. Therefore, the proposed changes
do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
(3) The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
The proposed change corrects an error present in the original analysis by accounting for reactor coolant pressure
losses through the reactor core. The revised COMS curves are the result of a re-analysis of the original COMS analysis.
The new analysis preserves the originally intended margin of safety. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve
a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request:

 March 21, 1994. 


Description of amendment request:

 The licensee proposes to revise Technical Specifications 3.1.2.3 ``Reactivity Control Systems Charging 
Pumps_Shutdown'' and 3.1.2.1 ``Boration Systems Flow Paths_Shutdown.'' The amendment would allow energizing
of an inoperable centrifugal charging pump in preparation for switching of the centrifugal charging pumps, provided
the pump discharge is isolated from the reactor coolant system. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The NRC staff's review
is presented below: 
(1) The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously
evaluated accident. 
The proposed change is to modify the note which permits energizing of an inoperable centrifugal charging pump for
testing purposes, provided the pump discharge is isolated from the reactor coolant system, to include pump energization
for switching purposes. 
The proposed changes can potentially impact two events during Modes 4, 5, and 6: (1) Cold overpressurization of the
reactor coolant system, and (2) boron dilution resulting in a return to criticality. The requirements of Specification
3.1.2.3 with regard to the cold overpressure mitigation system analysis would remain valid because the inoperable
centrifugal charging pump would be isolated from the reactor coolant system. A return to criticality would be prevented
because the action statement of Specification 3.1.2.1 would be entered if the boron injection flow path could not
be restored following centrifugal charging pump switching. Therefore, allowing energization of an inoperable
pump for switching would have an insignificant effect on the probability of an overpressurization and boron dilution
accident. 
Energization of an inoperable pump is currently permitted for testing purposes provided the pump discharge is isolated
from the reactor coolant system. It is operationally desirable to maintain flow to the reactor coolant pump seals
during the centrifugal charging pump switching process. This proposed change will not only protect the reactor coolant
system from overpressurization at low temperatures, but will also provide the capability of maintaining reactor
coolant pump seal injection flow during the switching process. 
Therefore, there is no increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident. 
(2) The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

Required boron injection flow paths would be maintained in Modes 4, 5, and 6 except during centrifugal charging pump
switching. In the event the boron injection flow path could not be restored after centrifugal charging pump switching,
the action statement of Specification 3.1.2.1 would be entered. The proposed changes would not affect the operability
of safety-related equipment and reactor coolant pump seal injection flow could be maintained. The plant operators
are knowledgeable of the potential situation being created by energizing two centrifugal charging pumps and will
follow direct administrative controls to isolate the pumps from the reactor coolant system. Therefore, the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident is not created. 
(3) The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
Cold overpressure mitigating system requirements in Specification 3.1.2.3 would continue to be maintained as a
result of the proposed change. Thus, 10 CFR 50 Appendix G limits will not be affected. Although the boron injection
flow path required by Specification 3.1.2.1 may briefly be compromised, there is no significant reduction in a margin
of safety because core alterations would be halted and positive reactivity changes would not be made if the boron injection
path could not be maintained after centrifugal charging pump switching. This action, coupled with the short 
time period required for centrifugal charging pump switching, would preclude a return to criticality event. Therefore,
there is no significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
Based on this review, it appears that the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes
to determine that the request for amendments involves no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment requests:

 February 16, 1994 (Reference LAR 94-05). 


Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendments would revise the combined Technical Specifications (TS) for the Diablo Canyon Power Plant
Unit Nos. 1 and 2 to revise TS 3/4.7.2.1, ``Steam Generator Pressure/Temperature Limitation,'' 3/4.7.7.1, ``Snubbers,''

These TS would be relocated to plant administrative controls and the final safety analysis report by reference. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

 

a. Do the changes involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?

These proposed changes simplify the TS, meet regulatory requirements for relocated TS, and implement the recommendations
of the Commission's Final Policy Statement on TS Improvements. Future changes to these requirements will be controlled
by 10 CFR 50.59. The proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not involve any modifications to any plant
equipment or affect plant operation. 
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 
b. Do the changes create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?

The proposed changes are administrative in nature, do not involve any physical alterations to any plant equipment,
and cause no change in the method by which any safety-related system performs its function. 
Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. 
c. Do the changes involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? 
The proposed changes do not alter the basic regulatory requirements and do not affect any safety analyses. Therefore,
the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant
hazards consideration.

factor to be specified in the Core Operating Limits Report (COLR).

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

 

a. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?

The Heat Flux Hot Channel Factor, F

Q

(z), is not involved in the initiation of any accident. Verifying F

Q

(z) is below its limit ensures initial conditions for accident analyses are met. The proposed changes have been previously
approved by the NRC and provide for application of a more conservative F

Q

(z) penalty which will ensure that possible F

Q

(z) margin decreases are adequately accounted for. Therefore, if the F

Q

(z) does exceed its limit, the appropriate actions in TS 3.2.1 and TS 3.2.2. will be taken and are adequate to ensure
design basis accidents analyses assumptions are met. 
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 
b. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?

F

Q

(z) is not involved in the initiation of any accident. The F

Q

(z) surveillance provides assurance that the initial conditions for accident assumptions are met. F

Q

(z) is a measurement of a physical property and is not involved in the initiation of any accident. 
Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. 
c. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? 
The F

Q

(z) surveillance ensures that certain core parameters are maintained consistent with supporting assumptions regarding
the core for postulated accidents. The methodology used in Revision 1 to WCAP-10216-P-A adequately
accounts for F

Q

(z) increases between monthly flux maps. Using the methodology of Revision 1 to WCAP-10216-P-A
results in a F

Q

(z) penalty which is more conservative than the current TS F

Q

(z) penalty of 2 percent. If the F

Q

(z) increases above the TS limit, appropriate actions in TS 3.2.1 and TS 3.2.2. are adequate to ensure design basis
accidents analyses assumptions are met. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.

 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant
hazards consideration.

Portland General Electric Company, et al., Docket No. 50-344, Trojan Nuclear Plant, Columbia County, Oregon





Date of amendment request:

 January 27, 1993, revised March 8, 1994. 


Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendment, as revised, by Portland General Electric Company, PGE or the licensee, would change the Trojan
Nuclear Plant (Trojan) Appendix A Technical Specifications to reflect the permanently defueled status of the facility.
The permanent cessation of power generation at Trojan and the May 5, 1993 amendment to the license which granted the
licensee a Possession Only License for the facility has rendered many of the existing provisions of the current Appendix
A Technical Specifications inappropriate. PGE has developed Permanently Defueled Technical Specifications (PDTS)
for Trojan using NUREG-1431, ``Standard Technical Specifications, Westinghouse Plants,'' as a basis for
the PDTS scope and format.
Based on a series of discussions between the PGE staff and the NRC on February 9, 1994 and February 28, 1994 the licensee
has revised several requirements contained in the original June 27, 1993 amendment request. These revisions were
forwarded to the NRC staff by letter dated March 8, 1994. The March 8, 1994 revision updates the June 27, 1993 submittal
deleting reference to sections that had been relocated out of the Technical Specifications by amendments granted
since June 1993. It also provided supplemental information concerning the deletion and/or relocation of certain
existing Trojan Technical Specifications requested by the NRC staff. The March 8, 1994 submittal also clarified
the long term organization at the site, established a line of succession for the operational command and control function,
modified the review and audit functions performed by the Independent Review and Audit Committee assuring their independence
of review, required independent review of certain programs and manuals, limited annual and quarterly doses and operability
and usage of the effluent treatment systems to conform to Appendix I to 10 CFR Part 50, continued the existing requirement
for surveillance of former structural modifications to the facility, and required the submission of an annual radioactive
effluent release report in accordance with 10 CFR 50.36a. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.92(a), the licensee has provided an analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
In accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.92, Issuance of Amendment, this license amendment request, as revised,
is judged to involve no significant hazards consideration based upon the following:

 

1. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
The licensee analysis shows that the worst case design basis accident for this plant, in its permanently shutdown
defueled state, is a fire in the radioactive waste annex building. The licensee has also identified a second design
basis accident scenario, a fuel handling accident in the vicinity of the Trojan spent fuel pool. Other Trojan Final
Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) accident scenarios addressed in Chapter 15 are no longer applicable to Trojan in the
permanently defueled mode. The proposed amendment, as revised, does not lessen any of the requirements associated
with either the radioactive waste annex building or the spent fuel pool therefore the probability of either accident
occurring is unchanged. The proposed amendment, as revised, does not change the consequences of the accident since
it does not affect the magnitude, detection, or mitigation of either accident scenario. Additionally, the ability
of the radioactive waste annex building and the spent fuel pool to withstand other applicable FSAR events, natural
phenomena, and fires is either unchanged from the existing licensing basis or is improved during the permanently
defueled condition. 
2. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
Maintaining the permanently defueled facility in accordance with the PDTS, as revised by the March 8, 1994 letter,
does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously considered. Most of the existing
plant systems and functions will not be operational in the permanently defueled condition since power operations
are prohibited and all of the fuel at Trojan is stored in the spent fuel pool. However, 





all structures, systems and components that are necessary for safe fuel handling and storage activities will be maintained
operable during the permanently defueled condition. The proposed PDTS, as revised, provide operation and surveillance
requirements and administrative controls which are sufficient to ensure that the required structures, systems
and components will be maintained operable in the permanently defueled condition. 


3. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in
a margin of safety. 

The proposed PDTS, as revised by the March 8, 1994 letter, are sufficient to ensure no reduction in a margin of safety,
in part, because of the reduced range of design basis accidents against which the facility must be protected now that
the facility is prohibited from power operations and is permanently defueled. Only a fire in the radioactive waste
storage facility or a fuel handling accident are relevant during the permanently defueled condition. The margins
of safety for both of these accidents will remain the same or improve by maintaining the facility in accordance with
the proposed PDTS, as revised. None of the other Chapter 15 FSAR accidents are applicable since power operations are
prohibited and the facility is permanently defueled. Additionally, the margins of safety for other applicable FSAR
events, natural phenomena, and fires are either unchanged from the existing licensing basis or is improved during
the permanently defueled condition.

 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis, and based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request, as revised by
the March 8, 1994 supplement, involves no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendments request:

 October 14, 1993



Description of amendments request: 

The proposed changes would revise surveillance test intervals and allowed outage times for reactor trip system (RTS)
and engineered safety feature actuation system (ESFAS) instrumentation. The proposed changes would also revise
certain RTS/ESFAS functions, minimum channels operable, channel calibration, and channel functional test requirements
to ensure they are in concert with the Westinghouse Standard Technical Specifications and WCAP-10271, ``Evaluation
of Surveillance Frequencies and Out-of-Service Times for Reactor Protection Instrumentation Systems.'' 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




(1) The proposed changes to the RTS/ESFAS STIs [surveillance test intervals] and AOTs [allowed outage times], and
Minimum Channels Operable, Channel Calibration and Channel Functional Test requirements will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The determination that the result of the proposed changes associated with STI and AOT are within all acceptable criteria
[that] has been established in the SERs [Safety Evaluations] prepared for WCAP-10271; WCAP-10271 Supplement
1; WCAP-10271 Supplement 2; and WCAP-10271 Supplement 2, Revision 1. Implementation of the proposed
changes results in a slight increase in the Reactor Trip System yearly unavailability. This slight increase, which
is primarily due to less frequent surveillance, results in a slight increase in Core Damage Frequency (CDF) and public
health risk. The values determined by the WOG and presented in the WCAP for the increase in CDR were verified by Brookhaven
National Laboratory (BNL) as part of an audit and sensitivity analyses for the NRC staff. Based on the small value of
the increase compared to the range of uncertainty in the CDF, the increase is considered acceptable. Increasing STIs
and AOTs is not expected to affect the probability or consequences of previously evaluated accidents.

The change associated with the Minimum Channel Operable requirement for the RTS Turbine Trip by Turbine Throttle
Valve Closure provides additional operating flexibility based on the Westinghouse Standard Technical Specifications,
Revision 5. The new action statement ensures that any inoperable channel is placed in trip, and the remaining operable
channels fulfill the necessary reactor trip diversity function. The change associated with the ESFAS Minimum Channel
Operable requirement for Containment Pressure_High-High assures that the Technical Specifications reflect the
correct as-built design actuation logic while ensuring the function continues to meet the single failure criteria.
The proposed change to the turbine trip reactor trip function Channel Calibration reflects the assumptions in WCAP-10271
and current Farley calibration practices. The proposed change to the safety injection ESF [engineered safety feature]
input for the reactor trip Channel Functional Test is consistent with the assumptions in WCAP-10271 and current
Farley surveillance testing practices. The proposed changes to the ESF permissive interlocks Channel Calibration
and Channel Functional Test requirements are in concert with the NRC SER for WCAP-10271 and Farley surveillance
practices. The proposed change to the ESF manual initiation functions Channel Functional Test reflects the proper
surveillance requirements for a Westinghouse Solid State Protection System (SSPS). The proposed changes to these
RTS/ESFAS Channel Calibration and Channel Functional Test requirements are also consistent with Westinghouse
Standard Technical Specifications.

(2) The proposed changes will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The proposed changes to not involve hardware changes and do not result in a change in the manner in which
the RTS/ESFAS provides plant protection or the manner in which surveillance testing is perform to demonstrate operability.
Therefore, a new or different kind of accident will not occur as a result of these changes.

(3) The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed changes do not alter
the manner in which safety limits, limiting safety system setpoints, or limiting conditions for operation are determined.
The impact of reduced testing, other than as addressed above, is to allow a longer time interval over which instrument
uncertainties (e.g., drift) may act. Evaluations have been performed to assure that the plant setpoints properly
account for these instrument uncertainties over the longer time interval. RTS diversity is still provided by the
Turbine Throttle Valve closure logic circuits. Steam Line Isolation diversity continues to be provided by the ESFAS
Containment Pressure_High-High. Changes to certain RTS/ESFAS Channel Calibration and Channel Functional Test
surveillances clarify what tests are required and when the tests are performed. Implementation of the proposed changes
is expected to result in an overall improvement in safety as noted below.

a. Less frequent testing will potentially result in fewer inadvertent reactor trips and ESF component actuation.


b. Longer allowed outage times provide for better assessments of problems and easier repairs, ultimately resulting
in better equipment performance. 

c. Less frequent distraction of the plant operator and shift supervisor to attend to and support instrumentation
testing will improve the effectiveness of the operating staff in monitoring and controlling plant operation.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The staff's review is
presented below.

The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because the proposed changes do not involve a change to the plant design or operation. The changes simply
involve the frequency at which testing of the instrumentation is performed and the AOT for instruments. There may
be a small increase in average instrument failure frequency as a result of increasing the surveillance interval.
However, the proposed changes will require that a check be made for the majority of instruments to assure that making
them inoperable for surveillance testing or repair does not result in a loss of function. This added check assures
that a loss of function has not occurred, or if it has, that the appropriate ACTION statement be entered promptly. Therefore,
these proposed changes do not result in a significant increase in either the probability or consequences of any accident
previously analyzed.

The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated because the proposed changes do not result in any change in the plant design or operation. The changes are
for increased AOT and decreased frequency of instrumentation testing. The instrumentation involved are those instruments
which sense plant problems and/or accidents, and then initiate systems or alarms to respond to the plant problem/accident.
The proposed changes do not modify any of the instruments, or the initiation logic formed by the instruments. Therefore,
no new or different type of an accident has been created.

The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because the small increase in average
instrument failure frequency is offset by safety benefits such as a reduction in the number of inadvertent test-induced
scrams, a reduction in wear due to excessive equipment test cycling, and better optimization of plant personnel resources.
In addition, the proposed changes will require that a check be made for the majority of instruments to assure that making
them inoperable for surveillance testing or repair does not result in a loss of function. This added check assures
that a loss of function has not occurred, or if it has, that the appropriate ACTION statement be entered promptly. Therefore,
these proposed changes do not result in a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff
proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

TU Electric Company, Docket Nos. 50-445 and 50-446, Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station, Units 1 and
2, Somervell County, Texas





Date of amendment request: 

November 15, 1993



Brief description of amendments: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station (CPSES) Units 1 and 2 technical specifications
to increase the maximum permitted power at which the post-refueling power ascension reactor coolant system (RCS)
flow verification can be performed. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated
accident.

The proposed change increases the power at which the verification of the Reactor Coolant System flow rate with a precision
heat balance can be performed. The only potentially relevant concern for this change is the possibility of having
insufficient flow to support the accident analyses at the higher (85%) power level. Power level and RCS flow are important
parameters in determining the severity of an event but have no impact on the initiation of an event or accident. Thus,
the change does not involve a significant increase in the probability of any previously analyzed accident.

Although accidents tend to be more severe at higher initial power levels, the acceptance criteria of the applicable
safety analyses continue to be met [even when the test is conducted at the higher power level]. Thus, the proposed change
would not involve an increase in the consequences of any previously analyzed accident.

2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

The proposed change merely increases the power at which the initial post-refueling startup verification of RCS flow
with a precision heat balance may be performed. Since the new power level is within the normal operating range of the
reactor, it does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed change increases the power which can be attained prior to verification of the Reactor Coolant System
flow with a precision heat balance. The power value is increased from 75% RTP [rated thermal power] to 85% RTP. An analysis
was performed which demonstrates that the safety analysis DNB [departure from nucleate boiling] limit will not be
exceeded if the initial power is 85% or less, even with a significant reduction in flow. A flow reduction significantly
different from the expected flow is highly unlikely, however, since RCS flow is verified by measurement of elbow tap
differential pressure prior to operation in Mode 1. This flow measurement, although less accurate than the precision
heat balance, is sufficient to assure adequate flow at 85% power. Adequate limitations on power level, F delta-H verification,
and the power range neutron flux-high setpoint are imposed during post-refueling power ascension to ensure that
if the RCS flow is not verified with a precision heat balance until 85% RTP, the results of the accident analyses would
remain valid.

The evaluation of the DNB-limited events, initiated from a power level of 85% RTP, considered the limitations imposed
during the power ascension. Based on this evaluation, it is concluded that, even though 85% RTP is a more severe initial
condition, the applicable event acceptance criteria would continue to be met; therefore, the proposed change does
not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

TU Electric Company, Docket Nos. 50-445 and 50-446, Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station, Units 1 and
2, Somervell County, Texas





Date of amendment request: 

March 30, 1994



Brief description of amendments: 

The proposed amendments would revise the Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station (CPSES) Units 1 and 2 Technical Specifications
to allow the use of an alternative method for verifying that the emergency diesel generator fuel oil meets requirements.




Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated
accident.





Either the current testing option, which remains valid for fuel oil with ASTM Color 5 or less, or the alternative testing
method, provide the necessary assurance that the water and sediment quantity in the new fuel oil is acceptable. As
the performance of the quantitative water and sediment test of ASTM-D1796-1968, maintains essentially the
same attribute qualities of the new fuel oil, there should not be any undetected degradation in the Diesel Generator
fuel oil supply.

Therefore, since the fuel oil supply will be maintained at its present quality level, there should be no increase in
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

As stated in (1) above, the proposed amendment only provides a quantitative method for the acceptability determination
of new Diesel Generator fuel oil. The proposed testing will continue to verify the high quality and acceptability
of the fuel oil supply. There should not be any possibility that a new or different kind of accident from those previously
evaluated is created.

3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The only margin associated with this amendment is the margin between the acceptance limit on water and sediment in
the fuel oil supply and the quantity of water and sediment that could impact Diesel Generator operation. The ``clear
and bright'' testing per ASTM-D4176-1982 and the proposed quantitative testing per ASTM-D1796-1968
are both written to detect and reject fuel oil containing water or sediment at essentially the same level. The margin
of safety to Diesel Generator impairment is therefore not reduced. This amendment does not involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears 





that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Union Electric Company, Docket No. 50-483, Callaway Plant, Unit 1, Callaway County, Missouri





Date of amendment request: 

February 21, 1992



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specifications Appendix B, Environmental Protection Plan (Non-radiological),
by removing Sections 2.3 and 4.3, ``Cultural Resources.'' Union Electric has developed and maintains a management
plan for the protection of cultural resources on the Callaway Plant site. The amendment request summarizes the plan
that provides the status and disposition of each portion of the current Appendix B sections related to cultural resources.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




The proposed change[s] do[es] not involve a significant hazards consideration because operation of Callaway Plant
in accordance with these change[s] would not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated (10 CFR
50.92(c)(1)).

The proposed changes are administrative in nature and have no impact on safety-related structures, systems or components.
Therefore, there is no impact on the probability of occurrence or the consequences of an accident or malfunction of
equipment previously evaluated.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated (10 CFR 50.92(c)(2)).

The proposed change[s] do[es] not affect any of the assumptions used in previous accident evaluations. All accidents
continue to be bounded by previous analyses and deletion of satisfied Environmental Protection Plan requirements
is administrative and will therefore not introduce the possibility of any new or different kind of accident.

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety (10 CFR 50.92(c)(3)).

The proposed changes are administrative and do not affect the margin of safety as defined in the basis for any Technical
Specification.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Union Electric Company, Docket No. 50-483, Callaway Plant, Unit 1, Callaway County, Missouri





Date of amendment request: 

July 16, 1993



Description of amendment request: 

The amendment would revise Technical Specifications 3/4.8.1.1 and 3/4.8.1.2, A. C. Sources, Operating and Shutdown.
The proposed revision changes the minimum required storage volume of the Emergency Fuel Oil storage and day tanks
from 85,300 gallons and 390 gallons to 80,400 gallons and 510 gallons. These changes are the result of inconsistencies
found by Union Electric, in the calculations and T/S Bases for tank capacities, while performing a self-initiated
Electrical Distribution System Functional Assessment (EDSFA). The Electrical Distribution System Functional
Inspection (EDSFI) performed by the NRC re-examined this issue and it was determined that NUREG-1431 provided
bases for the change to day tank level. This submittal is a T/S enhancement. 
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:




The proposed changes to Technical Specifications 3/4.8.1.1 and 3/4.8.1.2 do not involve a significant hazards consideration
because operation of Callaway Plant with these changes would not:

(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The current minimum required volume of the day tanks as given in T/S 3.8.1.1b.1 and 3.8.1.2b.1 is based on fuel oil with
a specific gravity value in the upper range of values allowed by T/S. Calculations made using fuel oil with a specific
gravity of 39 degrees API, which is the minimum allowed specific gravity, indicate a larger minimum required volume
is needed in the day tanks. The increased minimum required volume provides additional conservatism for the day tanks
to perform their intended safety function based on the possibility of using different specific gravity fuel oil.
The current minimum required volume of the storage tanks as given in T/S 3.8.1.1b.2 and 3.8.1.2b.2 was calculated
by using an overly conservative Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH) available calculation. The original calculation
assumed a static head was needed in order for the NPSH available to exceed the NPSH required and assure proper operation
of the fuel oil transfer pumps. Union Electric calculations have determined that the NPSH required for the transfer
pumps is maintained as long as the pump suction is submerged. Based on this calculation the minimum required volume
of the storage tanks can be reduced and the diesel generators can still achieve their required seven days of operation
at continuous rating plus an additional volume available to be used for testing.

(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

There is no new type of accident or malfunction being created and the method and manner of plant operation remains unchanged.
The safety design bases in the FSAR have not been altered, the requirement for continuous operation remains unchanged.

(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

There are no plant design changes involved and no changes are being made to the safety limits or safety system settings
that would adversely impact plant safety. The minimum required storage volumes of the day and storage tanks are being
changed based on calculations using conservative data.

Based on the above discussions, it has been determined that the requested Technical Specification revisions do not
involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident or other adverse condition over
previous evaluations; or create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident or condition over previous
evaluations; or involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Therefore, the requested license amendment
does not involve a significant hazards consideration.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Virginia Electric and Power Company, Docket Nos. 50-338 and 50-339, North Anna Power Station, Units No.
1 and No. 2, Louisa County, Virginia





Date of amendment request: 

February 25, 1994



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed change would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) for the North Anna Power Station, Units No. 1 and
No. 2 (NA-1&2). Specifically, the proposed change would modify the surveillance frequency of the nozzles
in the Quench Spray and the Recirculation Spray Systems at NA-1&2.

The proposed changes to the surveillance requirements for the nozzles in the Quench Spray System and Recirculation
Spray Systems are consistent with the intent of Generic Letter 93-05, ``Line-Item Technical Specifications
Improvement to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation,'' dated September 27, 1993,
which is to improve safety, decrease equipment degradation, and reduce unnecessary burden on personnel resources
by reducing testing requirements that are marginal to safety.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




Specifically, operation in accordance with the proposed Technical Specifications changes will not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed reduced testing frequency of the Spray Systems nozzles does not change the way the systems are operated
or the Spray Systems operability requirements. The proposed change to the surveillance frequency of safety equipment
has no impact on the probability of an accident occurrence nor can it create a new or different type of accident. NUREG-1366,
``Improvements to Technical Specifications Surveillance Requirements,'' dated December 1992, concluded that
the corrosion of stainless steel piping is negligible during the extended surveillance interval. Since the Spray
Systems are maintained dry there is no additional mechanism that could cause blockage of the spray nozzles. Thus,
the nozzles in the Spray Systems will remain operable during the ten year surveillance interval to mitigate the consequence
of an accident previously evaluated. To date, no clogging or blockage of the nozzles in the Spray [System] during the
five year surveillance tests [has] been observed at . . . North Anna. Testing of the Spray Systems nozzles
at the proposed reduced frequency will not increase the probability of occurrence of a postulated accident or the
consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed reduced frequency testing of the Spray Systems' nozzles does not change the way the Spray Systems are
operated. The reduced frequency of testing of the spray nozzles does not change plant operation or system readiness.
The reduced frequency testing of the Spray Systems' nozzles does not generate any new accident precursors. Therefore,
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously evaluated is not created by the proposed changes
in surveillance frequency of the Spray Systems nozzles.

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Reduced testing of the Spray Systems' nozzles does not change the way the Systems are operated or the Spray Systems'
operability requirement. NUREG-1366 concluded that the corrosion of stainless steel piping is negligible
during the extended surveillance interval. Since the Spray Systems are maintained dry there is no additional mechanism
that could cause blockage of the Spray Systems' nozzles. Thus, the proposed reduced testing frequency is adequate
to ensure spray nozzle operability. The 
surveillance requirements do not affect the margin of safety in that the operability requirements of the Spray Systems
remains unaltered. The existing safety analysis remains bounding. Therefore, no margins of safety are adversely
affected.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



Specifically, operation of Surry [Units 1 and 2] in accordance with the proposed Technical Specifications changes
will not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed reduced testing frequency of the Spray Systems' nozzles does not change the way the systems are operated

frequency will not increase the probability of occurrence of a postulated accident or the consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed reduced frequency testing of the Spray Systems' nozzles does not change the way the Spray Systems are

Washington Public Power Supply System, Docket No. 50-397, Nuclear Project No. 2, Benton County, Washington





Date of amendment request: 

February 17, 1994



Description of amendment request: 

The amendment proposes to modify the Technical Specifications (TS) to reflect management and organizational changes
at the Washington Public Power Supply System (the licensee) for operation of the WNP-2 facility. The proposed
changes would (1) modify the reporting responsibility of the quality assurance organization from the Managing Director
to the Assistant Managing Director, Operations (AMDO), and (2) modify the appointment authority for the Corporate
Nuclear Safety Review Board (CNSRB) from the Managing Director to the AMDO. These changes are proposed to reflect
the current designation of the AMDO as the licensee's designated official with corporate responsibility for overall
plant nuclear safety, and as the direct report for the CNSRB.

In addition, the proposed change would (1) delete the specific requirement for health physics/chemistry program
procedures, (2) modify the titles of two positions on the Plant Operations Committee (POC) to reflect revised organizational
titles, (3) modify the CNSRB quorum requirements from nine personnel to a minimum of nine personnel, and (4) delete
the requirement that the CNSRB Executive Secretary be designated from the CNSRB membership.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The NRC staff's review
is presented below:



1. Does the amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated?

All of the proposed changes are administrative in nature, and do not involve any change in the design or operation of
the plant. None of the changes affect any initiating events, nor do they affect plant response to postulated events
already analyzed. The proposed changes do not, therefore, affect the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

2. Does the amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?

The proposed changes do not affect the design, operation, maintenance, or testing of the plant. They do not, therefore,
create the possibility for any new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3. Does the amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?

The proposed changes do not affect any accident analyses, and do not, therefore, affect any of the margins of safety
affected by the design or operational limitations of the plant. The proposed changes do not, therefore, affect any
margin of safety.

Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes
to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, Docket No. 50-482, Wolf Creek 
Generating Station, Coffey County, Kansas





Date of amendment request: 

February 23, 1994



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment revises Technical Specification 3.8.1.1, AC Sources Operating, and 3.8.1.2, AC Sources
Shutdown, to increase the minimum volume of fuel oil required for the emergency diesel generator fuel oil day tanks.
Several other changes have been proposed to correct editorial errors related to previously issued amendments.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

The current minimum required volume of the day tanks as given in Technical Specifications 3.8.1.1 and 3.8.1.2 is based
on fuel oil with a specific gravity value in the upper range of values allowed by the technical specifications. Calculations
made using fuel oil with a specific gravity of 39 degrees API, which is the minimum allowed specific gravity, indicate
a larger minimum required volume is needed in the day tanks. The increased minimum required volume provides additional
conservatism for the day tanks to perform their intended safety function based on the possibility of using different
specific gravity fuel oil. The proposed change will not prevent the Emergency Diesel Generator fuel oil system from
performing its design function, nor require the system to be operated in a manner different than that for which it was
designed. Therefore, the proposed change will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

There is no new type of accident or malfunction being created and the method and manner of plant operation remains unchanged.
The safety design bases in the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) have not been altered, and current operating
requirements of the Emergency Diesel Generators remain unchanged. Thus, this change does not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The basis for the existing emergency fuel oil day tank level requirements is to ensure that sufficient fuel oil is available
to meet the operational requirements specified in ANSI N195-1976. This proposed change to the minimum required
storage volume of the day tanks is based on revised calculations performed in accordance with ANSI N195-1976
using conservative data. This proposed change will not change the operation of the plant. Thus, the proposed change
will continue to ensure the Emergency Diesel Generator operating requirements. There are no changes being made to
the safety limits or safety system settings that would adversely impact plant safety. Therefore, the proposed change
will not cause a reduction in the margin of safety.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, Docket No. 50-482, Wolf Creek Generating Station, Coffey County,
Kansas





Date of amendment request: 

February 24, 1994



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment revises Technical Specification 3.9.4, Containment Building Penetrations, to allow use
of temporary alternate closure methods for the emergency personnel escape lock and containment wall penetrations,
during alterations of the core or movement of irradiated fuel within the containment.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

The probability of occurrence of a previously evaluated accident is not increased because failure to maintain containment
closure is not an initiating condition for fuel handling an accident. The use of temporary alternate closure methods
for the emergency personnel escape lock and containment wall penetrations does not introduce any new potential accident
initiating condition during refueling operation.

The consequences of an accident previously evaluated is not increased because the use of 





temporary alternate closure methods for the emergency personnel escape lock and containment wall penetrations
will provide the assurance of containment closure during refueling activities. The ability of [the] containment
to restrict the release of any fission product radioactivity to the environment remains unchanged.



2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The failure of the temporary alternate closure methods for the emergency personnel escape lock and containment wall
penetrations during refueling will not result in a malfunction of any other plant equipment. The sole purpose of establishing
containment closure for refueling is to restrict the release of any fission product radioactivity in the event of
a fuel handling accident.

3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
The temporary alternate closure methods for the emergency personnel escape lock and containment wall penetrations
will provide the same assurance of containment closure during refueling for credible accident scenarios. The ability
of containment to restrict the release of any fission product radioactivity to the environment, should a fuel handling
accident occur, remains unchanged.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, Docket No. 50-482, Wolf Creek Generating Station, Coffey County,
Kansas





Date of amendment request: 

February 24, 1994



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment revises Technical Specification 4.7.1.2.1.a to require that the turbine-driven and motor-driven
auxiliary feedwater pumps be tested at least quarterly on a staggered test basis instead of the currently required
testing once per 31 days on a staggered test basis. In addition, the proposed changes would revise Technical Specification
Bases 3/4.7.7, Emergency Exhaust System_Auxiliary Building, and 3/4.9.13, Emergency Exhaust System_Fuel Building,
to eliminate the reference to the use of automatic control for the emergency exhaust system heaters.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The NRC staff's review is
presented below.

1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

This change only revises the surveillance requirement for the auxiliary feedwater pumps. The purpose of this surveillance
requirement is to prove that the pumps are operable. The longer test interval should result in greater availability
by reducing the rate of test induced failures which should offset any loss in reliability. The revised surveillance
requirement does not affect the probability of accident initiation. The operability of the pumps is maintained and
therefore the consequences of evaluated accidents is unaffected by the proposed change. The revised surveillance
frequency is consistent with the guidance issued in Generic Letter 93-05, ``Line-Item Technical Specifications
Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation.''

Changes to the emergency exhaust system technical specifications eliminate the words ``using automatic control''
associated with the humidity controlling heaters. These changes reflect the current method in which the fuel building
emergency exhaust system heaters are controlled in that humidity sensors are bypassed to allow continuous operation
of the heaters whenever the emergency exhaust system fans are operating. The proposed changes do not affect the probability
of initiating an accident previously evaluated. The ability of the emergency exhaust systems to mitigate the consequences
of an accident are likewise unaffected since the heaters remain available and operating to control humidity.

2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

Verification of pump operability is still maintained with the change to the frequency of the surveillance requirement.
No system configuration 
changes are being implemented in order to perform the surveillance testing and any potential accidents that may be
associated with the surveillance testing were previously considered. The changing of the surveillance frequency
does not introduce any additional failure modes for the auxiliary feedwater system.

The proposed revisions to the emergency exhaust system technical specifications are limited to the automatic control
of the humidity controlling heaters. The proposed change does not introduce any new potential challenges to fission
product barriers or any new failure modes which might prevent the emergency exhaust systems from fulfilling their
accident mitigating functions.

3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The inservice testing program will continue to ensure that auxiliary feedwater pumps operational readiness criteria
are consistent with the requirements of ASME Section XI. System performance surveillances will continue to be conducted
in accordance with the technical specifications. The proposed change does not significantly reduce the margin of
safety because the availability and reliability of the auxiliary feedwater system are not significantly decreased
and the heat removal requirements for the system are unchanged.

The proposed changes to the emergency exhaust system technical specifications affect the requirements to maintain
heater control in the automatic mode. The proposed changes do not decrease the exhaust systems' actual ability to
control humidity or alter the other functional requirements for the system. Therefore, the proposed change does
not significantly reduce any margin of safety related to the performance of the emergency exhaust systems.

Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff
proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Entergy Operations, Inc.; Partial Withdrawal of Application For Amendment To Facility Operating License


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has granted the request of Entergy Operations, Inc. (the
licensee), to partially withdraw its November 16, 1993, application for proposed amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF-38 for the Waterford Steam Electric Station, Unit 3, located in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana.
The amendment revised the Technical Specifications (TSs) to provide acceptable conditions for operation when:
(1) The core operating limits supervisory system (COLSS) is in service and neither control element assembly calculator
(CEAC) is operable and (2) the COLSS is out of service and either or both CEACs are operable.
The Commission had previously issued a Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 5, 1994 (59 FR 620). However, by supplemental letter dated April 5, 1994, the licensee partially withdrew
the proposed change pertaining to the increase of the required power operating limit reduction from 13 percent to
16 percent for limiting anticipated operations occurrences with both CEACs inoperable.
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated November 16, 1993, and the
licensee's letter dated April 5, 1994, which partially withdrew the application for license amendment. The above
documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the University of New Orleans Library, Louisiana Collection,
Lakefront, New Orleans, Louisiana 70122.

<DOCTITLE>Mr. Douglas D. Preston; Order Prohibiting Involvement in NRC-Licensed Activities (Effective Immediately)</DOCTITLE>


I



Mr. Douglas D. Preston was employed by the Berry Construction Company at the Iowa Electric Light and Power Company's
(IELPC or Licensee) Duane Arnold Energy Center where he was granted unescorted access. IELPC holds Facility License
DPR-49, issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR part 50 on February
22, 1974. The license authorizes IELPC to operate the Duane Arnold Energy Center located near Cedar Rapids, Iowa,
in accordance with the conditions specified therein.



II



Mr. Preston first applied for employment with Berry Construction Company and was subsequently granted unescorted
access to the Duane Arnold Energy Center on or about June 19, 1990, based in part on the representations he made on his
access authorization applications. One of the representations was that he had not been arrested and convicted for
any criminal offense other than minor traffic violations. The Licensee submitted fingerprint cards to the Federal
Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and subsequently was informed that Mr. Preston had a record of arrests, convictions,
and imprisonments prior to 1978. However, while waiting for the results of the FBI fingerprint check, Mr. Preston's
employment at the Duane Arnold Energy Center was terminated for a lack of work. Mr. Preston's deliberate false statements
on his access authorization application on or about June 19, 1990 were essentially the same as his 1993 false statements
(addressed below), but are not being cited in this Order as a violation because they were made before the effective
date of 10 CFR 50.5.

On June 21, 1993, Mr. Preston again applied for a position at the Duane Arnold Energy Center and was hired on June 21,
1993 by the Berry Construction Company as a laborer with responsibilities involving NRC-licensed activities. On
June 23, 1993, Mr. Preston filled out an access authorization application and again denied having a criminal history.
The Licensee granted Mr. Preston temporary unescorted access to the plant on or about July 15, 1993. On or about August
13, 1993, the Licensee received the results of a second FBI fingerprint check which again detailed Mr. Preston's criminal
history. Mr. Preston, when questioned by an IELPC investigator on August 13, at first denied having a criminal history
and then admitted that he had lied about his criminal history to gain employment in 1990 and again in 1993. He further
stated that he would lie again to gain employment in the future. The Licensee than revoked Mr. Preston's unescorted
access based on the deliberately false information regarding his criminal history on his access authorization application.



III



Based on the above Mr. Preston engaged in deliberate misconduct on or about June 23, 1993, by deliberately falsely
stating on the access authorization application that he had no criminal history for crimes other than minor traffic
offenses. The Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.5, in part, prohibit any employee of a contractor of a licensee
from literately submitting to the licensee information that the employee knows to be incomplete or inaccurate in
some respect material to the NRC. Mr. Preston's actions constitute a violation of 10 CFR 50.5(a). Information concerning
criminal history is material to the determination the licensee must make to meet 10 CFR 73.56(b)(2).



IV



The NRC must be able to rely on the Licensee, its contractors, and the licensee and contractor employees to comply with
NRC requirements, including the requirement to provide information that is complete and accurate in all material
respects. Mr. Preston's actions in deliberately providing false information to the Licensee constitute deliberate
violations of Commission regulations and his statement to the Licensee that he would do it again have raised serious
doubt as to whether he can be relied upon to comply with NRC requirements and to provide complete and accurate information
to the NRC in the future.

Consequently, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that nuclear safety activities within NRC jurisdiction
can be conducted in compliance with the Commission's requirements and that the health and safety of the public would
be protected if Mr. Preston were permitted to be engaged in the performance of licensed activities. Therefore, the
public health, safety and interest require that Mr. Preston be prohibited from being involved in the performance
of activities licensed by the NRC for a five year period. In addition, Mr. Preston is required to notify the NRC, for
an additional five year period, of his acceptance of employment in NRC-licensed activities so that appropriate inspections
can be performed. Furthermore, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I find that the significance of the deliberate misconduct
described above is such that the public health, safety and interest require that this Order be immediately effective.



V



Accordingly, pursuant to sections 103, 161b, 161i, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the
Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR 50.5, 

it is hereby ordered, effective immediately, that

A. Mr. Douglas D. Preston is prohibited from engaging in activities licensed by the NRC for five years from the date
of this Order. For the purposes of this Order, licensed activities include the activities licensed or regulated by:
(1) NRC; (2) an Agreement State, limited to the Licensee's conduct of activities within NRC jurisdiction pursuant
to 10 CFR 150.20; and (3) an Agreement State where the licensee is involved in the distribution of products that are
subject to NRC jurisdiction.

B. After the five year prohibition has expired as described in paragraph A above, Mr. Preston shall provide notice
to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, for acceptance
of any employment in licensed activity for an additional five year period.

The Regional Administrator, Region III, may, in writing, relax or rescind any of the above conditions upon demonstration
by Mr. Preston of good cause.



VI



In accordance with 10 CFR 2.202, Mr. Preston must, and any other person adversely affected by this Order may, submit
an answer to this Order, and may request a hearing within 30 days of the date of this Order. The answer may consent to this
Order. Unless the answer consents to this Order, the answer shall, in writing and under oath or affirmation, specifically
admit or deny each allegation or charge made in this Order and shall set forth the matters of fact and law on which Mr.
Preston or other person adversely affected relies and the reasons as to why the Order should not have been issued. Any
answer or request for a hearing shall be submitted to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ATTN: Chief,
Docketing and Service Section, Washington, DC 20555. Copies also shall be sent to the Director, Office of Enforcement,
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement
at the same address, to the Regional Administrator, Region III, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 801 Warrenville
Road, Lisle, Illinois 60532-4351, and to Mr. Preston, if the answer or hearing request is by a person other than
Mr. Preston. If a person other than Mr. Preston requests a hearing, that person shall set forth with particularity
the manner in which his interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall address the criteria set forth in 10 CFR
2.714(d).

If a hearing is requested by Mr. Preston or a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue
an Order designating the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing
shall be whether this Order should be sustained.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(c)(2)(i), Mr. Preston, or any person adversely affected by this Order, may in addition to
demanding a hearing, at the time that answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding officer to set aside the immediate
effectiveness of the Order on the ground that the Order, including the need for immediate effectiveness, is not based
on adequate evidence but on mere suspicion, unfounded allegations, or error.

In the absence of any request for a hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from
the date of this Order without further order or proceedings. An answer or a request for a hearing shall not stay the immediate
effectiveness of this order.

proposal would (1) establish a $250.00 non-refundable listing application fee, which upon acceptance by the Exchange
for listing would be applied toward the $750.00 listing fee; (2) provide a $1.50 per trade credit on all non-internalized
market orders ranging in size from 100 up to 2,500 shares; (3) reduce the specialist post clearing and cashiering fee
from $1375.00 to $500.00 per specialist book per month; (4) eliminate charges on pre-opening trades and trades in
CTA securities ranked above 1000; and (5) establish a security routing fee of $500.00 per month per BEACON User ID with
stocks being routed to that ID. For purpose of the market order credit, ``non-internalized'' shall mean all orders
directed to the Exchange in stocks in which the routing firm has no affiliation with or financial interest in the specialist
operation registered in those stocks. In addition, specialists will be charged a new fee of $.50 per trade for certain
market orders. The specific new language is as follows: [deleted language];

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organization; Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board </DOCTITLE>


April 7, 1994. 



In the matter of Self-regulatory organizations; order approving proposed rule change by the Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board relating to political contributions and prohibitions on municipal securities business and notice
of filing and order approving on an accelerated basis amendment No. 1 relating to the effective date and contribution
date of the proposed rule.

 


On January 12, 1994, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``MSRB'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR-MSRB-94-02) pursuant to section
19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder. The MSRB filed the proposal to adopt rules relating to political contributions and
prohibitions on municipal securities business. The Commission published notice to the proposal in the 

Federal Register 

on January 21, 1994.
 On February 4, 1994, the Commission extended the comment period for the proposal by 30 days, to March 11, 1994.
 On March 29, 1994, the MSRB filed an Amendment to the proposal relating to the proposal's effective date and contribution
date.
 








The Commission received 69 comment letters on the proposed rule change. Twenty-four commentators favor the proposal
and 33 oppose the proposal. Several commentators raise concerns without expressly favoring or opposing the proposal.
Several commentators that favor the proposal make recommendations to better enable municipal securities dealers
to comply with the proposal. The Commission has determined, for the reasons discussed below, to approve the proposed
rule change. 



I. Executive Summary 



The MSRB's proposed rule change relating to political contributions and prohibitions on municipal securities business
is intended to address practices known as ``pay to play.'' These practices typically involve payments in the form
of political contributions to help finance election campaigns of state or local officials or similar arrangements
with these officials. Widespread reports regarding the existence of such practices has fueled industry and regulatory
concerns. These practices directly affect municipal securities markets by increasing costs borne by issuers, dealers
and ultimately investors, by creating artificial barriers to competition, and by undermining underwriter and market
integrity. In 1993, state and local governments awarded negotiated underwriting contracts for the sale of more than
$250 billion of municipal bonds, approximately 80% of all municipal securities underwritings, to facilitate the
construction of schools, highways, hospitals, public housing, bridges, water and sewer systems, and other infrastructure
projects needed to serve public needs and spur local and regional economic growth.
 As of December 31, 1993, private investors, including households and mutual and money market funds, held more than
$850 billion in municipal securities, representing approximately 70% of outstanding municipal securities.
 While it is difficult to quantify the cost of fraudulent, unethical, and manipulative dealer selection practices,
at a minimum, these practices substantially undermine the integrity of the municipal securities market. Congress
recognized the importance of integrity in municipal securities financing when it directed the formation of the MSRB,
as part of the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, and authorized the MSRB to regulate the conduct of municipal securities
dealers to, among other things, prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, promote just and equitable
principles of trade, remove impediments to free and open trade, and protect investors and the public interest.

As the self-regulatory organization (``SRO'') charged with primary oversight of municipal securities dealers'
activities, the MSRB has proposed a series of measures designed to prevent ``pay to play'' practices in the awarding
of municipal securities business. These measures include a prohibition against municipal securities dealers,
conducting certain types of municipal securities business with an issuer if the dealer or affiliated persons, subject
to exceptions, made political contributions to officials of the issuer who could influence the awarding of that business.
The measures also include separate provisions requiring municipal securities dealers to maintain records and to
disclose aggregate information to facilitate compliance and examinations with the goal of promoting investor confidence
in the integrity of the municipal securities market. As discussed below, the Commission believes that the proposal
is consistent with the Act and will advance the goals of the Act.



II. Background



The market for municipal securities is characterized by great diversity and high volume and comprises an estimated
50,000 issuers including state governments, cities, towns, counties, and special subdivisions, such as special
purpose districts and public authorities.
 There are approximately 1.3 million municipal securities issues outstanding, representing over $1.2 trillion
in securities.
 In 1993, 17,000 new issues took place with a record value of $335 billion.
 As discussed below, negotiated underwritings have become the predominate method of underwriter selection. The
MSRB's proposal is designed to address abuses involving political contributions inherent in using negotiated underwriting
as a method of underwriter selection.







A. Increasing Use of Negotiated Underwritings



The types of securities generally issued by municipalities include general obligation bonds (secured by the full
faith and credit and general taxing power of the issuer), revenue bonds (secured by the revenues of a particular project),
and conduit bonds (securities issued to finance a project that is to be used in the trade or business of a third party,
typically a private corporation or non-profit entity). At one time general obligation bonds were most prevalent.
Today, however, most offerings consist of revenue bonds. During the past few years, the municipal bond market also
has experienced a proliferation of complex derivative products.

<TEXT>
 

Although competitive bidding traditionally has been used for public financing,
 in recent years negotiated underwritings have become much more common.
 in 1993, negotiated underwritings accounted for approximately 80% of all long-term municipal bond offerings.








Competitive bidding offers the public some protection against the exertion of inappropriate influence on public
officials by municipal underwriters. When bidding is done competitively and publicly, there is less possibility
of collusion and political patronage. Because the competitive process offers all potential bidders equal opportunity
to be awarded the deal, bidders must compete with one another based on the pricing of the issue and the willingness to
accept market risk.

<TEXT>
 

In contrast to competitive underwritings, negotiated underwritings present greater risk of abuse in the underwriter
selection process.
 Issuers may become involved not only in selecting the lead underwriter, but also in controlling other provisions
of the distribution. Selection may be based on nonmeritorious considerations, creating a genuine risk that underwriters
will be selected on the basis of political influence rather than the quality of the underwriter's services in distributing
the securities.







B. ``Pay to Play''




Recent reports regarding ``pay to play'' have raised concerns about the practices municipal securities dealers
employ to obtain municipal securities business. There have been numerous reported instances where registered municipal
securities dealers, their employees, and related parties, allegedly have made payments, political contributions,
or entered into business ventures with political figures apparently to obtain the underwriting business of municipal
securities issuers. Specific abuses have been alleged in several state and local governments including Alabama,
 California,
 Colorado,
 the District of Columbia,
 Florida,
 Illinois,
 Kentucky,
 Massachusetts,
 Michigan,
 New Jersey,
 New York,

 Ohio,
 Oklahoma,
 and Wisconsin.
 The widespread nature of the complaints concerning abuses has received considerable attention from Congress, the
Commission, the MSRB, the securities industry, the media, and the public, reflecting concerns regarding the integrity,
fairness, and sound operation of the municipal securities market.

C. Regulation of Municipal Securities Underwritings 



It appears that ``pay to play'' practices are considered by many municipal securities dealers to be an ordinary cost
associated with obtaining municipal underwriting business.
 The widespread perception of such practices calls into question the integrity of the municipal securities market
and the business practices some municipal underwriters utilize in order to obtain underwriting contracts. Several
reports have suggested that the greatest cost of improper contributions is the cost to investors, taxpayers, and
the public at large.








As a result of reports alleging improper payments regarding the New Jersey Turnpike refunding, in May 1993, Congress
requested the Commission, the MSRB, and the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'') to review the
adequacy of regulation and oversight of the municipal securities market.








This culminated in the Division's 

Municipal Securities Report,


 and Congressional hearings on the municipal securities market held on September 9, 1993. The 

Municipal Securities Report

 recommended that ``pay to play'' contributions be addressed promptly.
 The Staff stated that an MSRB proposal to require disclosure of political contributions and limiting campaign contributions
for the purpose of obtaining underwriting business represented a positive first step to address the misuse of political
contributions.








The MSRB's efforts to examine the role of political contributions in the underwriting process pre-date recent public
interest in the issue. In August 1991, the MSRB published a notice expressing concern that the process of selecting
an underwriting team should not be influenced by political contributions, and encouraged underwriters, and state
and local governments to maintain the integrity of the underwriter selection process.
 In May 1993, the MSRB issued a press release noting continued concern by the MSRB, industry members, and others regarding
political contributions.
 







In August 1993, the MSRB published for comment draft rule G-37 (``August 1993 draft rule'').
 Although the majority of commentators supported the MSRB proposal, none gave unqualified support. After considering
the commentators' concerns and suggestions at its November and December 1993 meetings, the MSRB proposed the instant
rule change.

Some state officials and politicians have advocated or introduced legislation aimed at abuses resulting from political
contributions and have made attempts to reform the municipal securities underwriter selection process.
 Voluntary industry efforts also are underway to reduce the presence of inappropriate political influence peddling.
On October 18, 1993, seventeen municipal securities dealers agreed to adopt a ``Statement of Initiative,'' providing
the political contributions made, in any manner, for the purpose of influencing the awarding of municipal finance
business should be prohibited. To date, over 50 firms have agreed to adhere to the Statement of Initiative.







While the Commission views the voluntary efforts of those firms adhering to the Statement of Initiative as laudable,
these actions represent only a first step. The MSRB's proposed rule change marks a second step: industry-wide reform
intended to respond to the detrimental effects of conflicts of interest.



III. Description



The proposed rule change would establish industry-wide restrictions and requirements aimed at preventing fraudulent
and manipulative practices, promoting just and equitable principles of trade, removing impediments to free and
open trade, and protecting investors and the public interest. The MSRB's proposal is intended to address the real
as well as perceived abuses resulting from ``pay to play'' practices in the municipal securities market. The proposal
is a comprehensive scheme composed of several separated requirements affecting municipal securities dealers,
including limitations on business activities triggered by political contributions, limitations on solicitation
and coordination of political contributions, and dealer recordkeeping and disclosure.

A. Rule G-37_``Pay to Play'' Restrictions



1. Business Disqualification Provision



Proposed rule G-37 will prohibit brokers, dealers and municipal securities dealers (``dealers'') from engaging
in municipal securities business with an issuer within two years after proscribed contributions made by (1) the dealer,
(2) any municipal finance professional associated with the dealer, or (3) any political action committee (``PAC'')
controlled by the dealer or any such associated municipal finance professional, to an official of the issuer who can,
directly or indirectly, influence the awarding of municipal securities business. ``Municipal securities business''
includes certain dealer activities such as the purchase of a primary offering of municipal securities from the issuer
on other than a competitive bid basis (

i.e.

 acting as a managing underwriter or as a syndicate member in negotiated underwritings), and acting as a financial
advisor, consultant, placement agent, or negotiated remarketing agent.
 The proposal defines an ``official of an issuer'' as any incumbent, candidate or successful candidate for elective
office of the issuer, which office is directly or indirectly responsible for, or can influence the outcome of, the
hiring of a dealer for municipal securities business. This includes any issuer official, incumbent or candidate
(or successful candidate) who has influence over the awarding of municipal securities business. ``Contributions''
include any gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value made: (1) For the purpose of
influencing any election of any official of a municipal securities issuer for federal, state,
 or local office; (2) for payment or reduction of debt incurred in connection with any election; or (3) for transition
or inaugural expenses incurred by the successful candidate for state or local office.






Thus, contributions to certain state-wide executive or legislative officials will affect the eligibility of the
firm to engage in municipal securities business.
 The proposal applies to contributions made on or after April 25, 1994.







The proposal's disqualification provision also would be triggered by contributions from employees of dealers,
defined as ``municipal finance professionals, '' are primarily engaged in municipal securities business. The proposal
exempts contributions made by municipal finance professionals of $250 or less per election to each official for whom
the individual is entitled to vote. The proposal defines the term ``municipal finance professional'' to mean:

(1) Any associated person primarily engaged in municipal securities representative activities, as defined in rule
G-3(a)(i);
 





(2) Any associated person who solicits municipal securities business;

(3) Any direct supervisor of such persons up through and including, in the case of a dealer other than a bank dealer,
the chief executive officer or similarly situated official and, in the case of a bank dealer, the officer or officers
designated by the board of directors of the bank as responsible for the day-to-day conduct of the bank's municipal
securities dealer activities, as required pursuant to rule G-1(a); or

(4) Any member of the dealer executive or management committee or similarly situated officials, if any (or, in the
case of a bank dealer, similarly situated officials in the separately identifiable department or division of the
bank, as defined in rule G-1).






Family members are not specifically included within the definition of municipal finance professional. The proposal,
however, prohibits a dealer and any municipal finance professional from doing any act indirectly which would result
in a violation of the proposed rule if done directly by the dealer or municipal finance professional. This is intended
to prevent dealers from funnelling funds or payments through other persons or entities to circumvent the proposal's
requirements. For example, a dealer would violate the proposal if it does business with an issuer after contributions
were made to an issuer official from or by associated persons, family members of associated persons, consultants,
lobbyists, attorneys, other dealer affiliates, their employees or PACs, or other persons or entities as a means to
circumvent the rule. A dealer also would violate the rule by doing business with an issuer after providing money to
any person or entity when the dealer knows that the money will be given to an official of an issuer who could not receive
the contribution directly from the dealer without triggering the rule's prohibition on business.

<PARENT> FR940413-2-00070 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The proposal will not restrict personal volunteer work by municipal finance professionals in political campaigns
other than soliciting or coordinating contributions. However, if resources of the dealer are used or expenses are
incurred by the municipal finance professional in personal volunteer work, the value of the resources or expenses
must be included in determining whether the dealer is restricted from future negotiated underwritings involving
that issuer or whether the municipal finance professional exceeded the $250 limitation.



2. Solicitation Restriction



The proposal also will prohibit dealers from soliciting contributions on behalf of officials of issuers with which
the dealer is engaging or seeking to engage in municipal securities business.
 This will prevent dealers from engaging in municipal securities business with issuers if they engage in any kind of
fund-raising activities for officials of the issuers that may influence the underwriter selection process. This
prohibition on solicitation and coordination also applies to municipal finance professionals. The proposal prohibits
municipal finance professionals from soliciting contributions to an official of an issuer with which the dealer
engages or is seeking to engage in municipal securities business and from coordinating contributions.





B. Disclosure and Recordkeeping



The proposal would establish disclosure and recordkeeping requirements to facilitate enforcement of rule G-37's
``pay to play'' restrictions and, independently, to function as a public disclosure mechanism to enhance the integrity
of and public confidence in municipal securities underwritings. Thus, although the disclosure and recordkeeping
provisions will generally supplement the ``pay to play'' restrictions, the purposes served by these provisions
are distinct from, and not dependent on, the business disqualification or solicitation restriction provisions.



1. Rule G-37



Proposed rule G-37 will require dealers to disclose to the MSRB on Form G-37 certain information about
political contributions, as well as other summary information, to facilitate public scrutiny of political contributions
in the context of the municipal securities business of a dealer. Contributions to be reported include those to officials
of issuers and political parties of states and political subdivisions made by the dealer, any municipal finance professional,
any executive officer, and any PAC controlled by the dealer or by any municipal finance professional.
 Only contributions over $250 by municipal finance professionals and executive officers are required to be disclosed.
The proposal does not require dealers to disclose the names of individual municipal finance professionals and executive
officers.





The proposal requires that dealers report on Form G-37 by state: (1) The name and title, (including any city/county/state
or other political subdivision) of each official of an issuer and political party receiving contributions; (2) the
total number and dollar amount of contributions made by the dealer, dealer controlled PACs, and associated municipal
finance professionals, and (3) other identifying information as required by Form G-37. Dealers also will be
required to disclose issuers with which the dealer has engaged in municipal securities business during the reporting
period, along with the type of municipal securities business and the name, company, role and compensation arrangement
of any person employed by the dealer to obtain or retain municipal securities business from the issuers. The reports
are required to be made on Form G-37 and to be submitted to the MSRB in accordance with rule G-37 filing procedures,
quarterly, by dates determined by the MSRB.

The MSRB will include information reported on Form G-37 in its electronic library system, the Municipal Securities
Information Library (``MSIL''). The MSRB will develop appropriate filing procedures to allow for public access
to the information, as well as indexing, and record storage.


2. Rules G-8 and G-9


The proposal will amend rules G-8 and G-9 on recordkeeping and record retention regarding political contributions.
The proposed amendment to rule G-8 will require a dealer to maintain a list of: (1) Names, titles, city/county
and state of residence of all associated municipal finance professionals; (2) names, titles, city/county and state
of residence of all executive officers of the dealer; (3) the states in which the dealer is engaging or is seeking to
engage in municipal securities business; (4) every issuer with which municipal securities business has been conducted
during the current year, as well as the previous two years and, where applicable, the name, company, role and compensation
arrangement of any person employed by the dealer to obtain or retain municipal securities business with the issuer;
and (5) all contributions, direct or indirect, to officials of issuers and to political parties of states and political
subdivisions made by the dealer, each dealer-controlled PAC, and each associated municipal finance professional
and executive officer.
 The records required pursuant to the proposal apply to contributions made or business engaged in beginning April
25, 1994.






The proposal does not require the dealer to maintain a list of contributions by its municipal finance professionals
or executive officers that are made: (1) To officials for whom the person is entitled to vote, provided such contributions
do not exceed $250 to each issuer official, per election; or (2) to political parties for the state and political subdivision
in which the person is entitled to vote, provided the contributions do not exceed $250 per party, per year. The proposal
also does not require dealers to maintain a list of contributions by any other employees, affiliate companies and
their employees, spouses of covered employees, or any other person or entity unless the contributions were directed
by persons or entities subject to proposed rule G-37.
The proposed amendment to rule G-9 requires dealers to maintain, for a six-year period, those records required
to be made pursuant to the proposed amendment to rule G-8.

IV. Summary of Comments


The Commission received 69 comment letters on the proposal. A separate summary of comments was prepared and is available
in the public file. The Discussion section of this order addresses specific issues addressed by the commentators.


V. Discussion


The MSRB's rule proposal seeks to end ``pay to play'' abuses in municipal securities underwritings. The MSRB has determined
that the most effective means of accomplishing this goal is through adoption of several provisions consisting, as
described above, of a business disqualification provision, a solicitation restriction and disclosure and recordkeeping
requirements. These provisions reflect well-established methods for dealing with conflicts of interest and other
instances where improper influence is used to secure an unmerited benefit.
The Commission believes that the MSRB's proposal is tailored to accomplish its stated goals with minimal disruption
in the municipal securities industry and the state and local political process to which that industry is linked. The
Commission agrees with the MSRB that its proposal represents an appropriate response to a compelling problem and,
therefore, has determined to approve the proposed rule change.


A. Statutory Standard


The proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act, and in particular, with sections 15B(b)(2)
(C) and (G) of the Act.
 Section 15B(b)(2)(C) authorizes the MSRB to adopt rules designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and
practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons
engaged in regulating transactions in municipal securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism
of a free and open market in municipal securities and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. Section
15B(b)(2)(G) authorizes the MSRB to adopt rules that prescribe the records to be made and kept by municipal securities
dealers and the periods for which such records shall be preserved. Because the MSRB's rules are to be preventive in
nature, Section 15B defines the scope of the MSRB's authority in terms of purposes rather than subject matters. This
authority provides the MSRB with flexibility to deal with future problems in the municipal securities industry.
 Thus, Section 15B provides the MSRB broad rulemaking authority to implement its enumerated purposes.

1. Prevent Fraudulent and Manipulative Acts and Practices



The Commission and the MSRB have a significant interest in preventing fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,
as well as the appearance of fraud and manipulation, in the municipal securities market. One of the principal goals
of Section 15B is to address threats to the integrity of the municipal securities market.
 Underwriters perform essential functions in offerings by structuring the offering and preparing disclosure documents
that form the basis of marketing the offering to the public.
 If underwriter selection is swayed by political contributions or influence, underwriters may be chosen based on
their history of contributions or political contacts, rather than their expertise or competence.






Several commentators contend that reports of abuse are unsubstantiated,
 or view the issue as one of voter confidence and campaign reform, rather than investor protection.
 The Commission believes, however, that ``pay to play'' practices may damage the municipal securities market in several
ways. If political influence is the determinative factor in the choice of municipal securities dealers as underwriters
in an offering, the underwriter selected may be less likely or competent to perform a reasonable investigation of
statements made by the issuer in connection with the offering.
 A decrease in the credit quality of the issue after it has been sold could have a significant adverse impact on investors,
and the underwriter's investigation might reveal information that bears directly on the issuer's future ability
to meet interest and principal payment obligations on a timely basis.







``Pay to play'' also undermines the integrity of municipal securities underwriting. The mere perception of political
influence in underwriter selection diminishes investor confidence in an underwriter's willingness to faithfully
fulfill its obligations to the investing public. The Statement of Initiative itself attests to the prevalence of
industry concerns regarding the effects of these practices on the integrity of the municipal securities market and
underwriters.

The perception of conflicts of interest is also damaging to investor confidence. Although some commentators suggest
that investor confidence has not been affected by ``pay to play'' practices,
 the Commission, relying on its own expertise as well as the judgment of the MSRB, believes that the widespread reports
of abuse adversely affect investor confidence, and that the MSRB's proposal will help to strengthen the integrity
of the underwriting process and will help to restore and maintain investor confidence.

2. Perfect the Mechanism of a Free and Open Market



As discussed above, several reports have indicated that ``pay to play'' practices are considered by many municipal
securities underwriters to be an ordinary cost of doing business. Because of great competitive pressures to obtain
business, municipal securities firms and the offering process are susceptible to abusive political contribution
practices. ``Pay to play'' practices raise artificial barriers to competition for those firms that either cannot
afford or decide not to make political contributions. Moreover, if ``pay to play'' is the determining factor in the
selection of an underwriting syndicate, an official may not necessarily hire the most qualified underwriter for
the issue. The proposal makes clear to municipal securities dealers and to officials of issuers that ``pay to play''
practices should no longer be employed to obtain municipal securities business. The proposal will further merit-based
competition between municipal securities dealers and, thus, will remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism
of a free and open market for municipal securities.



3. Promote Just and Equitable Principles of Trade



The proposal will promote just and equitable principles of trade. One of the primary principles of section 15B is to
raise the level of conduct in the municipal securities industry.
 ``Pay to play'' practices undermine these principles since underwriters working on a particular issuance may be
assigned similar roles, and take on equivalent risks, but be given different allocations of bonds to sell_resulting
in differing profits_based on their political contributions or contacts. The MSRB, under the Commission's supervision,
was given primary rulemaking authority to regulate the conduct of municipal securities dealers by adopting rules
to promote just an equitable principles of trade. In particular, the MSRB is obligated to assure that municipal securities
dealers observe high professional standards in their activities with the public. The Statement of Initiative demonstrates
the significance with which municipal securities dealers address reports of abuse in the municipal securities market.
The proposal will extend the goals of the Statement of Initiative to all municipal securities dealers attempting
to obtain municipal securities business.





4. Foster Cooperation and Coordination in Regulating Municipal Securities Transactions



The proposal will foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating transactions in municipal
securities. The proposal's disclosure and recordkeeping requirements will aid the Commission, the MSRB, and the
NASD to oversee enforcement of and dealer compliance with the proposal.



5. Records and Record Retention



The proposal's record and record retention requirements are consistent with section 15B(b)(2)(G) of the Act which
authorizes the MSRB to adopt rules that prescribe the records to be made and kept by municipal securities dealers and
the periods for which such records shall be preserved. As discussed above, the proposal's record and record retention
requirements, along with its prohibitions on municipal securities business, are designed to prevent ``pay to play''
practices in the awarding of municipal securities business.



B. First Amendment Guarantee of Free Speech



Several commentators believe that the proposal's prohibitions on political contributions impermissibly infringe
on the First Amendment guarantees of freedom of speech and association,
 and constitutional guarantees of equal protection.
 These commentators believe that although municipal bond business should not be a ``pay back'' for political contributions,
the proposal restricts the ability of municipal securities underwriters and their employees to demonstrate support
for state and local officials.

<DOCNO> FR940413-2-00152 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940413-2-00070 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In light of the Commission's approval and enforcement of MSRB's rules, the Commission is sensitive to and has carefully
considered these constitutional concerns in reviewing the proposed rule change.
 The Commission acknowledges that the business disqualification provision may affect the propensity of municipal
securities underwriters to make political contributions. Although political contributions involve both speech
and associational rights protected by the First Amendment, a ``limitation on the amount that any one person or group
may contribute to a candidate or political committee entails only a marginal restriction upon the contributor's
ability to engage in free communication.''
 Even a significant interference with rights protected by the First Amendment may be justified by a sufficiently compelling
government interest so long as the interference is closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of those protected
rights.








Prevention of fraud and manipulation and the appearance of fraud and manipulation are compelling government interests.
The MSRB's proposal is in the context of a closely regulated industry and is directly relevant to the concerns of the
regulatory scheme. The MSRB's interests in seeking approval of the proposed rule change_the eradication of ``pay
to play'' practices and other 

quid pro quo 

arrangements_are precisely the kind of interests which have been deemed sufficiently compelling to justify restrictions
on political contributions.
 As discussed above, ``pay to play'' arrangements can have detrimental effects on the municipal securities markets;
the widespread perception that these practices are commonplace undermines the integrity of the market and diminishes
investor confidence. Moreover, the restrictions inherent in the MSRB's proposed rule change are in the nature of
conflict of interest limitations which are particularly appropriate in cases of government contracting and highly
regulated industries. Unlike general campaign financing restrictions, such as certain provisions of the Federal
Election Campaign Act, which seek to combat unspecified forms of undue influence and political corruption, conflict
of interest provisions, such as the MSRB's proposal, are tied to a contributor's business relationship with governmental
entities and are intended to prevent fraud and manipulation.







As previously noted, the Commission believes that the MSRB's proposed rule change is closely tailored to accomplish
its goal of preventing fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices that stem from 

quid pro quo 

arrangements and minimizes any undue burdens on the protected speech and associational rights of municipal securities
dealers and municipal finance professionals. The proposed rule change is narrowly crafted in terms of the conduct
it prohibits, the persons who are subject to the restriction, and the circumstances in which it is triggered.






The proposal is limited to contributions to officials of municipal issuers who can influence the hiring of a dealer
in connection with negotiated offerings. The restrictions are triggered only in situations where a business relationship
exists or will be established in the near future between the municipal securities dealer and a municipal issuer. Most
employees and affiliates of dealers are not covered by the proposal, and the dealer's municipal finance professionals
will be able to avail themselves of a personal contribution exception of up to $250, individually, with respect to
officials for whom they are eligible to vote. The proposal does not restrict uncoordinated independent expenditures
in support of candidates or political views. Moreover, because the contribution limitations take the form of a business
disqualification, the proposal does not flatly prohibit individuals from making, or prevent candidates from receiving
contributions. In addition, the proposal does not, as some commentators suggest, restrict the ability of municipal
securities underwriters and their employees to demonstrate support for state and local officials. Underwriters
and their employees may continue to contribute in other ways in political campaigns that do not involve soliciting
or coordinating contributions.

The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is a necessary and appropriate measure to prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and practices and the appearance of fraud and manipulation in the municipal securities market
by eliminating ``Pay to play'' arranged underwritings. The proposal represents a balanced response to allegations
of corruption in the municipal securities market; it provides specific prohibitions to help ensure that underwriter
selection is based on expertise, not on the amount of money given to a particular candidate for office.





C. Municipal Securities Dealers: Small Firms and Minority and Women Owned Firms








Several commentators believe that the proposal will disadvantage small, regional municipal securities firms and
firms owned by minorities or women.
 Because larger firms may have more employees that may be eligible to use the 

de minimis 

exemption, these commentators believe that the proposal will provide larger firms an unfair advantage.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940413-2-00154 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940413-2-00070 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission believes that the proposal will not have a disproportionate effect on minority or women-owned firms
or on small and regional firms. The proposal clearly does not prevent local and state officials from selecting minority
or women-owned municipal securities dealers for participation in municipal securities issuances.
 Moreover, the proposal will apply equally to all municipal securities dealers seeking to obtain municipal securities
underwriting business. The Commission is not aware of any evidence indicating that the proposed rule change will
disproportionately affect minority or women-owned firms, or smaller and regional firms vis-a-vis large dealers.
The Commission rejects the notion that campaign contributions are a unique and essential business development mechanism
for small, regional, or minority and women-owned firms. As a practical matter, the proposal leaves open all legitimate
marketing practices which firms, both large and small, may use to gain underwriting business such as sales presentations,
seminars, and marketing documents. Moreover, the Commission believes that the costs of incidental, unintended
effects, if any, are far outweighed by the benefits of restricting ``pay to play'' practices. 





D. Effect on Women and Minority Candidates



Some commentators suggest that the proposal will adversely affect women and minority candidates for state and local
office, or will inhibit the ability of municipal securities professionals to volunteer for public service.
 The basis for this contention is uncertain, but the proposal is clearly not intended to affect any particular candidate
or identifiable group of candidates in an adverse manner. As noted before, the restrictions relate only to those situations
where contributions are directed to an official of a municipal issuer with which a dealer might do business. It does
not prevent other forms of indirect financial support for a candidate, such as contributions to political action
committees that are not controlled by the dealer or its municipal finance professionals, or independent expenditures.







E. Candidates for Federal Office



Several commentators also suggest that the proposal should apply to contributions made to officials of or candidates
for federal office.
 Several commentators raise concerns that the proposal will restrict contributions to state and local officials
running for federal office, without a similar limitation on contributions to the incumbent federal office holder.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940413-2-00155 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940413-2-00070 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission believes that it is not necessary to extend the proposal to include contributions to candidates for
federal office. The proposal addresses abusive political contributions to officials of issuers who may influence
the selection of municipal securities underwriters. Because federal office holders do not influence the underwriter
selection process, the Commission believes that it would not be appropriate to include federal candidates under
the rule's requirements.

By the same token, the Commission also believes that any resulting hardship to candidates for federal office who are
currently local officials is not a reason for eliminating these requirements. The MSRB cannot overlook potential
conflicts of interest solely because there are candidates for the same federal office who do not face the same conflicts.
In any event, the resulting burden to current local officials does not appear to be significant. Generally, municipal
underwriters play a less significant role as contributors in federal elections. Moreover, under federal law there
exist general contribution restrictions that limit the amount of contributions that other candidates are able to
obtain from municipal securities dealers and municipal finance professionals.






F. Municipal Securities Dealer Affiliates



Several commentators believe that the proposal should apply to contributions from all employees affiliated with
the underwriter and from affiliated financial institutions and their employees.
 Several commentators specifically express concern that the proposal excludes contributions by chief executive
officers of banks,
 or by PACs controlled by banks or bank holding companies, which have a municipal securities dealer department or subsidiary.
 These commentators believe that by exempting affiliated banks and bank holding companies, the proposal provides
a ``loophole'' for continued abuse of political contributions by municipal securities dealers and their affiliates.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940413-2-00156 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940413-2-00070 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission believes that the MSRB's proposed rule change is not deficient merely because it does not include affiliated
banks and bank holding companies. Because of the sensitivity to constitutional and other concerns, the Commission
believes that the coverage of the proposal is no broader than is necessary to effectuate its purpose and that extending
the scope to cover affiliated banks and bank holding companies is not necessary.






G. De Minimis Exemption



Several commentators recommend that the proposal increase the 

de minimis

 amount that municipal finance professionals may contribute.
 Several commentators recommend that the rule should provide a ``good faith'' exemption for inadvertent violations.
 One commentator recommends that the rule provide a ``safe harbor'' provision for certain contributions.
 Another commentator believes that the proposal should exempt contributions made for legitimate purposes.









Several commentators believe that the 

de minimis

 exemption should be expanded to include contributions to officials for whom the municipal finance professionals
are not entitled to vote.
 These commentators believe that the proposal prevents municipal securities dealers from establishing business
relationships with issuers,
 and from supporting candidates with similar views important to the municipal finance professional or to the municipal
securities broker-dealer firm.
 One commentator recommends that the proposal allow contributions to candidates that represent the area in which
the professionals' principal office is located.

<TEXT>
 

The Commission believes that the MSRB's determinations as to the amount of the de minimis exemption and limiting its
application to contributions to officials for whom the municipal finance professional is entitled to vote are appropriate
and reasonable. As discussed, the proposal provides specific guidelines to prevent ``pay to play'' contributions.
The proposal provides an appropriate balance between limiting ``pay to play'' practices and the ability of dealers
and their employees to demonstrate support for state and local candidates. The proposal recognizes that certain
contributions made for legitimate political purposes present less risk of a conflict of interest or the appearance
of a conflict of interest. Although an individual may have a legitimate interest in making contributions to candidates
for whom she is ineligible to vote, there is a greater risk in such circumstances that the contribution is motivated
by an improper attempt to influence municipal officials. Thus, the proposal enables municipal finance professionals
to contribute $250 per election to candidates for whom they are entitled to vote without triggering the proposal's
business limitation. As discussed, the proposal does not prevent dealers or their employees from demonstrating
support for local and state officials in other ways including volunteer political campaign activity.


H. General Provisions


Several commentators believe that the proposal is operationally too burdensome to implement. These commentators
believe that because of the number and types of persons subject to the rule's prohibitions, it will be difficult for
municipal securities dealers to implement and enforce compliance procedures.
 Some commentators believe that the proposal's disclosure and recordkeeping requirements are overly burdensome.
 Several commentators also believe that the scope of the proposal is uncertain and recommend that it provide more complete
standards regarding employee contributions,
 the use of consultants and law firms,
 bonds issued by corporations with the assistance of local governments,
 the definition of ``election,''
 and the definition of ``official of such issuer.''
 One commentator requests that the proposal contain a ``sunset'' provision to require the MSRB to review rule G-37
after a fixed number of years.

<DOCNO> FR940413-2-00158 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940413-2-00070 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission believes that the proposal's provisions are sufficiently specific to permit compliance with its
terms. The Commission also understands that industry efforts are currently underway to draft proposed guidelines
to assist dealer compliance with the proposal. In addition, the MSRB will provide continued interpretive guidance
to assist dealer compliance with the proposal. The Commission, in accordance with its statutory mandate, will continue
to monitor the implementation of the proposal and the effects the proposal may have on the market.



I. Amendment No. 1



The Commission finds good cause for approving the MSRB's Amendment No. 1, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the amendment. As originally submitted, the proposal's
prohibitions on municipal securities business would arise from contributions made on or after April 1, 1994. The
MSRB filed the amendment to change the April 1, 1994 date to a date 10 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 of the order approving the proposal. The MSRB also amended the proposal to change the effective date of the proposal's
disclosure and recordkeeping requirements to a date 10 days after publication of the approval order in the 

Federal Register

. Thus the proposal's prohibitions will arise from contributions made on or after April 25, 1994. The proposal's disclosure
and recordkeeping requirements also will not be effective until April 25, 1994. The Commission believes that the
amendments will facilitate compliance by municipal securities dealers. The amendments, in conjunction with the
proposal's notice and comment period, will provide municipal securities dealers sufficient time to adopt and implement
procedures to comply with the proposal.



VI. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the MSRB's Amendment No. 1.
Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission,
450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the amendment that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the amendment
between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section.
Copies of the amendment also will be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the MSRB. All submissions
should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by May 4, 1994.



VII. Conclusion



For the foregoing reasons, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder applicable to the MSRB and, in particular, section 15B(b)(2)(C).



It is therefore ordered,

 Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change and Amendment No. 1 described above be, and hereby
are, approved, and shall be effective April 25, 1994.





By the Commission.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board
Relating to Suitability of Recommendations</DOCTITLE>


April 7, 1994.


On January 7, 1994, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``Board'' or ``MSRB'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (``Act''),
 a proposed rule change consisting of amendments to rule G-19, concerning suitability of recommendations,
and rule G-8 concerning recordkeeping. The proposed rule change was published for comment in the 

Federal Register

.
 No comments were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change.





I. Background


In a letter dated May 8, 1992, the Commission's Division of Market Regulation asked the MSRB to review the requirements
of rule G-19 on suitability of recommendations and to consider strengthening the requirements for transactions
in certain types of municipal securities.
 In September 1992, the Board published a request for comments on a number of customer protection issues, including
the application of rule G-19 to customer transactions.
 After reviewing these matters, the MSRB decided that rule G-19 embodies the appropriate general standard for
dealers in making recommendations to customers, but recognized that there was a perception that certain provisions
of the rule could be viewed as permitting recommendations to go forward without proper regard to the nature of the security
being recommended and the customer to whom it is recommended. Accordingly, at its May 1993 meeting, the Board approved
a Request for Comments on draft amendments to clarify and strengthen the suitability requirements of rule G-19.
The MSRB requested public comment on the proposal,
 and draft amendments were approved at the November 1993 Board meeting and form the basis of the rule change proposed
herein. Shortly thereafter, 12 groups and associations representing a broad range of market participants submitted
to the Commission a Joint Statement on Improvements in Municipal Securities Market Disclosure.
 The Joint Statement called on the MSRB to monitor the effectiveness of its suitability rules and to strengthen those
rules if appropriate.
 The Joint Statement specifically called for suitability rules to require disclosure of ratings and whether the issuer
has committed to provide annual financial reports.
 In September, 1993, the MSRB indicated it was considering requiring municipal securities dealers to disclose to
their customers the importance of secondary market information and whether the issuer has agreed to voluntarily
provide such disclosures.











II. Description



The proposed rule change amends MSRB rules G-19 and G-8 and is designed to strengthen the Board's customer
suitability rule.


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940413-2-00160 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940413-2-00071 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

It eliminates two provisions from rule G-19. Rule G-19 generally requires that before making any recommendations
to a customer, a dealer must first determine that the proposed transaction is suitable for the customer. One provision
of the rule in its current form, which is in effect an exemption to it, permits a dealer to make a recommendation when
a customer fails to provide sufficient information about himself, as long as the dealer has no reasonable grounds
to believe and does not believe that the recommendation is unsuitable. The Board proposes deleting the provision
to avoid any ambiguities regarding a dealer's obligation to make a suitability determination and to prevent any future
use of the provision as an excuse for unsuitable recommendations. As a result of this rule change, a dealer who lacks
specific information regarding a customer's financial status or investment objective, but reasonably believes
that an investment is suitable for the customer, would not be permitted to go forward with the recommendation.

A second exemptive provision of the current rule allows dealers to recommend specific municipal securities to investors
who want to invest in those securities even after being informed by the dealer that, based on their financial circumstances,
investments in those securities would not be suitable. The Board also proposes deleting this provision to strengthen
the suitability rule.

The proposed rule change also amends rule G-19 to clarify the information that municipal securities dealers
must obtain from customers and when it must be obtained. For non-institutional customers, the rule change clarifies
that dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain the following information: The customer's financial status,
tax status, investment objectives and such other information used or considered to be reasonable and necessary by
the dealer in making recommendations to the customer.
 The proposal does not establish a specific list of items that must be requested from institutional accounts.





The suitability rule itself applies equally to institutional and non-institutional accounts, irrespective of
the different information gathering requirements. It states that for each recommendation of a municipal securities
transaction, a broker or dealer shall have reasonable grounds, based upon information available from the issuer
and facts disclosed by the customer or otherwise known about the customer, to believe that the recommendation is suitable.

The proposed rule change also revises the definition of ``institutional account'' contained in rule G-8. The
new definition would add the accounts of savings and loan associations, investment advisers registered under Section
203 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and other entities (whether a natural person, corporation, partnership,
trust, or otherwise) with total assets of at least $50 million to those of banks and registered investment companies
under the definition of ``institutional accounts.'' This amendment would make the Board's definition of ``institutional
account'' the same as that established by Article III, section 21(c)(4) of the National Association of Securities
Dealers (``NASD'') Rules of Fair Practice for purposes of suitability determinations.



III. Discussion



Since the adoption of suitability rules in the late 1970's, there have been significant changes in the municipal securities
markets. The number of retail investors has increased and the introduction of more complex, and in some cases, speculative
municipal securities has become a characteristic of today's market. In addition, there have been a number of defaults
in municipal securities in recent years, including some defaults in unrated and conduit bonds.






As a result of these developments, the Commission believes it is critical that dealers have clear policies to ensure
that sales personnel do not recommend securities to customers without proper regard to the nature of the security
being recommended and the customer to whom it is being recommended. Furthermore, because of the lack of available
information regarding prices and risk of municipal securities, brokers and dealers have an information advantage
relative to their customers. Particularly in such an environment, it is wholly appropriate to hold brokers and dealers
to high professional standards when making recommendations to their customers.

The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
applicable to the Board and in particular, section 15B(b)(2)(C), which authorizes the Board to adopt rules designed
to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to
foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in municipal securities
and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

The Commission notes also that the proposed rule change addresses the concerns raised by the Division of Market Regulation
in its 1993 report to Congress on the Municipal Securities Market.
 In that report, the Division cited sales practices as one area that could benefit from increased MSRB attention and
specifically encouraged the MSRB to update its suitability and customer protection rules.





The Commission believes that the proposed rule change will help prevent fraudulent and deceptive practices and promote
just and equitable principles of trade because it is designed to ensure that dealers, before making a recommendation
to a customer, take appropriate steps to determine that the municipal securities transaction is suitable. In particular,
by clarifying and strengthening the rules governing the inquiries dealers must make of customers and the circumstances
under which recommendations are permissible, the rule change will further important goals such as assuring the integrity
of the market for municipal securities and safeguarding the interests of the investing public.

Institutional customers also will be better protected under the proposed rule change because brokers an dealers
will be required to have reasonable grounds, based upon information available from the issuer and facts disclosed
by or known about a customer, for believing that a recommendation is suitable, whether or not the client is an institution.
Institutional and non-institutional customers will be treated differently only with respect to the precise information
that must be obtained prior to a recommendation. For both types of customers, information still must be obtained that
is adequate to support a reasonable suitability determination. There will be no difference in the standard a broker
or dealer is held to in determining the suitability of that recommendation. Thus, in many cases, even though not required
to obtain certain types of customer information for recordkeeping purposes, dealers will, as a practical matter,
need to obtain the same types of information for certain institutional accounts as would be required for non-institutional
accounts.






Furthermore, by revising the definition of ``institution'' to conform with the definition used by the NASD,
 the proposed rule change promotes consistency in classification, thereby facilitating the determination of the
proper duty of inquiry owed to the particular client, and reduces confusion in the administration, compliance and
surveillance of municipal securities dealers by NASD examiners.







It is therefore ordered,

 Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change be, and hereby is, approved.




By the Commission.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Securities Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing and Order Granting
Accelerated Approval of a Proposed Rule Change Amending NSCC's By-laws to Provide for an Additional Member of the
Board of Directors</DOCTITLE>


April 1, 1994.


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on March 4, 1994, the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below,
which Items have been primarily prepared by NSCC. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on
the proposed rule change from interested persons.




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The proposed rule change amends NSCC's by-laws to allow for an additional member of the board of directors.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, NSCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. NSCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


When NSCC was formed, the number of directors on the board was sixteen. To provide a greater representation of the participants
in the management of NSCC, the number of directors on the board was increased to seventeen in 1984 and to eighteen in
1990.
 NSCC's participant base has expanded significantly since 1990. Therefore, NSCC believes that it is in the participants'
interest that the number of directors again be increased. NSCC's by-laws permit the number of directors to be increased
from time to time. The rule change consists of an amendment to the by-laws increasing the number of directors on the
board from eighteen to nineteen. Pursuant to NSCC's shareholders agreement, the board of directors is made up as follows:
One director representing each shareholder (

i.e., 

the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange, and National Association of Securities Dealers), one director
representing NSCC's management (

i.e., 

NSCC's president and chief executive officer), and the remaining directors are selected from NSCC's participants.
The additional participant director will further the opportunity for participants to be represented on the board
and to participate in the administration of NSCC.

NSCC believes the proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A(b)(3)(C)
 of the Act because it increases the opportunity for NSCC's participants to be involved in the administration of NSCC's
affairs.






B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



NSCC does not believe that the proposed rule change will have an impact or impose a burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others



No written comments have been solicited or received. NSCC will notify the Commission of any written comments received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Section 17A(b)(3)(C)
 states that the rules of a clearing agency must assure a fair representation of its shareholders (or members) and participants
in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs. The Commission believes that the proposed increase
in the number of directors on the board is consistent with NSCC's obligations under section 17A because the result
will be a board which reflects, to a greater degree, NSCC's participants. As a result, participants will be afforded
additional opportunities to raise, discuss, and help resolve issues that effect them.





NSCC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving the proposed
rule change because it will give NSCC the opportunity to have the additional participant member elected and possibly
participate in the next board meeting, which is scheduled for April 1994.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public
Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing also will be available for inspection
and copying at the principal office of NSCC. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-NSCC-94-03
and should be submitted by May 4, 1994.



It Is Therefore ordered, 

pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-NSCC-94-03) be, and hereby is approved.



For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.
