REA Telecommunications Software License Agreement 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Rural Electrification Administration, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) hereby amends its regulations on telecommunications to add a uniform
Telecommunications Software License Agreement that will be an Addendum to any REA financed central office equipment
contract where the Borrower is required to execute a Software License Agreement. This action provides a single Telecommunications
Software License Agreement instead of the present situation where each supplier uses its own form. This action reduces
the review and approval time of equipment contracts and provides fair and equal treatment for all providers of central
office equipment.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Executive Order 12866 


This final rule has been determined to be not-significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has
not been reviewed by OMB. 



Executive Order 12372 


This final rule is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Consultation. A notice of
final rule entitled Department Programs and Activities Excluded from Executive Order 12372 (50 FR 47034) exempts
REA and RTB loans and loan guarantees, and RTB bank loans, to governmental and nongovernmental entities from coverage
under this Order. 



Executive Order 12778 


This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This final rule:


(1) Will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies; 
(2) Will not have any retroactive effect; or 
(3) Will not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit challenging the provisions of this
rule. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 



The Administrator of REA has determined that this final rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number
of small entities as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). This final rule provides for a uniform software license agreement which will reduce review and approval time and
ensure fair and equal treatment for all providers of central office equipment. 


Information Collection and Recordkeeping Requirements 



The reporting and recordkeeping requirements contained in this final rule have been submitted to OMB for approval.
Comments concerning these requirements should be directed to the Department of Agriculture, Clearance Office,
Officer of Information Resources Management, room 404-W, Washington, DC 20250, and to the Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for USDA, room 3201, NEOB, Washington, DC 20503.

The Administrator of REA has determined that this final rule will not significantly affect the quality of the human
environment as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

). Therefore, this action does not require an environmental impact statement or assessment. 



Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance 



The program described by this final rule is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs under No.
10.851, Rural Telephone Loans and Loan Guarantees, and 10.852, Rural Telephone Bank Loans. This catalog is available
on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, the United States Government Printing Office, Washington,
DC 20402. 



Background 



7 CFR part 1753, Telecommunications System Construction Policies and Procedures, contains guidelines for the preparation
of Software License Agreements subject to approval by REA. Efforts to conclude satisfactory license agreements
with individual equipment suppliers have been time consuming and in certain cases REA has been unable to reach an agreement
that is acceptable to REA and the equipment suppliers. This agreement will permit all REA financed purchases of central
office equipment and the suppliers to utilize a common uniform Software License Agreement. The agreement will be
an Addendum to all REA financed central office equipment contracts and eliminates the present practice of using individual
license agreements negotiated with separate equipment suppliers. 

REA amends 7 CFR part 1753, by revising subpart A,  1753.7, paragraph (f)(4), and subpart E,  1753.38,
paragraph (a)(2)(i)(J), to indicate that the software license agreement prepared by REA will be an addendum to the
central office equipment contract, and to amend  1753.38, paragraph (c), by revising the software license
agreement. Additionally, it removes  1753.38, paragraph (a)(2)(iii), which instructs the borrower to review
the proposed software licensing agreement and obtain REA approval, if required. This final rule eliminates the need
for instructions since the software agreement has been prepared by REA and approved by the Administrator prior to
presentation to suppliers. It is also amended by adding a form to  1755.93. 



Comments 



Public comments were received from Alcatel Network Systems, Inc., AT&T Network Systems, Commonwealth Telephone
Company, Hastad Engineering Co., Mitel Public Switching, Northern Telecom Inc., Redcom Laboratories, Inc., and
Seimens Stromberg-Carlson. The comments, recommendations and responses are summarized as follows: 



General Comments 



One commenter felt REA should have one universal software license for all software controlled devices. 



Response: 

The use of a universal software license has been considered by REA but is not viable at this time because of the large
difference in types of equipment and the requirements of various REA contracts. 

One commenter states that their switch uses firmware, which is hardware based and sold with the product, rather than
software, therefore, they are not required to have a software agreement. 



Response: 

REA does not require an executed software license agreement. If the vendor requires an executed software/firmware
license agreement, then the only one acceptable to REA is the REA prepared Software License Agreement (Addendum 2).


One commenter feels that it is in the best interest of the Licensor and the REA Borrowers to use its existing standard
form Software License, or failing that, to use the currently approved REA Negotiated License instead of the REA prepared
Software License Agreement.

Response:

 REA believes one form of Software License to be used in all Software leasing situations involving the Forms 525 and
545 Contracts is in the best interests of the suppliers, the borrowers, and REA because a single uniform Software License
presents a fair and equitable distribution of risk to all parties involved and assures borrowers that all manufacturers
must meet the same requirements. 


Two commenters felt that the term ``Licensed Software'' be used consistently throughout the Agreement. 




Response:

 The Agreement has been revised to reflect the above comment. 



Section (1) 



One commenter suggested that the definition of Licensed Software and the associated documentation be more specific.




Response:

 The definition of Licensed Software and associated documentation has been revised to resolve this problem. 


One commenter suggested that the definition of Licensee and Licensor be expanded to include sublicensors of the Licensor
so that resellers or distributors could sign the Agreement. 




Response:

 REA believes that there should be one party responsible for meeting the Licensee's obligations and one party responsible
for meeting the Licensor's obligations so that the ultimately responsible entities can be easily ascertained. The
language in this definition has not been changed. 




Section (2) 




Two commenters suggested that the last sentence of Section (2) be changed to more clearly define the use of the Licensed
Software. 




Response: 

REA has revised this sentence to clarify the intention that the Licensed Software can only be used with the System provided
under the Contract. 


One commenter suggested that section (2)(i) be changed to require the Licensee to notify the Licensor of any change
in location of the equipment and Licensed Software so that the Licensor could track its software and assist in providing
software support (e.g., change notices, etc). 




Response: 

REA agrees. Section (2)(i) has been revised to incorporate the suggested change.

One commenter wanted additional language added to section (2)(ii) emphasizing territorial limits and the comparable
technical application by transferee of the original License. 




Response:

 REA has added language to sections (2)(ii) and (2)(iii) to further define the responsibilities of the transferee
and the original License holder. 


One commenter wanted language added to section (2)(ii) to restrict the transfer of the Licensed Software unless the
transfer was authorized in writing by the Licensor. 


It was also requested that the Licensor be allowed a 60 day period to raise any objections to the transfer. 


In addition, it was suggested that if a Company's relationship to the Licensee changes such that it is no longer a subsidiary
of the Licensee then a transfer of the License Agreement is required or the Licensor has the right to terminate the Agreement
and revoke the right to use the Licensed Software. 




Response:

 REA feels that the Licensee should have the right to transfer the Licensed Software to any party who acquires legal
title to the System. 


REA has added language to section (2)(ii) to specify that the Licensor should receive 30 days notice of any transfer.



The obligations of the Licensee and of the transferee who acquires legal title to the System are covered under section
(2)(ii). In addition, REA has added language to section (2)(iii) to emphasize the responsibilities of the Licensee,
therefore, REA does not feel that additional changes are advisable. 


Two commenters felt that the word ``reasonable'' should be changed to ``necessary'' in the first sentence of section
(2)(iii). 


One commenter felt that the word ``rightful'' should be added to the last sentence before the word ``acts''. 


One commenter requested that the following sentence be added to section (2)(iii): ``The Licensee shall not make the
Licensed Software available to any person except its employees on a need to know basis''. 




Response:

 REA feels the word ``necessary'' places too great a burden on the Licensee and that ``reasonable'' provides Licensor
with adequate protection. This requested change has not been implemented. 


The Licensee would not know if information or data that is available to the general public was rightfully released
or not. This requested change has not been implemented. 


REA has added language to restrict Software availability to a need to know basis, however, the words ``its employees''
have not been added. This would restrict the Licensee from obtaining assistance from other sources in the event section
(2)(xi) required enforcement. 


(i) In section (2)(iv), one commenter wanted additional language added to require the Licensee to follow the commenter's
printed procedures for copying the Licensed Software. It was suggested that the phrase ``pursuant to the Licensor's
then current procedures and practices'' be added to section (2)(iv). 


(ii) One commenter wanted the words ``In such reproduction,'' to begin the second sentence and the word ``such'' inserted
between the words ``all'' and ``copies'' in the second sentence to further define the limitation of reproduction
of the Licensed Software. 


(iii) One commenter remarked that there was no need to copy the code since it was contained on non-volatile ROM on the
switch. 




Response:

 (i) REA feels the suggested language regarding current procedures and practices is too vague and could impose unknown
restrictions on the Licensee. This language has not been added to the Software License. 


(ii) The suggested language on limitation of reproduction has been added. 


(iii) REA feels that it is appropriate to be able to copy any Licensed Software/Firmware that is furnished with the
System covered under the Contract for the reasons described in section (2)(iv) of the Software License Agreement.



One commenter remarked that in section (2)(v), activation of nonactivated program instruction steps is a process
by which a non-enabled software feature may be enabled and that, in such cases, additional Right-To-Use fees may apply.

Response:

 REA agrees and has added language to that effect. 

One commenter suggested that a new section (2)(vi) be added restricting decompiling or reverse assembly. 



Response:

 Although REA has not added a new section, the suggested language has been added to section (2)(iii). 

Four commenters replied on section (2)(vii)(A). Their comments are summarized below: 

(i) Three would void the warranty if the Licensee made any changes. 

(ii) Three wanted section (2)(vii)(A) removed. 

(iii) One suggested extensively revising the language. 

(iv) One suggested refusing to allow Licensee to make any changes to the Licensed Software to restore service. 



Response:

 (i) REA feels the Borrower must be able to attempt to preserve or restore service to their subscribers without incurring
a penalty if the Licensor is unable to preserve or restore service in a timely manner. 

(ii), (iii) Section (2)(vii)(A) has not been removed but the language has been extensively revised to clarify REA's
intention and protect the Licensor. 

(iv) As stated previously, REA feels the Borrower must be able to attempt to preserve or restore service to their subscribers.
However, this section has been revised to indicate that any changes made by Licensee can only be made if the Licensor
is unable to preserve or restore service in a timely manner. 

One commenter wanted to know who determines that the Licensor is unwilling or unable to furnish support for the Licensed
Software under section (2)(vii)(C). 



Response:

 The exception set forth in section (2)(vii)(c) applies only if section (2)(xi) is enforced. Section (2)(vii)(c)
has been revised to indicate the above. 

One commenter feels that all rights to any changes made under section (2)(vii) should remain the property of the Licensor.




Response:

 As indicated previously, section (2)(vii)(A) has been revised for clarification and any changes made under section
(2)(vii)(C) are only allowed if section (2)(xi) is enforced. REA believes any changes should become the property
of the Licensee because the changes are made only in the instance where the Licensor is unwilling or unable to support
the Licensed Software. 

Comments were received on section (2)(ix) as follows: 

(i) Five commenters stated that some software problems cannot be corrected in thirty days and suggested that additional
time be allowed in these cases. 

(ii) Two commenters suggested a one (1) year warranty period. 

(iii) One commenter felt that the Software warranty should begin at the Completion of Installation. 

(iv) It was also felt that the Software should function according to the Specification and not to the technical material
provided to explain the System and that the Licensor's sole obligation should be to repair the Software and correct
any physical damage caused by the Software failure. 

(v) One commenter wanted the phrase ``free from errors and incompleteness'' added to the first sentence of section
(2)(ix) to reflect the requirement in 7 CFR 1753.38(c)(1)(v) and a definition of those terms added to the Agreement.


(vi) It was also suggested that a one (1) year warranty period be added for special equipment. 



Response:

 (i) Section (2)(ix) already allows for an extension of time if the software problem cannot be corrected in thirty (30)
days. This language has been further clarified. 

(ii) REA requires a five (5) year warranty period because software is information based and defects in seldom used
programs would not be detected until the program is used. REA believes that over a 5 year period even seldom used programs
would be used and any defects corrected.

(iii) In order for the Licensee to realize a full five (5) year warranty the warranty period must start with the delivery
of possession and control from the Licensor. If it began at the Completion of Installation, the warranty period would
be diminishing while the equipment was still under control of the Licensor. 

(iv) Performance of the software must be in accordance with both the Specification and Licensor documentation. The
documentation is furnished to assist the Licensee in the operation, administration, and maintenance of the System.
REA has made no change in the obligations of the Licensor as stated in the Contract. 

(v) REA does not feel the term ``free from errors and incompleteness'' fully describes the intent of this section (2)(ix).
This language has not been added to section (2)(ix). 

(vi) This License was specifically designed for use with REA Forms 525 Central Office Equipment Contract (Including
Installation) and 545 Central Office Equipment Contract (Not Including Installation) and does not apply to special
equipment contracts, therefore, there is no need for a one (1) year warranty clause for special equipment. 

Comments were received on section (2)(x) as follows: 

(i) Two commenters wanted the ability to modify the Licensed Software or replace it with equivalent software at Licensor's
option. 

(ii) One commenter suggested that section (2)(x) disclaim any special, indirect or consequential damages in connection
with the use or performance of the Licensed Software. 

(iii) One commenter wanted the infringement clause to apply only to United States patents, copyrights and trademarks
and the right to remove the enjoined Licensed Software and refund some of the Right-to-Use Fee if modification or replacement
is not feasible. 

(iv) One commenter wanted the Licensee to indemnify the Licensor in like manner for any claim, suit or proceeding brought
against the Licensor for infringement caused by the Licensee. The commenter also wanted to remove the phrase ``This
shall be in addition to any other rights or claims which the Licensee may have'' and suggested that section (2)(x) disclaim
any liability for any settlement made without Licensee's consent. 



Response:

 (i) The option of modifying or replacing the Licensed Software is in the current language. 

(ii) REA's intent is to limit liability for special, indirect and consequential damages to provide the Licensor with
reasonable protection against losses related to product failure; protect the government's loan security; and serve
as a standard that bidders and owners alike can expect to see on all central office equipment contracts so competitive
bidding can be facilitated. This language has not been changed. 

(iii) REA feels that the Licensor should know what software can be legally licensed by the Licensor, and the Licensee
should expect that the Licensed Software furnished with the System is not going to be subject to infringement challenges.
Simply allowing the Licensor to refund some of the Right-to-Use Fee and remove the enjoined Licensed Software gives
the Licensor the right to ``buy back'' equipment or software when a copyright problem is encountered. To the Licensee,
this means that essential features or capability could be lost and would remain unavailable for the entire useful
life of the new switching equipment. The resulting reduction in value of the contract to the Licensee cannot be predicted,
and certainly cannot be limited to the price of the infringing equipment or software less depreciation. These requirements
have not been changed. 

(iv) Section (2)(x) specifically exempts the Licensor from liability if the infringing software is of the Licensee's
design or selection. REA feels that the existing language sufficiently protects the Licensor from unwarranted claims
caused by the Licensee. REA also feels the Licensee should not have to relinquish its rights as covered in the Contract
because the Licensor is involved in an infringement dispute. This language has not been changed. Also, the Licensee
cannot commit the Licensor to any settlement, therefore, the suggested additional language is not required. 

Comments were received on section (2)(xi) as follows: 

(i) Two commenters suggested that software support after the warranty period should have a specific time period.

(ii) Two commenters suggested that they should not be required to support retired software when there is active equivalent
or upgraded software available from the Licensor which it will support. 

(iii) One commenter suggested that the language should be amended to exclude information that the Licensor does not
have the legal right to turn over; e.g., third party Software. 

(iv) One commenter suggested that the only support covered under this section (2)(xi) should be the support required
by the Contract. The commenter also felt that the Licensee should be allowed to modify the Licensed Software for proper
equipment operation but not for feature enhancements, and the Licensor should receive royalty-free rights to make,
use and sell any modifications made by the Licensee under this section. 

(v) One commenter remarked that the only time the Licensee should be able to modify the Licensed Software is in the event
that the Licensor withdraws from the business of selling and supporting the Licensed Software. 



Response: 

(i) REA agrees that support after the warranty period should have a specified time limit. This was addressed when REA
published the Proposed Rule Form 525 Central Office Equipment Contract (Including Installation) in the 

Federal Register

.

(ii) REA feels that the Licensee should reasonably expect to receive support for the Licensed Software without having
to upgrade the System. 

(iii) REA agrees in principle, however, this exclusion does not extend to any information or Software not specifically
identified as ``agreed excluded documentation'' in an attachment to the Contract, and under no circumstance can
it include the overall operating Software of the System. Section (2)(xi) has been revised to reflect the above. 

(iv) REA agrees that the support referred to in section (2)(xi) is the support required by the Contract. The language
has been changed to reflect this. However, REA does not agree that the Licensee should be restricted from making feature
enhancements. The Licensee must be able to add enhancements to the System in order to offer current and future services
to their subscribers. Due to the circumstances that would require enforcement of this section (2)(xi) any changes
made under this section become the exclusive property of the Licensee. 

(v) REA feels the Licensee should have the right to modify the Licensed Software in the event that the Licensor refuses
to furnish support as required by the Contract. 

One commenter felt that in section (2)(xii), the word Licensor should be Licensee. One commenter felt that this section
should apply to both the Licensor and the Licensee. 



Response: 

Section (2)(xii) refers specifically to the Licensor. Section (2)(xiii) refers to the Licensee and details the remedies
available to the Licensor. 

Five commenters remarked on section (2)(xiii). Their comments are summarized below: 

(i) One commenter felt that damages of ten times the Contract price for a breach of the Software License was excessive
and should be changed to the initial cost of the Software. 

(ii) One commenter felt that damages of ten times the Contract price for a breach of the Software License was not a sufficient
deterrent and sixty (60) days notice before termination may cause irreparable harm to the Licensor. It was suggested
that section (2)(xiii) be eliminated in its entirety. 

(iii) One commenter suggested that the sixty (60) day notice period for REA should be changed to thirty (30) days. 

(iv) One commenter wanted section (2)(xiii) to apply to the Licensee and the Licensor and exclude from damages lost
revenue or profits. 

(v) One commenter wanted REA to agree that certain events would cause REA to recommend termination. One commenter
wanted the right to terminate the Software License without REA approval. 

(vi) One commenter suggested the word reasonable in the first sentence of section (2)(xiii) be changed to thirty (30)
days. 



Response: 

(i) REA feels that damages limited to the initial cost of the Software is not a sufficient deterrent to provide a reasonable
amount of security against a breach of the Software License. However, after further evaluation, and in response to
the comments, REA feels that ten times the Contract price could financially devastate the typical REA Borrower and
consequently jeopardize REA loan security. Damages payable by the Licensee for breach of this License have been changed
to not exceed the total Contract price 

(ii) In order to protect the Borrower and REA loan security REA feels there must be a cap on damages against the Licensee
for a breach of this License. REA also feels that there must be some restrictions on the termination of the Software
License. This section (2)(xiii) remains. 

(iii) REA feels that thirty (30) days is not sufficient time to thoroughly evaluate and arrive at a fair and equitable
decision regarding the circumstances that might cause termination of the Software License. 

(iv) As stated previously, section (2)(xii) refers specifically to the Licensor. Section (2)(xiii) refers to the
Licensee and details the remedies available to the Licensor. 

(v) Any event that would cause the Licensor to recommend termination of the Software License must be individually
and thoroughly evaluated by REA prior to any recommendation by REA. In order to protect the loan security of REA and
the Licensee's ability to repay that loan, REA must be included in any decision to terminate the Software License.


(vi) REA has evaluated the suggestion to change the word reasonable to thirty (30) days and agree that it would make
the Software License more definitive. The language in section (2)(xiii) has been changed to reflect this. 

The remainder of section (2)(xiii) has not been changed.

One commenter felt that section (2)(xv) was 
unnecessary because the Software License is an Addendum to the Contract and the Contract is subject to REA approval.




Response: 

Separate provisions for REA approval of the Software License Agreement makes the Agreement more prominent and helps
ensure that arbitrary changes are not made to the Agreement without REA's knowledge or approval. 

One commenter wanted four additional paragraphs added to section (2) of the Software License. One commenter wanted
two additional paragraphs added to section (2) of the Software License. These six paragraphs are summarized here.


(i) One paragraph specified that the obligations of the Licensee under this agreement shall survive after the termination
of this Agreement. 

(ii) One paragraph specified that the Licensee shall not, without the prior written permission of the Licensor, use
in advertising, publicity, or otherwise, any trade name, trademark, or any other identification owned by the Licensor.


(iii) One paragraph specified that the Software License Agreement shall prevail notwithstanding any conflicting
terms or legends which may appear on or in the Licensed Software. 

(iv) One paragraph specified that nothing contained herein shall be construed as conferring by implication or otherwise
(1) any license or right to use any name, trade name, trademark or any other identification, or simulation thereof;
(2) any obligation to furnish to any person, including Licensee, any assistance whatsoever, or any documentation
other than Licensed Software and related documentation as specified in this Agreement; (3) a grant to sell, lease,
or otherwise transfer or dispose of Licensed Software, except as specified. 

(v) One paragraph specified that the Licensee shall not decompile or reverse assemble the Licensed Software. 

(vi) One paragraph specified that the Licensee assumes sole responsibility for ensuring that the Billing Center
can correctly read call records and risk of loss for any data, use, revenue or profit shall be the responsibility of
Licensee. 



Response: 

(i) REA agrees and has added the suggested language to the Software License Agreement in section (2)(xiv). 

(ii) REA agrees that the Licensor and Licensee have a right to protect their trademarks, trade names and other forms
of identification. Language has been added to the Software License to reflect this in section (2)(xv). 

(iii) REA believes that this is the intent of the Software License Agreement and has added the suggested language to
the Software License in section (2)(xvi). 

(iv) REA believes that the language added to the Software License for paragraph (ii) covers part (1) of this paragraph.
Part (2) of this paragraph has not been added as the Licensor must provide support and assistance as required by the
Contract. REA has not added part (3) of this paragraph because section (2)(ii) of the Software License already states
the requirements for sale of the System. 

(v) Although REA has not added a new section, the suggested language has been added to section (2)(iii). 

(vi) REA believes it is the responsibility of the Licensor to determine what format is required for the call records
and react accordingly. This paragraph has not been added to the Software License.

Airworthiness Directives; Short Brothers PLC Model SD3-30, SD3-60, and 
SD3-SHERPA Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Short Brothers PLC Model
SD3-30, SD3-60, and SD3-SHERPA series airplanes, that currently requires an inspection to detect
corrosion on the distance piece associated with the wing strut pick up on the stub wing, and repair of corroded parts.
This amendment requires repetitive inspections to detect corrosion of repaired or reworked distance pieces and
adjacent side plates; and provides a terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This amendment is prompted
by reports of corrosion on the distance pieces and adjacent side plates of the wing strut pick up. The actions specified
by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the distance piece and adjacent side plates, which could result in reduced
strength of the wing strut attachment to the stub wing on the fuselage and, subsequently, reduced structural strength
of the main wing.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations by superseding AD 93-09-08, Amendment
39-8574 (58 FR 27928, May 12, 1993), which is applicable to certain Short Brothers PLC Model SD3-30, SD3-60,
and SD3-SHERPA series airplanes, was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 5, 1993 (58 FR 58992). The action proposed to supersede AD 93-09-08 to continue to require a
one-time inspection to detect corrosion on the distance piece associated with the wing strut pick up on the stub wing,
and repair or rework of corroded parts. The AD also proposed to require repetitive inspections to detect corrosion
of repaired or reworked original equipment type distance pieces (with pockets) and adjacent side plates. 



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the single comment received. 

The commenter supports the proposed rule. 

After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 

The FAA estimates that 106 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD. The currently required one-time
inspection action requires approximately 5 work hours per airplane to accomplish the actions, at an average labor
rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of that action on U.S. operators is estimated
to be $29,150, or $275 per airplane. 

For operators who replace or repair a distance piece, this AD will require that repetitive inspections of that distance
piece be performed. Such inspections will require approximately 5 work hours to accomplish, at an average labor charge
of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the repetitive inspections that will be required
of these operators will be $275 per airplane per inspection cycle. 

Should an operator elect to accomplish the optional terminating action that will be provided by this AD action, the
number of hours required to accomplish it will be approximately 80 per airplane, at an average labor charge of $55 per
work hour. The cost of required parts will be approximately $2,600 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of the optional terminating action on U.S. operators will be $7,000 per airplane.

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not 
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small 
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11 and MD-11F Series 
Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11
and MD-11F series airplanes, that requires modification of the cavity vent drain tube assembly at the center
wing lower auxiliary fuel tank cavity. This amendment is prompted by a report that the cavity vent tube, if not properly
grounded, could act as an electrical path in the event of a lightning strike. The actions specified by this AD are intended
to prevent arcing in the tank cavity and possible resulting fire.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11 and MD-11F series airplanes was published in the


Federal Register

 on November 4, 1993 (58 FR 58808). That action proposed to require modification of the cavity vent drain tube assembly
located in the center wing lower auxiliary fuel tank. 




Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 


One commenter supports the proposed rule. 


The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of one of its member operators, requests that the proposal
be withdrawn. The commenter maintains that the proposed modification will allow some fuel leakage within specified
limits into the lower auxiliary tank cavity. This commenter asserts that, if this modification is not mandated by
the FAA, then fuel will not be permitted to leak into the cavity and, unless fuel/vapor is present, there is no risk of
fire in this cavity in the event of a lightning strike. The commenter also points out that a daily check to detect fuel
leakage in the cavity drain valve is currently specified in the On Aircraft Maintenance Planning (OAMP) document
for Model MD-11 series airplanes. The commenter concludes that, since these inspections are performed on a
daily basis, and since fuel will not be permitted to leak into the cavity if the modification is not mandated, then a
lightning strike will not pose a threat to an area containing fuel or fuel vapor. 


The FAA does not concur that withdrawal of the proposal is appropriate. First, the FAA points out that the OAMP document
is not a mandated, FAA-approved document; therefore, regardless of the number or types of inspections that are contained
in it, there is no assurance that operators will strictly comply with those inspections or the indicated inspection
intervals. Additionally, there is always the potential that a fuel leak could develop during flight between inspection
intervals. Second, the FAA has determined that, since the required modification of the cavity vent drain tube assembly
will prevent the possibility of a lightning strike traveling up the cavity vent tube, the possibility of arcing in
the fuel tank cavity is thereby eliminated (regardless of whether or not fuel/vapor is present). Further, the FAA
has determined that long term continued operational safety will be better assured by actual modification of the cavity
vent drain tube assembly to remove the source of the problem, rather than by continuous inspections. Long term inspections
may not be providing the degree of safety assurance necessary for the transport airplane fleet. This, coupled with
a better understanding of the human factors associated with numerous continual inspections, has led the FAA to consider
placing less emphasis on inspections and more emphasis on design improvements. The modification required by this
AD is in consonance with these considerations. 


The ATA also requests that the proposed compliance time of 12 months for the modification be extended to 18 months.
Such an extension would permit accomplishment of the proposed modification during regularly scheduled maintenance
visits for most affected operators and would preclude special scheduling at considerable expense. The FAA concurs.
Upon consideration of the information provided by the commenter, and the fact that there have been no in-service incidents
of arcing or fire in the tank cavity (related to grounding problems in the cavity vent drain tube assembly), the FAA
has determined that extending the compliance time by 6 additional months will not adversely affect safety. Paragraph
(a) of the final rule has been revised accordingly. 


After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined
that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 


There are approximately 73 McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11 and MD-11F series airplanes of the affected
design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 29 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that
it will take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor
rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $120 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $8,265, or $285 per airplane. 


The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 


The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 


For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under
Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034,
February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this
action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided

Airworthiness Directives: de Havilland DHC-6 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes Airworthiness Directive (AD) 88-13-11, which currently requires repetitively
inspecting both wing main spar lower cap angles for corrosion, and repairing or replacing any corroded part. This
action retains these inspection and possible repair or replacement requirements, but eliminates the dual compliance
time of both hours time-in-service (TIS) and calendar time. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has determined
that, since corrosion occurs regardless of whether the airplane is in service, the best compliance method for the
proposed action is calendar time. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the wing structure
because of corroded wing main spar lower cap angles.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an AD that would apply to certain de Havilland
DHC-6 series airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 28, 1993 (58 FR 68575). The action proposed to supersede AD 88-13-11 with a new AD that would
retain the requirement of repetitively inspecting both wing main spar lower cap angles for corrosion, but require
these inspections with a compliance method based solely on calendar time. The proposed actions would be accomplished
in accordance with the Accomplishment Instructions section of de Havilland Service Bulletin No. 6/492, Revision
A, dated October 23, 1987. 




Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. One comment
was received in support of the 
proposed rule. 


After careful review of all available information, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest
require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that these
minor corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already
proposed.

The FAA estimates that 169 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
8 workhours per airplane to accomplish the required initial inspection, and that the average labor rate is approximately
$55 an hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $74,360. This
figure does not account for repetitive inspections. The only difference between this AD and AD 88-13-11,
which will be superseded by this required action, is limiting the 
compliance method to only calendar time instead of both calendar time and hours TIS. Therefore, the required action
will not impose any additional cost impact upon the public than that which is already required by AD 88-13-11.


The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Airworthiness Directives; Fokker Model F-28 Mark 0100 Series Airplanes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
Fokker Model F-28 Mark 0100 series airplanes, that requires inspection, necessary repair, 
and modification of the engine mount shear shelf webs. This amendment is prompted by 
reports of interference between the engine mount shear shelf web and the fixed cowl mid 
and aft hooks, which caused fatigue cracks to occur in the web. The actions specified by 
this AD are intended to prevent fatigue cracking and other damage to the structure of the 
shear shelf web, which subsequently could lead to loss of the engine mounting structure. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to 
Fokker Model F-28 Mark 0100 series airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on 
October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54312). That action proposed to require inspection, necessary 
repair, and modification of the engine mount shear shelf webs. 



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. 

One commenter supports the proposal. 

Two commenters request that proposed paragraph (a)(1) be deleted from the rule. 
That paragraph proposed to require that a detailed visual inspection be conducted to 
detect cracking or other damage of the engine mount shear shelf webs around the areas of 
the fixed cowl aft- and mid-hook centerlines. These commenters contend that, since the 
modification required by paragraph (a)(2) reinforces the web and eliminates the 
interference problems, the inspection of this area should not be required to be 
accomplished. The FAA concurs. Since the interference problem that prompted this AD 
action has been found only in the area that is to be modified, and since the modification 
will prevent the interference problem and remove any evidence of damage, the FAA has 
determined that the proposed inspection is not necessary. Further, if an operator has 
already performed the proposed modification, the FAA finds that it would be an undue 
burden to require that the operator disassemble the modified area to accomplish an 
inspection of it. Additionally, the manufacturer and the one affected U.S. operator have 
advised the FAA that inspection of this area at intervals of 1,000 flight hours is already 
specified in the manufacturer's recommended maintenance program. In light of all of these 
factors, the FAA has revised the final rule to delete the requirement to inspect the subject 
area. 

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the 
FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule 
with the change previously described. The FAA has determined that this change will 
neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 

The FAA estimates that 20 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, 
that it will take approximately 120 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required 
actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost 
approximately $2,390 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the 
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $179,800, or $8,990 per airplane. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
However, the FAA has been advised that all 20 affected U.S.-registered airplanes have 
been modified in accordance with the requirements of the AD as of December 1993. 
Therefore, there currently is no economic cost impact of this rule on U.S. operators. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not 
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small 
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be

Airworthiness Directives; Jetstream Aircraft Limited Model 4101 Airplanes


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes.
This action requires installation of fusible trunnion pins in the shock struts and drag braces of the main landing
gear (MLG). This amendment is prompted by a report of incorrectly manufactured trunnion pins that may cause the MLG
to compromise the structural integrity of the wing fuel tanks. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent
damage to the wing fuel tanks and the resultant fuel spillage and fire hazard when the maximum intended design load
limits are exceeded during landing.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes. The CAA advises that certain
trunnion pins in the shock struts and drag braces of the main landing gear (MLG) were manufactured incorrectly. The
trunnion pins in these airplanes were designed to be fusible so that the MLG would break away from the airplane when
landing loads exceed the intended design limits, such as those that may be encountered during emergency landing.
However, the defective trunnion pins were not manufactured with this fusible characteristic. Therefore, these
defective trunnion pins may cause the MLG to fail to break away from the airplane and, consequently, may compromise
the structural integrity of the wing fuel tank. This condition, if not corrected, could result in damage to the wing
fuel tanks and the resultant fuel spillage and fire hazard when the maximum intended design load limits are exceeded
during landing.


Jetstream has issued Service Bulletin J41-32-017, dated February 7, 1994, that describes procedures
for installation of new fusible trunnion pins in the shock struts and drag braces of the MLG. The CAA classified this
service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom.
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent damage to the wing fuel tanks and the resultant
fuel spillage and fire hazard. This AD requires installation of new trunnion pins in the shock struts and drag braces
of the MLG. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.


Comments Invited


Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption 

ADDRESSES

. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed.
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket.
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-34-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

 Evaporated Milk; Amendment of the Standard of Identity


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the standard of identity for evaporated milk by revising the minimum
milkfat and total milk solids content requirements and establishing a minimum milk solids-not-fat content requirement.
This action is in response to a petition filed by the American Dairy Products Institute (ADPI) and will promote honesty
and fair dealing in the interest of consumers.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:




I. The Proposal


 In the 

Federal Register

 of July 22, 1992 (57 FR 32470), FDA published a proposal, based on a petition from ADPI, 130 North Franklin St., Chicago,
IL 60606, to amend the standard of identity for evaporated milk (21 CFR 131.130) to: (1) Reduce the minimum milkfat
content requirement from 7.5 percent to 6.5 percent by weight; (2) reduce the minimum total milk solids content requirement
from 25 percent to 23 percent by weight; and (3) add a minimum milk solids-not-fat content requirement of 16.5 percent
by weight. Interested persons were given until September 21, 1992, to submit comments.



 II. Comments


 The agency received seven responses, each containing one or more comments, from a consumer, a trade association,
and several manufacturers. Six letters supported, and one opposed, the proposal. A summary of the opposing comments
and the agency's responses follow.
 1. The comment contended that the solids content of fluid milk (producers' milk) has probably increased over the last
20 years, and that the proposed reduction in the minimum required milkfat and total milk solids content of evaporated
milk is inconsistent with the intent of the standard of identity for evaporated milk, as well as the intent of the subsequent
amendments, that the milkfat and milk solids-not-fat contents be reasonably related to those of the milk used in the
manufacture of evaporated milk. 
 The agency disagrees with the comment. According to data supplied by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) (Ref.
1), the composition of producers' milk has remained fairly constant through the 1970's and the 1980's. These data
show that the yearly average milkfat content for all producers' milk, before standardization for beverage purposes,
during the period 1970 to 1991 (Ref. 1) ranged between 3.64 percent and 3.68 percent, with an overall average of 3.66
percent. 
 The agency does not agree that the change in compositional requirements is inconsistent with the intent of the evaporated
milk standard. Throughout the history of the evaporated milk standard, the labeling of evaporated milk products
and the instructional materials pertaining to the use of the food supplied to consumers by food manufacturers, trade
associations, and USDA (Ref. 2), as well as policy statements by FDA, have described the food as a 2 to 1 concentrate
of milk. Instructions on the label or in labeling of evaporated milk frequently show that the food is to be diluted with
an equivalent portion of water for use in preparation of beverages made using the food. In addition, recipes for other
foods often state that a can of evaporated milk may be diluted with a can of water for use in recipes calling for the addition
of milk (Ref. 2). 
 The standard of identity for milk in  131.110 (21 CFR 131.110) defines minimum compositional requirements
for the food of not less than 3.25 percent of milkfat and not less than 8.25 percent of milk solids not fat. The minimum
compositional requirements for evaporated milk that FDA is adopting in this final rule (i.e., not less than 6.5 percent
of milkfat, 16.5 percent of milk solids not fat, and 23 percent total milk solids) correspond to a twofold concentration
of standardized milk and, thus, are directly related to those of milk. Because the change in compositional requirements
accurately reflects the general understanding that evaporated milk is a twofold concentrate of milk, the agency
finds that the change in the evaporated milk standard is consistent with the intent of the standard and, therefore,
is revising the standard as proposed.
 2. The comment disagreed that the test results that ADPI submitted from a monadic (i.e., single-product evaluation)
in-home use test were a reliable indication of real consumer preferences. The comment stated that monadic ratings
are not accepted by organizations such as the National Advertising Division of the Better Business Bureau to support
product comparative claims.
 FDA acknowledges the comment's concern that ADPI's in-home use test was not a conclusive demonstration that consumers
preferred the lower fat, lower solids evaporated milk over the traditional standardized evaporated milk. However,
ADPI submitted information in its petition on a total of three industry research tests on consumer perceptions of
traditional standardized evaporated milk compared to evaporated milk manufactured to conform to the parameters
for which ADPI had petitioned. The monadic in-home use test was only one of these tests. In the other two tests, each
participant was able to evaluate both products.
 FDA has reviewed the studies that ADPI submitted (Ref. 3). The agency concludes that there was sufficient evidence
to support ADPI's claim that consumers were unable to distinguish between the standardized evaporated milk and evaporated
milk manufactured to conform to the petitioned parameters. Taken individually, the studies did not provide overwhelming
data, but the combined weight of the three studies has convinced the agency that consumers' perceptions of the two
products were not significantly different. Each test was performed under different circumstances (i.e., employing
different evaluation techniques) and used a different representative sample of consumers. The studies examined
a wide variety of possible consumer uses of evaporated milk in realistic, everyday situations. Additionally, these
were separate studies employing within-subjects and between-subjects designs that came to identical conclusions.
Based on all of the evidence in the petition, the agency finds that it can conclude that consumers are unable to discriminate
between standardized evaporated milk and the evaporated milk manufactured to conform to the suggested parameters.
 3. The comment stated that the overwhelming use of evaporated milk is in recipes, and that it was not aware of anyone
reconstituting evaporated milk for beverage use in the United States. The comment questioned whether consumers
consider evaporated milk to be a 2:1 concentrate of fluid milk, and whether the amendment would make reconstitution
for beverage use more convenient. 
 The agency agrees that evaporated milk is used primarily as an ingredient of other foods. FDA notes that evaporated
milk may be used in recipes, as manufactured, or in reconstituted form as a direct replacement for milk. Another significant
use of evaporated milk is in coffee and tea (Ref. 4). Although the common consumption of reconstituted evaporated
milk as a beverage is decreasing (Refs. 5 and 6), evaporated milk does replace fluid milk for beverage purposes in individual
households as a result of commercial purchases, as well as through the USDA commodity distribution program; in institutions;
and by participants in the USDA Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (Ref. 4). In fact, one comment
from a consumer stated that he and his family have used evaporated milk regularly in food recipes, in coffee, and in
the preparation of beverage milk.
Evaporated milk has been touted as a 2:1 concentration of milk for many years (Ref. 7). A 2:1 concentrate is easier for
consumers to reconstitute than a 2.3:1 concentrate because it is in whole units. In addition, as noted above, a 2:1
concentrate, when diluted, results in a product whose composition is the same as that for beverage milk. Therefore,
FDA concludes that providing for a 2:1 concentrate of milk under the standard of identity for evaporated milk is in
the best interest of consumers, and that the concerns raised by the comment are without merit.
 4. The comment argued that a change in the standard of identity for evaporated milk is unnecessary because consumers
that want a lower fat, lower cholesterol evaporated milk can purchase evaporated lowfat milk or evaporated skimmed
milk.
 FDA notes that consumers may continue to purchase evaporated lowfat milk or evaporated skimmed milk. However, comments
from a manufacturer of evaporated milk that were submitted in support of the proposal stated that many of its customers
have expressed an interest in lower fat and lower calorie foods, and that the amendment would afford it (the commenting
manufacturer) the opportunity to meet the demands of this segment of the public. Furthermore, the fat reduction,
although modest, is consistent with ``The Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health'' (Ref. 8) and the National
Academy of Sciences' report on ``Diet and Health, Implications for Reducing Chronic Disease Risk'' (Ref. 9), which
recommend that consumers reduce their consumption of fats and cholesterol. Therefore, FDA finds that the amended
standard will benefit consumers.
 FDA also notes that the nutritional benefit is only one of several bases that support the amended standard. Therefore,
FDA concludes that the argument raised by the comment is without merit.

 5. The comment noted that the proposed reduction in the minimum required milkfat content and milk solids content in
evaporated milk would make the U.S. standard of identity for evaporated milk inconsistent with the International
Codex standard for evaporated milk.
 FDA acknowledges that the amended standard is not identical to the International Codex standard for evaporated milk.
The Codex standard requires that evaporated milk contain not less than 7.5 percent of milkfat and not less than 25 percent
of total milk solids. Because the new requirements in the standard that FDA is adopting will establish lower values
for minimum milkfat and minimum total milk solids content than those of the Codex standard for evaporated milk, products
complying with the Codex standard will meet FDA's standard of identity. U.S. exporters of evaporated milk may need
to reformulate their products if they are to be shipped to countries that require that the food comply with the minimum
requirements of the Codex standard, but this fact provides no basis for not making the proposed change in the standard.
 Accordingly, after consideration of all comments, the agency is amending the standard of identity for evaporated
milk in  131.130(a) by reducing the minimum milkfat content requirement from 7.5 percent to 6.5 percent by weight,
reducing the minimum total milk solids content requirement from 25 percent to 23 percent by weight, and establishing
a minimum milk solids-not-fat content requirement of 16.5 percent by weight. FDA concludes that the amendments will
promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers.



 III. Economic Impact


 FDA has examined the economic implications of this final rule to amend the standard of identity for evaporated milk
in 21 CFR part 131 as required by Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354).
E.O. 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation
is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental,
public health, and safety effects; distributive impacts; and equity). The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires
that the agency analyze options for regulatory relief for small businesses.
 On July 22, 1992, FDA analyzed the economic impact of the requirements that the agency is adopting under the previous
E.O. 12291 and found that they would not have a significant impact on small business. The agency noted in the proposed
rule that manufacturers may continue to process evaporated milks using current formulations. Thus, no changes are
required in formulations unless manufacturers wish to reformulate their products. In the proposal, the agency tentatively
concluded that the regulation would have zero costs associated with it. FDA has received no information or comments
that would alter the tentative finding that it set out in the proposed rule that there is no substantive economic issue
in this rulemaking. 
 Thus, the agency finds that this final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined in E.O. 12866. In compliance
with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agency certifies that the final rule will not have a significant impact on
a substantial number of small businesses.
 


 IV. Environmental Impact


 The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(b)(1) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.



 V. Objections


 Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before May 16, 1994, file with the Dockets
Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered, and
each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection is
made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Food and Drug Administration




<DOCTITLE>Oral Dosage Form New Animal Drugs; Tetracycline Hydrochloride Soluble Powder</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of two supplemental
new animal drug applications (NADA's) for safe and effective use of tetracycline hydrochloride soluble powder.
One supplemental NADA was filed by Wade Jones Co., Inc., and covers the use of the drug product in the drinking water
of calves and swine for the control and treatment of certain bacterial diseases and in the drinking water of poultry
for the control of certain bacterial diseases susceptible to the drug. The other supplemental NADA was filed by Pfizer,
Inc., and also covers use of the drug in the drinking water of poultry for the control of certain susceptible bacterial
diseases. Both approvals reflect compliance with the results of the National Academy of Sciences/National Research
Council (NAS/NRC), Drug Efficacy Study Group's (DESI) evaluation of the drug's effectiveness and FDA's conclusions
concerning that evaluation. Additionally, the agency is technically amending the regulations to make other needed
corrections. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background


Wade Jones Co., Inc., 409 North Bloomington, Lowell, AR 72745 (Wade Jones), filed a supplement to approved NADA 65-140
for a soluble powder containing 324 grams (g) of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC HCl) activity per pound (lb). The
drug is available in several product container sizes, 2 and 5 lb tubs and 2.53, 5, and 10 ounce (oz) packets. The drug
is indicated for use in chickens at 200 to 400 milligrams per gallon (mg/gal) for control of infectious synovitis caused
by 

Mycoplasma synoviae

 and at 400 to 800 mg/gal for control of chronic respiratory disease caused by 

M. gallisepticum

 and E. coli. The drug is indicated for use in turkeys at 400 mg/gal for control of infectious synovitis caused by 

M. synoviae

 and at 25 mg/lb of body weight for control of complicating bacterial organisms associated with bluecomb. It is also
indicated for use in swine and calves at 10 mg/lb of body weight for control and treatment of bacterial enteritis (scours)
and bacterial pneumonia. The NADA was originally approved July 5, 1966. 


Pfizer, Inc., 235 East 42d St., New York, NY 10017 (Pfizer), filed supplemental NADA 65-123 for TC HCl soluble
powder (6.4 ounce (oz) packet) to provide for use in chickens and turkeys under the same conditions of use expressed
above for the Wade Jones application. The NADA was originally approved April 27, 1955.


 II. The NAS/NRC DESI Evaluation


The drug products were subject to a NAS/NRC DESI evaluation of effectiveness (DESI 0012NV). The findings were published
in the 

Federal Register

 of July 8, 1970 (35 FR 10966). NAS/NRC evaluated the products as ``probably effective'' for oral treatment of animal
diseases when such diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms sensitive to tetracycline hydrochloride,
diseases such as: (1) Enteric and respiratory diseases in poultry; (2) gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases
in swine; (3) infected wounds, gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in calves, sheep, and goats; (4) digestive
system and respiratory diseases, pyelonephritis, peritonitis, infected wounds, abscesses, ulcers, and secondary
bacterial invaders in dogs and cats; (5) coccidiosis in dogs; and (6) hexamitiasis in turkeys.
NAS/NRC reached the following conclusions applicable to the subject TC HCl drug products: 
(1) Most of the dosage directions provide for a less than effective dose, and the recommended minimum oral dose for
large animals is 10 mg/lb of body weight daily in divided doses and for small animals 25 mg/lb body weight daily in divided
doses; 
(2) claims for the treatment of viral diseases must be limited to microorganisms belonging to the psittacosis-lymphogranuloma
group; 
(3) each disease claim should be properly qualified as ``appropriate for use in (name of disease) caused by pathogens
sensitive to (name of drug),'' and if the disease cannot be so qualified the claim must be dropped; 
(4) claims made ``for prevention of'' or ``to prevent'' should be replaced with ``as an aid in the control of'' or ``to
aid in the control of''; (5) as applicable, the manufacturer's label should warn that treated animals must consume
enough medicated water or medicated feed to provide a therapeutic dose under the conditions that prevail_as a precaution,
the label should state the desired oral dose per unit of animal weight per day for each species as a guide to effective
use of the preparation in drinking water or feed. 
FDA concurred with the NAS/NRC findings, interpreting the phrase ``cannot be so qualified'' in item (3) of the paragraph
immediately above to mean ``is not supported by adequate data.'' FDA proceeded to review all available data relating
to the effectiveness of similar products to determine which label claims were supported by the requisite proof of
effectiveness. The review resulted in the agency concluding that the data supported effectiveness only for the control
and treatment of certain bacterial diseases susceptible to TC HCl in calves, swine, chickens, and turkeys.
Subsequently, Wade Jones and Pfizer complied with the NAS/NRC evaluation and FDA's conclusions by filing supplemental
NADA's which revised the drug products' labeling as follows: (1) Adopting the dosage recommended by NAS/NRC; (2)
dropping all claims for viral diseases; (3) properly qualifying disease claims; (4) revising prevention claims
to read ``Control of''; and (5) adding to the manufacturer's label the warning statement concerning factors influencing
adequate consumption of medicated water.
The NAS/NRC evaluation is concerned only with the drugs' effectiveness and safety to the treated animal. It does not
take into account the safety for human food use of food derived from drug-treated animals. 
Wade Jones' supplemental NADA is approved as of September 15, 1993, and Pfizer's supplemental NADA is approved as
of March 18, 1994. The regulations are amended by revising  520.2345d (21 CFR 520.2345d) to reflect the approvals.

FDA's approval of the supplemental NADA's does not involve a reevaluation or reaffirmation of the human food safety
data in the parent applications. Tolerances for residues of the drug and its metabolites in chickens, turkeys, swine,
and calves of 0.25 part per million are currently codified in 21 CFR 556.720.


III. Environmental Impact



The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of approving the Wade Jones Supplement.
FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental
impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that
finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305),
Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

With regard to approving the Pfizer supplement, the agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(d)(1)(i) that this action
is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore,
neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.

Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), these
approvals do not qualify for exclusivity periods because their applications do not contain reports of new clinical
or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and, in the case of food-producing animals,
human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to approval of the supplements
and conducted or sponsored by the applicants. 

In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and  514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21
CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), summaries of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval
of these applications may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.



IV. The Technical Amendments


In conjunction with amending  520.2345d to codify the NAS/NRC DESI finalization of Wade Jones' and Pfizer's
NADA's the agency is using this occasion to rewrite  520.2345d to clarify the regulations. Section 520.2345d
is the recodified version of section 546.180d(c). This latter section was one of many antibiotic drug sections affected
by the final rule that published in the 

Federal Register

 of August 18, 1992 (57 FR 37318) for the purpose of: (1) Removing the technical regulations that included the requirements
for certification and tests and methods of assay and (2) recodifying, based on route of administration, the remaining
provisions concerning conditions of marketing. However, when  546.180d was recodified, the agency did not
include other technical changes to update changes in the approved conditions of marketing. Accordingly, FDA is revising
 520.2345d to codify the currently approved conditions of marketing and to make the following needed corrections:
(1) The section heading is revised to fully identify the drug as the hydrochloride; (2) the ``

Specifications

'' paragraph is removed and information concerning drug concentrations is incorporated into the ``

Sponsors

'' paragraph; (3) the second sentence of the NAS/NRC status paragraph is removed because it has been superseded by
enactment of the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988; (4) the drug labeler code for Upjohn Co.
(000009) is removed because the firm was incorrectly listed as the sponsor of approvals for the use of TC HCl soluble

<DOCTITLE> Oral Dosage Form New Animal Drugs; Enalapril Maleate Tablets</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect the approval of a new animal
drug application (NADA) filed by Merck Research Laboratories, Division of Merck & Co., Inc. The NADA provides
for the oral use of ENACARD

TM

 (enalapril maleate) tablets for the treatment of heart failure in dogs.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Merck Research Laboratories, Division of Merck & Co., Inc., P.O. Box 2000, Rahway, NJ 07065, filed NADA 141-015
which provides for the use of ENACARD

TM

 containing 1, 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 milligrams (mg) of enalapril maleate per (/) tablet. ENACARD

TM

 tablets are administered to dogs once daily at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kilogram (kg) or twice daily at 0.5 mg/kg for a total
daily dose of 1.0 mg/kg for the treatment of mild, moderate, and severe (modified New York Heart Association Class
II, III, IV) heart failure in dogs. The NADA is approved as of February 24, 1994, and the regulations are amended in part
558 (21 CFR part 558) by adding new  520.804 to reflect the approval. The basis of approval is discussed in the
freedom of information summary.



In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and  514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21
CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval
of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm.
1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
 
 Section 512(c)(2)(F)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act provides a 5-year period of exclusivity to this
original NADA beginning February 24, 1994, because no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active
ingredient) has been approved in any other application under section 512(b)(1) of the act.

The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.

Rules for Administrative Review of Agency Decisions; Distress Terminations of Single-Employer Plans; Standard
Terminations of Single-Employer Plans



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On August 24, 1993, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') published an interim rule with request for
comments amending certain of its regulations (Administrative Review of Agency Decisions and Standard Terminations
of Single-Employer Plans) to permit the PBGC's Executive Director to grant relief from deadlines in the event of a
major disaster. The PBGC is now adopting these amendments as a final rule and also is amending its distress termination
regulation in order to give the Executive Director the authority to grant relief similar to that given in the interim
rule for standard terminations.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On August 24, 1993, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') published an interim rule with request for
comments amending its regulations on Rules for Administrative Review of Agency Decisions and Standard Terminations
of Single-Employer Plans (29 CFR parts 2606 and 2617, 58 FR 44738; as corrected, 58 FR 48680, September 17, 1993). The
interim rule provided that, when the President of the United States declares, under the Disaster Relief Act of 1974,
as amended (42 U.S.C. 5121, 5122(2), 5141(b)), that a major disaster (such as the 1993 flood disaster in the midwestern
United States) exists, the PBGC's Executive Director (or his or her designee) may grant relief from certain regulatory
deadlines by which persons are to submit filings to the PBGC or take other actions. The PBGC received no comments and
is adopting the interim rule as a final rule without change.




Before the interim rule was published,   2606.33 and 2606.53 of the PBGC's administrative review regulation
(29 CFR part 2606) provided deadlines for filing a request for reconsideration or appeal of an initial determination,
and  2606.4 provided for extensions of those deadlines for good cause shown and only if requested in writing
by the applicable filing deadline. The PBGC concluded that, when a major disaster like the 1993 midwestern flood is
declared, the above deadlines do not serve the agency's objective of making timely review available to aggrieved
persons. As amended,  2606.4 provides that the deadlines for filing a request for reconsideration or appeal
may be extended by the Executive Director (or his or her designee) when a major disaster is declared. The extension
may be for a period of up to 180 days and applies to any aggrieved person who resides in, or whose principal place of business
is within, a designated disaster area, or with respect to whom the office of the service provider, bank, insurance
company, or other person maintaining the information necessary to file the request for reconsideration or appeal
is within a designated disaster area.

Similarly, as amended   2617.25 and 2617.28 of the PBGC's standard termination regulation (29 CFR part
2617) include an exception to the deadlines (1) for filing the standard termination notice with the PBGC (  2617.3(b)(2)
and 2617.25(a)) and, consequently, for issuing notices of plan benefits to participants and beneficiaries (  2617.3(b)(3)
and 2617.23(a)) and (2) for completing the distribution of plan assets ( 2617.28(a), (e), and (f)). As in the
administrative review regulation, the Executive Director (or his or her designee) may extend these deadlines for
a period of up to 180 days when a major disaster is declared. The extension applies to plan terminations with respect
to which the principal place of business of the contributing sponsor or the plan administrator, or the office of the
service provider, bank, insurance company, or other person maintaining the information necessary to issue the notices
of plan benefits or file the standard termination notice, or to complete the distribution of plan assets (as applicable),
is within a designated disaster area.

The PBGC believes that similar relief should be available for plans terminating in distress terminations pursuant
to section 4041(c) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and the PBGC's distress termination
regulation (29 CFR part 2616). Sections 2616.3(b), 2616.24, and 2616.25(c)(2) establish deadlines for filing a
distress termination notice and related information with the PBGC. Section 2616.27(a)(1) establishes the deadline
for issuing notices of benefit distribution in those few terminations where the plan is sufficient for at least guaranteed
benefits and, accordingly, plan assets may be distributed to participants and beneficiaries in a manner similar
to a standard termination distribution. (The notices of distribution are similar to the notices of plan benefits
required in standard terminations under 29 CFR 2617.23.) Finally,  2616.29(a)(1) contains distribution
procedures and deadlines that are generally the same as those in standard terminations; that section cross-references
29 CFR 2617.28 (c), (e), and (f) and provides the same 180-day (unless extended) deadline for distribution.

The amendments in this final rule permit the PBGC's Executive Director (or his or her designee) to extend the above
deadlines in the same circumstances as were provided for standard terminations in the interim rule. (The PBGC did
not include distress terminations in the interim rule because the small number of distress terminations filed annually
lessened the need for prompt action; however, these provisions are essentially procedural in that they establish
alternative mechanisms for obtaining extensions of filing or other deadlines (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A)), and the notice
and public procedure and delayed effective date requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 therefore do not apply.)



E.O. 12866



The PBGC has determined that this action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the criteria set forth in
Executive Order 12866, because it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely
affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,
public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; create a serious inconsistency or
otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements,
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or raise novel legal or policy
issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order
12866.

In consideration of the foregoing, the interim final rule amending 29 CFR parts 2606 and 2617, as published on August
24, 1993, at 58 FR 44738 and corrected on September 17, 1993, at 58 FR 48600, is adopted as a final rule without change,

Director of the PBGC (or his or her designee) may, by issuing one or more notices of disaster relief, extend the due date
for filing the distress termination notice pursuant to  2616.24, for issuing the notices of benefit distribution
pursuant to  2616.27(a)(1), or for completing the distribution of plan assets pursuant to  2616.29,
by up to 180 days.

(b) The due date extension or extensions shall apply only to plan terminations with respect to which the principal

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans Florida: Approval of Revisions to the Florida State Implementation
Plan



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is approving revisions to the Florida State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the Florida Department of
Environmental Protection (FDEP) on July 2, 1993. These revisions replace references to specific sources with references
based on emissions or capacity.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


On July 2, 1993, the FDEP submitted revisions to the Florida SIP to replace references to specific sources with references
based on emissions or capacity. These revisions were made to Chapter 17-296 of the Florida Administrative Code
and were adopted on June 9, 1993. The amendments to Rule 17-296, F.A.C., Stationary Sources-Emission
Standards, specifically, sections 17-296.405, 17-296.406, and 17-296.701 were necessary to
eliminate references to specific sources of air emissions.

EPA is approving the following revisions to the Florida SIP. These revisions are more fully discussed in the official
SIP submittal that is available at the Region IV office listed under the ``ADDRESSES'' section of this document. The
revisions were made to Section 17-296.405, Fossil Fuel Steam Generators with more than 250 million Btu per hour
heat input, Section 17-296.406, Fossil Fuel Steam Generators with less than 250 million btu per hour heat input,
and Section 17-296.701, Portland Cement Plants. The rules previously included air emissions and application
of technologies for specifically named facilities. The amendments to the rule eliminate the references to those
facilities by their specific name, and makes it a more general rule applicable for those facilities. It does not establish
new emission standards, but merely precludes specific facility references.



Final Action



This action is being taken without prior proposal because the changes are noncontroversial and EPA anticipates no
significant comments on them. The public should be advised that this action will be effective [Insert date 60 days
from date of publication]. However, if notice is received by [Insert date 30 days from date of publication] hat someone
wishes to submit adverse or critical comments, this action will be withdrawn and two subsequent documents will be
published before the effective date. One document will withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking
by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period.


The Agency has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved SIP for conformance with the provisions
of the 1990 Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The Agency has determined that this action conforms with those
requirements irrespective of the fact that the submittal preceded the date of enactment.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed
in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by [Insert date 60 days from date of publication].
Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this
rule for purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed,
and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings
to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2).)
 
This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirements
of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and
Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request
continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for a revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.


SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans California State Implementation Plan Revision



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is finalizing limited approvals and limited disapprovals of revisions to the California State Implementation
Plan (SIP) proposed in the 

Federal Register

 on September 29, 1993. This final action will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. The intended
effect of finalizing this action is to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in accordance with
the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). The revised rules control VOC emissions from
metal container, closure, and coil coating, from wood products coating, and from graphic arts operations. EPA is
finalizing a simultaneous limited approval and limited disapproval under CAA provisions regarding EPA action on
SIP submittals and general rulemaking authority because these revisions, while strengthening the SIP, also do not
fully meet the requirements for non-attainment areas. As a result of this limited disapproval EPA will be required
to impose highway funding or emission offset sanctions under the CAA unless the State submits and EPA approves corrections
to the identified deficiencies within 18 months of the effective date of this disapproval. Moreover, EPA will be required
to promulgate a Federal implementation plan (FIP) unless the deficiencies are corrected within 24 months of the effective
date of this disapproval.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


Background


On September 29, 1993 at 58 FR 50884, EPA proposed granting limited approval and limited disapproval of the following
SCAQMD rules into the California SIP: Rule 1125, Metal Container, Closure, and Coil Coating Operations; Rule 1136,
Wood Products Coatings; and Rule 1130, Graphic Arts. Rule 1125 and Rule 1136 were adopted by SCAQMD on August 2, 1991
and submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to EPA on May 13, 1993. Rule 1130 was adopted by SCAQMD on
March 6, 1992 and submitted by CARB on September 14, 1992. These rules were submitted in response to EPA's 1988 SIP Call
and the CAA section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement that nonattainment areas fix their reasonably available control technology
(RACT) rules for ozone in accordance with EPA guidance that interpreted the requirements of the pre-amendment Act.
A detailed discussion of the background for each of the above rules and nonattainment areas is provided in the notice
of proposed rulemaking (NPR) cited above.
EPA has evaluated all of the above rules for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations and EPA's
interpretation of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the
NPR. EPA is finalizing the limited approval of these rules in order to strengthen the SIP and finalizing the limited
disapproval requiring the correction of the remaining deficiencies. These deficiencies are related to recordkeeping
requirements, test method references, Executive Officer discretion, control device equivalency, VOC limits,
and rule applicability. A detailed discussion of the rule provisions and evaluations has been provided in the NPR
and in technical support documents (TSDs) available at EPA's Region IX office (TSDs for SCAQMD's Rule 1125, Rule 1136,
and Rule 1130 dated April 30, 1993 and July 21, 1993). 


Response to Public Comments


A 30-day public comment period was provided at 58 FR 50884. EPA received no comment letters on the NPR.


EPA Action


EPA is finalizing a limited approval and a limited disapproval of the above-referenced rules. The limited approval
of these rules is being finalized under section 110(k)(3) in light of EPA's authority pursuant to section 301(a) to
adopt regulations necessary to further air quality by strengthening the SIP. The approval is limited in the sense
that the rules strengthen the SIP. However, the rules do not meet the section 182(a)(2)(A) CAA requirement because
of the rule deficiencies which were discussed in the NPR. Thus, in order to strengthen the SIP, EPA is granting limited
approval of these rules under sections 110(k)(3) and 301(a) of the CAA. This action approves the rules into the SIP
as federally enforceable rules.
At the same time, EPA is finalizing the limited disapproval of these rules because they contain deficiencies that
have not been corrected as required by section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, and, as such, the rules do not fully meet the
requirements of part D of the Act. As stated in the NPR, upon the effective date of this final rule, the 18 month clock
for sanctions and the 24 month FIP clock will begin. Sections 179(a) and 110(c). If the State does not submit the required
corrections and EPA does not approve the submittal within 18 months of the final rule, either the highway sanction
or the offset sanction will be imposed at the 18 month mark. It should be noted that the rules covered by this final rule
have been adopted by the SCAQMD and are currently in effect in the Los Angeles-South Coast Air Basin. EPA's limited
disapproval action in this final rule does not prevent SCAQMD or EPA from enforcing these rules.
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements. 


Regulatory Process


This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). A revision to the SIP processing review tables was approved by the Acting
Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro,
to the Regional Administrators). A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989,
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 222) from the requirements
of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and
Table 3 SIP 
 
revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues
in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by June 13, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by 
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section
307(b)(2)).

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Maryland (Revisions to Air Pollution Emergency
Episode Plan Requirements)




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Maryland. This revision revises
definitions and provisions to Maryland's air pollution emergency episode plan requirements. The intended effect
of this action is to incorporate by reference into the federally-enforceable SIP revised State regulations which
meet current Federal requirements. This action is being taken under section 110 of the Clean Air Act.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On June 7, 1990, the State of Maryland submitted a formal revision to its State Implementation Plan (SIP). The SIP revision
consists of amendments to Code of Maryland Administrative Regulations (COMAR) 26.11.05 governing air pollution
episode emergency plans. The amended provisions, which are applicable Statewide, are summarized below: 




1. COMAR 26.11.05.01A.-Definition of ``Air Stagnation Advisory (ASA)'' (added)
2. COMAR 26.11.05.01B.-Definition of ``Atmospheric stagnation'' (modified)
3. COMAR 26.11.05.01H.-Definition of ``Pollutant Standards Index (PSI)'' (added)
4. COMAR 26.11.05.01J.-Definition of ``Special Dispersion Statement (SDS)'' (added)
5. Deletion of the definition of ``Coefficient of haze.''
6. COMAR 26.11.05.02B.,.02C.-Administrative changes making clear that the Maryland Department of the Environment
(MDE) Secretary's designee is empowered to declare conditions of air pollution designated as Standby Watch, Health
Advisory, Alert, Warning, or Emergency. 

7. COMAR 26.11.05.03A.,B, D.-Air Pollution Episode Criteria
Administrative changes similar to those made in COMAR 26.11.05.02B. and C. Replacement of forecast stage with a standby
watch stage and a health advisory stage.
 
8. COMAR 26.11.05.05A.-Control Requirements and Standby Orders. Administrative changes. Replacement of
forecast stage with a standby watch stage and a health advisory stage.

9. COMAR 26.11.05.05B. through D.-administrative changes to broaden the definition of ``incineration''
in that so that the specific term ``refuse'' is deleted. 

The current SIP requires activation of episode plans either: (1) When air stagnations are forecasted; or (2) air pollutant
concentrations reach Alert Stage levels. However, revisions are necessitated to correct situations where the applicable
regulations did not require air pollution emergency episode plans to be activated, despite the fact that violations
of the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) had been recorded, but neither of the above conditions were
met.

To correct this situation, Maryland has instituted a revised system for activating air pollution episode plans before
air quality actually becomes unhealthful. The Forecast Stage has been replaced: (1) A Standby Watch Stage which will
be triggered when the PSI reaches a level of 83 (i.e., monitored air quality concentrations reach 83 percent of the
applicable National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS); and (2) a Health Advisory Stage which will be treated whenever
the PSI reaches a level of 100 (i.e., there is a monitored violation of the NAAQS). Maryland may also issue an SDS for
situations where forecasted atmospheric stagnations are expected to last between 12 and 36 hours. Maryland may also
issue an ASA where atmospheric stagnations are expected to last more than 36 hours, and is required to make a public
announcement within two hours of such declaration. (COMAR 26.11.05.03B.(1)(c).) 

The revisions to COMAR 26.11.05 have a limited impact on the attainment and maintenance of standards. The purpose
of emergency episode plans is to ensure that in the event of unhealthy air quality, there are SIP-enforceable provisions
which can be activated so as to minimize the exacerbation of unhealthy air quality levels (i.e., air quality levels
in excess of the NAAQS) through the activation of emergency control measures. The removal of the term ``refuse'' in
the context of incineration is consistent with requirements prescribed in 40 CFR part 51, appendix L regarding the
curtailment of incinerator use when invoking air pollution emergency episode plans. The prescribed requirements
in appendix L call for curtailment of all incinerator use regardless of the type of material being burned. 

The revised requirements which replace the Forecast Stage still conform with the triggering levels and lengths of
air stagnation episodes prescribed in 40 CFR part 51, appendix L. In addition, the revised threshold levels for NO

2

, PM

10

, and ozone also conform with those prescribed in 40 CFR part 51, appendix L. Similarly, the removal of the COH threshold
levels is also consistent with EPA's view that COH measurements do not reflect the best means of measuring combined
SO

2

 and PM

10

 levels. Currently, there is no requirement in either 40 CFR part 51, subpart H or 40 CFR part 51, appendix L which requires
States to have COH threshold levels in their respective air pollution emergency episode plans.

EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective June 13, 1994 unless, by May 16, 1994, notice is
received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn
before the effective date by simultaneously publishing two subsequent documents. One document will withdraw the
final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment
period. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on June 13, 1994.




Final Action



EPA is approving the amendments to COMAR 26.11.05 described above as a revision to the Maryland SIP. The Agency has
also reviewed this SIP revision request for conformance with the provisions of the 1990 amendments enacted on November
15, 1990, and has determined that this action conforms with those requirements irrespective of the fact that the submittal
preceded the date of enactment.

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
 
This action has been classified as a Table 3 action for signature by the Acting Regional Administrator under the procedures
published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from
the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The USEPA has submitted a request for
a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules
on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order
12291 on September 30, 1993.


Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by [Insert date 60 days from date of publication]. Filing a petition
for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes
of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not
postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action regarding EPA's approval of revisions to Maryland's
air pollution emerency episode requirements (COMAR 26.11.05) may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce
its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Montana; State Implementation Plan for Columbia
Falls PM

10

 Nonattainment Area


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In this action, EPA approves the State implementation plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Montana to achieve attainment
of the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than
or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM

10

). The SIP was submitted by Montana to satisfy certain Federal requirements for an approvable moderate nonattainment
area PM

10

 SIP for Columbia Falls. The State has committed to complete several actions for this SIP, including issues regarding
its New Source Review and Prevention of Significant Deterioration regulations, test methods, emergency episode
plan, operating permit program, and contingency measures. EPA will take separate action, as appropriate, on these
rules when the State fulfills its related commitments.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background


The Columbia Falls, Montana area was designated nonattainment for PM

10

 and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act, upon enactment of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990.

1

 See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991); 40 CFR 81.327 (Flathead County; Columbia Falls and vicinity). The air quality planning
requirements for moderate PM

10

 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of part D, title I of the Act.





The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and
SIP revisions submitted under title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)).
Because EPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble
for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of title I advanced in this final action and the supporting rationale.
Those States containing initial moderate PM

10

 nonattainment areas were required to submit, among other things, the following provisions by November 15, 1991:



1. Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) (including such reductions in emissions
from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control
technology (RACT)) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993;
2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modelling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously
as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable;
3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress
(RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 
4. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM

10

 also apply to major stationary sources of PM

10

 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM

10

 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c), 188, and 189 of the Act.
Some provisions are due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM

10

 nonattainment areas were required to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified
major stationary sources of PM

10

 by June 30, 1992 (see section 189(a)). Such States also were required to submit contingency measures by November 15,
1993 that become effective without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has
failed to achieve RFP or to attain the PM

10

 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. See section 172(c)(9) and 57 FR 13543-13544.
On January 27, 1994, EPA announced its proposed approval of the Columbia Falls, Montana moderate nonattainment area
PM

10

 SIP as meeting those moderate PM

10

 SIP requirements due on November 15, 1991 (59 FR 3804-3808). In that proposed rulemaking action and related
Technical Support Document (TSD), EPA described in detail its interpretations of title I and its rationale for proposing
to approve the Columbia Falls moderate nonattainment area PM

10

 SIP taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented.
EPA requested public comments on all aspects of the proposal (please reference 59 FR 3808), and no comments were received
during the comment period, which ended on February 28, 1994. This final action on the Columbia Falls moderate nonattainment
area PM

10

 SIP is unchanged from the January 27, 1994 proposed approval action.
The discussion herein provides only a broad overview of the proposed action EPA is now finalizing. The public is referred
to the January 27, 1994 proposed rule for a more in depth discussion of the action now being finalized.


II. Response to Comments


EPA did not receive any public comments regarding its January 27, 1994 proposed approval of the Columbia Falls moderate
nonattainment area PM

10

 SIP (59 FR 3804-3808).


This Action


Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565-13566).
The Columbia Falls SIP consists of two submittals. The first contains the Flathead County Air Pollution Control Program
and Air Pollution Plan regulations. Flathead County contains two PM

10

 nonattainment areas for which SIPs were due in November 1991: Columbia Falls and Kalispell. The Flathead County regulations
apply to both areas and were submitted with the attainment demonstration for Kalispell on November 25, 1991, after
being approved by the Montana Board of Health and Environmental Sciences (MBHES) on November 15, 1991. The Columbia
Falls SIP and attainment demonstration were not submitted at that time since a permit necessary to the control strategy
for the SIP was not finalized. The MBHES issued that permit and approved the SIP on January 24, 1992. This second submittal
to EPA was made by the Governor on May 6, 1992. Final technical corrections to the SIP were received by EPA on June 15,
1993. The submittals were intended to satisfy those moderate PM

10

 SIP requirements due for Columbia Falls on November 15, 1991.
As described in EPA's proposed action on this SIP (59 FR 3804-3808, January 27, 1994), the Columbia Falls moderate
nonattainment area PM

10

 plan includes, among other things, a comprehensive and accurate emissions inventory, control measures that satisfy
the RACM requirement, a demonstration (including air quality modelling) that attainment of the PM

10

 NAAQS will be achieved by January 1, 1995

2

, provisions for meeting the November 15, 1994 quantitative milestone and reasonable further progress, and enforceability
documentation. Further, EPA proposed to determine that major sources of precursors of PM

10

 do not contribute significantly to PM

10

 levels in excess of the NAAQS in Columbia Falls

3

 Please refer to EPA's notice of proposed rulemaking (59 FR 3805) and the TSD for that action for a more detailed discussion
of these elements of the Columbia Falls plan.






In this final rule, EPA is announcing its approval of those elements of the Columbia Falls moderate nonattainment
area PM

10

 SIP that were due on November 15, 1991, and submitted by the Governor on November 25, 1991 and May 6, 1992, with technical
corrections submitted in a letter dated June 15, 1993. Specifically, EPA is approving the Flathead County rules (with
the exception of rules 501 through 506 which are specific to the city of Kalispell-EPA will take separate action
on the Kalispell PM

10

 nonattainment area control plan) and the Columbia Falls PM

10

 nonattainment area control plan.
EPA finds that the State of Montana's PM

10

 SIP for the Columbia Falls moderate nonattainment area meets the Reasonably Available Control Measures (RACM),
including Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT), requirement. Five sources/source categories were
identified as contributing to the PM

10

 nonattainment problem in Columbia Falls and, therefore, were targeted for control in the SIP. The State has demonstrated
that by applying control measures to area sources (re-entrained road dust, residential wood combustion, prescribed
burning, and motor vehicle exhaust), as well as reducing allowable emissions through air quality permit modifications
for the Plum Creek sawmill and fiberboard plant, Columbia Falls will be in attainment by January 1, 1995 (see footnote
# 2) and it does not appear that applying further control measures to these sources would expedite attainment. 
EPA views the following measures as reasonable, enforceable, and responsible for significant PM

10

 emissions reductions in Columbia Falls: (1) Flathead County Rules No. 601-606, which provide re-entrained
road dust controls, including sanding and chip sealing standards and street sweeping and flushing requirements;
(2) Flathead County Rules No. 201-209, which regulate prescribed burning; (3) Flathead County Air Pollution
Control Program, Chapter VIII, Sub-chapter 3, which contains a voluntary solid fuel burning device curtailment
program, and Sub-chapter 4, which lists materials prohibited from burning in wood or coal residential stoves; (4)
industry permit modifications made at Plum Creek to reduce allowable plant-wide emissions; and (5) the Federal tailpipe
standards, which provide an ongoing benefit due to fleet turnover. The RACM (including RACT) provisions in the SIP
are described further in the technical support document associated with EPA's January 27, 1994 notice of proposed
rulemaking on this SIP.
Further, although no credit was claimed in the SIP, EPA notes that the State has adopted, as part of the Columbia Falls
SIP, the Montana Smoke Management Plan, which sets standards for the regulation of prescribed burning. EPA approved
this plan in a separate rulemaking action. (59 FR 2988, January 20, 1994).
A more detailed discussion of the individual source contributions, their associated control measures (including
available control technology) and an explanation of why certain available control measures were not implemented,
can be found in the TSD accompanying EPA's proposed approval of the Columbia Falls moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area SIP (59 FR 3804). EPA has reviewed the State's documentation and concluded that it adequately
justifies the control measures to be implemented. The implementation of Montana's PM

10

 nonattainment plan for Columbia Falls will result in the attainment of the PM

10

 NAAQS by January 1, 1995 (see footnote # 2). By this action EPA is approving the Columbia Falls PM

10

 plan's control measures as satisfying the RACM, including RACT, requirement.
As noted, EPA did not propose to approve some aspects of the Columbia Falls SIP, as explained in the notice of proposed
rulemaking (59 FR 3804-3808) and associated TSD. To address deficiencies identified by EPA, the State adopted
commitments after public hearings on November 15, 1991 and January 24, 1992, and submitted the commitments to EPA
with the Governor's May 6, 1992 letter, as additional tasks to be completed to correct the deficiencies in the Columbia
Falls and statewide SIP. The State has fulfilled commitments related to SIP requirements due November 15, 1991 for
the Columbia Falls nonattainment area. Those items related to deficiencies in the statewide SIP will be addressed
in a separate action. EPA has determined that the Columbia Falls SIP can be fully approved without the State fulfilling
the remaining commitments. Therefore, EPA is tracking the State's efforts to meet these commitments, but approval
of the SIP for the Columbia Falls nonattainment area is not contingent upon the State meeting them by the specified
dates. Therefore, EPA will take separate action, as appropriate, when the remaining commitments are fulfilled by
the State. A more detailed discussion of the State's commitments can be found in EPA's January 27, 1994 proposed approval
of the Columbia Falls moderate nonattainment area PM

10

 SIP (59 FR 3804-3808) and the TSD for that action.
The State has made a separate commitment to testing and further dispersion modeling of emissions from the Columbia
Falls Aluminum Company (CFAC) facility. This facility is located outside the nonattainment area and emissions from
CFAC were not identified on the Chemical Mass Balance analysis of filters collected from the monitor in the Columbia
Falls nonattainment area. Emissions from CFAC are a potential concern, however, since this source accounts for 20
percent of the emission inventory (at permitted allowable emissions). EPA will continue to monitor the testing and
assist the State with any action required by the results.


Final Action


This document announces EPA's final action on the rulemaking proposed at 59 FR 3804. As noted elsewhere in this action,
EPA received no adverse public comments on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has
reclassified this action from Table 2 to Table 3 under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January
19, 1989.
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for a revision to any SIP. Each request for a revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific
technical, economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.


Regulatory Process


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600, 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but
simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does
not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small
entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation
of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state
action. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

 v. 

U.S. E.P.A.

, 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). 
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by June 13, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the
Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does
it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be file, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (See section
307(b)(2)).


Executive Order (EO) 12866


This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the
requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver
for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request.
This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September
30, 1993.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The USEPA is approving revisions to Minnesota's State Implementation Plan (SIP) for sulfur dioxide (SO

2

) for the Air Quality Control Region (AQCR) 131 area (excluding the Pine Bend area of Dakota County and the St. Paul Park/Ashland
area), which were submitted to USEPA on May 29, 1992. These SIP revisions were submitted by the State of Minnesota as
a means of demonstrating attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for SO

2

. The USEPA proposed to disapprove the originally submitted SIP revisions on September 13, 1993. However, that notice
of proposed rulemaking stated that if the issues identified within were satisfactorily addressed by the State by
the end of the 30-day comment period, and if no other significant adverse comments were received, USEPA would proceed
with a final approval. The issues were adequately addressed by the State and submitted to the USEPA on July 12, 1993.
No comments were received on the September 13, 1993, proposed action. Consequently, the USEPA is fully approving
the SO

2

 SIP revisions for AQCR 131. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background


On May 29, 1992, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) submitted to the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (USEPA), revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for sulfur dioxide (SO

2

) in Air Quality Control Region (AQCR) 131. The seven-county metropolitan area (AQCR 131) has been designated, by
the USEPA, as nonattainment for SO

2

. This submittal was intended to demonstrate attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for
SO

2

in AQCR 131, excluding an area surrounding the SO

2

 emission sources at Ashland Petroleum Company, and an area surrounding the SO

2

 emission sources at and near Koch Refining Company, located in Dakota County. These two sources and the surrounding
areas were subject to separate submittals and are addressed in separate rulemakings. 
On September 13, 1993, a document was published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 47840) which proposed disapproval of the SO

2

 SIP revision for AQCR 131. The proposed notice discussed the State submittal, including background information,
attainment demonstration, specific aspects of each administrative order, USEPA comments regarding the administrative
orders, comparison of submittal with sections 110 and 172 requirements, and proposed rulemaking action. The disapproval
was based on the issues which had been identified in the notice by the USEPA. However, the action also stated that if
the issues were satisfactorily addressed by the end of the 30-day comment period, and if no adverse comments were received,
the USEPA would proceed with a final approval. This final rule will present a brief summary of the State submittal,
detail how the USEPA identified issues were addressed, and present our recommendation for final approval. 


II. Submittal Summary


The SO

2

 SIP revisions submitted by the MPCA for the AQCR 131 area consisted primarily of administrative orders issued to five
facilities: (1) Minneapolis Energy Center, Inc.; (2) Northern States Power Company; (3) FMC and U.S. Navy (FMC has
since changed its name to Armament Systems Division of United Defense, L.P.); (4) GAF Corporation; and (5) Federal-Hoffman,
Incorporated. The administrative orders contained emission limits, operating restrictions, compliance methodologies,
and reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Technical support was also submitted which justified the limits
and restrictions in the administrative orders as well as explained the methodology used to demonstrate attainment.



Attainment Demonstration 


Section 172(c)(6) requires that revisions include enforceable emission limitations and other control measures,
means or techniques, necessary to provide for attainment of the applicable NAAQS. The State submittal demonstrated
attainment through the use of air dispersion modeling. The primary guidance for such demonstrations is the Guideline
on Air Quality Models, which specifies the criteria for selection of dispersion models and for estimation of emissions
and other model inputs. In accordance with that guidance, the dispersion modeling conducted for the five administrative
orders in this submittal was performed using the Industrial Source Complex Short-term (ISCST) model (version 90346)
for calculation of the 24-hour and 3-hour concentrations. The analysis used urban dispersion coefficients, five
years of National Weather Service meteorological data (surface data from the Minneapolis/St. Paul airport and upper
air data from St. Cloud), regulatory default parameters, and receptors spaced at 100 meter intervals at areas of maximum
impact. The emissions used in the modeling demonstration were based on the maximum emissions allowed at each facility.
The annual impacts were calculated in the original 1987 submittal using the Climatological Dispersion Model (CDM
2.0). The modeled concentrations, plus background concentrations and growth margins, showed attainment with the
3-hour, 24-hour, and annual NAAQS. 


Compliance 


The administrative orders for the five facilities each contain sections detailing how compliance is to be determined.
The methods used include continuous emissions monitors (CEMS), stack testing conducted in accordance with Reference
Methods 1 through 4, 6, 6a, or 6b, and regular fuel sampling and fuel supplier certification. The USEPA has determined,
based on guidance in the ``General Preamble for Future Proposed Rulemakings,'' published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 16, 1992 (57 FR 13498), that these compliance methods are adequate to provide for SO

2

 compliance monitoring at the affected facilities.



III. State Responses to USEPA Comments


The following are the administrative order revisions made by the State and submitted to USEPA on July 12, 1993, in response
to USEPA comments detailed in the notice of proposed rulemaking. In addition, the administrative order for FMC Corporation
and U.S. Navy was again revised on March 26, 1993 and an official SIP revision package was sent to the USEPA at that time.
Those revisions will also be discussed in this section. 


Federal Hoffman, Inc.


(1) A formula was added to the administrative order which calculates an emission rate in pounds of sulfur dioxide per
million British Thermal Units (lbs/mmBtu) from information on percent sulfur, density of the fuel oil, theoretical
sulfur to sulfur dioxide availability, and the heating value.
(2) It was made clear in the administrative order that the emission limits on emission points 82, 83, and 84, apply to
each point and not the group.
(3) The method used to determine the sulfur content of fuel oil is now clearly identified as an approved American Society
for Testing and Materials (ASTM) method.


FMC and U.S. Navy


(1) In response to a concern about monthly analysis of fuel oil for waste oil or waste solvents, the administrative
order was changed so that every time the Company adds waste oil or waste solvents to the fuel oil, the resulting fuel
oil will be sampled and analyzed.
(2) The method used to determine sulfur content of the fuel oil is now clearly identified as an approved ASTM method.

(3) A formula was added to the administrative order which calculates an emission rate in lbs/mmBtu from information
on percent sulfur, fuel oil coefficients for the type of fuel being burned, and the heating value.
Additional changes to the FMC and U.S. Navy order were requested in a March 26, 1993, SIP revision package submitted
by the State. The changes included the addition, in Exhibit 1 of the administrative order, of distillate oil as a fuel
type for boilers 1 through 13 (these boilers are also allowed to burn residual oil), three diesel generators were added
as emission points to Exhibit 1 (these diesel generators were included in the modeled attainment demonstration),
name changes for boilers 1A, 1B, and 2A, and associated changes to Part I.C.E of the administrative order which specifies
operating restrictions during the decommission of boilers 1 through 17 and their replacement with three new boilers.



GAF Building Materials Corporation


(1) The administrative order increases the sampling and analyzing frequency of the mixture of No. 6 fuel oil and knockout
oil (a petroleum based by-product) from a monthly to a weekly basis. If, after six months, the sulfur content of the
mixture is less than 1.3 percent, monthly sampling will be considered sufficient.
(2) The administrative order now contains a formula for use in calculating an emission rate in lbs/mmBtu from the recorded
sulfur content and heating value information. 
(3) The method used to determine sulfur content of the fuel oil and asphalt are specifically identified as approved
ASTM methods. A revision was also made to the recordkeeping section of the administrative order requiring the Company
to keep records on the mixture of fuel oil and knockout oil. 


Northern States Power


(1) The annual emission limit on emission point #3 has been revised and is now based on a daily, 365-day rolling average.
(2) Minor language changes were made to clarify that testing conditions and operating capacities may be specified
by the MPCA and/or the USEPA, and that the company shall obtain a permit amendment if required by State or Federal regulation.
(3) A comment regarding the need for a formula in the order was addressed by the use of continuous emission monitors
(CEMS) at the facility. The CEMS provide emissions data in lbs/mmBtu and lbs/hour. The section in the administrative
order discussing the operation and maintenance of the CEMS was revised to reflect a new date for beginning stack flow
monitoring. This was requested by the Company due to equipment installation problems and subsequent delays. 
(4) An additional revision was made to the administrative order limiting the types of fuel the Company is authorized
to burn. 


Minneapolis Energy Center, Inc.


(1) In response to an USEPA comment regarding emission limits on operating scenarios not included in the original
administrative order, the State has revised the order to include limits on all possible operating scenarios at the
facility. Dispersion modeling was submitted to support the additional limits. Also, information was included in
the administrative order for determining compliance when an operating scenario changes in the middle of an averaging
period.
(2) A formula was added to the administrative order to be used for calculating sulfur dioxide emissions in lbs/hr based
on data regarding fuel flow, fuel density and percent sulfur. 
(3) The administrative order was revised to require recordkeeping during periods of time when natural gas supplies
are interrupted and the Facility is burning distillate oil.
(4) The emission units for emission point number 1 were changed to correctly reflect Boilers 1, 2, and 3.
(5) An emergency diesel generator was added to the emission units included in the administrative order. The generator
is limited to 0.5 lbs of sulfur dioxide/mmBtu. The generator was included in the supplementary dispersion modeling
attainment demonstration noted in 1) above.


IV. Public Comment/USEPA Response 


There were no comments received on the notice of proposed rulemaking published on September 13, 1993. 


V. Rulemaking Action


The SO

2

 SIP revisions submitted to USEPA for AQCR 131 (except the Pine Bend area of Dakota County and the St. Paul Park/Ashland
area) dated May 29, 1992, and the supplemental amendments dated, March 26, 1993, and July 12, 1993, satisfy the general
requirements for implementation plans as detailed in section 110(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act and also the nonattainment
area plan requirements listed in subpart 1 of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act. The July 12, 1993, submittal satisfactorily
addressed the issues identified in the September 13, 1993, notice of proposed rulemaking. Consequently, given that
no other comments on the proposed rulemaking were received, USEPA is taking final action to approve Minnesota's SO

2

 SIP revision submittals for the above specified area of AQCR 131.
The enforceable element of the State's submittals are the administrative orders for five facilities in AQCR 131.
The codification portion of this document identifies the effective dates of the administrative orders and the names
and locations of the facilities covered. This final action incorporates into the SIP and makes federally enforceable
the administrative orders for: (1) FMC Corporation and U.S. Navy; (2) Federal Hoffman, Incorporated; (3) Northern
States Power-Riverside Plant; (4) GAF Corporation; and (5) Minneapolis Energy Center, Incorporated. 
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but
simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does
not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a regulatory
flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Clean
Air Act forbids USEPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. 

Union Electric Co.

 v. 

USEPA

, 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
This action makes final the action proposed at 58 FR 47840. As noted elsewhere in this action, USEPA received no adverse
public comment on the proposed action. Consequently, this action has been reclassified from Table 2 to Table 3 by the
Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989, (54 FR 2214-2225). A revision to the SIP processing review tables was approved by the Acting
Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional
Administrators). A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive
Order 12291 for a period of 2 years. USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions.
OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continued in effect
under Executive Order 12866 which superceded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by June 13, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the
Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does
it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2).)

ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 USEPA is approving the removal of a transportation control measure (TCM) as a revision to Minnesota's State Implementation
Plan (SIP) for carbon monoxide (CO). USEPA's action is based upon a revision request which was submitted by the State.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The CO SIP for the Duluth area was approved at 45 FR 40579 (June 18, 1980). The Duluth area was redesignated to attainment
for CO, see 51 FR 45319 (December 18, 1986), and 52 FR 6548 (March 4, 1987). On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101-549, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q. Pursuant to section 107(d)(4)(A),
the City of Duluth was designated nonattainment for CO as a result of monitored violations of the CO National Ambient
Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) during the 1988-1989 time period, see 56 FR 56694, November 6, 1991. On October
30, 1992, the State of Minnesota requested the removal of a TCM from the CO State Implementation Plan for Duluth. This
TCM is an improved truck turning radius. On September 24, 1993, USEPA proposed to approve the requested SIP revision,
see 58 FR 49952. The State also requested on that date that a maintenance plan for the area be approved and that the area
be redesignated to attainment of the CO NAAQS. Action on the maintenance plan and redesignation request is in a separate
notice.


The State Implementation Plan Revision


The State submitted rollback modeling that shows that the revision would not interfere with attainment of the CO NAAQS.
USEPA believes that the State has shown through rollback modeling of concentrations, air quality trends, and information
on the effect of the construction of I-35 on the amount of truck traffic that would be rerouted, that I-35
provides an equivalent or greater reduction in emissions than the improved truck turning radius TCM.
All of the transportation control measures with the exception of the improved truck turning radius have been implemented.
This turning radius would have made it easier for trucks to turn at 14th Avenue and 3rd Street east (Trunk Highway 61).
The City of Duluth discovered that enlarging the turning radius would require significant rerouting of utilities,
which probably was not legally feasible, since utility companies have equal eminent domain authority. In some cases,
trucks were using East 1st Street, which was not a designated truck route, to avoid the turn on 14th Avenue East and 3rd
Street East. The City erected a sign on 1st Street directing through truck traffic to 3rd Street East so that trucks
would not hamper movements on both 1st and 3rd Streets East.
Currently, a truck heading northeast from the southwestern part of Duluth would by pass Duluth's downtown on I-35
unless it had a delivery downtown. Construction on I-35 was completed on October 28, 1992. All through truck
traffic will now use I-35, eliminating permanently any need to widen the turning radius at the intersection
of 14th Avenue East and 3rd Street.

 Truck traffic will be able to access I-35 at Lake Avenue, 21st Avenue East, and 26th Avenue East. I-35 was
designed to allow traffic out of the downtown area and a sign informs truckdrivers to use an alternate route to lead
them out of the downtown area. 





The State submits that I-35 provides reductions of traffic and CO by the rerouting of traffic. The Minnesota
Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) forecasts that 28 percent of overall downtown traffic is now carried on I-35,
and more than 28 percent of overall downtown truck traffic is now carried on I-35. Mn/DOT forecasts that 42 percent
of all downtown traffic and about 42 percent of all downtown truck traffic will use I-35 instead of downtown streets.
The only trucks that will use Superior Street are the ones which are making local deliveries. Truck routes which divert
truck traffic off Superior Street will be maintained for trucks making deliveries elsewhere in Duluth and for trucks
carrying hazardous materials. All other trucks will use I-35.
The State has also shown that the completed I-35 will more than offset the reductions that would be obtained with
a truck turning radius. The truck turning radius would only have lessened the amount of emissions from trucks and vehicles
caught in traffic due to turning trucks. I-35 eliminated a substantial amount of emissions in the area around
14th Avenue East and 3rd Street, simply because trucks are taking I-35 instead. 
The State will track the SIP's progress in maintaining the standard by reviewing data from the local metropolitan
planning organization. 


Public Comment/USEPA Response


No adverse comments were received on the September 24, 1993, notice of proposed rulemaking. 

Rulemaking Action


USEPA approves the removal of the Improved Truck Turning Radius TCM from the SIP. The effect of I-35 as a permanent
improvement has more than adequately replaced the Truck Turning Radius TCM.
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
This action makes final the action proposed on September 24, 1993 (58 FR 49952) to approve Minnesota's requested SIP
revision. This action has been reclassified from a Table 1 to a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the
procedures published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). A revision to the SIP processing review tables was approved by the Acting
Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993. A future document will inform the general
public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions
(54 FR 222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The USEPA has submitted a request
for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time
as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continued in effect under Executive Order 12886 which superseded Executive
Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 
 Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids USEPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

Approval of Maintenance Plan and Designation 
of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; Minnesota 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 USEPA is approving a redesignation request and maintenance plan for the City of Duluth as a revision to Minnesota's
State Implementation Plan (SIP) for carbon monoxide. 



The revision is based on a request from the State of Minnesota to redesignate this area, and approve its maintenance
plan, and on the supporting data the State submitted. Under the Clean Air Act, designations can be changed if sufficient
data are available to warrant such change. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under section 107(d) of the pre-amended Clean Air Act (CAA), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)
promulgated the carbon monoxide (CO) attainment status for each area of every State. For Minnesota the Duluth area
was designated nonattainment for CO, see 43 FR 8962 (March 3, 1978), and 43 FR 45993 (October 5, 1978). The Duluth area
was redesignated to attainment for CO, see 51 FR 45319 (December 18, 1986), and 52 FR 6548 (March 4, 1987). On November
15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990 were enacted. Pubic Law No. 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified
at 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q. Pursuant to section 107(d)(4)(A), the City of Duluth was designated nonattainment
for CO as a result of monitored violations of the CO National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) during the 1988-1989
time period, see 56 FR 56694, November 6, 1991. The City of Duluth was classified as a low moderate CO nonattainment
area based on a design value below 12.7 ppm. On October 30, 1992, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) submitted
a maintenance plan and a request for the redesignation of the City of Duluth, Minnesota to attainment of the NAAQS for
CO. The redesignation request was accompanied by a report containing information supporting the redesignation
request. On November 10, 1993, the State of Minnesota transmitted the results of their public hearing and additional
information. On December 22, 1993, the MPCA provided further detail on the schedule for implementing their maintenance
plan.

USEPA has provided guidance on processing redesignation requests in a September 4, 1992, memorandum from John Calcagni,
Director, Air Quality Management Division, Subject: Procedures for Processing Requests to Redesignate Areas to
Attainment (Redesignation Memorandum). This guidance memorandum was used in the evaluation of the submittal. The
State of Minnesota has met all of the CAA requirements for redesignation pursuant to section 107(d)(3)(E). The State
has included a copy of the base year 1990 emissions inventory as the attainment inventory. The attainment emissions
inventory contained point, area, and mobile source carbon monoxide emissions in tons per year and for a typical winter
day in Duluth.

Public Comment/USEPA Response 



No adverse comments were received on the September 24, 1993, notice of proposed rulemaking. 



Rulemaking Action 



The amended Clean Air Act established a new submittal requirement with respect to various programs. Therefore, USEPA
reviewed the State's submittal, to determine whether the State met the applicable requirements of the amended Act.


The redesignation request can now be approved as meeting conditions of the CAA in section 107(d)(3)(E) for redesignation,
since the State has submitted a schedule for implementing the contingency plan. The State has also met the terms of
the May 26, 1988, SIP call for the Minnesota portion of the Duluth Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) consisting
of St. Louis County, Minnesota.

The applicable New Source Review (NSR) requirements for moderate CO areas are in section 172(c)(5) of the Act. Section
172(b) establishes a date no later than November 15, 1993, for submittal of the section 172(c) requirements. Since
USEPA has not established an earlier date for submittal, the NSR requirement did not become an applicable requirement
until November 15, 1993. Since Minnesota submitted the redesignation request for Duluth prior to November 15, 1993,
and the area is now designated attainment, there is no longer a requirement for nonattainment area CO NSR. 

The amended Act also specifies new requirements_i.e., requirements not established under the pre-amended Act_for
CO nonattainment areas. These include an oxygenated fuels program and an emissions inventory. These requirements
were due on November 15, 1992. Since Minnesota submitted the redesignation request prior to November 15, 1992, the
State was not required to submit these plan elements for purposes of redesignation. Further, since the area is now
designated attainment for CO, the CO emissions inventory and oxygenated fuels SIPs are no longer required for the
Duluth area. 

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 

This action makes final the action proposed on September 24, 1993 (58 FR 49956) to approve Minnesota's requested redesignation.
USEPA received no public comment on the proposed rule. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has reclassified
this action from Table 1 to a Table 3 under the processing procedures published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Assistant
Administrator for Air and Radiation. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget waived Tables Two and
Three SIP revisions (54 FR 222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years. USEPA
has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the
waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866
which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a 
substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids USEPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

Redesignation of an area to attainment under section 107(d)(3)(E) of the CAA does not impose any new requirements

will not affect a substantial number of small entities. 

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United

Tolerance Exemption for Trimethylolpropane; Technical Amendment




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; Technical amendment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document makes a technical amendment to a regulation establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance
for residues of trimethylolpropane (CAS Registry No. 77-99-6) when used as an inert ingredient (component of water-soluble
film) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops only. A limitation of 15% of the formulation that was inadvertently
listed is changed to the intended 15% of the film limitation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of August 25, 1993 (58 FR 44766), EPA issued a regulation adding trimethylolpropane (CAS Reg. No. 77-99-6), a component
in water-soluble film, to 40 CFR 180.1001(d) as an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for pesticides under
section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346a). The exemption included with the limit ``Not
to exceed 5% by weight of the film.'' In the preamble to the final rule, EPA discussed a comment requesting that the 5%
limit be raised and announced that it would be addressed in a separate notice.


A proposal to raise the limit to 15% was published in the 

Federal Register

 of November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62071), and the amendment was finalized on January 19, 1994 (59 FR 2751). Although the discussion
in the preamble of the November 24th proposal indicated clearly that trimethylolpropane was used in water-soluble
films at levels up to approximately 15%, all expressions of the limits in the proposed and final rules on the amendment
to the exemption were as percentages ``of the formulation.'' Even the previous final rule was incorrectly described
in the November 24th proposal as having ``a limitation that it will not exceed 5% of the pesticide formulation.'' This
document corrects this error by delineating the appropriate limits so that the exemption will be correctly listed
in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). EPA is issuing this technical amendment without notice and comment periods
because it is merely a technical change which restores the scope of the exemption to what was intended by EPA, the original
petitioner, the commenter who sought to raise the limit, and all other commenters on this exemption.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action finalizes a rule implementing for grants and cooperative agreements, the Secretarial Outreach Issue
Paper Decision_Issue 4_Endorsement of Commercial Products or Services. Former Secretary Lujan determined that
as a matter of Departmental policy, there should be a provision in all contracts (exceeding $25,000), assistance
agreements, and Memoranda of Understanding/Agreement (MOAs) which would prevent the nongovernmental party from
using the arrangement to imply Government endorsement of a product, service or position which the recipient represents
in its commercial advertising.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Department published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the August 6, 1992, 

Federal Register 

(57 FR 34755-34756). Bureaus and offices within the Department are entering into a variety of partnership agreements
with profit and nonprofit organizations, through which the bureaus receive support of various kinds. This may include
dissemination of information about programs, promotion of activities of mutual interest which further those programs,
and generation of financial and other types of support, where authorized. These types of agreements are consistent
with a Department emphasis on partnerships and cooperative efforts to accomplish public purposes, and therefore
are encouraged. However, under these agreements, there is risk that certain promotional material produced under
the agreement, such as publications, advertisements in newspapers, magazines, and on television, might improperly
infer agency endorsement of a product, service, or position which the recipient represents. Following the consideration
of several alternative policies and procedures to ensure compliance with these provisions in various types of contracts
and agreements, the former Secretary decided to adopt the policy of including a provision that prohibits the recipient/contractor
from using improper endorsements in promotional material in all contracts (exceeding $25,000), assistance agreements,
and Memoranda of Understanding/Agreement. 



Comments on the Proposed Rule 



One public comment was received by the Department. The commenter stated that, as a private nonprofit organization,
it serves as an adviser to the Federal Government and that their credibility is maximized by the recognized impartiality
of the institution. In order to maintain this objectivity, it has been their long-standing policy not to accept contractual
provisions that would permit a sponsor to control either the timing of the release or the information contained in
their final reports. Copies of the reports are provided to sponsors up to fourteen days before release to the public,
but there is no obligation on their part to accept comments or to incorporate suggested changes. 

The commenter also stated that the proposed coverage in  12.2(d)(2)(i) for non-research awards which would
require prior Government approval for public information releases, would not be acceptable for work done by their
organization and would require time consuming waivers on each instrument awarded by the Department prior to acceptance
by them. The suggestion was made to include nonprofit organizations, in addition to * * * ``a Sate or
local government * * *,'' as an exception to the coverage in  12.2(d)(2), or to authorize the
use of the wording in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) for research awards in all of their agreements. The Department does not
accept the suggestion to exclude nonprofit organizations from coverage, because this would be contrary to the basic
intent of the policy to exclude only governmental parties. 

The commenter stated that the proposed coverage for research awards was acceptable.

With the publication of the final rule, the Department is clarifying the scope of covered awards under this policy.
The policy is limited to those grants/cooperative agreements that have as their principal purpose a relationship
wherein the recipient/partner will contribute resources to promote agency programs, publicize agency activities,
assist in fundraising, or provide assistance to the agency. Therefore, because of the unlikelihood of a research
award meeting this criteria, we are eliminating the separate distinction and policy for research awards. In determining
the applicability of the policy, the focus should be on the purpose of the award. For such an award, the Department's
policy should apply whether the award is for research or not.


Executive Order 12866, Paperwork Reduction Act, and Regulatory Flexibility Act


This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866.
The Department has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities, since this rule merely implements a former Secretarial decision concerning the prohibition of recipients
to use the Department's use of services and products provided as an endorsement. This revision to the rule does not
contain a collection of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

).


Environmental Effects


The Department has determined that this rule does not constitute a major Federal action having significant impact
on the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.


Executive Order 12778


The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these proposed regulations meet the applicable
standards provided in Sections 2 (a) and 2 (b) of Executive Order No. 12778.

products or processes of manufacturers or the services of commercial firms for advertising, publicity, or sales
purposes. The Department's use of materials, products, or services does not constitute official endorsement.
(2) The policy in paragraph (d)(1) of this section applies to a grant/cooperative agreement whose principal purpose
is a partnership where the recipient/partner contributes resources to promote agency programs, publicize agency
activities, assists in fundraising, or provides assistance to the agency. In the event that such a grant/cooperative
agreement is awarded to a recipient, other than a State government, a local government, or a federally-recognized
Indian tribal government, and authorizes joint dissemination of information and promotion of activities being
supported, the following provision shall be made a term and condition of the award:


Grant/Cooperative Agreement Provision


Recipient shall not publicize or otherwise circulate, promotional material (such as advertisements, sales brochures,
press releases, speeches, still and motion pictures, articles, manuscripts or other publications) which states
or implies governmental, Departmental, bureau, or government employee endorsement of a product, service, or position
which the recipient represents. No release of information relating to this award may state or imply that the Government
approves of the recipient's work products, or considers the recipient's work product to be superior to other products
or services.
All information submitted for publication or other public releases of information regarding this project shall
carry the following disclaimer:
The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as representing
the opinions or policies of the U.S. Government. Mention of trade names or commercial products does not constitute
their endorsement by the U.S. Government.
Recipient must obtain prior Government approval for any public information releases concerning this award which
refer to the Department of the Interior or any bureau or employee (by name or title). The specific text, layout photographs,
etc. of the proposed release must be submitted with the request for approval.
A recipient further agrees to include this provision in a subaward to any subrecipient, except for a subaward to a State
government, a local government, or to a federally-recognized Indian tribal government.


[End of Provision]


(3) Recipient requests for clearance of public releases will be reviewed using existing public information mechanisms
through the appropriate Public Affairs Office and with consultation with the cognizant Ethics Officer.

Changes in Flood Elevation Determinations 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Modified base (100-year) flood elevations are finalized for the communities listed below. These modified elevations
will be used to calculate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings and their contents.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Federal Emergency Management Agency makes the final determinations listed below of modified base flood elevations
for each community listed. These modified elevations have been published in newspapers of local circulation and
ninety (90) days have elapsed since that publication. The Associate Director has resolved any appeals resulting
from this notification. 



The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are not listed for each community in this notice. However, this rule
includes the address of the Chief Executive Officer of the community where the modified base flood elevation determinations
are available for inspection. 

The modifications are made pursuant to section 206 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and
are in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq., and with 44 CFR part 65. 

For rating purposes, the currently effective community number is shown and must be used for all new policies and renewals.


The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis for the floodplain management measures that the community
is required to either adopt or to show evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or to remain qualified
for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. 

These modified elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum
that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must change any existing ordinances that
are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community may at any time enact stricter requirements
of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, state or regional entities. 

These modified elevations are used to meet the floodplain management requirements of the NFIP and are also used to
calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings built after these elevations are made
final, and for the contents in these buildings. 

The changes in base flood elevations are in accordance with 44 CFR 65.4.

<DOCTITLE>Final Flood Elevation Determinations </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).


 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Base (100-year) flood elevations and modified base (100-year) flood elevations are made final for the communities
listed below. The base (100-year) flood elevations and modified base flood elevations are the basis for the floodplain
management measures that each community is required either to adopt or to show evidence of being already in effect
in order to qualify or remain qualified for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Federal Emergency Management Agency makes final determinations listed below of base flood elevations and modified
base flood elevations for each community listed. The proposed base flood elevations and proposed modified base flood
elevations were published in newspapers of local circulation and an opportunity for the community or individuals
to appeal the proposed determinations to or through the community was provided for a period of ninety (90) days. The
proposed base flood elevations and proposed modified base flood elevations were also published in the 

Federal Register

. 



This final rule is issued in accordance with section 110 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104,
and 44 CFR part 67. 

FEMA has developed criteria for floodplain management in floodprone areas in accordance with 44 CFR part 60. 

Interested lessees and owners of real property are encouraged to review the proof Flood Insurance Study and FIRM available
at the address cited below for each community. 

The base flood elevations and modified base flood elevations are made final in the communities listed below. Elevations
at selected locations in each community are shown. 



National Environmental Policy Act 



This rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR part 10, Environmental Consideration. No environmental
impact assessment has been prepared. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Associate Director, Mitigation Directorate, certifies that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act because final or modified base flood elevations are required by the Flood Disaster Protection
Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and are required to establish and maintain community eligibility in the NFIP. No regulatory
flexibility analysis has been prepared. 




Regulatory Classification



This final rule is not a significant regulatory action under the criteria of section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866
of September 30, 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review, 58 FR 51735.



Executive Order 12612, Federalism 



This rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 12612, Federalism, dated
October 26, 1987. 



Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform



This rule meets the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. 



List of Subjects in 44 CFR Part 67

Atlantic Tuna Fisheries 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) issues this interim final rule to revise the regulations governing the Atlantic
tuna fisheries to: Establish fishing category quota allocations for the 1994 fishing season; amend the specified
amount of other species to be landed as a condition for landing an incidental bycatch of bluefin in the southern longline
fishery; adjust the line that separates the northern and southern regulatory areas for vessels using longline gear
and possessing an Incidental Catch permit for bluefin; and make technical corrections to clarify the regulatory
text. 


This action is necessary to implement the recently adopted quota recommendation of the International Commission
for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), to improve management and monitoring of the U.S. bluefin fisheries,
to facilitate enforcement, and to enhance collection of data to improve assessment of the impacts of the fisheries.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Atlantic tuna fisheries are managed under regulations at 50 CFR part 285 implementing the recommendations of
ICCAT and issued under the authority of the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (ATCA), 16 U.S.C. 971 

et seq

. The ATCA authorizes the Secretary to implement regulations as may be necessary to carry out the recommendations
of ICCAT. The authority to implement the ICCAT recommendations is delegated from the Secretary to the Assistant Administrator
for Fisheries, NOAA (AA). 


Purpose of Current Action 


Background information about this action was provided in the proposed rule (59 FR 2813, January 19, 1994) and is not
repeated here. 


Management Measures 


These regulatory changes will improve NMFS' ability to implement the ICCAT recommendations and further the management
objectives for the domestic tuna fisheries: 


1. Quota Allocations 


Quota allocations by permit category are maintained at the 1993 level. The required 1 percent overall reduction for
the U.S. fishery is taken from the reserve category. 


2. Boundary Adjustment 


The line designating the northern and southern management areas for the Incidental category is adjusted south to
34
  N. latitude. 


3. Minimum Landings Requirement 


The directed fishery minimum poundage requirement of landing one bluefin tuna in the southern management area for
vessels permitted in the Incidental category is decreased to 1,500 pounds (680 kg) during the months of January through
April, and is increased to 3,500 (1,588 kg) pounds during the months of May through December. 


4. Technical Corrections 


A number of technical corrections to the regulations at 50 CFR part 285 are made to: Add definitions for straight fork
length and curved fork length; delete an obsolete reference to at-sea processing of bluefin tuna; adjust the conditions
under which retention of small fish is authorized to account for the recently implemented Angling category permit
and prohibit possession of small bluefin taken by unauthorized gear; clarify the catch limits which apply to vessels
holding permits for both the Angling and General categories; define more clearly the biweekly reporting periods
for bluefin tuna transactions; and instruct bluefin dealers to mail required reporting forms at the dealer's expense.
These changes will not affect the conduct of the tuna fisheries except to facilitate enforcement. Without such changes,
the fisheries cannot be monitored or enforced with maximum effectiveness.

Comments and Responses 


1. Quota Allocations 




Comment

: Given the need for stock-rebuilding, allocating 301 mt to the purse seine category is unjustified. 


Response

: Within limits and guidelines arising from recommendations of ICCAT, as required by U.S. law, NMFS allocated a limited
resource to the various categories according to historical catch shares. This allocation based on historical share
was established in 1992, following the 1991 ICCAT-recommended reductions in quota for the western Atlantic. 


Comment

: NMFS needs to establish a set-aside for the traditional NY Bight recreational fishery. 


Response

: The total quota of school bluefin tuna that NMFS has at its disposal (99 mt or 8 percent of its national quota) was determined
by ICCAT at the November, 1993 meeting. Therefore, as required by the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act, NMFS has no discretion
to raise or lower that amount. A 52.5 mt subquota of school bluefin tuna is reserved for recreational fishermen in the
area from New Jersey north and is based on average catches from those areas in recent years. Given the difficulties
of monitoring recreational catch and the interannual variability in bluefin migration patterns, a further fractioning
of quotas would result in quota management areas that would be impossible to administer on a real-time basis. 


Comment

: Deducting 13 mt from the reserve to maintain fishing category quotas at 1993 levels does not reduce fishing mortality
nor does it prepare the industry for future quota reductions. 


Response

: With respect to fishing mortality, maintaining allocations by reducing the reserve will achieve the same results
as reducing all categories proportionally. The reserve is used only to make up for overharvest in any category. NMFS
believes a reserve amount of 18 mt is sufficient for the intended purpose of maintaining total harvest within the U.S.
quota. Recent improvements in quota monitoring procedures (e.g., faxing dealer reports) reduce the risk of commercial
categories overharvesting the annual quota. Further, the industry is aware of the future quota reductions recommended
by ICCAT in 1993. 


2. Boundary Adjustment 




Comment

: Adjusting the boundary line between the northern and southern management areas will do little to reduce mortality.



Response

: Since the quotas for the two Incidental category longline management areas would remain the same, there would be
no adverse impact on the ICCAT stock recovery program. 


3. Minimum Landings Requirement 




Comment

: The change in minimum landing requirement will not reduce bluefin mortality. Instead, NMFS should create an experimental
fishery requiring specialized gear such as break-away leaders. 


Response

: Such an experimental fishery requires a substantial analysis of environmental and economic impacts and considerable
research is needed to develop an enforceable definition or criteria for breakaway gear. Therefore, provisions for
an experimental fishery could not be included into this interim final rule without violating notice and comment requirements.
However, NMFS does plan to consider fully the management alternative of the suggested experimental fishery in the
proposed rulemaking for the 1995 fishing season and will analyze this alternative in the Draft Environmental Impact
Statement (DEIS) to be released in May 1994. In the interim, NMFS will continue to gather information (anecdotal and
scientific) and encourage the use of specialized gear and fishing methods to reduce bluefin mortality. Fishermen
are encouraged to contact NMFS to discuss alternative means of avoiding bluefin hook-ups. To the extent that bluefin
discards are reduced through shorter trips, total fishing mortality may decrease. 


Comment

: The Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council recommended that NMFS require a minimum number of days between landings
of bluefin tuna and that NMFS develop special break-away gear. 


Response

: A minimum number of days between landing a bluefin, in the absence of other restrictions, would allow for an intermittent
directed fishery, contrary to the ICCAT recommendation. NMFS agrees with the industry that a minimum number of days
between landings in conjunction with a minimum poundage requirement would be too restrictive for Gulf longliners
and would only result in additional discards. NMFS will continue to research break-away gear.

4. Technical Corrections





Comment:

 Use of curved length measurements would allow the retention of illegal-sized fish so the measurement should be defined
and its use prohibited.



Response:

 NMFS did not propose to allow use of curved length measurements to determine size classes of bluefin tuna. NMFS sought
only to clarify the alternative measurement methods and to take comment on the feasibility of increasing the size
class definitions to account for the curved length method. Once additional industry comments and field observations
are made concerning the measurement techniques used by the industry for Atlantic bluefin tuna, NMFS will make a determination
about what would be the appropriate method to use. If the curved length measurement were to become standard, the sizes
would be adjusted accordingly. This adjustment would not allow retention of illegal-sized bluefin.



5. Request for Comments on Closure Notices





Comment:

 Timely notice of closures is commendable but closures should err on the side of conservation.



Response:

 NMFS attempts to keep harvests within allotted quota levels and has retained the reserve to account for overharvest
in any category.



6. The Environmental Assessment's ``Finding of No Significant Impact''





Comment:

 Without more effective conservation measures, the proposed rule is likely to have significant impacts on bluefin
stock recovery.



Response:

 The proposed actions continue and facilitate implementation of ICCAT's long-term program for stock recovery. While
the minor changes affecting the 1994 U.S. domestic fishery may not appear to significantly accelerate stock recovery,
they are an integral part of an overall 15 percent ICCAT reduction for 1994. Analysis of more far-reaching management
alternatives will continue as NMFS prepares a DEIS for the 1995 fishery. As evidence of commitment to this long-term
process of stock rebuilding, NMFS issues these regulatory changes as an interim final rule, rather than a final rule.
This interim final rule will be superseded when regulatory actions are implemented for the 1995 fishery after completion
of the 1994 ICCAT meeting and the public review process required under the National Environmental Policy Act.



Changes From the Proposed Rule



The following changes were made to the proposed rule: In  285.22, the Angling category subquotas for school
size tuna are indicated to one decimal place to reflect the total of 99 mt. In  285.24, a paragraph has been added
to clarify the catch limits that apply to vessels holding permits for both the Angling and General categories.

<PARENT> FR940414-0-00028 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In  285.29, language was added to instruct bluefin dealers to mail required reporting forms at the dealer's
expense. This is necessary because the U.S. Department of Commerce can no longer provide postage and fees for the delivery
of Dealer Landing Report forms to the NMFS Gloucester office, because the post office no longer accepts the previously
issued government postage-paid envelope. Also in  285.29, a clarification is made to define the biweekly reporting
periods as the first day to the fourteenth day of each month and the fifteenth day to the last day of the month.

At the request of NMFS enforcement staff, paragraph (a)(28) in  285.31 is amended to prohibit possession of
school, large school, and small medium bluefin tuna taken by unauthorized gear. Also, a correction to the regulatory
text at  285.31 is made to omit paragraph (c) relating to a prohibition on certain forms of at-sea processing
of bluefin tuna. A prior rule change (see 58 FR 45286, August 27, 1993) affecting at-sea processing of tunas rendered
this paragraph obsolete.



Classification



This interim final rule is published under the authority of the ATCA, 16 U.S.C. 971 

et seq.

 The AA has determined that this rule is necessary to implement the recommendations of ICCAT and is necessary for management
of the Atlantic tuna fisheries.

The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Small Business Administration that this rule
would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because the fishing category
quotas proposed for 1994 will remain the same as current quotas. Also, the changes to the Incidental Catch category
will alleviate some of the restrictions imposed on fishermen landing bluefin taken incidental to longlining for
swordfish, sharks, and other tunas. These changes will facilitate enforcement of bluefin regulations, will have
a modest positive economic impact for some longline fishing trips and will help prevent waste of bluefin tuna which
would otherwise be discarded dead. Since the changes made to the proposed rule are not such as would significantly
affect a substantial number of small entities, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared. This interim
final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866.

This interim final rule involves a clarification of an existing collection-of-information requirement subject
to the Paperwork Reduction Act that has been approved by OMB (control number 0648-0239). This change, in reference
to the daily dealer report, clarifies the requirement to indicate the type of measurement recorded for bluefin tuna
weights and lengths. Public reporting burden for this collection-of-information is estimated to average 3 minutes
per response for completing the requirement and faxing to NMFS. The requirements for the bi-weekly dealer report
are also restated. The reporting burden is estimated to average 33 minutes per response. Send any comments regarding
these burden estimates or any other aspect of these requirements, including suggestions for reducing the burden,
to NMFS and OMB (see 

ADDRESSES

).

NMFS has determined that there is good cause to waive partially the 30-day delay in the effective date normally required
by Section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act because reducing Atlantic bluefin tuna mortality in the incidental
longline southern area fishery is necessary for compliance with international obligations. Since this fishery
is underway, early implementation of the new target species minimum catch will better ensure that bluefin tuna incidental
mortality is minimized. Early implementation of the other measures is important because the bluefin fishery is underway
and these measures are necessary for effective implementation of the ICCAT recommendations.

 285.26 

Size classes. 



Straight fork length will be the sole criterion for determining the size class of Atlantic bluefin tuna. For any Atlantic
bluefin tuna found with the head removed, it is deemed, for purposes of this subpart, that the tuna, when caught, fell
into a size class in accordance with the following formula: Total straight fork length equals pectoral fin straight
fork length multiplied by a factor of 1.35. For this purpose, all measurements must be taken in a straight line along
the middle of the lateral surface from a line perpendicular to the dorsal insertion of the pectoral fin of the beheaded
fish to a line perpendicular to the fork of the tail (PF, see Figure 1). The pectoral fin straight fork length will be
the sole criterion for determining the size class of a beheaded Atlantic bluefin tuna. Total straight fork length
will be the sole criterion for determining the size class of whole (head on) Atlantic bluefin tuna. Atlantic bluefin
tuna are deemed to fall into a size class according to the following table; approximate round weights are given for
illustrative purposes only. 



* * * * * 



7. Section 285.29 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) to read as follows: 



 285.29 

Dealer recordkeeping and reporting. 



* * * * * 



(a) Must submit to the Regional Director via both electronic facsimile (FAX) and the existing postal system a daily
report on a reporting card provided by NMFS, within 24 hours of the purchase or receipt of each Atlantic bluefin tuna
from the person or vessel that harvested the fish. A FAX of said card must be received at the NMFS NE Regional Office (FAX

Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues this final rule to establish requirements for combining two or more limited entry Pacific Coast groundfish
fishery permits endorsed with vessel lengths from smaller vessels into a single limited entry permit endorsed with
a larger length for use with a single fishing vessel. This rule is necessary to comply with regulations that require
the Director, Northwest Region, NMFS (Regional Director), to develop and implement a standardized measure of harvest
capacity for the purpose of determining the appropriate endorsed lengths for limited entry permits created by combining
two or more permits with smaller size endorsements. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Amendment 6 to the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) was prepared by the Pacific Fishery Management
Council (Council), approved on September 4, 1992, and implemented by NMFS on November 16, 1992 (57 FR 54001), through
regulations codified at 50 CFR part 663, subpart C. Amendment 6, also called the ``Limited Entry Plan,'' is intended
to control the harvesting capacity of the groundfish fishing fleet by:
(1) Limiting the overall number of vessels; 

(2) Limiting the number of vessels using each of the three major gear types; and 

(3) Limiting increases in vessel harvest capacity by limiting vessel length. 

Amendment 6 requires that each limited entry fishing permit be endorsed with the length overall of the vessel that
initially qualified for the permit (except for certain exceptions explained in the implementing regulations).
A permit can only be used for a vessel that is no more than 5 ft (1.5 m) longer than the endorsed size on the permit or for
a smaller vessel. Vessel owners may fish with larger vessels by combining permits for smaller vessels. Regulations
at 50 CFR 663.33(g) require the Regional Director, with professional advice of marine architects and other qualified
individuals, and after consultation with the Council, to develop and implement a standardized measure of harvest
capacity for the purpose of determining the appropriate endorsed lengths for limited entry permits created by combining
two or more permits with smaller size endorsements. 

Amendment 6 bases the system for combining limited entry permits in the Pacific Coast groundfish limited entry fishery
on overall length of the fishing vessel. The standard it sets is that the harvest capacity represented by the appropriate
length endorsement for the combined permit not exceed the sum of the harvest capacities of the permits being combined.
As provided by Amendment 6, the standard applies regardless of the target species being fished, and is applicable
equally to trawl, longline, and fish trap (pot) vessels. As a practical matter, any system for combining permits must
also provide the flexibility for vessel owners to mix and match permits with a variety of different length endorsements
in order to achieve the desired length endorsement for a larger vessel. Once the relationship between length and harvesting
capacity is established, a table can be generated that assigns a certain number of capacity rating points for each
increment of vessel length. Such a table can be used by vessel owners to determine, at a glance, how many rating points
are needed for any particular length of vessel. Under Amendment 6, only limited entry permits with ``A'' gear endorsements
may be combined, and only permits for the same gear type (e.g., longline and longline, not trawl and longline) may be
combined. 

This final rule adds a table to the regulations implementing Amendment 6 that assigns a certain number of capacity
rating points per foot of vessel length (see Table 1 added to  663.33(g)). The table of capacity rating points
per foot increment of vessel length up to a vessel length of 150 ft 
(45.7 m) is based on a curvilinear relationship described as length to the 2.5 power. For vessels larger than 150 ft

(45.7 m), the relationship is a straight line (constant slope) increasing the number of 60-foot (18.3 m) permits required
per increment of vessel length, so that a 200-foot (61.0 m) vessel would require twelve 60-foot (18.3 m) permits and
a 400-foot 
(121.9 m) vessel would require twenty 60-foot (18.3 m) permits.

The preamble to the proposed regulations (59 FR 9171; February 25, 1994) contains a more complete explanation of the
relationship between length and harvesting capacity for combining permits. Also described in the proposed rule
is an explanation of the technical bases for the schedule chosen by NMFS (called the NMFS preferred approach in the
proposed rule), as well as a description of two other alternatives, one initially proposed by NMFS (Initial Alternative
I), the other by the Council (Initial Alternative II). The proposed rule requested public comments not only on the
NMFS preferred approach, but on Initial Alternatives I and II as well. This rule implements the NMFS preferred approach,
as described in the proposed rule. The final rule addresses what is primarily a technical issue with little or no conservation
implications. 

The relationship between vessel length and harvest capacity chosen in the final rule is conservative and treats vessels
of all lengths equitably. It was chosen based on the recognition that smaller vessels appear to produce at a level closer
to their harvesting capacity, while larger vessels, especially 200 ft (61.0 m) and larger, may currently produce
considerably below their actual capacity. As a result, the chosen relationship reflects the expectation that the
harvesting capacity for larger vessels is potentially greater than the actual amounts that vessels of that size have
produced historically. 

Initial Alternative I carried the curvilinear relationship only to 90 ft (27.4 m) and the straight line relationship
to 200 ft (61.0 m) (ten 60-foot (18.3 m) permits), with no increase in capacity rating points for vessels larger than
200 ft (61.0 m). The Council's recommended formula, Initial Alternative II, was curvilinear to 200 ft (61.0 m) with
the straight line relationship beginning with twenty 60-foot (18.3 m) permits at 200 ft (61.0 m) and ending with thirty-two
60-foot (18.3 m) permits for 400-foot (121.9 m) vessels. All three concepts are shown graphically in Figure 1. 



















Comments and Responses 



Written comments were submitted by 6 fishing vessel owners' associations (Coast Draggers Association, Fishermen's
Marketing Association, United Catcher Boats, American Factory Trawlers Association, and 2 from Mid-Water Trawlers
Cooperative), 6 seafood processing companies, the Astoria Chamber of Commerce, 48 individuals or corporations
associated with individual catcher vessels primarily involved in the Pacific whiting fishery, 3 corporations owning
catcher-processors (factory trawlers), and a corporation owning a mothership processor. Thirty of the comments
received were from Newport, Oregon. The total number of comments received was 65, with 54 advocating adoption of the
proposal recommended by the Council (Initial Alternative II), 5 advocating the NMFS initial proposal (Initial Alternative
I), 3 supporting the NMFS preferred approach, and 3 offering comments but no preference. 



Comment 1: 

Twenty-two commenters argued that the NMFS preferred approach would increase harvest capacity in the Pacific whiting
fishery because large, efficient factory trawlers with a significant harvesting capacity would purchase permits
issued to historically unproductive vessels, many with little or no historical catch of whiting, thus increasing
the overall harvest capacity in the groundfish fishery, and particularly the whiting fishery. 



Response: 

Most of the commenters favoring the Council's recommendation argued that the purchase of a permit with marginal historical
production by the owner of a potential highline vessel would increase capacity in the fishery. Most of these commenters
made no distinction between harvest capacity, fishing effort, and actual production (catch). Fishing effort is
the actual intensity with which a vessel/permit is used. It represents an amount of fishing activity per time period,
not an amount of catch. In the context of this rule, capacity refers to the potential amount of fish that can be caught
and retained by a vessel of a given length. Since permits are transferable, it is important to note that the potential
catch associated with capacity is not necessarily the historical catch of that vessel, but rather the potential of
the permit when affixed to a successful vessel of the same size. 

The Council in Amendment 6 specifically instructed NMFS to develop a schedule for combining permits that assured
that harvest capacity, not fishing effort or catch, did not increase. The schedule chosen by NMFS is an attempt to keep
the capacity represented by the sum of fishery permits from increasing. When permits are combined, the capacity of
the resulting permit should not exceed the capacity of the group of permits that have been combined. The capacity of
a permit is not defined by the level of fishing effort or production that its owner may have experienced over the preceding
years, but by its potential for use by a highline vessel of the endorsed size.

The degree to which a permit is actually used may be referred to as effort. The goals and objectives of Amendment 6 clearly
identify ``capacity'' of permits, not the effort with which they are applied, as being the focus for constraint in
the limited entry program in general, and the formula for combining permits in particular. Thus, even though effort
may increase as permits are transferred from less intensive to more intensive operations, in terms of fleet capacity,
it makes no difference whether a vessel combines permits from ten 60-foot (18.3 m) vessels that each landed 1 mt the
last 5 years, or from ten 60-foot (18.3 m) vessels that each landed 5,000 mt over the same period. The relevant question
for determining capacity is what an individual could have caught with the permit, using a quality vessel of the same
length, with a knowledgeable skipper and an efficient crew. 
The fact that potential highliners will increase overall effort and production in the fishery by obtaining permits
from individuals who are making little use of them is not surprising; this likelihood is addressed in the analysis
for Amendment 6. The Council could have reduced the potential for increases in effort resulting from permit transfers
by establishing more rigorous minimum landing requirements for initial qualification for permits, but the Council's
final action did not include different minimum landing requirements for vessels of different length. Alternatively,
Amendment 6 could have constrained outputs (landings) by, for example, attaching landing endorsements to the permits,
rather than length endorsements. In order for a vessel to increase its landings, it would have had to buy a permit endorsed
for an appropriate amount of tonnage. This would have prevented little-used vessels from being transformed, through
permit sale, into highliners, without production having been reduced by someone else. However, in constraining
inputs to the fishery (vessel length and gear) rather than outputs, the Council was aware that increases in effort
and production might occur. 
One example given by a commenter to justify concern about unproductive permits being transferred to a highline vessel
was that, for example, a 300-foot (91.4 m) factory trawler, producing about 400 mt per day, could obtain a limited entry
permit by obtaining 13 permits from thirteen 65-foot (19.8 m) shrimp vessels that historically caught an aggregate
of less than 400 mt of whiting over a whole year. However, it is also true that, if each one of those 13 permits was sold
to a highline 65-foot (19.8 m) vessel making at-sea deliveries of whiting, the 13 vessels could easily deliver an aggregate
of more than 1,000 mt per day, based on data from the 1991 whiting fishery. As this example illustrates, the potential
for increasing effort in the whiting fishery is not simply an issue that arises with regard to factory trawlers combining
permits in order to enter the fishery. Quite the contrary, historically unproductive permits for vessels under 110
ft (35.5 m) could generate as much or more additional catch in the whiting fishery if they were transferred/combined
to highline vessels within the same size range than if they were combined to accommodate the use of a factory trawler.

NMFS agrees that fishing effort will tend to increase with the combining of permits for factory trawlers in the whiting
fishery. Likewise, the amount of capacity utilized in the whiting fishery will increase as permits issued for vessels
with no historical whiting catch are transferred to vessels that fish for whiting. Those transfers represent a transfer
of capacity from the non-whiting fishery, or alternatively the groundfish fishery as a whole, into the whiting fishery.
However, it cannot be ignored that permits that are combined to support 100-foot (30.5 m) catcher boats, or even those
that are transferred between vessels of the same size, will also lead to increases in effort, and, if transferred into
the whiting fishery, to increases in capacity in the whiting fishery. Regardless of the size of her/his vessel, an
entering highliner will always attempt to purchase permits as cheaply as possible, and that will involve seeking
out permits that are generating the least amount of money for their current owners. 


Comment 2:

 Nine commenters argued that NMFS' use of a 
60-foot catcher vessel in the whiting fishery for comparison with factory trawlers was flawed, because the average
length of catcher vessels delivering whiting is closer to 85 ft (25.9 m) or 90 ft (27.4 m) in length. They argued that,
if the same comparison were done using a 90-foot (27.4 m) vessel length for a catcher vessel, the results would show
that the NMFS preferred approach was not conservative enough to prevent harvest capacity from increasing.

Response:

 The 2.5 exponential relationship for vessel length, explained in the proposed rule, which provided a good fit for
the highline production data in the non-whiting sector of the groundfish fishery, does not characterize the length-production
relationship observed in the whiting fishery. Because the relationship between production and vessel length departs
dramatically from the exponential curve for all vessels in the whiting fishery, highline production data were determined
to be the best way to illustrate the relationship of potential harvest capacity to vessel length for vessels in the
whiting fishery. Although production data are used to illustrate relationships between vessels of different lengths,
the potential harvest capacity of vessels larger than 150 ft (45.7 m) is presumed to be greater than the historical
highline production for those vessels. The formula promulgated by this rule takes the difference between a vessel's
highline production data and potential harvest capacity into account. Highline production is the average production
for the top 25 percent of the vessels in each vessel class. For analytical purposes, highline production values are
used to demonstrate trends and relationships between vessels of different lengths for vessels that participate
substantially in the whiting fishery. 
Because the increase in historical production per increment in vessel length for factory trawlers is less than the
increase in production per increment demonstrated by smaller vessels in the groundfish (non-whiting) fishery,
comparison of the highline catch amounts associated with number of permits needed for a factory trawler is affected
by the size of vessel chosen for comparison. As an example, compare the number of 60-foot 
(18.3 m) and 90-foot (27.4 m) permits that would be required for a permit for a 300-foot (91.4 m) vessel. If a 300-foot
(91.4 m) factory trawler were to obtain all of its permits from 60-foot (18.3 m) boats, under the NMFS preferred approach
it would need about sixteen permits. Since the 1991 highline production data for 60-foot (18.3 m) vessels was estimated
to be about 470 mt per week, these permits represent 7,500 (16 x 470) mt/week of catching capacity in the offshore whiting
fishery. During the same year, the highline production data for factory trawlers around 300 ft (91.4 m) in length was
in the 1,000-1,100 mt/week range. In 1992, highline factory trawler production went up, but was still generally
less than 2,000 mt/week. Thus, the demonstrated capacity of the sixteen 60-foot (18.3 m) vessels is still greater
than the 1992 factory trawler catch by a factor of at least three. 
If, on the other hand, the factory trawler were to acquire all of its permits from 90-foot (27.4 m) trawlers, it would
need a total of 6. A 90-foot (27.4 m) vessel's highline production data was 610 mt/week, which is only 30 percent higher
than for a 60-foot (18.3 m) vessel. Thus, the demonstrated production of these six vessels combined amounts to slightly
more than 3,500 mt/week. While this value is less than the amount a 300-foot (91.4 m) vessel might harvest occasionally
in the pollock fishery, it is higher than any weekly catch observed by a factory trawler over recent years in the whiting
fishery. This example illustrates that a reasonable safety factor still exists, even if 90-foot (27.4 m) vessels
are used for comparison with factory trawlers. 
Sixty-foot (18.3 m) vessels were selected for comparison with the factory trawlers in the whiting fishery for several
reasons. First, that size of vessel was common among all three gear types (trawl, longline, and pot) and thus allows
a comparison of harvest capacity and vessel length for all three gear types. Second, 60-foot (18.3 m) catcher vessels
were assumed to be producing closer to their actual harvest capacity than 80- or 90-foot (24.4_27.4 m) catcher vessels.
Therefore, 60-foot (18.3 m) vessel permits were used as a yardstick to compare the relationships between harvest
capacity and vessel length for vessels using all three gear types and participating in the non-whiting sector of the
fishery. 
Finally, the appropriateness of choosing comparison values is not determined by the make-up of the current whiting
fleet, but by the length composition of the permits that are actually assembled in order to license a factory trawler.
Since permits may be acquired from across the groundfish/whiting complex for this purpose, it seems likely that any
factory trawlers will acquire permits from a variety of vessel lengths. Regardless of the lengths of the size endorsements
on the permits being combined, or whether the smaller vessels have fished primarily for other groundfish or shrimp,
the appropriate measure of the catching capacity, relative to a factory trawler, is what these vessels could produce
in the offshore whiting fishery. 


Comment 3:

 Several commenters noted that the actual harvest capacity of larger (80-90-foot) (24.4_27.4 m) at-sea delivery
vessels in the whiting fishery was greater than the 500 mt per week for catcher vessels used in the NMFS analysis for
comparison with factory trawler production values. They noted that the larger at-sea delivery vessels often were
constrained by production limits from motherships. 


Response:

 NMFS agrees, and the NMFS analysis assumes that actual harvesting capacity is greater than the production values
for all classes of vessels substantially involved in the whiting fishery. For example, if all 90-foot (27.4 m) vessels
delivered 1,000-1,100 mt of whiting per week (equivalent to the largest single week of deliveries by any catcher
vessel in the data examined) instead of the 610 mt observed production for the top 25 percent of delivery vessels, then
if under the NMFS preferred approach, six 90-foot (27.4 m) vessel permits are combined, the harvest capacity retired
would actually amount to 6,000 mt per week or more, almost triple any observed production from factory trawlers in
the whiting fishery. At this point, neither the information regarding potential factory trawler performance submitted
by commenters (addressed in the response to comment 4), nor any other information of which NMFS is aware, supports
the assumption that the actual production of factory trawlers in the whiting fishery can be increased by a factor of
2.5 to 3.0 through the introduction of efficient offloading procedures at sea. Still, this is an emerging technology,
and it is not impossible that factory trawler catch could be increased substantially if a factory trawler serves,
in whole or in part, as a delivery vessel. 


Comment 4:

 Some commenters have suggested that factory trawler catches have been restricted by the processing aspects of their
operations and that supplemental at-sea transfers between factory trawlers, which are both harvesting and processing,
could significantly increase factory trawler catch rates. 


Response:

 NMFS agrees that production methods may be one factor limiting current harvest levels for factory trawlers. During
1991, for example, whiting factory trawlers had weekly levels of fish retention that were roughly half the amounts
for comparably sized motherships, despite having roughly the same under-deck space available for production lines,
freezing, and storage facilities. This indicates that processing limitations probably are not the sole factor constraining
harvests. NMFS agrees that some potential exists for factory trawlers to increase their production. Thus, the harvest
capacity for vessels over 200 ft (61.0 m) in length, calculated by this rule, is greater than any historical level of
factory trawler catch in the whiting fishery.

One reason offered for this difference between mothership and factory trawler production is the fact that mothership
production benefits from having several vessels scouting for concentrations of whiting, as well as fishing. Factory
trawler production might be increased if these vessels were able to benefit from some method of scouting for concentrations
of fish, so that the factory ship was able to stay on productive grounds. One commenter provided a news article documenting
the use of a new hose-transfer technology that might be used by factory trawlers to transfer fish between two or more
vessels. The article reported that a 207-foot (63.1 m) trawler off-loaded 2,000 mt of pollock during a 1-week period
using this methodology. Although the article did not say if 2,000 mt represented the trawler's catch of pollock for
the entire week, this level of production is the same level demonstrated by larger than 200-foot (61.0 m) vessels in
the whiting fishery. 
This potential for factory trawlers to increase their harvest rates in the whiting fishery is the reason that the schedule
for larger vessels requires more permits than is suggested by highliner production data, whereas the formula for
smaller vessels, with less potential to increase production, closely tracks highline production data. 


Comment 5.

 Several commenters believed that, under the NMFS preferred approach, factory trawlers would accumulate the necessary
number of permits at a disproportionately low net cost per unit compared to the net cost, for example, to a 70-foot (21.3
m) vessel upgrading to a 90-foot (27.4 m) vessel.


Response.

 It should be noted that the analysis in the EA/RIR/IRFA of the potential cost of permits in support of the proposed rule
was extremely speculative, since little information on the profitability of various sectors of the fleet was readily
available. The analysis was never intended as a prediction of what prices would be, but only to illustrate what the
range of prices might be given certain par values for 60-foot vessels. Since a working model of profitability in the
groundfish and whiting fisheries was not available, no effort was directed at projecting what the actual cost of permits
would be. 
In anticipation of a permit combination rule becoming effective, some factory trawler owners have been purchasing
permits. A comment received from representatives of a factory trawler indicates that the cost of securing the number
of permits required by the NMFS preferred approach was, in fact, in excess of $1.5 million. 
Although it is not clear what the commenters intended as a yardstick for a comparison of net cost per unit for smaller
versus larger vessels, two potential yardsticks are the cost of entering the fishery relative to the amount of fish
that can be caught, and the cost of entry relative to the existing capitalization of the fishing vessel. The following
table illustrates the relationships between permit cost and production, assuming that permits cost roughly $6,000
per rating point, as asserted in the comments from the American Factory Trawlers Association. In terms of the dollar
amount that must be spent per metric ton of catch, it is clear that factory trawlers will pay more than smaller vessels.
Based on highline production levels, a 60-foot (18.3 m) vessel would pay one-sixth of what a factory trawler would
per metric ton of catch per week. Ninety-foot (27.4 m) and 120-foot (36.6 m) vessels would pay about one-third to one-half
of the cost per ton estimated for factory trawlers.

However, it is also possible to view the cost question in the context of the existing capitalization of an operation.
The cost of a permit for a 90-foot (27.4 m) catcher boat may represent an additional 50-100 percent of the existing
capitalization of the operation. The amount a factory trawler would have to pay is likely to represent a far smaller
percentage of the total amount that has been invested. In this regard, it may be easier for a factory trawler to increase
its debt load to cover the cost of necessary permits. It should be noted, however, that factory trawlers were built
primarily for the Alaska pollock fisheries, not the Pacific whiting fishery. Factory trawlers also have the ability
to derive profit from processing fish, as well as catching them. This tends to give them a larger relative whiting income
stream with which to repay the permit cost. On the other hand, those smaller catcher vessels with hold capacity also
possess opportunities to offset permit costs with additional landings of other groundfish species during portions
of the year when the whiting season is closed. Another consideration is that the vast majority of catcher boats that
will be participating in this fishery in all likelihood initially qualified for limited entry permits and will not
have to pay anything for the right to continue fishing. 
Although the cost of permits will fluctuate based on supply and demand, permit cost does not appear to be a reasonable
basis for estimating harvest capacity in the groundfish fishery. 


Comment 6:

 One commenter provided an alternative analysis of the capacity differences between trawl vessels of different lengths,
based on calculations of the area and volume of water capable of being swept by the trawl net per hour. 


Response:

 While there may be a strong correlation between area swept and the catch of vessels of given sizes, it is not clear what
that functional relationship is between the two variables. Whatever this relationship, it is almost certainly characterized
by diminishing catches per area swept at some point, just as the increase in highline production values per increment
of vessel length diminished in the NMFS analysis. Knowing only the ratio of the areas swept per hour by vessels of different
lengths without knowing the functional relationship between the two variables is not helpful in identifying catching
capacity. For example, if the ratios reflect a linear increase in capacity over a 46-fold increase in area swept, then
the capacity of a 90-foot (27.4 m) and a 300-foot (91.4 m) vessel, relative to a 60-foot (18.3 m) vessel, would be 4.7:1
and 44.5:1, respectively, as noted in the comment. If, on the other hand, catch equals area swept to an exponential
value, 0.75 for example, then the capacity ratios that result are 3.2:1 and 17.2:1, respectively, for the 90- and 300-foot
(27.4 and 91.4 m) vessels; these values are not substantially different from those in the NMFS preferred approach.
Without considerable additional quantitative analysis, there appears to be no basis for presuming that one of these
assumptions is any better than the other. 
NMFS also evaluated the commenter's suggestion taking into account the target species in the fishery. NMFS agrees
that the commenter's method might be appropriate when harvesting spawning Alaska pollock where the pollock are distributed
in large dense aggregations that are as much as 50 to 100 meters thick. In that case, it might be appropriate to calculate
the ratios on a volume-swept basis. Whiting stock assessment surveys have found that the typical dense schools of
whiting in the summer are scattered in a relatively thin layer that may be only 5 to 10 meters thick. In this case it appears
more appropriate to calculate the ratios for whiting on an area-swept (two dimensional) basis rather than on a volume-swept
basis. This method also is independent of any limits induced by the market, processing capacity, or vessel hold capacity,
all of which typically reduce vessel capacity by some unknown amount. Based on an analysis of the capacity ratios using
an area-swept method, it appears that this rule offers reasonable certainty that the permit combining schedule does
not allow the overall harvesting capacity of the groundfish trawl fleet to increase. 


Comment 7:

 One commenter complained that, in the proposed rule, NMFS did not adequately explain why it deviated from its initial
proposal to flatten the 2.5 exponential curve at a vessel length of 90 ft (27.4 m), and instead proposed to flatten the
curve at a length of 150 ft (45.7 m). 


Response:

 After evaluation of production values for the top 25 percent of the Alaska Freezer longline fleet (vessels up to 150
ft (45.7 m) in length), NMFS concluded that the actual production potential for longline vessels in the Pacific groundfish
fishery also could be fairly represented by the 2.5 exponential curve initially used to describe harvest capacity
and production for vessels 90 ft (27.4 m) in length and below. Consequently, NMFS revised its initial proposal (Initial
Alternative I) to extend the 2.5 exponential curve describing harvest capacity from 90 ft (27.4 m) to 150 ft (45.7 m)
(NMFS preferred approach). 


Comment 8:

 Two commenters representing factory trawlers recommended that NMFS allow permits to be combined temporarily (leased)
then broken again into individual permits at the end of the lease period.

Response:

 Amendment 6 specifically did not provide for aggregating leased permits to provide for the temporary entry of larger
vessels into the Pacific groundfish fishery. Any such consideration is beyond the scope of this regulatory amendment,
and would require an amendment to the FMP. The commenter should make this proposal to the Council for its consideration.



Comment 9:

 One commenter noted that the current regulations require that the size endorsement for a permit endorsed for trawl
gear that is transferred to a smaller vessel be downgraded to the length overall of the smaller vessel. The commenter
suggested that this regulation would prevent a larger trawl vessel from leasing his permit to a smaller vessel, thus
restricting the number of people who might lease a trawl permit. He noted that leasing a 90-foot (27.4 m) trawl permit
to a 60-foot (18.3 m) vessel would result in a temporary reduction in harvest capacity, which would be consistent with
the objectives of the limited entry program. He recommended revising the limited entry regulations to allow leasing
of trawl permits to smaller vessels without having the permit permanently downsized.



Response:

 NMFS agrees that leasing a trawl permit with a large size endorsement to a smaller trawl vessel would be consistent
with the goals and objectives of the limited entry program. Amendment 6, however, specifically requires that, if
a permit endorsed for trawl gear is registered to a trawl vessel more than 5 ft shorter than the size endorsed on the permit,
the permit will be re-endorsed with the length overall of the smaller vessel. In a trip-limit fishery, for example,
there may be greater profit from fishing with a smaller vessel. Taking advantage of this would require downsizing
the permit. This is one of the means by which Amendment 6 intended to reduce harvest capacity in the groundfish fishery.
This provision cannot be changed, except by further amending the FMP. The commenter should take his request to the
Council for its consideration.



Comment 10:

 Two commenters who supported NMFS Initial Alternative I argued that, if the NMFS preferred approach were adopted,
the schedule for vessels above 200 ft (61.0 m) in length should be modified slightly to increase the number of permits
required for vessels between 200 and 250 ft (61.0 and 76.2 m) in length.



Response:

 Production data that NMFS examined for the top 25 percent of the factory trawler fleet showed a modest increase in production
as vessel length increased. NMFS believes that the modest increase in the number of permits required by the NMFS preferred
approach for vessels between 200 and 400 ft (61.0 and 121.9 m) in length fairly represents harvest capacity as suggested
by the production data available from the fishery.



Comment 11:

 Two commenters noted that NMFS accepted either the documented length on the U.S. Coast Guard Documentation (CG-1270)
or a marine survey as documentation of ``length overall'' to determine the appropriate size endorsement when initially
issuing limited entry permits. They argued that NMFS should continue to accept either form of documentation when
determining the ``length overall'' and the necessary size endorsement for a permit for a vessel that results from
the combination of two or more smaller permits.



Response:

 The limited entry plan and the regulations require the use of ``length overall'' for permit size endorsements. This
was done so there would be a standard length measure that would be comparable across all vessels and vessel sizes. Length
overall was adopted because it is routinely used and is explained in Coast Guard regulations. When the NMFS Northwest
Region Fisheries Permit Office began receiving permit applications for initial issuance of limited entry permits,
applicants were not required to submit a marine survey showing ``length overall.'' The first permits issued were
endorsed with the length shown on the CG-1270. In most cases, the length shown on the CG-1270, if not the
``length overall,'' was a shorter length derived from the U.S. Coast Guard ``Standard'' system of measurement. In
these cases, the use of the length on the CG-1270 as ``length overall'' was to the detriment of the permit recipient
because permits could have been endorsed for the larger ``length overall'' measurement. Initial permit recipients
were notified of this discrepancy and offered the opportunity to submit a marine survey or builder's certificate
showing ``length overall'' of the qualifying vessel. Upon receipt of these documents, NMFS issued new permits with
the size endorsement showing true ``length overall.''

For transfers and permit combination (upgrades), use of the improper length measurement for the new vessel operates
to the benefit of the individual applicant, but to the disadvantage of the limited entry program, by allowing increases
in the overall fishing capacity through granting permits based on length measurements that are not comparable to
the measure required by the regulations. NMFS will continue to require either a marine survey or builder's certificate
to document actual ``length overall'' of any vessel receiving a new permit through permit combination.



Comment 12:

 Three commenters favored the NMFS preferred approach. Two commenters noted that adoption of the NMFS preferred option
would be less disruptive to the fishery for factory trawlers, since some had purchased permits using this option as
a guideline, and because there would be little time between the issuance of this rule and the start of the whiting season,
April 15, within which to obtain additional permits if NMFS issued a more restrictive schedule. One commenter favoring
the NMFS preferred approach was concerned that, under a more restrictive alternative, more vessels would sell their
permits and enter another fishery such as the shrimp fishery, resulting in over-capitalization of that fishery.



Response:

 Comments are noted. The NMFS preferred approach is being promulgated.



Comment 13:

 Fourteen commenters believed that implementation of the NMFS preferred approach would result in more factory trawlers
purchasing permits and entering the whiting fishery than if the Council's recommendation, Initial Alternative
II, were implemented. These commenters believed that more factory trawlers entering the whiting fishery would deprive
coastal catcher boats of potential whiting markets with at-sea processors. As a result, many coastal catcher vessels
would be forced to fish for traditional (non-whiting) groundfish species, adding additional capacity into an already
overcapitalized fishery.

Response:

 NMFS has no information to indicate how many factory trawlers would purchase and combine permits in order to participate
in the Pacific whiting fishery under any of the three alternatives. Some factory trawlers are likely to participate
under any of the alternatives. It appears likely that the number of factory trawlers purchasing permits and participating
in the whiting fishery will be considerably less than the number that have participated in the fishery under open access
during the past 3 years. The availability of whiting markets for coastal catcher vessels will depend, to some degree,
on the number of at-sea processors that offer markets and on the level of operation of shoreside processing plants
in 1994. As a result of limited entry and the regulations that allocate the Pacific whiting harvest between the at-sea
and shoreside sectors of the industry, whiting markets should support a larger number of catcher vessels in 1994 than
at any time during the past 3 years. Whether fishing effort will increase for traditional non-whiting groundfish
species is uncertain. It should be noted that much of the capacity represented by permits being purchased by factory
trawlers for use in the whiting fishery, if not utilized for that purpose, is available for transfer and use to fish
for other groundfish species. Any increase in harvest capacity in the whiting fishery is counterbalanced by decreasing
capacity available to harvest other groundfish species. NMFS has no data to indicate whether the potential capacity
that leaves the other groundfish sector will be any greater or less than the capacity that leaves the whiting fishery
due to lack of markets.



Comment 14:

 Twenty-two commenters stated that NMFS, as a matter of policy, should defer to the expertise and judgment of the Council
and implement Initial Alternative II.



Response:

 During the development and adoption of Amendment 6 (limited entry) to the Pacific Groundfish FMP, the Council decided
to leave the task of developing a measure of harvest capacity and method for combining limited entry permits to NMFS,
based on the standard set out in the FMP. NMFS was to develop and implement the system for combining permits in consultation
with the Council and with the advice of a marine architect. None of the development documentation or analysis was undertaken
by the Council. While the Council has made a recommendation to NMFS for a different method from that proposed by NMFS,
it has not presented an analysis or administrative record supporting the recommendation. Although NMFS gives great
weight to Council recommendations, they must be supported by an administrative record demonstrating they are based
on the best available scientific information and are consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable Federal
law.



Comment 15:

 Several commenters stated that the NMFS preferred approach ignores the goals and objectives of the Pacific groundfish
FMP. These commenters believed only Initial Alternative II is consistent with the Council's goals.



Response:

 Amendment 6 to the FMP very narrowly defined the objectives for NMFS in developing a permit combination system. Regulations
at 50 CFR 663.33(g) require the Regional Director, with advice of marine architects and other qualified individuals,
and after consultation with the Council, to develop and implement a standardized measure of harvest capacity for
the purpose of determining the appropriate endorsed lengths for limited entry permits created by combining two or
more permits with smaller size endorsements. Amendment 6 bases the system for combining limited entry permits in
the Pacific Coast groundfish limited entry fishery on the overall length of the fishing vessel. The standard set by
Amendment 6 requires that the harvest capacity represented by the appropriate length endorsement for the combined
permit not exceed the sum of the harvest capacities of the permits being combined. As provided by Amendment 6, the standard
applies regardless of the target species being fished or the size of the vessels involved, and is equally applicable
to trawl, longline, and fish trap (pot) vessels.

Amendment 6 did not authorize NMFS to modify parameters of the system to meet goals and objectives other than ensuring
that the harvest capacity of a combined permit does not exceed the sum of the harvest capacities of the permits being
combined.



Comment 16:

 Several commenters stated that NMFS has ignored the recommendations of the marine architect who provided professional
advice to the Council's Groundfish Advisory Panel.



Response:

 The report of the Groundfish Advisory Subpanel provided at the Council's April 1993 meeting indicated that a marine
architect, David Green, President of Jensen Maritime, advised the subpanel that any of the formulas initially proposed
by NMFS will reduce fleet size over time, and that length cubed potentially reduced fleet size the most. All of these
formulas included flattening the curve for vessels above about 120 ft (36.6 m) in length. Mr. Green stated that the
length cubed function matches vessel fishing power relatively well, but the choice is primarily one of economics
and social considerations. Although each formula will permanently reduce fleet size, Mr. Green believed none would
prevent increased fishing capacity in the form of deeper, ``beamier'' vessels to be built in the future. The Council's
Groundfish Advisory Subpanel recommended the 2.5 exponential factor, stating that it better matches the west coast
fleet, and recommended that the curve be flattened at about 150 ft (45.7 m) in vessel length instead of the 120 feet shown
in the formulas.

A letter from Mr. Green elaborated on his prior comments. Although Mr. Green states that exponents of 2.5 or less favor
a fishery with increasing catch capability, he also comments that there is a reasonable correlation between hold
capacity and length either to the 2.5 or 3.0 exponent, and that this correlation holds up reasonably well to about 150
ft (45.7 m) in length. These remarks tend to confirm that a 2.5 exponent is at least very close to the optimal value to
prevent any increase in capacity and that the exponential relationship breaks down for vessels larger than 150 ft
(45.7 m).

Mr. Green's only comments on the formula proposed for large vessels is that the flattened section favors the processor
type vessel as a substitute for smaller catchers and would accelerate transition from today's fleet of individual
owners to the corporate fleets of processors. His comments regarding fleet structure may be accurate if the standard
for comparison is the structure of the fleet during the 1984-88 qualifying period for limited entry permits.
They may not be as accurate, at least initially, if the standard of comparison is the 1991-93 fleet, which included
as many as 20 large factory trawlers, and fewer than that number purchase permits to enter the fishery.

The make-up of the fishery, however, is not a relevant consideration in the formulation of these regulations. The
relevant issue is a reasonable estimate of harvesting capacity. If the purpose of the limited entry program was to
freeze the structure of the fleet as it was in 1984-87, the Council would not have provided for the entry of new
and larger vessels. The FMP recognized the need to provide flexibility for the fleet to change.

Finally, Mr. Green seems to use the concepts of hold capacity and catching capacity interchangeably. While the ability
to catch fish is undoubtedly tied to hold size (or under-deck volume), the relationship between these variables is
not necessarily one to one, and the relationship may be different in different fisheries. NMFS' initial uncertainty
regarding this relationship prompted examination of actual highliner production records and eventually led to
modification of NMFS' initial proposal. 



Comment 17: 

Several commenters representing the operators of factory trawlers favored the NMFS initial proposal (Initial Alternative
I) because it was based on data from the highest producers and, of the three alternatives, best reflected actual historical
production by factory trawlers. They argued that factors such as product quality and problems with flesh deterioration
limited the ability of factory trawlers to increase production.

In the NMFS Initial Alternative
