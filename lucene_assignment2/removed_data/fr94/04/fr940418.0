Energy Conservation Voluntary Performance Standards for New Commercial and Multi-Family High Rise Residential
Buildings; Mandatory for New Federal 
Buildings


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, DOE.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rules; Removal. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to a court order, the Department of Energy today removes a portion of the interim commercial building energy
performance standards from new Federally-owned buildings which set forth Standby Loss Criteria, Minimum Performance
``Loss'' for electric, gas and oil storage water heaters. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under the Energy Conservation Standards for New Buildings Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. 6831-40 (1988), the Department
of Energy issued interim energy performance standards that were binding for the design of new Federally-owned buildings.
10 CFR part 435. A portion of the interim standards set forth ``standby loss'' rules to limit those losses in water heaters
installed in new federal construction projects. 


Following publication of the interim standards, the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association filed a lawsuit challenging
the ``Standby Loss'' criteria in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. 
In 

Gas Appliance Manufacturers Ass'n

 v. 

Secretary of Energy

, 722 F. Supp. 792 (D.D.C. 1989), the court set the standards aside. It enjoined enforcement of the ``Standby Loss''
rules and remanded the case for the Department to develop a statement of reasons and then to issue its final rule. 
On remand, the Department published a ``Preliminary Statement of Reasons for Adoption of Standby Loss Criteria,''
54 FR 49,724, November 30, 1989, as corrected, 54 FR 50,341, December 6, 1989. The Association then filed a second lawsuit
against the Department. The District Court upheld the ``Standby Loss'' criteria. 773 F. Supp. 461 (D.D.C. 1991).
The Association appealed. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the matter to the District Court. 

Gas Appliance Manufacturers Ass'n

, vs. 

Department of Energy

, 998 F. 2d 1041 (D.C. Cir 1993). With that decision having now become final, the Department is removing the ``Standby
Loss'' rules from the Code of Federal Regulations. 
The Storage Water Heater Standby Loss Criteria in question are part of  435.109 of the interim standards, entitled
``Service Water Heating Systems,'' published at 54 FR 4689, January 30, 1989. This section identifies the scope,
design principles, minimum requirements, and a prescriptive compliance method for service water heating systems
and equipment.

Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 737-100, -200, and -200C Series Airplanes





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.










</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment revises an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to all Boeing Model 737-100,
-200, and -200C series airplanes, that currently requires periodic inspections to detect missing nuts
and/or damaged secondary support hardware adjacent to the engine aft mount, and replacement, if necessary. This
amendment provides for the optional installation of a new, modified support, which, if accomplished, constitutes
terminating action for certain required inspections. This amendment is prompted by the development of a modification
that will prevent wearing of the secondary support. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure
of the secondary support to sustain engine loads in the event of failure of the aft engine mount cone bolt, which could
result in the separation of the engine from the wing.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations by revising AD 91-09-14, Amendment 39-6972
(56 FR 18696, April 24, 1991), which is applicable to all Boeing Model 737-100, -200, and -200C series
airplanes, was published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 29, 1993 (58 FR 68787). Among other things, AD 91-09-14 currently requires periodic inspections
to detect missing nuts and/or damaged secondary support hardware, and replacement, if necessary. The notice proposed
to revise AD 91-09-14 to provide for the optional replacement of the existing aft engine mount secondary
support with a new, modified secondary support. If accomplished, such replacement would constitute terminating
action for certain of the currently required inspections.



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received.

All of the commenters support the proposal.

One commenter, Boeing, notes that the number of work hours necessary to accomplish the optional modification is closer
to 60 work hours rather than 30 work hours, as was indicated in the cost impact information presented in the preamble
to the notice. The FAA acknowledges this updated figure and has revised the cost impact information, below, to reflect
it.

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed.

There are approximately 1,144 Model 737 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates
that 432 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD.

The actions currently required by AD 91-09-14 take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish,
at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the currently required
actions on U.S. operators is estimated to be $71,280, or $165 per airplane, per inspection cycle.

This revision of AD 91-09-14 adds no new additional costs to operators, since it merely provides for an
optional installation that would provide terminating action for certain requirements. Should an operator elect
to accomplish the installation, the associated actions will take approximately 60 work hours per airplane to accomplish,
at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $6,818 per airplane. Based on
these figures, the total cost of accomplishing the optional installation is estimated to be $10,118 per airplane.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under
the caption

To prevent failure of the secondary support to sustain engine loads, in the event of failure of the aft engine mount
cone bolt, which could result in engine separation from the wing, accomplish the following:

(a) Within the next 45 landings after May 20, 1991 (the effective date of AD 91-09-14, amendment 39-6972),
accomplish the following:

(1) Inspect the aft mount cone bolt indicator for proper alignment. Improper alignment indicates a broken aft cone
bolt. Broken cone bolts must be replaced, prior to further flight, with bolts that have been inspected in accordance
with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 737-71A1212, dated December 22, 1987, using magnetic particle inspection
techniques. Repeat the inspection of the indicator at intervals thereafter not to exceed 45 landings.

(2) Unless previously accomplished within the last 255 landings, inspect the aft mount cone bolt improved secondary
support for missing nuts, evidence of bolt wear, and disbonded honeycomb core in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin
737-71-1250, dated June 14, 1990. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this AD, missing nuts, bolts worn
outside the limits specified in the service bulletin, or disbonded honeycomb core must be replaced, prior to further
flight, with new or repaired identical parts. Repeat the inspection at intervals not to exceed 300 landings.

(b) Perform the following inspections if discrepant hardware is found during the inspections required by paragraph
(a)(2) of this AD, and replacement hardware is not immediately available:

(1) Prior to further flight, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 300 landings, inspect for cracks in the aft engine
mount cone bolt, in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 737-71A1212, dated December 22, 1987, using
ultrasonic inspection techniques. Replace cracked cone bolts, prior to further flight, with bolts that have been
inspected in accordance with the above service bulletin, using magnetic particle inspection techniques. Replacement
(newly installed) cone bolts must be ultrasonically inspected for internal cracking in accordance with the provisions
of this paragraph at intervals not to exceed 300 landings.

(2) At the next ultrasonic inspection, as required by paragraph (b)(1) of this AD, unless previously accomplished
within 150 to 300 landings after cone bolt installation, accomplish a torque check to verify that the cone bolt is torqued
to the proper torque limit specified in the appropriate Boeing maintenance manual. This check is to be accomplished
without loosening the bolt. After every cone bolt installation, accomplish the torque check procedure required
by this paragraph, between 150 landings and 300 landings following installation. Replacement of discrepant hardware
in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this AD constitutes terminating action for the requirements of this paragraph.

(i) If the cone bolt torque is below one-half the specified torque, remove the cone bolt and replace it with a serviceable
bolt.

(ii) If the cone bolt torque is equal to, or above one-half the specified torque, but below the specified torque, re-torque
to the specified level and re-check the torque within the next 150 to 300 landings. If, at that time, the torque is below
90 percent of the specified torque, replace the cone bolt with a serviceable bolt.

(c) Replacement of the existing aft engine mount secondary support with a new, modified secondary support, Kit Number
65C37057-1, in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 737-71-1289, dated August 19, 1993, constitutes
terminating action for the inspections required by paragraphs (a)(2), (b), (b)(1), and (b)(2) of this AD.

(d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane
Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector,
who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Seattle ACO. 






Note 2: 

Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained
from the Seattle ACO.




(e) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) 21.197 and 21.199
to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.

(f) The optional replacement shall be done in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 737-71-1289, dated
August 19, 1993. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance
with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. Copies may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707,

Alteration of Jet Route J-34



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.


 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action changes the description of Jet Route J-34 located between the Badger, WI, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional
Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) facility, the Grand Rapids, MI, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Distance
Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) facility, and the Carleton, MI, VORTAC. This change removes the reference to the radials
from the navigational aids (NAVAIDS), and designates the Grand Rapids, MI, (GRR) VOR/DME as the turning point for
aircraft transiting from the Badger, WI, (BAE) VORTAC to the Carleton, MI, (CRL) VORTAC.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


History




On September 15, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to alter
the description of Jet Route J-34 (58 FR 48331). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking
proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received.
Except for editorial changes, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. Jet routes are published in
paragraph 2004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by
reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The jet route listed in this document will be published subsequently
in the Order.


The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends the description of Jet Route J-34 by removing
the reference to the radials from the NAVAIDS and designates the Grand Rapids, MI, (GRR) VOR/DME as the turning point
for aircraft transiting from the Badger, WI, (BAE) VORTAC to the Carleton, MI, (CRL) VORTAC.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm.
1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Section 512(c)(2)(F)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(i) provides
a 5-year period of exclusivity to this original NADA beginning March 4, 1994, because no active ingredient (including
any ester or salt of the active ingredient) has been approved in any other application under section 512(b)(1) of the
act.
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is changing the operating regulations governing bridges over the Chicago River System which are owned
and operated by the City of Chicago. This final rule expands the periods of time when Chicago's highway bridges need
not open for the passage of recreational vessels, establishes a specific number of recreational vessels that will
be required to gather in order for the bridges to open, and requires recreational vessel owner/operators or their
representatives to give notice in advance of a vessel's time of intended passage through the draws. Additionally,
the period of time during the winter months when the bridges need open only after receiving an advance notice is expanded.
This final rule also adds a Wednesday opening for the passage of recreational vessels during the Spring break-out
period (April 15-June 15). This final rule also adds the Madison Street bridge to the bridge list for the South
Branch. The Madison Street Bridge was inadvertently left out of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. This action will
accommodate the needs of vehicle traffic while providing for the reasonable needs of navigation.

on December 17, 1993, with a comment period ending January 22, 1994. The Coast Guard received 132 letters commenting
on the proposal. Additionally, the Commander, Ninth Coast Guard District held a public hearing on January 20, 1994,
in Chicago, Illinois. There were 107 persons in attendance at the public hearing, of whom 32 made oral statements and/or
furnished data on the proposed regulations.



Background and Purpose



Presently, the bridges owned and operated by the City of Chicago are governed in accordance with 33 CFR 117.391 which
allows draws to remain closed through the peak vehicle traffic periods during the morning and afternoon rush hours.
In addition, certain bridges need not open for the passage of vessels unless notice is given in advance of a vessel's
intended time of passage through the draws. The City of Chicago has requested that, from April 1 through November 30,
the bridges which cross the Chicago River and the Chicago River Branches not be required to open for the passage of recreational
vessels except between the hours of 6:30 p.m. and 12 midnight on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and between the hours of 7 a.m.
and 7 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. During these times, the bridges would not be required to open unless there are no
fewer than five recreational vessels and not more than twenty-five recreational vessels available to transit during
the opening and these vessels have given at least twenty-four hours advance notice of their requested time of passage
through the draws. From December 1 through March 31, the draws of the highway bridges across the Chicago River, the
North Branch of the Chicago River, North Branch Canal, and the South Branch of the Chicago River shall open on signal
for all vessels if notice is given at least 12 hours in advance of a vessel's time of intended passage through the draws.
On December 22, 1993, the Coast Guard issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to change the permanent operating schedules
for the Chicago River bridges. This NPRM contained no weekday daytime openings, but did provide a 12-hour opening
period on Saturdays and Sundays, as well as a 6:30 p.m. to midnight opening period on Tuesdays and Thursdays.



Discussion of Comments and Changes



From the 132 comments received from the Public Notice, 35 commenters were in support of limiting the openings of the
Chicago bridges for recreational vessels, and 97 were opposed to limiting the openings of bridges for recreational
vessels. The comments in support of the proposal were from managers of businesses, building managers and officials
from various Departments of the City of Chicago. Reasons for support of the proposed regulations change submitted
were: A proposal to build a Chicago Central Area Circulator, a light rail system, that will be used to transport people
within the Chicago Loop; disruption of vehicle and pedestrian traffic when bridges open for the passage of vessels
during the day; the movement of emergency vehicles (fire, ambulance, police) that could allow response time when
a bridge is open for the passage of vessels; the cost of manpower to open the bridges; additional air pollution caused
while vehicles are stopped during bridge openings; and the disruption of deliveries made to and from various business
interests within the loop during business hours.

The comments opposing the proposed bridge operating regulations were concerned with unsafe conditions because
the two weekday openings begin when there are but a few hours of daylight left. Boaters do not reach Lake Michigan and
do not reach their respective marinas along the Lake Michigan Coast until late at night or early morning hours when
there is total darkness. In addition, these comments are concerned with unsafe conditions associated with the mass
of vessels that are required to gather in order to have the bridge open. The large number of vessels during periods of
darkness has caused some minor accidents among boaters on previous trips and they feel, should a serious accident
occur, or someone fall overboard, the night trips would cause a loss of life because it is more difficult to locate a
person in the water and conduct rescue operations when it is dark. Other comments received in opposition of the proposed
regulations showed concerns with the inability of bridgetenders to see when all vessels have cleared the bridge,
the loss of accessibility to the boatyards for normal and emergency vessel repairs, floating debris, unsafe seawalls
and submerged pilings in the water that are not visible during periods of darkness, the additional cost, and the availability
of professional help when a vessel needs towing or is in need of emergency repairs during late evening or early morning
hours.

Commenters were also opposed to the proposal stating the inability of the City of Chicago, and the lack of personnel
available, to move the mass of boaters in or out of the Chicago River System in a timely manner. Many of the commenters
requested that the Coast Guard, when considering a final regulation, protect their right to navigate on a federally
controlled waterway in a safe and timely manner, and develop a regulation that meets the interests of all parties,
both land and waterborne traffic. 

From the comments and data received in support of not opening the City of Chicago bridges for the passage of recreational
vessels on weekdays during the day, the proposed Central Area Circulator was a point considered for not opening the
bridges during this period of time. However, this light rail system is still in the planning and funding stages and,
at this point in time, daytime bridge openings will have no effect on a transportation system not yet in place. 

Of the 32 oral statements and data submitted at the Public Hearing, 8 were in support of limiting the openings of the
Chicago bridges for recreational vessels, and 23 were opposed to limiting the openings of bridges for recreational
vessels. 

After a review of the comments, the Coast Guard, to maintain safety on a navigable water of the United States, and to
protect the economic benefit of the river infrastructure, has added a Wednesday daytime opening period (11 a.m.-2
p.m.), 117.391(b)(1) during the Spring Breakout (April 15 through June 15). The Wednesday daytime opening will give
recreational boaters the opportunity to transit through the Chicago River System during daylight during the week.
Also, the Wednesday daytime opening will give the mariner the alternative to transit the river during the week if a
scheduled daytime trip on Saturday or Sunday is delayed or postponed due to a special event bridge closure, bridge
failure, or bad weather. 

One of the primary concerns of this rulemaking is the regulation on the draws during the Spring Breakout period, from
April 15 through June 15. The Coast Guard has determined that delay in implementing this rule would be contrary to the
public interest, and that good cause exists to make this rule effective in fewer than 30 days after publication in the


Federal Register

. In order that the new regulations be fully implemented during the 1994 Spring Breakout, this rule is being made effective
on April 18, 1994. 



Regulatory Evaluation 



This rule is not major under Executive Order 12886 and not significant under the Department of Transportation Regulatory
Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule
to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary. This change to the operating regulations for bridges
over the Chicago River System allows recreational vessels to navigate the Chicago River System during the times specified
by these regulations, after having given an advance notice to the City of Chicago. 



Small Entities 



This rule will provide boaters with adequate windows of time to transit to and from their respective boatyards while
providing the City of Chicago with relief during times when there is more than normal activity in the City. Therefore,
the Coast Guard certifies under 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) that this proposal will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



Collection of Information 



This proposal contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501


et seq.

). 



Federalism 



The Coast Guard has analyzed this final rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612
and has determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of
a Federalism Assessment.

Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.g.5 of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical
Exclusion Determination statement has been prepared and placed in the docket.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans and Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; State
of North Carolina 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On November 13, 1992, the State of North Carolina, through the North Carolina Department of Environment, Health,
and Natural Resources (NCDEHNR), submitted a maintenance plan and a request to redesignate the Raleigh/Durham area
(classified as a moderate nonattainment area) from nonattainment to attainment for ozone (O

3

). The O

3

 nonattainment area includes the following counties: Durham, Wake, and the Dutchville Township portion of Granville.
Under the Clean Air Act, designations can be changed if sufficient data are available to warrant such changes. In this
action, EPA is approving the State of North Carolina's submittal because it meets the maintenance plan and redesignation
requirements. The approved maintenance plan will become a federally enforceable part of the SIP for the Raleigh/Durham
area. 



On January 15, 1993, in a letter from Patrick Tobin to Governor James Hunt, the EPA notified the State of North Carolina
that the EPA had made a finding of failure to submit required programs for the nonattainment area. EPA's redesignation
of the Raleigh/Durham area to attainment abrogates those requirements for this area. Therefore, the sanctions and
federal implementation plan clocks begun by those findings are stopped at the time of the redesignation. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA) were enacted. (Pub. L. 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399,
codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q.) Under section 107(d)(1), in conjunction with the Governor of North Carolina,
EPA designated the Raleigh/Durham area as nonattainment because the area violated the O

3

 standard during the period from 1987 through 1989. Furthermore, upon designation, the Raleigh/Durham area was classified
as moderate under section 181(a)(1). (See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (November 30, 1992), codified
at 40 CFR 81.334.) 



The Raleigh/Durham area more recently has ambient monitoring data that show no violations of the O

3

 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), during the period from 1989 through 1992. Therefore, in an effort
to comply with the CAA and to ensure continued attainment of the NAAQS, on November 13, 1992, the State of North Carolina
submitted for parallel processing an O

3

 maintenance SIP for the Raleigh/Durham area and requested redesignation of the area to attainment with respect to
the O

3

 NAAQS. On January 13, 1993, the NCDEHNR submitted evidence that a public hearing was held on the maintenance plan and
on July 8, 1993, the maintenance plan became State effective. In addition, there have been no violations reported
for the 1993 O

3

 season. 


On August 11, 1993, Region IV determined that the information received from the NCDEHNR constituted a complete redesignation
request under the general completeness criteria of 40 CFR part 51, appendix V, sections 2.1 and 2.2. However, for purposes
of determining what requirements are applicable for redesignation purposes, EPA believes it is necessary to identify
when NCDEHNR first submitted a redesignation request that meets the completeness criteria. EPA noted in a previous
policy memorandum that parallel processing requests for submittals under the CAA, including redesignation submittals,
would not be determined complete. See the memorandum entitled ``State Implementation Plan (SIP) Actions Submitted
in Response to Clean Air Act (Act) Deadlines'' from John Calcagni to Air Programs Division Directors, Regions I-X,
dated October 28, 1992 (Memorandum). The rationale for this conclusion was that the parallel processing exception
to the completeness criteria (40 CFR part 51, appendix V, section 2.3) was not intended to extend statutory due dates
for mandatory submittals. (See Memorandum at 3-4.) However, since requests for redesignation are not mandatory
submittals under the CAA, EPA believes that it must change its policy with respect to redesignation submittals to
conform to the existing completeness criteria. Therefore, EPA believes, the parallel processing exception to the
completeness criteria may be applied to redesignation request submittals, at least until such time as the EPA decides
to revise that exception. NCDEHNR submitted a redesignation request on November 13, 1992. In the November 13 submittal,
NCDEHNR submitted the maintenance plan, thereby including the final element to make the November 13, 1992, request
for parallel processing complete under the parallel processing exception to the completeness criteria. When the
maintenance plan became state effective on July 8, 1993, the State of North Carolina no longer needed parallel processing
for the redesignation request and maintenance plan. Therefore, the EPA informed the State of North Carolina on August
11, 1993, that the redesignation request and maintenance plan submittals were complete under the general completeness
criteria. 

The North Carolina redesignation request for the Raleigh/Durham area meets the five requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E)
for redesignation to attainment. The following is a brief description of how the State of North Carolina has fulfilled
each of these requirements. Because the maintenance plan is a critical element of the redesignation request, EPA
will discuss its evaluation of the maintenance plan under its analysis of the redesignation request.

1. The Area Must Have Attained the O

3

 NAAQS 



The State of North Carolina's request is based on an analysis of quality assured ambient air quality monitoring data
which is relevant to the maintenance plan and to the redesignation request. Most recent ambient air quality monitoring
data for calendar year 1989 through calendar year 1992 show an expected exceedence rate of less than 1.0 per year of
the O

3

 NAAQS in the Raleigh/Durham area. (See 40 CFR 50.9 and appendix H.) Because the Raleigh/Durham area has complete quality-assured
data showing no violations of the standard over the most recent consecutive three calendar year period, the Raleigh/Durham
area has met the first statutory criterion of attainment of the O

3

 NAAQS. In addition, there were no violations reported for the 1993 O

3

 season. The State of North Carolina has committed to continue monitoring in this area in accordance with 40 CFR part
58. 



2. The Area Has Met All Applicable Requirements Under Section 110 and Part D of the Act 



On April 17, 1980, and on September 10, 1980, EPA fully approved North Carolina's SIP as meeting the requirements of
section 110(a)(2) and part D of the 1977 CAA (45 FR 26038 and 45 FR 59578). The amended CAA, however, revised section
110(a)(2) and, under part D, revised section 172 and added new requirements for all nonattainment areas. Therefore,
for purposes of redesignation, to meet the requirement that the SIP contain all applicable requirements under the
CAA, EPA reviewed the North Carolina SIP to ensure that it contained all measures due under the amended CAA prior to
or at the time the State of North Carolina submitted its redesignation request. 



A. Section 110 Requirements 



Although section 110 was amended, the Raleigh/Durham area SIP meets the requirements of amended section 110(a)(2).
A number of the requirements did not change in substance and, therefore, EPA believes that the pre-amendment SIP met
these requirements. As to those requirements that were amended, see 57 FR 27936 and 57 FR 27939 (June 23, 1992), many
are duplicative of other requirements of the CAA. EPA has analyzed the SIP and determined that it is consistent with
the requirements of amended section 110(a)(2). 



B. Part D Requirements 



Before the Raleigh/Durham area may be redesignated to attainment, it also must have fulfilled the applicable requirements
of part D. Under part D, an area's classification indicates the requirements to which it will be subject. Subpart 1
of part D sets forth the basic nonattainment requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas, classified as well
as nonclassifiable. Subpart 2 of part D establishes additional requirements for O

3

 nonattainment areas classified under table 1 of section 181(a). The Raleigh/Durham area is classified as moderate
(See 56 FR 56694, codified at 40 CFR 81.334). The State of North Carolina submitted their request for redesignation
of the Raleigh/Durham area prior to November 15, 1992. Therefore, in order to be redesignated to attainment, the State
of North Carolina must meet the applicable requirements of subpart 1 of part D, specifically sections 172(c) and 176,
and the requirements of subpart 2 of part D, which became due on or before November 13, 1992, the date the State submitted
a complete redesignation request. 



B1. Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 172 



Section 172(c) sets forth general requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas. Under section 172(b), the
section 172(c) requirements are applicable as determined by the Administrator but no later than three years after
an area is designated as nonattainment. EPA had not determined that these requirements were applicable to classified
O

3

 nonattainment areas on or before November 13, 1992, the date that the State of North Carolina submitted a complete
redesignation request for the Raleigh/Durham area. Therefore, the State of North Carolina was not required to meet
these requirements for purposes of redesignation. 

Upon redesignation of this area to attainment, the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions contained
in part C of title I are applicable. On December 30, 1976, and on February 23, 1982, the EPA approved the State of North
Carolina's PSD program (41 FR 56805 and 47 FR 78376). 



B2. Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 176 Conformity Plan Provisions 



Section 176 of the CAA requires States to develop transportation/air quality conformity procedures which are consistent
with federal conformity regulations. Section 176 provides that EPA must develop federal conformity regulations,
requiring states to submit these procedures as a SIP revision by November 15, 1992. EPA promulgated final conformity
regulations on November 24, 1993 (transportation conformity) and November 30, 1993 (general conformity). Since
it was impossible to establish a SIP revision date of November 15, 1992, in these regulations, EPA established a regulatory
submittal date of one year after promulgation of the conformity regulations. The State of North Carolina has committed
in their maintenance plan to revise the SIP to be consistent with the final federal regulations. In addition, the State
Air Quality Section will work closely with the State Department of Transportation (DOT) and local transportation
agencies to assure that Transportation Improvement Programs (TIPs) in the maintenance areas are consistent with
and conform to the SIP and meet federal requirements on conformity. This review process is being extended to include
all major projects regardless of source of funding, as well as all federally funded projects. A complete description
of the conformity review process is included in the TSD prepared for this notice.

B3. Subpart 2 of Part D 



Under section 182(a)(2)(A) areas that retained a designation of nonattainment for O

3

 under the amended CAA and that are classified as marginal or above were required to fix their pre-amendment VOC RACT
SIPs. North Carolina was not required to submit VOC RACT fixups for purposes of redesignating the Raleigh/Durham
area because the Raleigh/Durham area was not nonattainment before the 1990 amendments to the CAA. 

Under section 182(b), several requirements were due for moderate O

3

 nonattainment areas on November 15, 1992, such as VOC RACT catch-ups, Gasoline Vapor Recovery, New Source Review,
and Emission Statements. North Carolina failed to submit these measures for the Raleigh/Durham area. On January
15, 1993, EPA made a finding of failure to submit these measures by letter from Patrick M. Tobin, Acting Regional Administrator,
to James B. Hunt, Jr., Governor of North Carolina. However these requirements are not applicable for purposes of considering
the State's redesignation request. For purposes of redesignation, EPA must consider whether the State has met all
requirements that were applicable prior to the time the state submitted the redesignation request. Since North Carolina
submitted the redesignation request for Raleigh/Durham on November 13, 1992, these measures are not relevant for
purposes of redesignation. Therefore, all subpart 2 requirements that were applicable at the time the State submitted
its redesignation request have been met. 



3. The Area Has a Fully Approved SIP Under Section 110(k) of the CAA 



Based on the approval of provisions under the pre-amended CAA and EPA's prior approval of SIP revisions under the amended
CAA, EPA has determined that the Raleigh/Durham area has a fully approved SIP under section 110(k), which also meets
the applicable requirements of section 110 and part D as discussed above. 



4. The Air Quality Improvement Must Be Permanent and Enforceable 



Several control measures have come into place since the Raleigh/Durham area violated the O

3

 NAAQS. Of these control measures, two control measures produced the most significant decreases in VOC and NO

X

 emissions. One control measure is a reduction of fuel volatility, as measured by the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), from
10.1 psi in 1988 to 9.0 psi in 1990 and then to 7.8 psi in the summer of 1992. As a result of the RVP reductions, there has
been a reduction of emissions of VOCs of more than 25% from 1988 to 1992 from gasoline powered vehicles of all classes.
The other control measure is the improvement in tailpipe emissions associated with the Federal Motor Vehicle Control
Program (FMVCP). This program reduces VOC and NO

X

 emissions as newer, cleaner vehicles replace older, high emitting vehicles. VOC emissions reductions are 20.9%
from 1988 to 1990 and NO

X

 emissions reductions are 2.7% from 1988 to 1990. 


In association with its emission inventory discussed below, the State of North Carolina has demonstrated that actual
enforceable emission reductions are responsible for the recent air quality improvement and that the VOC emissions
in the base year are not artificially low due to local economic downturn. 



5. The Area Must Have a Fully Approved Maintenance Plan Pursuant to Section 175A of the Act 



Section 175A of the CAA sets forth the elements of a maintenance plan for areas seeking redesignation from nonattainment
to attainment. The plan must demonstrate continued attainment of the applicable NAAQS for at least ten years after
the Administrator approves a redesignation to attainment. Eight years after the redesignation, the state must submit
a revised maintenance plan which demonstrates attainment for the ten years following the initial ten-year period.
To provide for the possibility of future NAAQS violations, the maintenance plan must contain contingency measures,
with a schedule for implementation, adequate to assure prompt correction of any air quality problems. 

In this notice, EPA is approving the State of North Carolina's maintenance plan for the Raleigh/Durham area because
EPA finds that the State of North Carolina's submittal meets the requirements of section 175A. 



A. Emissions Inventory_Base Year Inventory 



On November 13, 1992, the State of North Carolina submitted comprehensive inventories of VOC, NO

X

, and CO emissions from the Raleigh/Durham area. The inventories included biogenic, area, stationary, and mobile
sources using 1990 as the base year for calculations to demonstrate maintenance. The 1990 inventory is considered
representative of attainment conditions because the NAAQS was not violated during 1990. The 1990 Base Year Emission
Inventory for the Raleigh/Durham area has been submitted to EPA in SIP Air Pollutant Inventory Management Subsystem
(SAMS) format. 

The State of North Carolina submittal contains the detailed inventory data and summaries by county and source category.
This comprehensive base year emissions inventory was submitted in the SAMS format. Finally, this inventory was prepared
in accordance with EPA guidance. A summary of the base year and projected maintenance year inventories are shown in
the following three tables. Refer to the TSD prepared for this notice for more in-depth details regarding the base
year inventory for the Raleigh/Durham area.

B. Demonstration of Maintenance_Projected Inventories






Total VOC, NO

X

, and CO emissions were projected from the 1990 base year out to 2004. These projected inventories were prepared in
accordance with EPA guidance. Refer to EPA's TSD prepared for this notice for more in-depth details regarding the
projected inventory for the Raleigh/Durham area.

On January 12, 1994, the State of North Carolina submitted supplemental projection inventories. The State recalculated
growth rates to include 1992 Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) data received in late 1993 from the North Carolina Department
of Transportation. The projections indicate that VOC, NO

x

, and CO emissions remain under the 1990 baseline emission inventory from 1990 through 2004. EPA believes that the
emissions projections demonstrate that the area will continue to maintain the O

3

 NAAQS because this area achieved attainment through VOC controls and reductions. The projected emission inventories
were submitted in the SAMS format.



C. Verification of Continued Attainment



Continued attainment of the O

3

 NAAQS in the Raleigh/Durham area depends, in part, on the State of North Carolina's efforts toward tracking indicators
of continued attainment during the maintenance period. The State of North Carolina's contingency plan is triggered
by two indicators, an air quality violation or the periodic emissions inventory exceeding the baseline emission
inventory by more than 10%. As stated in the maintenance plan, the NCDEHNR will be developing these periodic emissions
inventories every three years beginning in 1996. These periodic inventories will help to verify continued attainment.
Refer to the TSD prepared for this notice for a more complete discussion of the indicators the State is tracking and
the contingency measures.



D. Contingency Plan



The level of VOC and NO

x

 emissions in the Raleigh/Durham area will largely determine its ability to stay in compliance with the O

3

 NAAQS in the future. Despite the State's best efforts to demonstrate continued compliance with the NAAQS, the ambient
air pollutant concentrations may exceed or violate the NAAQS. Therefore, the State of North Carolina has provided
contingency measures with a schedule for implementation in the event of a future O

3

 air quality problem. The plan contains a contingency to implement pre-adopted additional control measures such
as Reasonable Available Control Technology (RACT) level control for not previously controlled VOC sources, Stage
II vapor control for gasoline dispensing facilities, and new source permit requirements for VOC and NO

x

 emissions to include emission offsets, Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) level control, and permit applicability.
These pre-adopted additional measures will be implemented within 45 days of the date the State certifies to EPA that
the air quality data which demonstrates a violation of the O

3

 NAAQS is quality assured. The plan also contains a secondary trigger that will apply where no actual violation of the
NAAQS has occurred. The secondary trigger is an exceedance of the baseline emissions inventory by more than 10%. On
the occurrence of the secondary trigger, the State will commence, within 60 days of the trigger, regulation development
and adoption of measures amending the State vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program, extending coverage
of the I/M program, extending and/or lowering vapor pressure limits for gasoline, extending geographic coverage
of RACT controls, transportation control measures, and RACT level control for NO

x

. A complete description of these contingency measures and their triggers can be found in the TSD prepared for this
notice. EPA finds that the contingency measures provided in the State of North Carolina submittal meet the requirements
of section 175A(d) of the CAA.

E. Subsequent Maintenance Plan Revisions 



In accordance with section 175A(b) of the CAA, the State of North Carolina has agreed to submit a revised maintenance
SIP eight years after the area is redesignated to attainment. Such revised SIP will provide for maintenance for an
additional ten years. 



Final Action 



In this final action, EPA is approving the Raleigh/Durham O

3

 maintenance plan, including the 1990 base year emission inventory, because it meets the requirements of section
175A. In addition, the EPA is redesignating the Raleigh/Durham area to attainment for O

3

 because the State of North Carolina has demonstrated compliance with the requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E) for
redesignation. This action stops the sanctions and federal implementation plan clocks that were triggered for the
Raleigh/Durham area by the January 15, 1993, findings letter. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting
or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to
the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in
relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 

The O

3

 SIP is designed to satisfy the requirements of part D of the CAA and to provide for attainment and maintenance of the
O

3

 NAAQS. This final redesignation should not be interpreted as authorizing the State of North Carolina to delete, alter,
or rescind any of the VOC or NO

x

 emission limitations and restrictions contained in the approved O

3

 SIP. Changes to O

3

 SIP VOC regulations rendering them less stringent than those contained in the EPA approved plan cannot be made unless
a revised plan for attainment and maintenance is submitted to and approved by EPA. Unauthorized relaxations, deletions,
and changes could result in a finding of nonimplementation (section 173(b) of the CAA) or in a SIP deficiency call made
pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the CAA. 

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing
the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that
the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small
businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of
less than 50,000. 

Redesignation of an area to attainment under section 107(d)(3)(E) of the CAA does not impose any new requirements
on small entities. Redesignation is an action that affects the status of a geographical area and does not impose any
regulatory requirements on sources. The Administrator certifies that the approval of the redesignation request
will not affect a substantial number of small entities. 

This action is being taken without prior proposal because the changes are noncontroversial and EPA anticipates no
significant comments on them. The public should be advised that this action will be effective June 17, 1994. If, however,
notice is received by May 18, 1994 that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments, this action will be withdrawn
and two subsequent notices will be published before the effective date. One will withdraw the final action and the
other will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a comment period. 

Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed
in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by June 17, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration
by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2).) 

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989, (54 FR 2214-2225) as revised by a Memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro to Regional Administrators,
dated October 4, 1993. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions
(54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. The U.S. EPA has submitted a request
for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such
time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive
Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 

Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for a revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall
be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to
relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Revision to the U.S. Virgin Islands Implementation Plan



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 With one exception, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a request from the U.S. Virgin Islands
to revise its air pollution control plan prepared under the Clean Air Act to include a comprehensive revision to the
Virgin Islands' air pollution control regulations.



EPA is approving a special 1.5 percent sulfur content limit for residual fuel oil used by two specific sources, however,
EPA is disapproving this special limit for Martin Marietta, St. Croix (now known as Virgin Islands Alumina Corporation).

EPA is approving subsections 204-40(e) of ``Reports, Sampling and Analysis of Waste Fuels A and B,'' and 206-25(c)
of ``Test Methods.'' However, these provisions permit the Commissioner to approve alternate requirements that
are not incorporated in the Virgin Islands Implementation Plan. Any variances adopted pursuant to these subsections
become applicable only if approved by EPA.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On March 20, 1987, the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources (DPNR) submitted revisions to
title 12, chapter 9, subchapters 204 and 206 of the Virgin Islands Code, effective January 15, 1987, to the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) for incorporation into the Virgin Islands Implementation Plan. Specific revisions to Subchapter
204 included the amending of sections 204-20 through 204-23, 204-25, 26, 28, 29 and the addition
of new sections 204-33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 and 45. Specific revisions to subchapter 206 include amending
and redesignating sections 206-23 through 206-30 as sections 206-24 through 206-31, and
the addition of a new section 206-23. The DPNR held public hearings on these revisions in St. Thomas on September
8 and 9, 1986.



On December 14, 1989 (54 FR 51303), EPA published a 

Federal Register

 notice proposing to approve all but one of the comprehensive revisions to the Virgin Islands' submittal. Specifically,
EPA proposed to disapprove subsection 204-26(a)(2), which allowed a special 1.5 percent sulfur in residual
fuel limit for Martin Marietta, now known as Virgin Islands Alumina Corporation. The December 14, 1989 

Federal Register

 notice solicited comments on the revised regulations and EPA's proposed action in response to the revisions. No comments
were received.

EPA is approving the revised regulations as part of the Virgin Islands Implementation Plan except for the disapproval
of subsection 204-26(a)(2) as it relates to Martin Marietta (VI Alumina Corporation). In subsection 204-26(a)(2)
the maximum allowable sulfur content of distillate and residual oil expressed in percent by weight are now 0.3 and
0.5, respectively, for all of the Virgin Islands except for the special 1.5 percent sulfur content limit for residual
fuel oil used by two specific sources (Hess Oil in St. Croix and Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority in St. Thomas).

It should be noted that EPA also is taking action at this time to approve a control strategy demonstration for sulfur
dioxide as it relates to the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority (VIWAPA) plant in St. Croix, based on the attainment
demonstration included in its Prevention of Significant Deterioration of Air Quality (PSD) permit application.
EPA has received and approved the PSD permit attainment demonstration, which conforms to EPA's ``Guideline on Air
Quality Models (Revised 1986).''

On December 28, 1992, EPA approved a PSD permit for four units at VIWAPA's north shore facility in St. Croix. A revised
attainment demonstration required to be included in the permit application specified a 0.33 percent sulfur content
limit in No. 6 residual fuel oil for the two existing boilers and a 0.2 percent sulfur content limit in No. 2 distillate
fuel oil in the remaining units. Although a 0.5 percent sulfur content limit in residual fuel oil and a 0.3 percent sulfur
content limit in distillate fuel oil for the VIWAPA plant in St. Croix are included in subsection 204-26(a)(2)
and approved under this action, this limit has been superseded by the limits contained in VIWAPA's PSD permit. The
PSD permit meets all applicable requirements of the PSD regulations codified in 40 CFR 52.21 and the Clean Air Act.

On August 12, 1986 EPA sent a letter to the Governor of the Virgin Islands notifying him that the Virgin Island Implementation
Plan was substantially inadequate to achieve and maintain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for
sulfur dioxide as it relates to VIWAPA's north shore facility in St. Croix. EPA's approval of the lower sulfur in fuel
oil limitations included in the PSD permit for VIWAPA and the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision rectify this
inadequacy and is consistent with the Clean Air Act Amendments (Act), enacted on November 15, 1990, requirements
of attaining and maintaining the NAAQS for sulfur dioxide.

EPA also is approving section 204-28, which establishes new opacity limits for internal combustion engines,
and section 204-37, which provides for the regulated use of waste fuel oils. These approvals are based on certain
understandings which were described in EPA's proposal. Approval of section 204-25, which regulates sources
of fugitive emissions, is based upon EPA's definition of the term ``fugitive emissions,'' since the existing and
revised regulations did not include a definition of this term.

EPA is approving subsections 204-40(e) and 206-25(c) where methods other than the Reference Methods
contained in parts 60 and 61 of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR) are used to demonstrate compliance.
These subsections permit the Commissioner to approve alternate requirements in those instances where the source
is unable to make use of the reference methods. They are intended to allow the Commissioner to respond to situations
which were not envisioned when the specific requirements were adopted, yet insure that the source complies with the
intent of the regulation. While EPA understands the need for such provisions, any changes which affect the SIP approved
emission limits used to demonstrate attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS must be federally enforceable and, therefore,
must be addressed through revisions to the SIP. EPA can only accept alternate requirements if these changes are approved
by EPA.

EPA also is revising the Table at 40 CFR 52.2773, ``EPA-approved Virgin Islands regulations,'' to reflect these newly
adopted regulations. The Table previously referenced the date the regulation was submitted, but has now been changed
to refer to the date when the regulation became effective.

Sections 206-30 and 206-31 have been renumbered to Sections 206-31 and 206-32, respectively.
EPA's previous determination concerning their approvability remains, along with the previous effective and approved
dates.

This SIP revision is intended to strengthen the Virgin Islands Implementation Plan, (especially with regard to sulfur
dioxide and particulates), by incorporating revised and new regulations which are consistent with the Act as interpreted
in current EPA guidance. Although this SIP revision was not intended to fulfill any specific provision of the Act,
EPA is approving the revision under section 110 of the Act, because it serves to strengthen the Virgin Islands Implementation
Plan and it is consistent with the Act's requirements for attaining and maintaining the NAAQS for sulfur dioxide and
particulate matter.



Conclusion



EPA is approving a special 1.5 percent sulfur content limit for residual fuel oil used by two specific sources, however,
EPA is disapproving this special limit for Martin Marietta, St. Croix (VI Alumina Corporation). Martin Marietta,
St. Croix (VI Alumina Corporation) is required to burn the maximum allowable sulfur content of distillate and residual
oil expressed in percent by weight of 0.3 and 0.5, respectively, in order to meet the PSD requirements specified in
part C of the Act.

EPA is approving subsections 204-40(e) of ``Reports, Sampling and Analysis of Waste Fuels A and B,'' and 206-25(c)
of ``Test Methods.'' However, these provisions permit the Commissioner to approve alternate requirements that
are not incorporated in the SIP. Any variances adopted pursuant to these subsections become applicable only if approved
by EPA. 

EPA's approval of the SIP revision, specifically the lower sulfur in fuel oil limitations and modeling demonstration
for St. Croix included in the PSD permit for VIWAPA, rectify the SIP inadequacy to achieve and maintain the primary
NAAQS for sulfur dioxide identified in the August 12, 1986 letter sent to the Governor of the Virgin Islands. 

This notice is issued as required by section 110 of the Act. The Regional Administrator's decision regarding the approval
of this plan revision is based on its meeting the requirements of section 110 of the Act and 40 CFR part 51. 

Nothing in this rule should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for a revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 

This rule makes final the action proposed at 54 FR 51303, December 14, 1989. As noted elsewhere in this notice, EPA received
no adverse public comments on the proposed rule. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has reclassified
this rule from Table 1 to Table 2 under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January 19, 1989. EPA has
submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The Office of Management and Budget
has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. 

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this rule must be filed in the United States Court
of Appeals for the appropriate circuit within 60 days from date of publication. Filing a petition for reconsideration
by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review
nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This rule may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See 307(b)(2).)

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans Tennessee: Approval of Revisions to the Portion of the State Implementation
Plan Regulating Volatile Organic Compounds and Determining General Alternate Emission Standards




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On June 25, 1992, and March 22, 1993, the State of Tennessee through the Department of Environment and Conservation
submitted revisions to its State Implementation Plan (SIP) regarding general definitions, control of volatile
organic compounds (VOCs), and general alternate emission standards.



On November 5, 1992, and April 22, 1993, the State submitted revisions to the VOC regulations and general alternate
emission standards in the Memphis-Shelby County portion of the Tennessee SIP on behalf of Memphis-Shelby County.
Since Memphis-Shelby County adopts the State's regulations by reference, the submitted SIP revisions were essentially
identical to the regulations in the State's submittal.

EPA is approving or conditionally approving revisions to the Tennessee SIP and the Memphis-Shelby County portion
of the Tennessee SIP as meeting the requirements of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (CAA). The State and Memphis
submittals addressed, or committed to address, all of the deficiencies identified in the State's VOC regulations
and documented by EPA in letters to the State dated November 9, 1987, June 10, 1987, and January 25, 1990, and to Memphis-Shelby
County dated November 9, 1987. EPA is disapproving the deletion of rule 1200-3-18-.03 Standard
for New Sources.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In May 1988, EPA released 1987 air quality data which established the degree to which areas throughout the Nation attained,
or failed to attain, the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) and issued SIP calls for areas that failed
to attain. The Memphis and Nashville areas in Tennessee failed to attain the ozone NAAQS. On September 7, 1988, at 53
FR 34500, EPA gave notice that SIP calls were made to the nonattainment areas.



The SIP call letters, which were sent to Governors and State Air Pollution Control Directors, requested that the states
respond to the SIP calls in two phases. The response to Phase I was due approximately one year following the issuance
of final EPA policy program requirements for ozone and carbon monoxide nonattainment areas and/or reauthorization
of the CAA. As part of the first phase, states were asked to upgrade SIPs to correct discrepancies in existing SIPs as
compared with EPA's existing guidance under section 108 and part D (related to reasonably available control technology
(RACT) for VOC emissions) and to adopt control measures to satisfy any commitments in the part D SIP's to adopt RACT
measures.

In 1990, Congress amended the CAA to address, among other things, continued nonattainment of the ozone NAAQS (Public
Law 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q). Section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA requires
states with existing areas designated nonattainment for ozone and classified as at least marginal, to submit, by
May 15, 1991, revisions to the SIP that correct or add requirements concerning RACT in accordance with pre-
amendment guidance.

1

 The SIP call letters interpreted that guidance and indicated the corrections necessary for specific nonattainment
areas.





The Memphis area is classified as marginal nonattainment and the Nashville area is classified as moderate nonattainment

2

 for the ozone NAAQS. Therefore, these areas are subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991, deadline.






Tennessee failed to meet the May 15, 1991, deadline for the submittal of corrections to the State (including the State's
portion of the Nashville nonattainment area), Memphis-Shelby County, and some of the Nashville-Davidson County
regulations

3

. EPA notified the State on June 25, 1991, that a finding of failure to submit had been made for the Memphis-Shelby County
and Nashville nonattainment areas. This finding of failure to submit was published at 56 FR 54557 on October 22, 1991.
The finding triggered the 18-month time clock for mandatory application of sanctions under section 179(a) of the
CAA and the 2-year time clock for promulgation of Federal VOC regulations for nonattainment areas as required by section
110(c)(1).





The State submitted revisions to the Tennessee SIP, including Nashville, to EPA on June 25, 1992, and on March 22, 1993.
The State submitted SIP revisions to meet the section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement on behalf of Memphis-Shelby County
on November 5, 1992, and on April 22, 1993. EPA found these submittals to be complete on October 6, 1993, and June 9, 1993,
respectively. This finding of completeness stopped the sanctions clock started on October 22, 1991, for the Memphis-Shelby
County and Nashville nonattainment areas. However, the Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) clock continued to run.
EPA's final approval action relieves EPA of the FIP obligation for those portions of the submittal that are being fully
approved. EPA is approving the following revisions except where it is specifically noted that the revision is being
conditionally approved or disapproved.

 


Chapter 1200-3-2 General Definitions


The following changes were made only to the Tennessee portion of the SIP, and not to the Memphis portion.



Rule 1200-3-2-.01 General Definitions 


The definition of ``air contaminant source'' was revised to correct a typographical error. The revision added the
phrase ``portable fuel-burning equipment, and incinerators of all types, indoor and,'' to the definition of ``air
contaminant source.''

The definitions of ``air curtain destructor,'' ``open burning,'' ``Ringelmann chart,'' ``soiling index,'' ``silicon
carbide plant,'' and ``magnetite processing plant'' were deleted.

Minor changes were made to the definitions of ``modification'' and ``reasonably available control technology''
to correct typographical errors and for clarification.

The definition of ``malfunction'' was revised to correct a typographical error. The revision added failures that
are caused by poor maintenance, careless operation, or any other preventable upset condition to the definition of
``malfunction.''
 
The definition of ``startup'' was revised to specify that ``startup is the setting in operation of an air contaminant

source for the production of product for sale or use as raw materials or steam or heat production.''

Definitions of ``continuous emission monitor,'' ``nonattainment area,'' ``PM-10,'' and ``total suspended
particulate (TSP)'' were added.

Minor revisions to the definitions of ``air pollution,'' ``board,'' and ``cupola'' were withdrawn by the State via
letter dated January 11, 1993, from Mr. John W. Walton, Technical Secretary of the Tennessee Air Pollution Control
Board.

Rule 1200-3-18-.29 Graphic Arts-Rotogravure and Flexography.




Rule 1200-3-18-.01 Purpose and General Provisions 


The following changes were made to both the Tennessee and Memphis portions of the SIP. 
Paragraph (1) was revised to change the applicability of emission standards and requirements from ``new and existing''
sources to ``certain'' sources of VOCs for which applicability is specified in this chapter or other chapters of division
1200-3. This paragraph was also revised to state that ``[i]n determining whether the source category at a facility
satisfies the applicability standard of a specific rule, the potential emissions from all sources of the source category
shall be totaled.''

Paragraph (3) was added to describe the standards that limit the pounds of VOCs per gallon of material. These standards
must now specify the allowable VOC content per gallon of material less water. Demonstration of compliance with the
VOC content standards of chapter 1200-3-18 was also addressed in paragraph (3). This paragraph states
that compliance ``other than by use of complying materials, shall be demonstrated by the limitation of volatile organic
compound emissions to a level equivalent to the quantities which theoretically would be emitted if complying materials
would be used.''

Paragraph (4) describing methods for proof of compliance with the standards in chapter 1200-3-18 was
also added to this rule. EPA is conditionally approving subparagraph 1200-3-18-.01(4)(b) in the
Memphis submittal because it provides for determination of the VOC content, water content, densities, volume solids,
and weight solids by certification from the manufacturer, if supported by batch formulation records and approved
by the Technical Secretary. Based on Attachment 4 to the May 25, 1988, ``Blue Book,'' the reference to batch formulation
data must be changed to batch analytical data. In a letter dated January 25, 1994, the State committed for Memphis to
correct this deficiency by February 1, 1995. EPA is not approving this revision for the area of Tennessee outside of
the Memphis-Shelby county area because the State of Tennessee revised this rule in a subsequent submittal on May 18,
1993, which will be acted on by EPA in a later notice.

Subparagraph 1200-3-18-.01(4)(c), which refers to the procedure for the determination of capture
efficiency, was withdrawn by the State via letter dated August 26, 1992, from Mr. John W. Walton, Technical Secretary
of the Tennessee Air Pollution Control Board. Subparagraph 1200-3-18-.01(4)(c) was not included
in the Memphis-Shelby County submittal.

Paragraph (5) describing monitoring to confirm continuing compliance and daily recordkeeping procedures was added.
Paragraph (6) providing for a nonrenewable exemption from the standards in chapter 1200-3-18 was also
added.



Rule 1200-3-18-.02 Definitions 


The definitions of ``urban county,'' ``rural county,'' and ``approved'' were deleted. The definitions of ``volatile
organic compound'' and ``coating line'' were revised to correct deficiencies. Definitions of ``exempt solvent,''
``operation,'' ``potential VOC emissions,'' ``potential emissions,'' and ``legally enforceable'' were added.
A minor revision was made to the definition of ``existing source'' to change the word ``process(es)'' to ``process.''



Rule 1200-3-18-.03 Standard for New Sources 


Tennessee proposed to delete this rule in its entirety. EPA is disapproving the deletion of this rule for the Tennessee
submittal because Tennessee does not have federally approved New Source Review (NSR) regulations which apply to
some of the sources in this chapter. EPA is approving the deletion of this rule for the Memphis submittal because the
federally approved Tennessee NSR applies to the Memphis-Shelby County area. Section 110(l) of the CAA provides that
EPA shall not approve a SIP revision if the revision interferes with any applicable requirements concerning attainment
and reasonable further progress, or any other applicable requirements of the CAA. Section 110(k) of the CAA addresses
the situation in which an entire submittal, or a separable portion of a submittal, meets all applicable requirements
of the CAA. In the case where a separable portion of the submittal meets all of the applicable requirements, partial
approval may be used to approve that part of the submittal and disapprove the remainder. EPA has determined that the
proposed deletion of this rule is separable from the submittal because the other revisions apply to existing sources
and this proposed revision applies only to new sources.

Tennessee may submit the deletion of this rule with the submittal of their revised NSR regulations. For the deletion
to be approvable, the revised NSR regulation must meet the provisions of part D of title I of the CAA, must contain requirements
that will apply to the sources under this chapter and must be at least as stringent as the rule they propose to delete.



Rule 1200-3-18-.04 Alternate Emission Standard 


This rule was deleted in its entirety. Alternate emission standards for VOCs were added to chapter 1200-3-21.




Rule 1200-3-18-.05 Automobile and Light Duty Truck Manufacturing 


This rule was deleted in its entirety because there were no sources subject to the rule as contained in the Tennessee
SIP and the Memphis portion of the Tennessee SIP. A new regulation for such sources consistent with EPA guidance has
been submitted by the State and EPA will act on this submittal in a subsequent document.



Rule 1200-3-18-.06 Paper Coating 


The definition of ``Paper coating'' in subparagraph (1)(b) was revised to include ``decorative, functional, and
protective coatings.'' Paragraph (2) was revised to make saturation operations subject to the provisions of this
rule.

Paragraph (3) was revised to clarify the discharge limitation for the owner or operator of a paper coating line subject
to this rule. The limitation disallows ``the discharge into the atmosphere of any volatile organic compound in excess
of 0.35 kilograms per liter (2.9 pounds per gallon) of coating as applied (or as delivered to the applicator), excluding
water and exempt solvents, except as provided in 1200-3-18-.01(3).''




Rule 1200-3-18-.07 Petroleum Liquid Storage 


The reference to rule 1200-3-18-.41 was deleted in paragraph (4) because the rule was changed and
the exemption is no longer applicable.



Rule 1200-3-18-.08 Bulk Gasoline Plants 



Minor revisions were made to the exemptions in paragraph (3) for purposes of correction and clarification.



Rule 1200-3-18-.09 Bulk Gasoline Terminals 


A condition was added to the loading restrictions in paragraph (3). This condition states that no person may load gasoline
into any tank trucks or trailers from any bulk gasoline terminal unless all loading and vapor lines are equipped with
fittings which are vapor-tight.

Paragraph (6) was added to specify the applicable test method for determining VOC emissions from bulk gasoline terminals.
This paragraph included subparagraphs which describe the principle, method summary, applicability, apparatus,
test requirements, basic measurements required, 
test procedure, calculations, and calibrations of the test method.



Rule 1200-3-18-.10 Gasoline Service Stations Stage I 


The exemptions in paragraph (3) were revised. EPA is conditionally approving the exemption in subparagraph (3)(a)
of the Memphis submittal because it provides for director's discretion and therefore is not approvable. The exemption
specifies that gasoline dispensing facilities equipped with control devices which have been approved by the Technical
Secretary as providing emission reductions equivalent to that provided by floating roofs are exempt from this rule.
In a letter dated January 25, 1994, the State committed for Memphis to correct this deficiency by February 1, 1995.
EPA is not approving this revision for the area of Tennessee outside of the Memphis-Shelby county area because the
State of Tennessee revised this rule in a subsequent submittal on May 18, 1993, which will be acted on by EPA in a later
document.

Subparagraph (3)(b) was revised to change the exemption from ``stationary gasoline storage containers of less than
7,570 liters (2,000 gallons)'' to ``stationary gasoline storage containers of less than 2,085 liters (550 gallons)
capacity used exclusively in agriculture.'' Subparagraph (3)(c) was revised to change the exemption to facilities
in counties other than Davidson and Shelby Counties. Subparagraph (3)(d) was revised to change the exemption from
``gasoline dispensing facilities with an annual throughput of less than 260,000 gallons which is serviced with a
tank truck with a capacity of 4,200 gallons or less'' to ``gasoline dispensing facilities with an annual throughput
of less than 120,000 gallons.''

Conditions were added to the limitations on the transfer of gasoline described in paragraph (4). These conditions
specify that, ``[e]xcept as provided under paragraph (3) of this rule, no owner or operator may transfer or cause or
allow the transfer of gasoline from any delivery vessel into any stationary storage tank as described in subparagraphs
(a) and (b) of this paragraph, unless the tank is equipped with a submerged fill pipe and the vapors displaced from the
storage tank during filling are processed by a vapor control system in accordance with paragraph (5) of this rule.''
Subparagraph (a) specifies ``any stationary storage tank located at a gasoline dispensing facility, with a capacity
of 7,580 liters (2,000 gallons) or more, which is in place before January 1, 1979.'' Subparagraph (b) specifies ``any
stationary storage tank located at a gasoline dispensing facility, with a capacity of 948 liters (250 gallons) or
more, which is installed after December 31, 1978.'' Minor changes were made to the phrasing in paragraph (6) to clarify
the conditions on the owner or operator of a gasoline dispensing facility regarding design, maintenance, and refilling
of a vapor-laden delivery vessel.



Rule 1200-3-18-.11 Petroleum Refinery Sources 


The reference to rule 1200-3-18-.41 was deleted in paragraph (2) because this rule was changed and
is no longer applicable.



Rule 1200-3-18-.12 Can Coating 


Minor revisions were made in subparagraphs (3)(a), (b), (c), and (d) to clarify the limitations on the discharge of
VOCs into the atmosphere.



Rule 1200-3-18-.13 Coil Coating 


This rule was added to chapter 1200-3-18. Paragraph (1) contains definitions of ``Coil coating'' and
``Quench area.'' Paragraph (2) applies the rule, in accordance with 1200-3-18-.13 (3), to the coating
applicator(s), oven(s), and quench area(s) of coil coating lines involved in prime and top coat or single coat operations.

Paragraph (3) disallows the discharge of VOCs from a coil coating line into the atmosphere ``in excess of 0.31 kilograms
per liter (2.6 pounds per gallon) of prime and topcoat or single coat as applied (or as delivered to the applicator),
excluding water and exempt solvents, except as provided in 1200-3-18-.01(3).'' In the Memphis
submittal, EPA is conditionally approving paragraph (3) because to meet RACT, the emission limits must apply to any
coating, not just prime and topcoat or single coat. In a letter dated 
January 25, 1994, the State committed for Memphis to correct this deficiency by February 1, 1995. EPA is not approving
this revision for the area of Tennessee outside of the Memphis-Shelby county area because the State of Tennessee revised
this rule in a subsequent submittal on May 18, 1993, which will be acted on by EPA in a later notice.



Rule 1200-3-18-.14 Fabric and Vinyl Coating 


The definition of ``Vinyl coating'' in subparagraph (1)(b) was revised to exempt the application of plastisol coatings.
The qualification that plastisol coatings cannot be used to bubble emissions from vinyl printing and topcoating
was also added to subparagraph (1)(b).

The applicability provision in paragraph (2) was revised to include saturation operations. Minor revisions were
made to the phrasing in subparagraphs (3)(a) and (b) to clarify the VOC emission limitations.



Rule 1200-3-18-.15 Metal Furniture Coating 


Minor revisions were made to the phrasing in paragraph (3) to clarify the VOC emission limitations.



Rule 1200-3-18-.16 Surface Coating of Large Appliances 


A minor revision was made in paragraph (3) to correctly reference the VOC emissions limitations in paragraph (4).
Minor revisions were made to the phrasing in paragraph (4) to clarify the VOC emission limitations.



Rule 1200-3-18-.17 Magnet Wire Coating 


Minor revisions were made to the phrasing in paragraph (2) to clarify the VOC emission limitations.



Rule 1200-3-18-.18 Solvent Metal Cleaning 


The reference to rule 1200-3-18-.41 was deleted in paragraph (2) because this rule was changed and
is no longer applicable.



Rule 1200-3-18-.20 Flat Wood Panelling Coating 


Paragraphs (5) and (6), providing for increments of progress and proof of compliance respectively, were deleted
because the dates for demonstration of compliance had expired.



Rule 1200-3-18-.21 Surface Coating of Miscellaneous Metal Parts and Products


Definitions of ``High performance architectural coating'' and ``Refinishing'' were added to paragraph (1). The
definition of ``High performance architectural coating'' specifies that it is a coating ``[a]pplied at a facility
located in a county which is attainment for ozone and had a population of less that 15000 according to the 1980 census.''
An emission limitation of 0.75 kg/l (6.2 lb/gal) for high performance architectural coating as applied (or as delivered
to the applicator), excluding water and exempt solvents, was added as subparagraph (2)(a). The emission limitation
of 0.52 kg/l (4.3 lb/gal) for clear coating as applied was clarified and moved from subparagraph (2)(a) to (2)(b).
The emission limitation of 0.42 kg/l (3.5 lb/gal) for air dried coating as applied was clarified and moved from subparagraph
(2)(b) to (2)(c). The emission limitation of 0.42 kg/l (3.5 lb/gal)for extreme performance coating as applied was
clarified and moved from subparagraph (2)(c) to (2)(d). The emission limitation of 0.36 kg/l (3.0 lb /gal) for all
other coating as applied was clarified and moved from subparagraph (2)(d) to (2)(e).

The exemptions for the exterior of marine vessels and for bicycles in subparagraphs (5)(j) and (5)(m) were withdrawn
by the State via letter dated March 9, 1993, from
Mr. John W. Walton, Technical Secretary of the Tennessee Air Pollution Control Board. On August 30, 1993, the State
sent another letter to EPA withdrawing these exemptions from the Memphis submittal. The exemption in subparagraph
(5)(1) for prime and top coating aerospace components was deleted. Paragraphs (7) and (8), providing for increments
of progress and proof of compliance respectively, were deleted.



Rule 1200-3-18-.22 Leaks From Gasoline Tank Trucks and Vapor Collection Systems


The limitation in subparagraph (2)(a) on loading and unloading conditions for a gasoline tank truck was further specified
by the addition of the phrase ``when pressurized to gauge pressure of 4,500 pascals (18 in. of H

2

O).'' Paragraph (3) was amended by the addition of the requirement that testing of gasoline tank trucks for leak tightness
be accomplished during or before the twelfth month after the month of the last test in which compliance with the standards
of (2)(a) was demonstrated.

Paragraph (4) was revised to state that the rule is also applicable to gasoline tank trucks which load or unload at applicable
plants, terminals, or gasoline dispensing facilities in Shelby County. The requirement in paragraph (4) that gasoline
tank trucks be equipped for gasoline vapor collection for this rule to be applicable was deleted. Paragraph (4) was
also reorganized into subparagraphs for clarity.

Paragraph (5) requiring initial testing was deleted. The reference to rule 1200-3-18-.42 was deleted
in paragraph (6) because this rule was changed and is no longer applicable. 

Subparagraphs (6)(a) and (b) were revised to provide for EPA's approval of equivalent test procedures for proof of
compliance.



Rule 1200-3-18-.23 Petroleum Refinery Equipment Leaks 


Subparagraph (2)(a) was revised so that pressure relief devices which are connected to inaccessible valves are no
longer exempt from inclusion in the inspection program. Paragraph (4), providing for the institution of an approved
inspection program, was deleted.



Rule 1200-3-18-.25 Petroleum Liquid Storage in External Floating Roof Tanks


Paragraph (5), providing for increments of progress, was deleted.



Rule 1200-3-18-.26 Manufacture of Pneumatic Rubber Tires


Paragraphs (5) and (6), providing for increments of progress and proof of compliance respectively, were deleted.
 

Rule 1200-3-18-.27 Manufacture of Synthesized Pharmaceutical Products


Paragraphs (4) and (5), providing for increments of progress and proof of compliance respectively, were deleted.



Rule 1200-3-18-.28 Perchloroethylene Dry Cleaning 


Paragraph (5), providing for increments of progress, was deleted. Subparagraph (6)(d), providing for consistency
with the test methods and procedures in rule 1200-3-18-.43,
was also deleted. The test methods for proof of compliance are now provided for in paragraph 1200-3-18-.01(4).



Rule 1200-3-18-.29 Graphic Arts_Rotogravure and Flexography


Subparagraph (2)(b) was revised to add the requirement that the ink in flexographic and packaging rotogravure contain
no more than 0.5 pound VOC per pound of solids. Subparagraph (2)(b) was also reorganized into subparagraphs for clarity.
Paragraphs (5) and (6), providing for increments of progress and proof of compliance respectively, were deleted.



Rule 1200-3-18-.30 Surface Coating of Aerospace Components


This rule was deleted in its entirety because aerospace sources are subject to Rule 1200-3-18-.21
Surface Coating of Miscellaneous Metal Parts and Products.



Rule 1200-3-18-.40 Regulations Required Only in Metropolitan Davidson County


This rule was renamed ``Regulations Required in Nonattainment Areas.'' Paragraph (1) was deleted and reserved for
future use. Paragraph (2) was completely revised to state that ``[a]ny plant within a county designated in Part 1200-3-2-.01(1)(ffff)3
as nonattainment for ozone having sources with potential volatile organic compound emissions totaling more than
100 tons/year in the aggregate shall utilize reasonably available control technology (RACT) for volatile organic
compound emission from those sources.'' This changes the emission requirement for implementing RACT from 1000 tons/year
or greater only in the Metropolitan Davidson county to 100 tons/year or greater in the entire ozone nonattainment
area which makes the rule more stringent. The State has submitted further revisions to meet the non-CTG requirements
for the Nashville area and these will be addressed in a subsequent action by EPA. EPA is approving this revision for
its strengthening effect.



Rule 1200-3-18-.41 Compliance Schedules 


This rule was deleted and replaced with the requirement that the owner or operator of a source in existence or having
a State or local agency's construction permit before June 7, 1992, and subject to a standard in chapter 1200-3-18
shall satisfy the applicable increments of progress specified in subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c). This rule also
includes a certification requirement and an exemption provision.
 


Rule 1200-3-18-.42 Individual Compliance Schedules 


Paragraph (1) was revised to state that a facility with a source satisfying the applicability provisions of rule 1200-3-18-.41
may petition for a specific compliance schedule differing from the schedules contained in 1200-3-18-.41
and other rules in chapter 18 only if one or more of the conditions specified in subparagraphs (a) and (b) are satisfied.
The condition in subparagraph (1)(c) was deleted.

Paragraph (2) was revised to delete the word ``alphabetical,'' which was a typographical error, and to require final
compliance with the specified emission standard as expeditiously as possible, consistent with the limiting conditions
specified in paragraph (1) of this rule. Paragraph (3) was revised to state that individual compliance schedules
approved under this rule must be submitted to EPA for approval. Paragraph (4) was revised to delete the reference to
Hamilton County.
 

Rule 1200-3-18-.43 General Provisions for Test Methods and Procedures
Rule 1200-3-18-.44 Determination of Volatile Content of Surface Coatings
Rule 1200-3-18-.45 Test Methods for Determination of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions Control
Systems Efficiency
Rule 1200-3-18-.46 Test Method for Determination of Solvent Metal Cleaning Organic Compound Emissions
Rule 1200-3-18-.47 Test Procedure for Determination of VOC Emissions From Bulk Gasoline Terminals



The above listed rules were deleted in their entirety. The test methods and procedures for proof of compliance are
now provided for in paragraph 1200-3-18-.01(4).



Rule 1200-3-18-.48 Capture Efficiency Test Procedures 


This rule was withdrawn by the State via letter dated August 26, 1992, from Mr. John W. Walton, Technical Secretary
of the Tennessee Air Pollution Control Board. On August 30, 1993, the State sent another letter withdrawing this rule
from the Memphis submittal.

The State intends to adopt capture efficiency (CE) test procedures after EPA publishes its revised CE test procedures.
The study to evaluate the cost and technical aspects of alternative CE methods has been completed. EPA issued a draft
document on October 6, 1993. This document is currently undergoing review and comment. Where states have not yet adopted
CE regulations, EPA is allowing them to defer adoption of CE test requirements while the study is underway. 



Chapter 1200-3-21 General Alternate Emission Standards



Rule 1200-3-21-.01 General Alternate Emission Standard 


The following changes were made to both the Tennessee and Memphis portions of the SIP.
 
Paragraph (1) was revised to state that in lieu of satisfying the standards and requirements of other chapters of division
1200-3, air contaminant sources with a certificate of alternate control shall not emit particulate matter,
sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, or volatile organic compounds in excess of the respective limits
of said certificate.

Paragraph (2) was revised to allow sources of VOCs regulated by other rules in the State's regulations to apply for
a Certificate of Alternate Control. Paragraph (2) was also revised to change the word ``source'' to ``source(s),''
and to change the word ``must'' to ``may'' with regard to the Technical Secretary granting a request for a Certificate
of Alternate Control. In addition, the requirement that these standards and conditions be submitted to EPA for approval
was included in paragraph (3). 

The condition in subparagraph (2)(a) was revised to include VOCs and to replace the language regarding determination
of equivalent emissions. Subparagraph (2)(b) was revised to state that if a schedule of compliance is required, it
must be included as a condition on the certificate. The phrase ``this date'' was changed to ``the final compliance
date.''

Subparagraph (2)(c) was revised to require the air contaminant source to use modeling consistent with 

Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised)

, EPA-450/2-78-027R, with the 1988 revisions, to verify that the alternate emission standard will
yield equivalent or improved air quality for the pollutant involved. Minor revisions were also made in subparagraph
(2)(c) to correct typographical errors.

Subparagraph (2)(d) was revised to correct the reference to another rule and to replace the word ``old'' with ``existing''
in reference to sources. Subparagraph (2)(d) was also revised to require compliance with all applicable standards
and requirements established under paragraph 1200-3-9-.01(4), under chapters 1200-3-11
and 16, and according to a lowest achievable emission rate (LAER) determination under paragraph 1200-3-9-.01(5).
These standards and requirements will not be superseded or replaced by the alternate emission standard.

Subparagraph (2)(e), providing that sources must establish a specific emission limit for each emission point, was
deleted. Subparagraph (2)(f) was renamed (2)(e) and revised to increase the certificate fee for each source. 

Subparagraph (2)(g) was renamed (2)(f) and a phrase was deleted for clarification. A new subparagraph, (2)(g) was
added to state that the provisions of the Emissions Trading Policy Statement, 51 FR 43850, dated December 4, 1986,
are being satisfied. This policy statement is more stringent than subparagraph (2)(e) which was deleted.

Paragraph (3) was revised so that alternate emission standards and certificate conditions are no longer considered
to be an addition to the existing standards. In addition, the requirement that these standards and conditions be submitted
to EPA for approval was included in paragraph (3). 
Paragraph (4) was revised to state that ``[g]ood engineering practice stack heights shall be utilized on all stack
changes associated with the alternate control standards for particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide,
and nitrogen dioxide.'' Paragraph (9) was revised to delete the reference to each emission point.



Rule 1200-3-21-.02 Applicability 


This rule was added to make chapter 1200-3-21 applicable ``only to those air contaminant sources which
apply for a certificate of alternate control or a revision to a certificate of alternate control after March 18, 1993.''



Final Action 


EPA is fully approving the submitted revisions to the Tennessee State Implementation Plan (SIP) and the Memphis portion
of the Tennessee SIP with the exception of the proposed revisions to Rules 1200-3-18-.01 (subparagraph
(4)(b)), 1200-3-18-.10 (subparagraph (3)(a), and 1200-3-18-13 (paragraph
(3)) of the Memphis portion of the Tennessee SIP for which we are issuing a conditional approval and Rule 1200-3-18-.03
Standard for New Sources of the Tennessee SIP for which we are disapproving the proposed deletion.


 
In addition, EPA is not approving the proposed revisions to rules 1200-3-18-.01 (subparagraph
(4)(b)), 1200-3-18-.10 (subparagraph (3)(a)), and 1200-3-18-13 (paragraph
(3)) of the Tennessee SIP. These rules were revised in a subsequent submittal by Tennessee on May 18, 1993. Therefore,
since these revisions are not approvable as submitted in this action, EPA will act on these rules in the action on the
May 18, 1993, submittal. 

Because Tennessee has made a commitment for the Memphis nonattainment area that EPA believes meets the requirements
necessary for EPA to grant conditional approval, EPA is conditionally approving under section 110(k)(4) of the CAA.
In order for EPA to take final action on the commitment, the State must meet their commitment for the Memphis nonattainment
area to adopt the identified provisions by February 1, 1995, and submit them to EPA within the time specified in this
schedule. If the State fails to adopt or submit these rules for Memphis-Shelby County to EPA within this time frame,
this approval will become a disapproval on that date. EPA will notify the area by letter that this action has occurred.
At that time, this commitment will no longer be a part of the approved Memphis-Shelby County portion of the Tennessee
SIP. EPA subsequently will publish a notice in the notice section of the 

Federal Register

. If Tennessee adopts and submits these rules for Memphis-Shelby County to EPA within the applicable time frame, the
conditionally approved submission will remain a part of the SIP until EPA takes final action approving or disapproving
the new submittal. If EPA disapproves the new submittal, the conditionally approved submittal will also be removed
from the SIP. Moreover, the rules on which the conditional approval was based will also be disapproved at that time.
If EPA approves the submittal, those newly approved rules will become a part of the SIP and will modify or replace the
commitment and the rules on which the conditional approval is based.

If EPA determines that it cannot issue a final, conditional approval or if the conditional approval is converted to
a disapproval, the sanctions clock under section 179(a) will begin. This clock will begin at the time EPA issues the
final disapproval or on the date Tennessee fails to meet its commitment. In the latter case, EPA will notify the area
by letter that the conditional approval has been converted to a disapproval and that the sanctions clock has begun.
If the State does not submit and EPA does not approve the rule on which the disapproval was based within 18 months of the
disapproval, EPA must impose one of the sanctions under section 179(b)_highway funding restrictions or the offset
sanction. In addition, the final disapproval triggers the Federal implementation plan (FIP) requirement under
section 110(c).

This action is being taken without prior proposal because the changes are noncontroversial and EPA anticipates no
significant comments on them. The public should be advised that this action will be effective June 17, 1994. However,
if notice is received by May 18, 1994 that someone wished to submit adverse or critical comments, this action will be
withdrawn and two subsequent documents will be published before the effective date. One document will withdraw the
final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment
period.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed
in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by June 17, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration
by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (see section
307(b)(2) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2)).

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 26, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro,
Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the
requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver
for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request.
This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September
30, 1993.

Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for a revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.

SIP approvals and conditional approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements,
but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval
does not impose any new requirements, EPA certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities
affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory
flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA
forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On March 8, 1994, the Commission adopted a Report and Order (R&O) and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (FNPM)
in CC Docket 91-281. The R&O amends the rules regarding common carriers to establish federal policies and
rules concerning interstate calling number identification service (caller ID). The R&O finds that a federal
model for interstate delivery of calling party numbers is in the public interest, that calling party privacy must
be protected, and that certain state regulation of interstate calling party number (CPN) based services, including
interstate caller ID, must be preempted.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This summarizes the Commission's R&O in the matter of Policies and Rules Concerning Calling Number Identification
Service_Caller ID (CC Docket 91-281, FCC 94-59, adopted March 8, 1994 and released March 29, 1994). The
R&O and supporting file may be examined in the Commission's Public Reference Room, room 239, 1919 M Street, NW.,
Washington, DC, during business hours or purchased from the duplicating contractor, International Transcription
Service, 2100 M Street, NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857-3800. The R&O also will be published
in the FCC Record.



Analysis of Proceeding



This proceeding was initiated by the Commission's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in CC Docket 91-281,
FCC 91-300, 6 FCC Rcd 6752 (1991), (56 FR 57300, November 8, 1991), to establish federal policies and rules governing
calling number identification service on an interstate basis.

In its NPRM, the Commission tentatively concluded that a federal model for interstate caller ID should be established;
that the federal model should recognize privacy interests of both the called and the calling party; that it should
do so efficiently and without interfering with other services (such as 911); that the costs of the service should be
recovered from the beneficiaries, the users of the service; and that carriers should pass on the calling party number
from the originating carrier to the terminating carriers. The Commission tentatively concluded that it was not necessary
to propose to preempt any intrastate caller ID offerings. After reviewing the comments and/or reply comments submitted
by interested parties, the Commission has adopted rules which require common carriers using Common Channel Signalling
System 7 (SS7) and subscribing to or offering any service based on SS7 functionality must transmit calling party number
and its associated privacy indicator on interstate calls. The rules require that carriers offering CPN based service
provided automatic per call blocking at no charge to interstate callers, and that the privacy indicator be honored
by terminating carriers. The Report and Order finds that the costs of interstate transmission of CPN are 

de minimis, 

and that the CPN should be transmitted among carriers without additional charge. The rules require that carriers
participating in the offering of any service that delivers CPN on interstate calls must inform telephone subscribers
regarding the availability of identification services and how to invoke the privacy protection mechanism. The rules
restrict the reuse or sale of telephone numbers by subscribers to automatic number identification (ANI) or charge
number services, absent affirmative subscriber consent. The rules are made a part of this publication.



Request for Comments



The Commission affirmed the tentative conclusion reached in the NPRM that deployment of interstate calling party
number services should be accompanied by consumer education regarding the availability of identification services
and how to invoke the privacy protection mechanism. For ANI or charge number services for which such privacy is not
provided, the rules require that the notification inform telephone customers of the restrictions on the reuse or
sale of subscriber information. The Commission seeks further comment on whether it should prescribe detailed instructions
regarding what form education should take or prescribe more precisely responsibilities of various carriers. The
Commission is also particularly interested in specific joint industry education proposals. The Commission tentatively
concludes that its policies for calling party number delivery should apply equally to services delivering calling
party name, and seeks comment on its tentative conclusion. The Commission also seeks comment on whether the policies
for subscriber privacy should extend to other services. All proposals and other comments must reference CC Docket
No. 91-281. In particular, parties should address any differences in privacy considerations that apply to
calling party name delivery as opposed to calling party number delivery.



Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis

Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. section 601, 

et seq., 

the Commission's final analysis in this Report and Order is as follows:



I. Need and Purpose of This Action



This Report and Order adopts policies governing the transmission of the calling party number parameter and its associated
privacy indicator on interstate calls. Several commenters to the NPRM in this proceeding have identified a number
of potential uses for interstate calling party number based services, including caller ID, and have indicated that
it also will improve certain existing communication service offerings. We find that the potential benefits of interstate
passage of calling party number far exceed any negative effects. We thus adopt the conclusion reached in the NPRM that
interstate caller ID and other calling party number based services are in the public interest and should be available
to interstate subscribers nationwide pursuant to the policies and rules set forth in this order.



II. Summary of Issues Raised by the Public Comments in Response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis



No comments were submitted in direct response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.



III. Significant Alternatives Considered



The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this proceeding requested comments on several proposals as well as the views
of commenters on other possibilities. The Commission has considered all comments and has proposed regulations which
require the passage of calling party number where SS7 is deployed, facilitate interstate calling party number based
services, including caller ID, and implement federal policy on privacy.



Ordering Clauses



Accordingly, It is Ordered, That, pursuant to sections 1, 4(i), 4(j), 201-205, 218 of the Communications Act
of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. Sections 151, 154(i), 154(j), 201-205, and 218, Part 64 of the Commission's Rules
and Regulations are amended as set forth below, effective April 12, 1995.

It Is Further Ordered, that pursuant to authority contained in sections 1, 4(i), 4(j), 201-205, and 218 of the

of Proposed Rulemaking
 is hereby provided as indicated above.





It is Further Ordered, that, the Secretary shall cause a summary of this Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking to be published in the Federal Register

 which shall include a statement describing how members of the public may obtain the complete text of this Commission
decision. The Secretary shall also provide a copy of this Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking

 64.1600


Definitions.



(a) 

Aggregate Information. 

The term `aggregate information' means collective data that relate to a group or category of services or customers,
from which individual customer identities or characteristics have been removed.


(b) 

ANI. 

The term `ANI' (automatic number identification) refers to the delivery of the calling party's billing number by
a local exchange carrier to any interconnecting carrier for billing or routing purposes, and to the subsequent delivery
of such number to end users.

(c) 

Calling Party Number. 

The term Calling Party Number refers to the subscriber line number or the directory number contained in the calling
party number parameter of the call set-up message associated with an interstate call on a Signalling System 7 network.


(d) 

Charge Number. 

The term ``charge number'' refers to the delivery of the calling party's billing number in a Signalling System 7 environment
by a local exchange carrier to any interconnecting carrier for billing or routing purposes, and to the subsequent
delivery of such number to end users.

(e) 

Privacy Indicator. 

The term Privacy Indicator refers to information, contained in the calling party number parameter of the call set-up
message associated with an interstate call on an Signalling System 7 network, that indicates whether the calling
party authorizes presentation of the calling party number to the called party.


(f) 

Signalling System 7. 

The term Signalling System 7 (SS7) refers to a carrier to carrier out-of-band signalling network used for call routing,
billing and management.



 64.1601


Delivery requirements and privacy restrictions.



(a) Delivery. Common carriers using Signalling System 7 and offering or subscribing to any service based on Signalling
System 7 functionality are required to transmit the calling party number associated with an interstate call to interconnecting
carriers.

(b) Privacy. Originating carriers using Signalling System 7 and offering or subscribing to any service based on Signalling
System 7 functionality will only recognize *67 dialed as the first three digits of a call (or 1167 for rotary or pulse-dialing
phones) as a caller's request for privacy on an interstate call. No common carrier subscribing to or offering any service
that delivers calling party number may override the privacy indicator associated with an interstate call. The terminating
carrier must act in accordance with the privacy indicator unless the call is made to a called party that subscribes
to an ANI or charge number based service and the call is paid for by the called party.

(c) Charges. No common carrier subscribing to or offering any service that delivers calling party number may:

(1) Impose on the calling party charges associated with per call blocking of the calling party's telephone number,
or

(2) Impose charges upon connecting carriers for the delivery of the calling party number parameter or its associated
privacy indicator.

(d) Exemptions. Section 64.1601 shall not apply to calling party number delivery services:

(1) Used solely in connection with calls within the same limited system, including (but not limited to) a Centrex,
virtual private network, or private branch exchange system;

Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Air Brake Systems; Automatic Brake Adjusters 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
(NHTSA), Department of Transportation (DOT).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule, response to petitions for reconsideration.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice responds to petitions for reconsideration of a final rule amending Standard No. 121, 

Air Brake Systems,

 (49 CFR 571.121). The rule amended the standard by requiring, 

inter alia,

 automatic brake adjusters on all medium and heavy vehicles and establishing readjustment limits for the performance
of the adjusters. NHTSA received several petitions requesting the agency to reconsider the limits on the adjusters.
This document grants those petitions.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
On October 20, 1992, NHTSA published a final rule that amended Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 121, 

Air Brake Systems,

 to require, 

inter alia,

 automatic brake adjusters on all air-braked vehicles. (57 FR 47793.) That amendment improves the braking performance
of vehicles by ensuring that each vehicle has a device that automatically maintains proper brake adjustment, thus
eliminating the need for frequent inspection and manual adjustment of the brakes. To provide for a specific performance
requirement for the adjusters, the rule also specified that the adjuster would have to perform such that ``the readjustment
limits shall be in accordance with those specified in'' a regulation of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).
 (

See

, S5.1.8(a) of Standard No. 121.) The readjustment limits relate to the distance that a part of the brake (the pushrod)
must travel, or stroke, before engaging the brake. The readjustment limits specify maximum distances for pushrod
stroke. 





NHTSA received timely petitions for reconsideration of the rule from Rockwell International (Rockwell) and White
GM/Volvo. Petitioners asked for reconsideration of the requirements for the readjustment limits for the adjuster.
Mr. John Kourik submitted a late petition to reconsider various aspects of the rule, including the readjustment limits.
NHTSA is treating Mr. Kourik's petition as a petition for rulemaking, pursuant to the agency's regulations (see 49
CFR 553.35). However, NHTSA is responding in today's document to the issues raised by Mr. Kourik about the readjustment
limits, since they are almost identical to those of Rockwell and White GM/Volvo. 

Each petitioner was concerned about the readjustment limit. Among the petitioners' criticisms were that the requirement
is not objective, is inappropriate for certain air brake systems, and is likely to restrict new brake designs. Petitioners
also believed that NHTSA did not provide adequate notice about the specification in the final rule for the FHWA readjustment
limits. 

The concern about the adequacy of notice resulted from the development of the requirement from the original proposal
in the NPRM. In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that a brake adjuster perform so that it ``maintains brake adjustment within
the manufacturer's recommended adjustment limits.'' 56 FR 20396, 20401, May 3, 1991. Several commenters, including
White GM/Volvo, GM, Ford, and Midland-Grau, believed that the proposal would not provide any significant safety
benefits and might cause unnecessary complications and confusion. For example, some commenters argued that, since
there is no objective criteria as to what constitutes ``maintains brake adjustment,'' the requirement would be vague.
Also, White GM/Volvo, GM and Ford believed that the proposal might be misinterpreted as requiring the manufacturer
to be responsible for brake adjustment throughout the vehicle's life, even though under the National Traffic and
Motor Vehicle Safety Act the manufacturer is responsible for the compliance of the new vehicle only until the first
consumer purchase. One commenter, Midland-Grau, recommended that NHTSA incorporate the FHWA's requirements for
brake adjustment, set forth in the Minimum Periodic Inspection Standards.

After reviewing the comments, NHTSA agreed that the proposed requirement for readjustment limits was potentially
vague and misleading. However, NHTSA believed Midland-Grau's recommendation about the FHWA alternative had merit.
NHTSA stated: 





As for Midland-Grau's recommendation to use FHWA's regulations for ``Driver Out-of-Service Criteria'' for brake
adjustment, NHTSA has decided to reference these provisions in Standard No. 121 because they are relevant to in-use
heavy truck operation regulated by FHWA. Because amendments to Standard No. 121 require the use of brake adjustment
indicators which require the display of underadjustment, a reference to adjustment limits is necessary. 





57 FR at 47796. 


Petitions for Reconsideration 


All the petitioners raised identical concerns about the incorporation of the FHWA requirements. 


1. Design Specific Requirements 


Rockwell stated that the FHWA adjustment criteria that NHTSA incorporated would eliminate most air disc brakes from
the market. The petitioner said that until 1988, FHWA's readjustment limits for the brake adjuster were in the form
of guidelines. These guidelines provided separate requirements for air disc brakes, recognizing that air disc brakes
need a slightly longer maximum stroke limit for each chamber size than that specified for drum brakes. For example,
Rockwell said, for a type 30 chamber, the old FHWA ``minimum criteria'' provided for a maximum stroke of 2 inches for
drum brakes and 21/4 inches for air disc brakes. 
Rockwell stated there are fundamental differences between air disc brakes and drum brakes that account for why the
FHWA guidelines permitted air disc brakes to have a slightly longer pushrod stroke limit than drum brakes. The petitioner
explained: 





In both types of systems, the pushrod stroke length is proportionate to the clearance between the brake lining and
the rubbing surface (the drum or the disc). On drum brakes, the clearance and therefore the pushrod stroke gets longer
as the brakes become hot and the circular drum wall expands in diameter by as much as one-eighth inch at 800 degrees F.
By contrast, a disc brake pushrod stroke gets shorter as the brake gets hotter, because the expansion of the hot rotor
brings it closer to the pads which are also expanding in the direction of the rotors. 





Rockwell said that when FHWA adopted its rule for readjustment limits (53 FR 49402, December 7, 1988), the rule did
not continue to provide separate specifications for air disc brakes, as it had previously done in its guidelines.
Rockwell argued that ``by omitting the separate table for disc brakes, and requiring drum brakes and air disc brakes
to meet the same adjustment criteria, the FHWA Final Rule had the effect of imposing a more stringent requirement on
the air disc brakes than it imposed on drum brakes.'' 
Rockwell said that it has asked FHWA to reconsider the agency's 1988 rule and that FHWA has agreed to reopen Docket MC-90-7
for additional comment on the issue of the appropriate requirements for air disc brakes. FHWA anticipates that a notice
will be issued in the near future. 
Rockwell stated that the effect of incorporating the FHWA readjustment limits would be to prohibit future sales of
the air disc brake in certain applications. The petitioner argued that this would be anomalous in view of what Rockwell
believes is an excellent safety record for the air disc brake system. Rockwell said that the system has been in use on
the road for over 10 years, and, 





[S]ince 1985, Rockwell has been the sole North American manufacturer of air disc brakes. Many using customers have
purposefully selected the air disc brake because of its unique performance features. High performance requirements
of fire service vehicles, frequent braking requirements of refuse vehicles and minimal brake fade requirements
desired by tractor/trailer operators hauling hazardous and flammable cargos are typical air disc brake applications.






The National Transportation Safety Board in their April 1992 Heavy Vehicle Airbrake Performance Safety Study noted:


 

Air disc brakes have several advantages over drum brakes. When subjected to intense braking demands, disc brakes
do not suffer the same performance degradations as do drum brakes. Disc brakes also reduce down hill runaways as well
as brake imbalances caused by varied brake adjustments on the same vehicle. 


2. Design Restrictions 


The petitioners raised concerns that the incorporation of the FHWA requirements could hinder technological development,
such as that of long stroke brake chambers. (On August 2, 1993, NHTSA published an NPRM to facilitate the use of long
stroke brake chambers. 58 FR 41078). Rockwell stated:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940418-0-00033 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940418-0-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

By referencing the FHWA readjustment criteria in FMVSS 121, NHTSA has ``frozen'' the FHWA criteria in their current
form as of October 20, 1992, for purposes of FMVSS 121. Even if FHWA later amends its criteria in response to Rockwell's
petition or to accommodate new technology, NHTSA will have to take affirmative action to update its cross-reference.
* * * The time consuming process of adopting future changes to FMVSS 121 will deter air brake technology
or, at least, prevent its rapid introduction into the marketplace. Rockwell believes that NHTSA did not intend this
result. 


Agency's Decision 


After reviewing the petitions, NHTSA has decided to delete reference to the FHWA's regulations at issue. It appears
that the FHWA readjustment limits are suitable for conventional drum brakes, but do not account for differences between
conventional drum brakes and new types of air brake systems. When the agency adopted the readjustment limits, NHTSA
did not intend to impede the development of brake systems that could provide comparable performance to conventional
drum brakes, such as piston-type brakes. The FHWA requirements appear to be not fully appropriate for piston-type
brakes because of substantially longer stroke length air brake chambers, which are fully developed and are undergoing
fleet testing. Additional air brake chamber categories will have to be added to the FHWA Schedule A inspection tables
as technology moves forward. Moreover, when NHTSA adopted the readjustment limits, the agency did not intend to prevent
or hinder the development of brake designs that may offer 

potentially 

superior performance over drum brakes in specific applications, such as the air disc brake system. 
The air disc brake system is subject to the same readjustment limits in the FHWA requirements as conventional drum
brakes, which does not seem appropriate, given differences between the two types of air brake systems. Rockwell's
air disc brake system has a stroking distance that is about 1/4 inch longer than that permitted by the current FHWA requirement.
However, Rockwell submitted test data to NHTSA that show that, with this stroking distance, the air disc brake system
performs well when tested to the specifications and requirements of Standard No. 121. (These data have been placed
in docket 91-21, Notice 3.) 
Available information indicates that the air disc brake system appears to perform to Standard 121 specifications
and may perform better than conventional drum brakes in some situations. There does not appear to be any data to support
the need to impose a shorter stroke limit on air disc brake systems such as Rockwell's, that would impede the development
of those systems. NHTSA believes the development of alternative, potentially superior brake systems, such as the
air disc brake systems, should be facilitated to the extent possible. NHTSA believes there is an alternative requirement
that would address the need for readjustment limits, yet avoid the problems the petitioners addressed. 


Alternative Approach

Rockwell recommended that NHTSA require that the automatic adjuster's readjustment limits ``be in accordance with
the manufacturer's recommended limits.'' It commented that this language would be sufficiently objective because
NHTSA could confirm the compliance of a brake system by comparing the actual readjustment limits of a brake system
with those recommended by the manufacturer. These manufacturer recommendations are routinely provided by the manufacturer
with each vehicle. The petitioner stated that NHTSA has taken this approach in other circumstances, such as with respect
to testing safety belts for permissible levels of slack. (See, Standard No. 208, section S7.4.2.) 

The agency adopted the FHWA readjustment limits to provide a clear means of determining whether a brake adjuster was
performing properly. However, as explained above, the agency now believes that the FHWA requirement is inappropriate
for use by NHTSA given the differences among air brake systems. As mentioned above, FHWA's in-use inspection requirements
were developed primarily with drum brake systems in mind, and thus place disc brake systems, long stroke brake chambers
and piston-type systems at a competitive disadvantage. 

After reviewing the petitions, NHTSA has decided to delete reference to the FHWA requirements and to adopt a requirement
that ``the adjustment of the service brakes shall be within the limits recommended by the vehicle manufacturer.''
This language is similar to that of the NPRM (which would have required air brake adjusters to ``maintain brake adjustment
within the manufacturer's recommended adjustment limits''), in that the adjuster would be required to perform as
intended by the vehicle manufacturer. However, NHTSA believes that the language adopted in this document avoids
the concerns about objectivity and vagueness engendered by the NPRM. 

Those concerns about the NPRM stemmed from the word ``maintain'' in the language quoted above. Since there was no objective
criteria specified for determining whether a particular brake adjuster would ``maintain adjustment'' of the brakes,
manufacturers were concerned that questions could arise between a manufacturer and NHTSA as to whether a particular
system complied with the standard, particularly when it was unclear when exactly the determination of compliance
would be made. Manufacturers were concerned that the proposed language implied that Standard 121 requires a vehicle
to ``maintain'' conformance to the FMVSS's throughout the life of the vehicle, which is incorrect and confusing.


NHTSA concurred with the commenters that the proposed language was inappropriate (57 FR at 47796):

 

</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940418-0-00035 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940418-0-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The agency notes that there is no objective criteria as to what constitutes ``maintains adjustment.'' In addition,
as a general rule, the agency does not establish extended durability testing. The agency believes that to require
that the adjustment be maintained throughout the lifetime of the vehicle is unrealistic, dependent upon the vehicle's
exposure, and beyond the scope of NHTSA's authority.

 


The requirement adopted today provides an objective requirement that allows the vehicle manufacturer to evaluate
conformance to the standard. As Rockwell stated, NHTSA can readily confirm the compliance of a brake system by comparing
the actual readjustment limits of the system with those recommended by the manufacturer. Further, the requirement
does not use ``maintain'' and therefore avoids the implication that compliance with Standard 121 must be maintained
through a vehicle's lifetime. However, as explained below, since NHTSA is specifying a requisite level of performance
for the brake adjusters, the agency must also specify when, during compliance testing, NHTSA will evaluate the brake
adjusters to determine if they are performing according to the recommendations of the vehicle manufacturer. 



Inspection 



During NHTSA's review of the petitions for reconsideration, the agency realized that the standard had no express
requirement for when the adjustment indicators are to be inspected. However, the brake adjuster amendment implicitly
required that the brakes be inspected, because the amendment states that the readjustment limits must be in accordance
with the FHWA inspection standards. Also implicit in this amendment is that inspection will occur at the end of the
Standard No. 121 test procedures, since the need for readjustment will only occur after the vehicle has been driven.
In addition, inspection of the vehicle at the end of testing for conformance with the braking standard is consistent
with the specifications for hydraulic brake systems (Standard No. 105). Accordingly, in this document, NHTSA is
including a ``final inspection provision'' at the end of the test procedures to require that the service brake system
be inspected at the end of the test sequence. 



Procedural Concerns 



NHTSA notes that the petitioners' concerns about the adequacy of notice for the FHWA provisions are now moot. Therefore,
these concerns are not further addressed. 

The amendment to  571.121 becomes effective October 20, 1994, the effective date for the automatic brake adjusters.




Regulatory Impacts 



A. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory 
Policies and Procedures 



This notice has not been reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' This rulemaking has been
determined to be not ``significant'' under the Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures.
The amendment will not result in any additional cost impacts beyond those resulting from the initial final rule. The
agency further concludes that, because the cost impacts are minimal, a full regulatory evaluation is not required.




B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



NHTSA has also considered the impacts of this rulemaking under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify that
it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Any impact on small entities
from this action will be minimal since the amendments make minimal changes to the Standard that will not impose additional
costs or result in any savings. Accordingly, the agency has determined that preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis is unnecessary. 



C. Environmental Impacts 



In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, NHTSA has considered the environmental impacts
of this rule. The agency has determined that this rule will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human
environment. 



D. Federalism Assessment 



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612.
NHTSA has determined that the rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment. No state laws will be affected. 



E. Civil Justice Reform 



This final rule does not have any retroactive effect. Under section 103(d) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1392(d)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a state may not adopt
or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the Federal standard.
Section 105 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1394) sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending
or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration
or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Emergency Rule To List the Saint Francis' Satyr as Endangered


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Emergency rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Service exercises its emergency authority to determine the Saint Francis' satyr (

Neonympha mitchellii francisci

) to be an endangered species pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. This butterfly is known
from a single locality in North Carolina. Recent heavy collecting pressure has resulted in a reduction of the only
known population and is believed to pose an imminent threat to the butterfly's existence. Protection from collecting
is needed during the species' 1994 flight season while the Service proceeds with adopting permanent protection in
accordance with the Act's requirements. This emergency rule will implement Federal protection for 240 days. A proposed
rule to list the Saint Francis' satyr as endangered is published elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register.

 The proposed rule provides for public comment and a hearing (if requested).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background




Neonympha mitchellii francisci 

is a subspecies of one of two North American species of 

Neonympha. 

One of the rarest butterflies in eastern North America, it was described by Parshall and Kral in 1989 from material
collected in North Carolina. These authors estimated that the single known population probably produced less than
100 adults per year. Shortly thereafter, Saint Francis' satyr was reported to have been collected to extinction (Refsnider
1991, Schweitzer 1989). The subspecies was rediscovered at the type locality in 1992 during the course of a Service-funded
status survey. The Act defines ``species'' to include ``any subspecies of fish or wildlife or plants, and any distinct
population segment of any species of vertebrate fish or wildlife * * *.'' Therefore, although


N. m. francisci

 is recognized taxonomically as a subspecies, it will be referred to as a ``species'' throughout the remainder of this
emergency rule.
Saint Francis' satyr is a fairly small, dark brown butterfly and is a typical member of the 

Satyrinae, 

a subfamily of the 

Nymphalidae 

family, which includes many species commonly called satyrs and wood nymphs. The wingspan for the species ranges from
34 to 44 mm (Opler and Malikul 1992). Saint Francis' satyr and Mitchell's satyr, the northern subspecies (

N. m. mitchellii

), which was classified as endangered on May 20, 1992 (57 FR 21569), are nearly identical in size and show only a slight
degree of sexual size dimorphism (Hall 1993, Parshall and Kral 1989). Like most species in the wood nymph group, Saint
Francis' satyr has conspicuous ``eyespots'' on the lower surfaces of the wings. These eyespots are dark maroon brown
in the center, reflecting a silver cast in certain lights. The border of these dark eyespots is straw yellow in color,
with an outermost border of dark brown. The eyespots are usually round to slightly oval and are well-developed on the
fore wing as well as on the hind wing. The spots are accented by two bright orange bands along the posterior wing edges
and two darker brown bands across the central portion of each wing. Saint Francis' satyr, like the nominate subspecies,
can be distinguished from its North American congener, 

N. areolata, 

by the latter's well-marked eyespots on the upper wing surfaces and brighter orange bands on the hind wing, as well
by its lighter coloration and stronger flight (Refsnider 1991, McAlpine 

et al. 

1960, Wilsman and Schweitzer 1991, Hall 1993).

Saint Francis' satyr is extremely restricted geographically. Mitchell's satyr, the nominate subspecies, has been
eliminated from approximately half its known range, primarily due to collecting (Refsnider 1991). Saint Francis'
satyr is now known to exist as only a single population in North Carolina.
The annual life cycle of 

N. m. francisci,

 unlike that of its northern relative, is bivoltine. That is, it has two adult flights or generations per year. Larval
host plants are believed to be graminoids such as grasses, sedges, and rushes. Little else is known about the life history
of this butterfly. The habitat occupied by this satyr consists primarily of wide, wet meadows dominated by sedges
and other wetland graminoids. In the North Carolina sandhills, such meadows are often relicts of beaver activity.
Unlike the habitat of Mitchell's satyr, the North Carolina species' habitat cannot be properly called a fen because
the waters of this sandhills region are extremely poor in inorganic nutrients. Hall (1993) states:



Whereas true fens_apparently the habitat of the northern form of 

N. mitchellii

 (Wilsman and Schweitzer 1991)_are circumneutral to basic in pH and are long-lasting features of the landscape, the
boggy areas of the sandhills are quite acidic as well as ephemeral, succeeding either to pocosin or swamp forest if
not kept open by frequent fire or beaver activity.



Hall (1993) further states:



Under the natural regime of frequent fires ignited by summer thunderstorms, the sandhills were once covered with
a much more open type of woodland, dominated by longleaf pine, wiregrass, and other fire-tolerant species. The type
of forest that currently exists along [the creek inhabited by Saint Francis' satyr] can only grow up under a long period
of fire suppression. The dominance on this site of loblolly pine, moreover, is due primarily to past forestry management
practices, not any form of natural succession.



Parshall and Kral speculated that 

N. m. francisci

 is a relict from a more widespread southern distribution during the Pleistocene period. Hall (1993) presents the
following alternative hypothesis:



The current narrow distribution of 

francisci

 could also be a result of the enormous environmental changes that have occurred in the southern coastal plain just
within the past 100 years. Only the discovery of additional populations or fossil remains can clarify this situation.



Extensive searches have been made of suitable habitat in North Carolina and South Carolina, but no other populations
of this butterfly have been found (Hall 1993, Schweitzer 1989).
Federal government actions on this species began when it was included as a category 2 species in the November 21, 1991,
animal notice of review (56 FR 58804). Category 2 species are those for which the Service believes that Federal listing
as endangered or threatened is possibly appropriate but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and
threat are not currently available to support proposed rules. Recent surveys have been conducted by Service and State
personnel, and the Service now believes sufficient information exists to proceed with an emergency rule to list 

Neonympha mitchellii francisci

 as endangered.

Summary of Factors Affecting the Species



Section 4(a)(1) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures
for adding species to the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to
one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to Saint Francis'
satyr (

Neonympha mitchellii francisci

) are as follows:

A. 

The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range.

 Because of its relatively recent discovery, it is impossible to determine what the original range of Saint Francis'
satyr might have been. However, based upon its demonstrated dependency on periodic fires and the general trend of
fire suppression on private lands, it seems reasonable to assume that it once occupied a more extensive area. As stated
by Hall (1993):




In order for 

francisci

 to have survived over the past 10,000 years, there must surely have been more populations and greater numbers of individuals
than apparently now exist * * * As is true for many species that were once widespread in the sandhills,
massive habitat alteration must also be a major factor in the diminution of the range of 

francisci

 * * * reductions in 

francisci

's range would have accompanied the extensive loss of wetland habitats in the coastal plain. Again, the draining of
swamps, pocosins, Carolina bays, savannas, flatwoods, and bogs for conversion to agriculture and silviculture
is well known. In the case of 

francisci

, however, the extirpation of beavers from the Carolinas may have been the greatest factor.




Beavers had been virtually eliminated from North Carolina by the turn of the century. Reintroductions began in 1939,
but it was several decades before they again became an agent for creation of the sedge meadow habitats favored by Saint
Francis' satyr (Hall 1993, Woodward and Hazel 1991). Hall further states:




As the landscape mosaic of open woodlands and wetlands of the coastal plain declined throughout the past two centuries,
the range of 

francisci

 must have become increasingly fragmented. Although isolated populations may have persisted as long as suitable
habitat remained, the structure of their meta-populations would have been destroyed. Opportunistic colonization
of newly available habitats as well as the repopulation of sites wiped clean by fire or other catastrophe would have
become eventually impossible; one by one, the isolated remnants would have blinked out of existence. Although again
speculative, the fracturing of meta-populations has been used to explain the decline of the arogos skipper and a number
of butterflies associated with the tall-grass prairies (Panzer, 1988, D. Schweitzer, pers. comm.). That 

francisci

 was a relict to begin with only exacerbated this problem; the overall effect was to bring it as close to extinction as
any butterfly in the country.




The sole surviving population of this species is now fragmented into less than half a dozen small colonies that occupy
a total area no larger than a few square miles.

B. 

Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes.

 Both subspecies of the Saint Francis' satyr are highly prized by collectors, including commercial collectors who
often systematically collect every individual available. Several populations of the nominate subspecies are known
to have been obliterated by collectors, and others are believed extremely vulnerable to this threat (Refsnider 1991).
As mentioned in the ``Background'' section, the single known population of Saint Francis' satyr was so hard-hit by
collectors in the 3 years following its initial discovery that it was believed to have been collected to extinction.
Subsequent to the emergency listing of the nominate subspecies and prior to the publication of this rule, the North
Carolina population was the last where 

Neonympha mitchellii

 could legally be collected. Following the emergency listing of Mitchell's satyr, the North Carolina Heritage Program
received several inquiries from collectors about access to the last available population. Several expressed apprehension
about any restriction on collecting of this rare and much-sought-after satyr. Collectors reportedly visited the
known site every day throughout the flight periods, taking every adult they saw (Hall 1993). After this first wave
of over-collection, many unsuccessful searches for the butterfly were made before it was eventually rediscovered.
Numbers of individuals then seen were much lower than those reported by Parshall and Kral (1989), with the highest
single count consisting of only 11 butterflies (Hall 1993). Even though part of this population is protected from
collectors by virtue of being within dangerous artillery impact areas, intensive collecting from the periphery
of these areas could reduce total population numbers below levels needed for long-term survival. Very little is known
about this species' life history and ecological requirements, but it appears to be a more vagile species than its northern
relative. It may well be dependent upon a large meta-population structure in order to colonize new sites or recolonize
those from which it has been extirpated.

C. 

Disease or predation.

 This butterfly, like others, is undoubtedly consumed by predators, but there is no evidence that predation is a threat
to the species at this point. Disease is not known to be a factor in its decline.

D. 

The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms.

 Insects are not protected from collection under North Carolina law. There are also no Department of Defense regulations
that would restrict collecting of Saint Francis' satyr in North Carolina. Federal listing of this species will provide
legal protection against indiscriminate taking and illegal trade.

E. 

Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.

 Although the habitat occupied by this species is dependent upon some form of disturbance to set back succession (e.g.,
periodic fire and/or beaver impoundments), intense fires at critical times during the life cycle of the species can
eliminate small colonies. Historically, this did not present a problem since there were undoubtedly other adjacent
populations that could recolonize extirpated sites. However, the fact that only one population of this species now
remains makes it more vulnerable to such threats as catastrophic climatic events, inbreeding depression, disease,
and parasitism. Part of the occupied area is adjacent to regularly traveled roads, where there is the threat of toxic
chemical spills into the species' wetland habitat. Current military use of the impact areas is favorable to this species;
the frequent fires associated with shelling are undoubtedly a principal reason why the species is surviving on military
lands and not on surrounding private lands. Department of Defense personnel are aware of the species' plight and have
been cooperative in protection efforts. However, heavy siltation is a potential problem that could threaten the
small drainages occupied by the species. Although troop movements directly through an area occupied by the satyr
could have negative impacts, this has not occurred to date; these activities have now been directed away from areas
where the satyr occurs. Other potential threats to the species include pest control programs (for mosquitoes or gypsy
moths) and beaver control.



Reasons for Emergency Determination



In developing this rule the Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available
regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by this species. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action
is to list Saint Francis' satyr as endangered on an emergency basis. With only one population remaining (and this one
having already been diminished by intensive collecting) and with the other subspecies having been completely eliminated
from half the States where it historically occurred, the threat of over-collection cannot be denied. The Service
has concluded that conducting the normal listing process will delay protection of the species until after the 1994
flight period, thus subjecting the species to an additional year of excessive collecting pressure. The resulting
potential for further reduction of this last population could severely reduce the probability of the species' survival.
Therefore, the Service is listing the species on an emergency basis to provide maximum protection to the known population
during the 1994 flight period.



Critical Habitat



Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
designate critical habitat at the time a species is determined to be endangered or threatened. At this time the Service
has made a preliminary finding that designation of critical habitat is not prudent for this species. As discussed
under Factor B in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'' section, Saint Francis' satyr has already been
impacted by over-collecting and continues to be threatened by collecting pressure. Publication of critical habitat
descriptions and maps would make the satyr more vulnerable to collection and would increase enforcement problems
and the likelihood of extinction. Protection of this species' habitat will be addressed through the recovery process
and through the Section 7 jeopardy standard. The single remaining population is located on military lands, where
the Department of Defense is aware of its occurrence. Comments regarding the designation of critical habitat will
be accepted and reviewed during the comment period established by the proposed rule, which is published in this issue
of the 

Federal Register

.

Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include
recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.
Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies,
groups, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with
the States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal
agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities involving listed animals are discussed, in part, below.

Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section
7(a)(4) requires Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of a proposed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical
habitat. If the species is listed subsequently, Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities
they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy
or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat,
the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. Federal activities that could
impact Saint Francis' satyr and its habitat in the future include, but are not limited to, the following: road and firebreak
construction, pesticide application, beaver control, troop movements, prescribed burning and fire suppression,
and facilities construction. The only known population is located on military lands, where the Department of Defense
is already working with the Service to secure the protection and proper management of Saint Francis' satyr while accommodating
military activities to the extent possible. Conservation of this butterfly is consistent with most ongoing military
operations at the occupied site, and the listing of the species is not expected to result in significant restrictions
on military use of the land.

The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions
that apply to all endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States to take (includes harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, or collect; or to attempt
any of these), import or export, ship in interstate commerce in the course of a commercial activity, or sell or offer
for sale in interstate or foreign commerce and listed species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry,
transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service
and State conservation agencies.

Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered wildlife species under
certain circumstances. Regulations governing permits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are available for
scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and/or for incidental take in connection
with otherwise lawful activities.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On July 13, 1993, the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service adopted a revision to its bylaws. This final
rule incorporates those changes, which update and to some extent streamline the Board's bylaws. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The bylaws of the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service, 39 CFR parts 1 through 10, were initially adopted
after the passage of the Postal Reorganization Act in 1971, and have been amended several times. On July 13, 1993, the
Board of Governors adopted a revision of these bylaws. Parts 1 through 8 of the bylaws were changed, and a new part 11
was added. (Parts 9 and 10 of the bylaws were not changed and are not republished here.) In addition, 39 CFR part 221 was

amended. An explanation follows. 


Part 1_Postal Policy (Article I) 


Several changes were made to part 1 for conciseness. The former language of  1.1 (a general description of the
Postal Service) is replaced by similar language taken from former  2.1, Establishment of the U.S. Postal Service.
Language formerly contained in  1.2, The Board of Governors, also is transferred to the new  1.1. 
Former  1.3, Delegation of authority, is renumbered as  1.2. Finally, former  1.4, Open meetings,
is moved to part 7, Public Observation, and appears as paragraph 7.2(a). 


Part 2_General and Technical Provisions (Article II)


Section 2.1 now describes the physical location and function of the Office of the Board of Governors, and is derived
from former  3.9.

The language of  2.2, Agent for receipt of process, is amended to reflect that the General Counsel is also the
agent for receipt of process for each individual member of the Board when the member is acting in his or her official
capacity. The language of paragraph 2.4(b), which describes the Postal Service emblem, registered by the U.S. Patent
Office, is moved to 
 221.9 of part 221, General Principles of Organization. 


Part 3_Board of Governors (Article III) 


Former   3.1 and 3.2 are combined into a new  3.1, Responsibilities of Board, and language duplicating

39 U.S.C. 202 is deleted. Duplicative language is likewise deleted from renumbered  3.2, Compensation of Board.

For ease of reference,  3.3 is amended to contain only matters reserved for decision by the full Board. New  3.4,
by contrast, contains matters reserved for decision by the Governors only. 
Other changes in part 3 were made. New paragraph 3.3(c)(2) is added to provide for Board approval of the Postal Service
operating budget. Language is added to paragraph 3.3(e) to provide that projects above an amount specified by annual
Board resolution must be brought to the Board for approval. New language in paragraph 3.3(j) (approval of borrowing
authority) clarifies what is intended by the term ``short-term borrowings,'' and it eliminates the phrase ``purchase
money obligations,'' which is no longer used in the finance industry. Paragraph 3.3(k) (approval of terms and conditions
of obligations issued by the Postal Service) also is updated to parallel the new language in paragraph 3.3(j). 
Paragraph 3.3(m) (determination of number of officers) is simplified to remove the titles of specific officer positions
that could change. Likewise, the names of specific positions were removed from paragraph 3.3(n) (compensation of
officers at Level II of the Postal Career Executive Service). 
Section 3.6 is revised to specify the types of key reports currently provided to the Board. Paragraph 3.7(d) is added
to enhance program information provided to the Board. Section 3.8 is changed to provide for furnishing the Board with
information concerning proposals for exclusive licenses to use Postal Service intellectual properties, other
than patents and technical data rights, or proposals for joint ventures involving the use of such property. Section
3.9 is deleted; its language describing the Office of the Board of Governors was transferred to  2.1. 


Part 4_Officers (Article IV) 


Section 4.3, Postmaster General, is simplified to delete language duplicating statutory language found at 39 U.S.C.
202(c) and 203. Similarly,  4.4, Deputy Postmaster General, is simplified by removing language duplicating
39 U.S.C. 202(d) and 203. Section 4.5 is shortened by deleting outdated titles for officers. Section 4.7 is changed
to describe more closely the current duties of the Secretary of the Board, and to clarify that the Secretary is appointed
by the Governors. 


Part 5_Committees (Article V) 


Section 5.3 is deleted as duplicative of the statutory language on compensation of the Board in 39 U.S.C. 202(a). 


Part 6_Meetings (Article VI) 


Section 6.1 is amended to reflect that the Board meets normally on the first Monday and Tuesday of each month. New language
provides that the time or place of a regular or annual meeting may be varied by a unanimous vote.

Section 6.2 is changed to allow the Chairman to call special meetings with more than 30 days' notice. Section 6.5 is
amended to provide that there is no need to require the preservation of the Board's original minutes, as opposed to
copies of those minutes. Paragraph 6.6(c) is added to require a favorable vote of an absolute majority of the Governors
in office to appoint or remove the Secretary or Assistant Secretary, and to set the compensation of the Secretary or
Assistant Secretary. 



Part 7_Public Observation (Article VII)



Former  1.4, Open meetings, now appears as paragraph 7.2(a). Other paragraphs of  7.2 are renumbered
accordingly. Paragraph 7.2(c) is amended to require the approval of a majority of the Board for a person to participate
in, film, televise, or broadcast any portion of any meeting of the Board. Paragraph 7.3(f) is altered to extend its
privacy protection to all individuals, not just those who are under consideration for postal employment. 



Part 8_(Reserved) 



Part 8, Reports and Records [Article VIII], is deleted as duplicative. Section 3.3 describes reports requiring approval
of the Board (see 39 CFR 3.3(c)(1) and 3.3(r-u)). 



Part 9_Policy on Communications With Governors of the Postal Service During Pendency of Rate and Classification
Proceedings (Article IX) 



Part 9 is unchanged. 



Part 10_Code of Ethical Conduct for Postal Service Governors (Article X) 



Part 10 is unchanged. 



Part 11_Advisory Boards (Article XI) 



Part 11 is added to authorize the establishment of advisory boards for the Board of Governors. This part also states
that the Board of Governors may appoint persons to serve on such advisory boards or may delegate this authority to the
Postmaster General. 



Part 221_General Principles of Organization 



Language pertaining to the Postal Service emblem, formerly found at paragraph 2.4(b), now appears as  221.9.

In consideration of the foregoing, the Postal Service amends subchapter A of title 39, Code of Federal Regulations,
by revising parts 1 through 8 and by adding part 11, and also amends subchapter D of title 39, Code of Federal Regulations,
by adding section 221.9.

 1.1 

Establishment of the U.S. Postal Service. 



The U.S. Postal Service is established under the provisions 
of the Postal Reorganization Act (the Reorganization Act) of August 12, 1970, Public Law 91-375, 84 Stat. 719,
as an independent establishment of the executive branch of the Government of the United States, under the direction
of a Board of Governors, with the Postmaster General as its chief executive officer. The Board of Governors of the Postal
Service (the Board) directs the exercise of its powers through management that is expected to be honest, efficient,
economical, and mindful of the competitive business environment in which the Postal Service operates. The Board
consists of nine Governors appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to represent
the public interest generally, together with the Postmaster General and Deputy Postmaster General. 




 1.2 

Delegation of authority. 




Except for powers, duties, or obligations specifically vested in the Governors by law, the Board may delegate its
authority to the Postmaster General under such terms, conditions, and limitations, including the power of redelegation,
as it finds desirable. The bylaws of the Board are the framework of the system through which the Board monitors the exercise
of the authority it has delegated, measures progress toward the goals it has set, and shapes the policies to guide the
future development of the Postal Service. Delegations of authority do not relieve the Board of full responsibility
for carrying out its duties and functions, and are revocable by the Governors in their exclusive judgment.

The composition of the Board is described in 39 U.S.C. 202. The Board directs the exercise of the powers of the Postal
Service, reviews the practices and policies of the Postal Service, and directs and controls the expenditures of the
Postal Service. Consistent with the broad delegation of authority to the Postmaster General in  3.5 of these
bylaws, and except for those powers, duties, or obligations which the Reorganization Act specifically vests in the
Governors, as distinguished from the Board of Governors, the Board accomplishes its purposes by monitoring the operations
and performance of the Postal Service, and by establishing basic objectives, broad policies, and long-range goals
for the Postal Service. 


 3.2 

Compensation of Board. 


Section 202(a) of title 39 provides for the compensation of the Governors and for reimbursement for travel and reasonable

authorized by the Board 
must be specifically approved by the Board. For the purpose 
of determining the cost of a capital investment project, lease/rental agreement, or research and development project,

(1) All such projects and agreements undertaken as part of a unitary plan (either for contemporaneous or sequential
development in one of several locations) shall be considered one project or agreement, and 
(2) The cost of a lease/rental agreement shall be the present value of all lease payments over the term of the lease,
including all periods covered by renewal options or all periods for which failure to renew imposes a penalty or a hardship
such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured, plus the cost of any leasehold improvements planned in connection
with the lease/rental agreement. The present value will be determined using the cost of capital of the Postal Service.

(f) Authorization of the Postal Service to request the Postal Rate Commission to submit a recommended decision on
changes in postal rates.

(b) The term ``meeting'' means the deliberations of at 
least the number of individual members required to take action on behalf of the Board under  5.2 or  6.5
of these bylaws, where such deliberations determine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of the official
business of the Board. The term ``meeting'' does not include any procedural deliberations required or permitted
by   6.1, 6.2, 7.4, or  7.5 of these bylaws. 


 7.2 

Open meetings. 


(a) It is the policy of the United States, established in section 2 of the Government in the Sunshine Act, Public Law
94-409, 90 Stat. 1241, that the public is entitled to the fullest practicable information regarding the decisionmaking
processes of the Federal Government. The Postal Service is charged to provide the public with this information while
protecting the rights of individuals and the ability of the Government to carry out its responsibilities. Accordingly,
except as specifically permitted by statute, every portion of every meeting of the Board of Governors is open to public
observation. 
(b) Except as provided in  7.3 of these bylaws, every portion of every meeting of the Board is open to public observation.
Members of the Board may not jointly conduct or dispose of business of the Board without complying with   7.2

provided in the regulations of the Postal Service concerning the release of information. 
(c) Without the permission of a majority of the Board, no person may participate in, film, televise, or broadcast any
portion of any meeting of the Board. Any person may electronically record or photograph a meeting, as long as that action
does not tend to impede or disturb the members of the Board in the performance of their duties, or members of the public
while attempting to attend or observe a meeting of the Board. The rules and penalties of 39 CFR 232.6, concerning conduct
on 
postal property, apply with regard to meetings of the Board. 


 7.3 

Exceptions. 


Section 7.2 of these bylaws does not apply to a portion of a meeting, and   7.4 and 7.5 do not apply to information
concerning the meeting which otherwise would be required to be disclosed to the public, if the Board properly determines
that the public interest does not require otherwise, and that such portion of the meeting or the disclosure of such
information is likely to: 
(a) Disclose matters that are (1) specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be
kept secret in the interests of national defense or foreign policy, and (2) in fact properly classified under that
Executive order; 
(b) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Postal Service, including the Postal Service
position in negotiations or consultations with employee organizations. 
(c) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than the Freedom of Information Act,
5 U.S.C. 
552), provided that the statute (1) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave
no discretion on the issue, or (2) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types
of matters to be withheld; 
(d) Disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential,
such as market information pertinent to Postal Service borrowing or investments, technical or patent information
related to postal mechanization, or commercial information
