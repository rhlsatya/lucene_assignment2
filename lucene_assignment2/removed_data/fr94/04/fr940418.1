DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY 



Office of the Comptroller of the Currency













Capital Adequacy; Net Unrealized Holding Gains and Losses on 
Available-for-Sale Securities 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Treasury.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is 
proposing to amend its capital adequacy rules to revise the 
definition of common stockholders' equity to include unrealized 
holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, net of 
applicable tax effects. Inclusion of such unrealized gains and 
losses as a separate component of stockholders' equity is 
consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 
115, ``Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity 
Securities,'' and would keep the OCC's definition of common 
stockholders' equity consistent with generally accepted accounting 
principles (GAAP). As Tier 1 capital under the OCC's capital 
adequacy rules is defined to include common stockholders' equity, 
this proposal, if adopted, would require these net unrealized 
holding gains and losses to be considered in determining the amount 
of an institution's Tier 1 capital. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Under the current OCC minimum capital requirements (leverage 
ratio) and the risk-based capital guidelines set forth at 12 CFR 
part 3, a major component of Tier 1 capital is common stockholders' 
equity. Common stockholders' equity is defined to include (1) 
common stock, (2) common stock surplus, (3) undivided profits, (4) 
capital reserves, (5) adjustments for the cumulative effect of 
foreign currency translation, and (6) net unrealized losses on non-
current marketable equity securities. The net unrealized losses 
are those recorded under Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 12, ``Accounting for Certain Marketable Securities'' 
(SFAS 12). 

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, ``Accounting 
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,'' (SFAS 115). 
This statement supersedes SFAS 12 and establishes a new component 
of common stockholders' equity consisting of net unrealized holding 
gains and losses on available-for-sale securities. Under SFAS 115, 
available-for-sale securities are those securities which a bank 
does not have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, 
but does not intend to trade actively as part of its trading 
account. 

In August 1993, the OCC, the Federal Reserve Board, The 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift 
Supervision, announced the adoption of SFAS 115 for regulatory 
reporting purposes. The OCC now proposes to adopt SFAS 115 for 
regulatory capital purposes as well.

SFAS 115 


SFAS 115 applies for all debt securities and certain equity securities that have readily determinable fair values.
The statement establishes new accounting and reporting requirements for such securities effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1993, but banks have the option of adopting the statement as of the end of an earlier fiscal
year. For most banks, that would be as of December 31, 1993. 
SFAS 115 requires banks to divide their securities holdings among three categories: securities held-to-maturity,
trading securities, and available-for-sale securities. Each category of security is accounted for differently.



Held-to-Maturity 


The held-to-maturity category replaces the existing held for investment category. Presently, securities held
for investment are recorded at amortized cost. Under SFAS 115, securities in the held-to-maturity category will
be recorded at amortized cost. However, only those securities that a bank has both the positive intent and ability
to hold to maturity may be included in this account. 
This change will restrict a bank's ability to carry securities at amortized cost. For example, if a bank has the intent
to hold a security for only an indefinite period, the security cannot be classified as held-to-maturity. Consequently,
if a security would be sold in response to (1) changes in market interest rates and related changes in the security's
prepayment risk, (2) liquidity needs, (3) changes in the availability of and yield on alternative investments, (4)
changes in funding sources and terms, or (5) changes in foreign currency risk, then it must be assigned to either the
available-for-sale or trading categories. 
Nonetheless, changes in circumstances may occur that cause a bank to change its intent to hold a security to maturity.
SFAS 115 notes that a sale or transfer of a security from the held-to-maturity account in response to events that are
isolated, nonrecurring, and unusual and that could not have been anticipated, would not necessarily call into question
the bank's intent to hold other securities to maturity. 


Trading Securities 


The accounting for trading securities has not changed. Trading securities are those debt and equity securities that
a bank buys and holds principally for the purpose of selling in the near term. Trading securities will continue to be
recorded at fair value with unrealized changes in fair value reported directly in the income statement as part of the
bank's earnings.

Available-for-Sale


All securities that are not classified as either held-to-maturity or trading will be considered available-for-sale
securities. The available-for-sale category replaces the existing held-for-sale category. However, it is likely
to include some securities previously considered held for investment. The accounting treatment also has changed.
Under existing accounting requirements, held-for-sale securities are carried at the lower of cost or fair value,
with the offsetting entry reported directly in the income statement. Under SFAS 115, available-for-sale securities
will be recorded at fair value and any unrealized appreciation or depreciation will be excluded from earnings and
reported, net of applicable tax effects, as a separate component of common stockholders' equity.


Impact of SFAS 115 on Regulatory Capital


This proposed rule would amend the OCC's capital adequacy rules by revising the definition of common stockholders'
equity. Specifically, the proposed rule would remove the adjustment for net unrealized losses on non-current marketable
equity securities and replace it with the net unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities
under SFAS 115. Since common stockholders' equity is a component of Tier 1 capital, the proposed rule would affect
the calculation of an institution's Tier 1 capital under the OCC's capital adequacy rules. This amendment is intended
to adopt SFAS 115 for regulatory capital purposes and to ensure greater consistency with GAAP.
As discussed earlier, SFAS 115 restricts the circumstances in which securities may be reported at amortized cost.
Thus, a greater proportion of a national bank's securities will be carried at fair value. While this proposed rule
to adopt SFAS 115 for regulatory capital purposes will not affect reported earnings, it could result in an increase
in the volatility of regulatory capital. Under the current interest rate environment, the precise impact of this
proposed rule is difficult to predict. Until recently, interest rates were declining. Consequently, the fair value
for most banks' securities portfolios generally exceeded their book value. Therefore, the impact of this proposal
likely would have resulted in an increase in the regulatory capital of national banks. However, with the recent upturn
in interest rates, it is not possible to generalize the impact of this proposed rule on regulatory capital. Over time,
as the interest rate environment changes, the proposed rule could result in periods of lower regulatory capital for
some national banks and possibly subject a bank to regulatory action under the OCC's prompt corrective action rules.
See 12 CFR part 6. Nonetheless, while the amount of regulatory capital may vary with changes in interest rates, banks
can exercise some control over the volatility through effective interest rate risk management techniques.


Issues for Comment


The OCC invites comments on all aspects of this proposal regarding the regulatory capital treatment of net unrealized
holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities. However, the OCC specifically seeks comment on (1) the
costs and benefits of adopting SFAS 115 for regulatory capital purposes, and (2) the extent to which banks will adjust
their behavior to manage the potential volatility in regulatory capital if the OCC adopts the proposed rule.


Regulatory Flexibility Act


Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is hereby certified that this regulation will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility
analysis is not required.
This rule may increase the volatility of small banks' regulatory capital. However, it should not lead to a significant
increase in the number of small banks that do not meet regulatory capital standards because most small banks operate
with capital levels well above regulatory capital standards. Even if there were a significant decline in the market
value of banks' available-for-sale securities, most banks would still meet regulatory standards.

Proposed Amendment of Offshore Airspace Area, San Juan, PR



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice proposes to amend the Offshore Airspace Area at Puerto Rico. This action would lower the base of the San
Juan Offshore Airspace Area from 5500 feet MSL to 2500 feet MSL. The intended effect is to lower the base of the Offshore
Airspace Area to provide sufficient controlled airspace for instrument flight rule (IFR) operations, and to create
a uniform base of controlled airspace in the area.

Availability of NPRM's



Any person may obtain a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation
Administration, Manager, System Management Branch (ASO-530), Air Traffic Division, P.O. Box 20636, Atlanta,
Georgia 30320. Communications must identify the notice number of this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed on
a mailing list for future NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory Circular No. 11-2A, which describes the
application procedure.



The Proposal



The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend the Offshore
Airspace Area at San Juan, PR. The intended effect is to lower the base of the Offshore Airspace Area from 5500 feet MSL
to 2500 feet MSL, to contain IFR operations in controlled airspace, and to create a uniform base of controlled airspace
in the area. The base of this controlled airspace was increased to 5500 feet during the airspace reclassification
for the purpose of creating a standard 5500 ft. base of controlled airspace in all the surrounding areas, however,
the base of all airspace surrounding the San Juan Offshore Airspace was never increased to 5500 ft. and remains at 2500
feet MSL. It has also been found with the base at 5500 feet, air traffic control does not have sufficient airspace for
IFR traffic arriving and departing Rafael Hernandez Airport. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based
on North American Datum 83. Designations for Offshore Airspace Areas are published in Paragraph 6007 of FAA Order
7400.9A dated June 17, 1993 and effective September 16, 1993 which is incorporated by reference in CFR 71.1. The Offshore
Airspace Area designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSM is announcing receipt of a proposed amendment to the Indiana regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the
``Indiana program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed amendment
(

#

94-1) consists of revisions to the Indiana statutes as may be the Indiana General Assembly and contained in Senate
Enrolled Act (SEA) 408, SEA 319, and House Enrolled Act (HEA) 1516. The amendment is intended to revise the Indiana
program to be consistent with SMCRA and to incorporate State initiatives.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



I. Background on the Indiana Program 
II. Discussion of the Proposed Amendment
III. Public Comment Procedures 
IV. Procedure Determinations 


I. Background on the Indiana Program



On July 29, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Indiana program. Background information
on the Indiana program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval
can be found in the July 26, 1982, 

Federal Register

 (47 FR 32071). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments can be found at 30
CFR 914.10, 914.15, and 914.16.




II. Discussion of the Proposed Amendment


By letter dated March 21, 1994, (Administrative Record No. IND-1341) Indiana submitted a proposed amendment
to its program pursuant to SMCRA. The amendment consists of numerous program changes in the form of three sets of legislative
changes.

The first set of amended legislative provisions are contained in the 1994 SEA 408. These provisions concern bond forfeiture
procedures, underground mine subsidence control, and permit revocation procedures. The provisions being amended
by SEA 408 are:




IC 13-4.1-6-9 Forfeiture of bond; use of funds collected [Amend]

IC 13-4.1-9-2.5 Underground mining; subsidence; repair or compensation for damage [New]

IC 13-4.1-11-6 Suspension or revocation of permit [Amend]

<DOCNO> FR940418-1-00009 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940418-1-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The second set of amended provisions is contained in the 1987 SEA 319 (Pub. L. 7-1987). These provisions are intended
primarily to substitute the then-repealed IC 4-22-1 with IC 4-21.5 concerning administrative
orders and procedures. The provisions amended by SEA 319 are:



IC 13-4.1-2-4 Petition to adopt, amend or repeal rule; procedure [Amend]
IC 13-4.1-4-3 Burden of establishing compliance; prime farmland [Amend]
IC 13-4.1-4-5 Issuance of permit; hearing on final determination [Amend]
IC 13-4.1-6-7 Release of bond or deposit [Amend]
IC 13-4.1-11-6 Suspension or revocation of permit [Amend]
IC 13-4.1-11-8 Review of notice or order; hearing; final decision; temporary relief [Amend]
IC 13-4.1-12-1 Civil penalties [Amend]
IC 13-4.1-13-1 Action of the director or commission subject to review [Amend]
IC 13-4.1-15-9 Hearings; use or disposition of acquired lands [Amend]





The third set of amended provisions is contained in the 1987 HEA 1516 (Pub. L. 13-1987). This provision amends
the conflict of interest provisions to require members of the Indiana Natural Resources Commission to file financial
interest reports with the Indiana State Board of Accounts. The specific provision being amended by HEA 1516 is:



IC 13-4.1-2-3 Conflict of interest; offense [Amend]


III. Public Comment Procedures


In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies
the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part
of the Indiana program.


Written Comments


Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under ``

DATES

'' or at locations other than the Indianapolis Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking
or included in the Administrative Record.


Public Hearing


Persons wishing to speak at the public hearing should contact the person listed under ``

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

'' by 4:00 p.m., e.s.t. on May 3, 1994. The location and time of the hearing will be arranged with those persons requesting
the hearing. If no one requests an opportunity to testify at the public hearing, the hearing will not be held.
Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission
of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate
questions.
The public hearing will continue on the specified date until all persons scheduled to speak have been heard. Persons
in the audience who have not been scheduled to speak, and who wish to do so, will be heard following those who have been
scheduled. The hearing will end after all persons scheduled to speak and persons present in the audience who wish to
speak have been heard.

Public Meeting



If only one person requests an opportunity to speak at a hearing, a public meeting, rather than a public hearing, may
be held. Persons wishing to meet with OSM representatives to discuss the proposed amendment may request a meeting
by contacting the person listed under ``

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

.'' All such meetings will be open to the public and, if possible, notices of meetings will be posted in advance at the
locations listed under ``

IV. Procedural Determinations


Executive Order 12866



This proposed rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866
(Regulatory Planning and Review).



Executive Order 12778



The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been meet.



National Environmental Policy Act



No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).



Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.

).



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

<USDEPT>PANAMA CANAL COMMISSION</USDEPT>










Tolls for Use of Canal and Rules for Measurement of Vessels 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Panama Canal Commission.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Advance notice of proposed rulemaking; request for comments; notice of hearing.



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Panama Canal Commission proposes a major revision of the rules for measurement of vessels using the Panama Canal
to become effective October 1, 1994. The existing rules of measurement will be replaced with a simplified, objective
approach which brings the Commission's system in line with an international practice which will enter into full application
worldwide on July 18, 1994. The proposed rules apply a mathematical formula to the vessel's total volume to produce
the basis for assessing tolls. The tonnage values computed under the proposed system are comparable to those calculated
under the Commission's existing rules and, in the aggregate, are equal to existing tonnages; accordingly, no changes
are proposed to the rates of toll for use of the Canal; however, certain administrative changes to the regulations
dealing with Canal tolls are necessary to ensure their consistency with the revised rules of measurement. 



This advance notice of proposed rulemaking announces the availability from the Commission of an analysis showing
the basis of and justification for the proposed changes, solicits written data and comments from interested parties,
and sets the time and place for a public hearing.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A complete revision to the Rules for Measurement of Vessels for the Panama Canal contained in 35 CFR part 135 is proposed.
The proposed revision is designed to simplify the Commission's measurement procedures which since the Canal's inception
have been based on the Moorsom system. The change is designed to bring measurement rules at the Canal in line with the
worldwide standard of tonnage measurement and achieve compatibility with the 1969 International Convention on
Tonnage Measurement of Ships (Convention). The Convention, which establishes a universal system of measurement
for vessels engaged on an international voyage, came into effect in the United States on February 10, 1983. 



This new 35 CFR part 135 would provide for: 

a. Establishment of measurement rules for the Panama Canal Commission which are based on Annex 1 of the Convention;


b. Transitional relief measures for certain vessels, provided they do not have a structural change which results
in an alteration of 10 percent or more in their total volume; 

c. Continued use of foreign tonnage authorities, and for acceptance of reasonably accurate volumes provided by them;


d. Correction of tonnage values as necessary to satisfy the Commission's desire for accuracy; and

e. Calculation of volumes for vessels without an International Tonnage Certificate 1969 (ITC 69) through an alternative
tonnage estimating formula. 

Subpart A contains general provisions concerning the uses of the Panama Canal Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS)
Net Tonnage for the purpose of calculating tolls and admeasurement fees. It provides for the presentation of an ITC
69 or suitable substitute or the application of alternative measurement procedures. It retains provision for Commission
control over the measurement determination, verification of tonnage certificates and the administration of these
rules. 

Subpart B establishes the PC/UMS. Under it, tolls will be assessed on the basis of the PC/UMS Net Ton. The Commission
will apply a mathematical formula to the total volume in order to determine the PC/UMS Net Tonnage. This formula has
been established so as to produce tonnage and, hence, revenues that in the aggregate are equal to those produced under
the current system annually. Relevant definitions are set forth in this subpart. The subpart also establishes the
rules concerning measurement and calculations. Finally, the subpart addresses measurement rules in the event of
a total volume change. 

Subpart C continues without substantive change the present rules for the measurement of warships, dredges and floating
drydocks. Tolls for these vessels will continue to be based on their tonnage of actual displacement. 

Subpart D provides transitional relief measures for vessels which previously transited the Canal and have not had
a significant structural change. 

Subpart E sets forth the measurement procedures the Commission will use when it becomes necessary for the Commission
to determine the total volume of a vessel. 

In addition to the changes to 35 CFR part 135, certain administrative changes to 35 CFR part 133 (Tolls for Use of Canal)
are required. These changes will reconcile the language of part 133 with new part 135 by allowing for the use of the ITC
69 to obtain the required total volume information. 

Section 1604 of the Panama Canal Act of 1979, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 3794, establishes the procedures that the Commission
must follow in proposing changes in the rules for measurement of vessels. Those procedures have been supplemented
by regulations in 35 CFR part 70, which provide interested parties with instructions for participating in the process
governing changes in the measurement rules. The statute and regulations require this advance notice of proposed
rulemaking in order for the Commission to announce the proposed changes and afford interested parties an opportunity
to submit written data or comments and to participate in the public hearing on May 25, 1994. A written analysis is also
made available to the public showing the basis of and justification for the revision. 

All pertinent data or comments presented in writing, or orally at the hearing, will be considered, along with other
relevant information, before the Commission publishes a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 

Federal Register

 and forwards a complete record and its final recommendation to the President of the United States. In considering
the proposal, the President has the authority to approve, disapprove, or modify any recommendation of the Commission.
The final rule, approved and published by the President, shall be effective October 1, 1994, or 30 days from the date
of publication in the 

Federal Register

, whichever occurs later. 

The Commission has been exempted from Executive Order 12866 and, accordingly, the provisions of that directive do
not apply to this proposed rule. Even if the Order were applicable, the proposed regulation, which concerns ``rates''
and ``practices relating'' thereto, would not constitute a ``rule'' as that term is defined in the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601(2)) and would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under that Act.


A review of the environmental effect of the proposed measurement rule changes concludes that the proposed change
will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. An environmental impact statement is not
required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. 

Finally, the Administrator of the Panama Canal Commission certifies that these proposed regulations meet the applicable
standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order No. 12778.

This part establishes the procedures for determining the Panama Canal Universal Measurement System (hereinafter
PC/UMS) Net Tonnage. The tonnage will be used to assess tolls for use of the Panama Canal. Also, the tonnage may be used,
when adequate volume information is not provided, to assess the charge for admeasurement services. 


 135.2 

Vessels generally to present tonnage certificate or be measured. 


All vessels except warships, floating drydocks, dredges, and vessels eligible for transitional relief measures,
applying for passage through the Panama Canal shall present a duly authenticated International Tonnage Certificate
(1969) (hereinafter ITC 69), or suitable substitute (i.e., a certificate derived from a system which is substantially
similar to that which was provided for in the 1969 International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, and which
contains the total volume or allows for the direct mathematical determination of total volume). Vessels without
such total volume information shall be inspected by Canal authorities who will determine an appropriate volume for
use in the calculation of a PC/UMS Net Tonnage of such vessels. 


 135.3 

Determination of total volume. 


(a) The determination of total volume used in the calculation of PC/UMS Net Tonnage shall be carried out by the Panama
Canal Commission. In so doing, however, the Commission may rely upon total volume information provided by such officials
as are authorized by national governments to undertake surveys and issue national tonnage certificates. Total volume
information presented at the Panama Canal shall be subject to verification, and if necessary, correction insofar
as may be necessary to ensure accuracy to a degree acceptable to the Panama Canal Commission. 
(b) The Commission may, when it is deemed necessary to verify information contained on the ITC 69, require the submission
of additional documents. Failure to submit the requested documentation may result in the Commission's developing
a figure that accurately reflects the vessel's volume. 


 135.4 

Administration and interpretation of rules. 


The rules of measurement provided in this part shall be administered and interpreted by the Administrator of the Panama
Canal Commission.

 135.12 



Definitions. 



(a) 

Upper Deck

 means the uppermost complete deck 
exposed to weather and sea, which has permanent means of 
weathertight closing of all openings in the weather part 
thereof, and below which all openings in the sides of the 
ship are fitted with permanent means of watertight closing. 
In a ship having a stepped upper deck, the lowest line of 
the exposed deck and the continuation of that line parallel 
to the upper part of the deck is taken as the upper deck. 

(b) 

Moulded Depth

 means the vertical distance measured 
from the top of the keel to the underside of the upper deck 
at side. 

(1) In wood and composite ships the distance is 
measured from the lower edge of the keel rabbet. Where the 
form at the lower part of the midship section is of a hollow 
character, or where thick garboards are fitted, the distance 
is measured from the point where the line of the flat of the 
bottom continued inwards cuts the side of the keel. 

(2) In ships having rounded gunwales, the moulded 
depth shall be measured to the point of intersection of the 
moulded lines of the deck and side shell plating, the lines 
extending as though the gunwales were of angular design. 

(3) Where the upper deck is stepped and the raised 
part of the deck extends over the point at which the moulded 
depth is to be determined, the moulded depth shall be 
measured to a line of reference extending from the lower 
part of the deck along a line parallel with the raised part. 

(c) 

Breadth

 or 

moulded breadth

 means the maximum 
breadth of the ship, measured amidships to the moulded line 
of the frame in a ship with a metal shell and to the outer 
surface of the hull in a ship with a shell of any other 
material. 

(d) 

Enclosed spaces

 mean all spaces which are bounded 
by the ship's hull, by fixed or portable partitions or 
bulkheads, by decks or coverings other than permanent or 
movable awnings. No break in a deck, nor any opening in the 
ship's hull, in a deck or in a covering of a space, or in 
the partitions or bulkheads of a space, nor the absence of a 
partition or bulkhead, shall preclude a space from being 
included in the enclosed space. 

(e) 

Excluded spaces 

mean, notwithstanding the 
provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, the spaces 
referred to in paragraphs (e)(1) to (e)(5) of this section. 
Excluded spaces shall not be included in the volume of 
enclosed spaces, except that any such space which fulfills 
at least one of the following three conditions shall be 
treated as an enclosed space: 

 


_The space is fitted with shelves or other means for 
securing cargo or stores; 

_The openings are fitted with any means of closure; 

_The construction provides any possibility of such 
openings being closed. 

 


(1)(i) A space within an erection opposite an end 
opening extending from deck to deck except for a curtain 
plate of a depth not exceeding by more than 25 millimeters 
(one inch) the depth of the adjoining deck beams, such 
opening having a breadth equal to or greater than 90 percent 
of the breadth of the deck at the line of the opening of the 
space. This provision shall be applied so as to exclude 
from the enclosed spaces only the space between the actual 
end opening and a line drawn parallel to the line or face of 
the opening at a distance from the opening equal to one-half 
of the width of the deck at the line of the opening (Figure 1). 



In the figure: 

 


O = excluded space 

C = enclosed space 

I = space to be considered as an enclosed space 

Hatched in parts to be included as enclosed spaces. 



B = breadth of the deck in way of the opening. 

 


In ships with rounded gunwales the breadth is 
measured as indicated in Figure 11 in paragraph 
(e)(5). 

 












(1)(ii) Should the width of the space because of any 
arrangement except by convergence of the outside plating, 
become less than 90 percent of the breadth of the deck, only 
the space between the line of the opening and a parallel 
line drawn through the point where the athwartships width of 
the space becomes equal to, or less than, 90 percent of the 
breadth of the deck shall be excluded from the volume of 
enclosed spaces. (Figures 2, 3 and 4).

as indicated in Figure 11 in paragraph (e)(5). 

 



















(1)(iii) Where an interval which is completely open 
except for bulwarks or open rails separates any two spaces, 
the exclusion of one or both of which is permitted under 
paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and/or (e)(1)(ii) of this section, such 
exclusion shall not apply if the separation between the two 
spaces is less than the least half breadth of the deck in 
way of the separation. (Figures 5 and 6).

(2) A space under an overhead deck covering open to 
the sea and weather, having no other connection on the 
exposed sides with the body of the ship than the stanchions 
necessary for its support. In such a space, open rails or a 
bulwark and curtain plate may be fitted or stanchions fitted 
at the ship's side, provided that the distance between the 
top of the rails or the bulwark and the curtain plate is not 
less than 0.75 meters (2.5 feet) or one-third of the height 
of the space, whichever is the greater. (Figure 7).

 135.13 

Determination of PC/UMS net tonnage. 



PC/UMS Net Tonnage will be determined as follows: 

(a) For all vessels with tolls fixed in accordance with 
 133.1 (a) or (b) of this chapter, unless eligible for the 
transitional relief measures established in  135.31 of this 
chapter, the formula for determining PC/UMS Net Tonnage is:




PC/UMS Net Tonnage = K

4

(V) + K

5

(V)

 


in which formula: 



(1) ``K

4

'' = [0.25 + 

{

0.01 x Log

10

(V)

}

] x 0.830 

(2) ``K

5

'' = [Log

10

(DA-19)]/

{

[Log

10

(DA-16)] x 17

}

. If the 
number of passengers (N

1

 + N

2

) is greater than 100 or DA is 
equal to or less than 20.0 meters then K

5

 is equal to zero. 

(3) ``V'' = Total volume of all enclosed spaces of the 
ship in cubic meters and is identical to V as specified in 
the 1969 International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of 
Ships. 

(4) ``DA'' (Average depth) = The result of the division 
of the Total Volume by the product of the length in meters 
multiplied by the molded breadth in meters. DA = V/(L x 
MB). 

(5) ``L'' (Length) is defined as 96 percent of the total 
length on a waterline at 85 percent of the least moulded 
depth measured from the top of the keel, or the length from 
the fore side of the stem to the axis of the rudder stock on 
that waterline, if that be greater. In ships designed with 
a rake of keel, the waterline on which this length is 
measured shall be parallel to the designed waterline. 
(6) Moulded breadth is defined in  135.12(c). 
(7) N

1

 = number of passengers in cabins with not more 
than 8 berths.

(8) N

2

 = number of other passengers. 
(9) N

1

 + N

2

 = total number of passengers the ship is 
permitted to carry as indicated in the ship's passenger 
certificate. 
(b) For vessels eligible for transitional relief 
measures, the existing Panama Canal Net Tonnage as specified 
on the certificate issued by Panama Canal Commission will 
become the PC/UMS Net Tonnage. In such case, the formula 
for determining PC/UMS Net Tonnage is: PC/UMS Net Tonnage = 
Panama Canal Net Tonnage. 


 135.14 

Change of PC/UMS net tonnage. 


(a) Vessels whose PC/UMS Net Tonnage is determined in 
accordance with section  135.13(a) will have a new PC/UMS 
Net Tonnage issued if ``V'' changes. 
(b) A vessel whose PC/UMS Net Tonnage is determined in 
accordance with  135.13(b) will retain that tonnage until 
the vessel undergoes a significant structural change as 
defined in  135.14(c). In the event of a significant 
structural change, the vessel's PC/UMS Net Tonnage will be 
determined in accordance with  135.13(a). 
(c) For the purposes of paragraph (b), significant 
structural change means an actual change of at least 10 
percent in the total volume of the vessel. Vessels without 
comparative ITC 69 total volumes, or other suitable sources 
of total volume comparison, will have a fair and equitable 
volume comparison made by the Commission to determine if a 
significant structural change has occurred. 


 135.15 

Calculation of volumes. 


(a) All volumes included in the calculation of PC/UMS 
net tonnage shall be measured, irrespective of the fitting 
of insulation or the like, to the inner side of the shell or 
structural boundary plating in ships constructed of metal, 
and to the outer surface of the shell or to the inner side 
of structural boundary surfaces in ships constructed of any 
other material. 
(b) Volumes of appendages shall be included in the 
total volume. 
(c) Volumes of spaces open to the sea may be excluded 
from the total volume. 


 135.16 

Measurement and calculation. 


(a) All measurements used in the calculation of 
volumes shall be taken to the nearest centimeter or 
one-twentieth of a foot. 
(b) The volumes shall be calculated by generally 
accepted methods for the space concerned and with an 
accuracy acceptable to the Commission. 
(c) The calculation shall be sufficiently detailed to 
permit easy checking. 


Subpart C_Warships, Dredges and Floating Drydocks 


 135.21 

Warships, dredges and floating drydocks to present 
documents stating displacement tonnage. 


All warships, floating drydocks, and dredges shall 
present documents stating accurately the tonnage of 
displacement at each possible mean draft. The term 
``warship'' means any vessel of government ownership that is 
being employed by its owners for military or naval purposes 
and shall include armed coast guard vessels and vessels 
devoted to naval training purposes, but shall not include 
naval auxiliary vessels such as tankers, ammunition ships, 
refrigerator ships, repair ships, tenders or vessels used to 
transport general military supplies. 


 135.22 

Tolls on warships, dredges and floating drydocks 
levied on actual displacement. 


The toll on warships, dredges, and floating drydocks 
shall be based upon their tonnage of actual displacement at 
the time of their application for passage through the Canal. The actual displacement of these vessels shall be determined

in a manner acceptable to the Commission and shall be 
expressed in tons of 2240 pounds. Should any of these 
vessels not have on board documents from which the 
displacement can be determined, Commission officials may use 
any practicable method to determine the displacement tonnage 
for assessment of tolls.

Subpart D_Transitional Relief Measures 



 135.31 

Vessels eligible for transitional relief measures. 



To be eligible for the transitional relief measures as 
specified in  135.13(b), a vessel must have made a transit 
of the Panama Canal between March 23, 1976 and September 30, 
1994, inclusive, and not have had a significant structural 
change as defined in  135.14(c) since the last transit 
during the above period. Any significant structural change 
made after the granting of transitional relief measures will 
disqualify a vessel for further relief, and the vessel will 
be handled in accordance with the provisions of  135.13(a). 
Transitional relief measures are applied to the vessel 
during its entire active service life as long as the vessel 
does not undergo a significant structural change. Vessels 
eligible for transitional relief measures will present their 
existing Panama Canal Tonnage Certificate on their first 
transit after October 1, 1994. Vessels eligible for relief 
measures will not be required to present an ITC 69 or any 
other total volume certification. 



Subpart E_Alternative Method for Measurement of Vessels 



 135.41 

Measurement of vessels when volume information is 
not available. 



When an ITC 69 or suitable substitute is not presented 
or the certificate or substitute presented does not have an 
accuracy acceptable to the Commission, vessels will be 
measured in a manner that will include the entire cubical 
contents as required by the definition of total volume and 
enclosed spaces. The Commission will endeavor to determine 
an accurate total volume of the vessel using the best 
information available at the time of the determination. The 
total volume shall be calculated by generally accepted 
methods for the space concerned and with an accuracy 
acceptable to the Commission. 



 135.42 

Measurement of ships when tonnage cannot be 
otherwise ascertained. 



(a) Vessels without an ITC 69, a suitable substitute 
or documentation from which to calculate total volume shall 
be measured as follows. 

(1) The volume of structures above the upper deck may 
be determined by any accepted method or combination of 
methods. These methods include but are not limited to 
simple geometric formulas, Simpson's rules, and other 
standard mathematical formulas. If special procedures are 
used, they should be identified. In all cases, measurements 
and calculations should be sufficiently detailed to permit 
easy review. 

(2) The volume of the hull below the upper deck (UDV) 
shall be determined as follows: 

(i) The formula:

 


UDV = (0.91  x  ((LOA  x  MB)  x  (D-SLD))) + (SLDISP/1.025)

 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940418-1-00020 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940418-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Where:

 


UDV = Total volume of all enclosed spaces below the 
upper deck in cubic meters. 

LOA = The Length overall, i.e., the length of the ship 
in meters from the foremost to the aftermost points, 
including a bulbous bow if present. 

MB = Moulded breadth in meters as defined in 
 135.12(c). 

D = Moulded depth in meters as defined in  135.12(b). 

SLD = Summer loaded draft (in meters) i.e., the maximum 
depth to which the vessel's hull may be immersed when in a 
summer zone. 

SLDISP = Summer loaded displacement, i.e., the actual 
weight in metric tons of the water displaced by the vessel 
when immersed to her SLD.

 


(ii) If  135.42(a)(2)(i) proves unworkable, the total 
volume of the hull below the upper deck will be determined 
by multiplying the product of the LOA, MD and D by the

Approval and Promulgation of State Implementation Plans; Utah Stack Height Analyses and Regulations 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Governor of Utah submitted two revisions to the Utah State Implementation Plan (SIP): Section 16, Stack Height
Demonstration, and Section 9, Part B, Sulfur Dioxide. Sections 16 and 9 were submitted in letters dated December 23,
1991, and May 15, 1992, respectively. The revisions to Section 16 were to address the stack-height demonstration
requirements for the Kennecott Minerals Company Smelter near Magna, Utah. Minor corrections to the other stacks
in the State were also made. Section 9, Part B was revised to be consistent with Section 16. Prior to the revision, the
SO

2

 attainment demonstration for Salt Lake County and portions of Tooele County was based on multipoint rollback emission
rates at the Kennecott smelter. The PM

10

 SIP adopted for Salt Lake County in 1991 established significantly lower emission rates (which would meet the 24-hour
National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for the smelter based on reasonable available control technology
(RACT). Section 16 and Section 9, Part B needed to be consistent with the PM

10

 SIP (the PM

10

 SIP is located in Section 9, Part A). In addition, Section 9 Part B was revised to include an analysis and the emission
limitation that would demonstrate attainment of the 3-hour secondary NAAQS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



A. Regulatory History 



On February 8, 1982 (47 FR 5864), EPA promulgated final regulations limiting stack height credits and other dispersion
techniques as required by section 123 of the Clean Air Act (CAA). These regulations were challenged in the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit by the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, Inc., the Natural Resources Defense Council,
Inc., and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 

Sierra Club 

v. 

EPA, 

719 F.2d 436 (DC Cir. 1983). On October 11, 1983, the court issued its decision ordering EPA to reconsider portions
of the stack height regulations, while upholding other portions. As a result, EPA promulgated revisions to the stack
height regulations on July 8, 1985 (50 FR 27892). The revisions redefined a number of specific terms including ``excessive
concentrations,'' ``dispersion techniques,'' ``nearby,'' and other important concepts, and modified some of
the bases for determining good engineering practice (GEP) stack height credit. 

Pursuant to Section 406(d)(2) as amended in the 1977 CAA, each state was required to: (1) Review and revise its SIP,
as necessary, to include provisions that limit stack height credit and other dispersion techniques in accordance
with the revised regulations; and (2) review all existing emission limitations to determine whether any of these
limitations have been affected by stack height credits greater than GEP, or any other dispersion techniques. For
any limitations so affected, each state was to prepare revised limitations consistent with the revised stack height
regulation. 

Subsequently, EPA issued detailed guidance on carrying out the necessary reviews. For the review of emission limitations,
each state was to prepare an inventory of stacks greater than 65 meters in height and sources with emissions of sulfur
dioxide (SO

2

) in excess of 5,000 tons per year (tpy). These limits correspond with the 

de minimis 

stack height and the 

de minimis

 SO

2

 emission level provisions in the regulations. These sources were then subjected to detailed review for conformance
with the revised federal regulations. State submissions were to contain an evaluation of each stack and source in
the inventory.

Subsequent to the July 8, 1985 promulgation, the stack height regulations were again challenged in 

NRDC 

v. 

Thomas, 

838 F.2d 1224 (D.C. Cir. 1988). On January 22, 1988, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued its decision
affirming the regulations, for the most part, but remanding three provisions to the EPA for reconsideration. These
are: 

 


1. Grandfathering pre-October 11, 1983 within-formula stack height increases from demonstration requirements
[40 CFR 51.100(kk)(2)]; 

2. Dispersion credit for sources originally designed and constructed with merged or multiflue stacks [40 CFR 51.100(hh)(2)(ii)(A)];
and 

3. Grandfathering pre-1979 use of the refined H + 1.5L formula [40 CFR 51.100(ii)(2)]. 

 


However, none of these provisions is at issue here. 



B. Regulatory Requirement for Stacks Greater Than GEP 



GEP has been established by the regulations to be the greater of: (1) 65 meters, (2) the height derived through application
of one of two formulas which base GEP on the dimensions of nearby buildings, or (3) the height demonstration through
a field study or fluid modeling demonstration to be necessary to avoid excessive concentrations of any air pollutant
due to downwash, eddies, or wakes caused by the source itself or nearby buildings or terrain obstacles (40 CFR 51.100(ii).
Where EPA or a State finds that a source emission limit is affected by dispersion from a stack in excess of GEP, the State
must then model to establish an emission limit which will provide for attainment of the NAAQS when stack height credit
is restricted to GEP. 

The term ``excessive concentration'' is defined in the regulations to be a 40% increase in concentrations of an air
pollutant due to downwash which also results in an exceedance of an applicable NAAQS or prevention of significant
deterioration (PSD) increment. In order to demonstrate that stack height in excess of the GEP formulas is needed,
a source owner must show through the use of fluid modeling that, when meeting emission rates equivalent to the new source
performance standard applicable to the source category, excessive concentrations would result from the use of a
shorter stack height. However, a source may demonstrate that the NSPS emission limit is infeasible, establishing
an alternative emission limit that represents the most stringent degree of emissions control feasible for the particular
source. In making this demonstration, source owners may generally rely on EPA's Guidelines for the Determination
of Best Available Retrofit Technology for Coal-Fired Power Plants and Other Existing Stationary Facilities, EPA
450/3-80-009b, November 1980 (BART Guideline).

C. The 1981 and 1986 SIP Submittals 


1. The 1981 SO

2

 SIP Submittal 


A Utah SO

2

 SIP revision was submitted with a letter dated August 17, 1981, by the Governor of Utah to address the attainment of
the SO

2

 NAAQS in Salt Lake County and portions of the nonattainment area in Tooele County. Additional information was submitted
by the State on December 7, 1981 and January 25, 1983. On February 7, 1983, the Governor submitted a request to redesignate
all of Salt Lake County and the nonattainment portion of Tooele County to attainment. On March 23, 1984 (49 FR 10926),
EPA proposed to delay any action on the request to redesignate the area to attainment until final resolution of several
issues. A detailed discussion of this SIP revision is contained in the March 23, 1984 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
and should be used as a reference for additional information. 
This SIP revision contained several complex national issues, such as what constitutes ambient air and whether attainment
demonstration is sufficient without dispersion modeling or monitoring. Section 50.1 of Title 40 Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) defines ``ambient air'' simply as ``that portion of the atmosphere, external to buildings, to
which the general public has access.'' Application of that regulatory provision is based on an evaluation of where
public lands are involved, where private lands are subject to little restriction on access, or conversely, where
lands adjacent to a source are clearly restricted for the public. Kennecott has maintained for some years, that public
access to the property (and therefore, the atmosphere) in question has been and is precluded. The cumulative effect
of Kennecott's property holding, property exchanges, installation of fences, posts, no-trespassing signs, and
security patrolling, supports the Company's claim to control use of the relevant property. There was information
on termination of limited elk hunting practices in the area. Kennecott's man-made barriers, and other security measures,
together with the inherently rugged nature of the mountainous terrain involved, were believed to effectively preclude
access. The control strategy for the 1981 SIP has several parts: (1) Emission limitations on several low-level stacks
at the smelter (e.g., boilers and heat treaters); (2) reasonably available measures to control or eliminate fugitive
emissions; and (3) cumulative emission limits for the main stack (see additional discussion on these emission limits
in 2.b. below). The State's strategy was based upon measured ambient data in the lower elevation near the smelter.
EPA identified the major deficiencies of the State analysis: (1) The State made no attempt to demonstrate the effects
in the upper elevation (above 5600 feet in the Oquirrh Mountains); and (2) the database at the smelter was insufficient
to be used reliably with the established emission limits, given the assumption in the development of the emission
limits technique. Modeling analyses performed by the State and EPA to demonstrate attainment in the upper elevation
were screening analyses only. EPA concluded that dispersion modeling in this complex terrain was unreliable and
that the only method that could be used for this determination was monitoring. The 1981 SO

2

 SIP was conditionally approved on the assumption that the emission limits were consistent with federal 1985 stack
height rules and, therefore, adequate for attainment of the SO

2

 NAAQS. The redesignation of the area to attainment was denied. (50 FR 7059, February 20, 1985) 


2. The May 2, 1986 GEP SIP Submittal 


The Utah Stack Height SIP was submitted by the Governor with a letter dated May 2, 1986. The submittal included regulations
to address (1) GEP stack height credit and dispersion techniques, (2) a new Section 17 of the SIP that listed all existing
stacks in Utah greater than 65 meters, and (3) a technical support document for Section 17 of the SIP. The Kennecott
Magna stack analyses were part of this submittal. Subsequent submittals to support the Kennecott analyses were received
in letters dated October 6, 1986, December 3, 1986, November 13, 1987, and May 17, 1988. 
The Kennecott smelter stack height credit was a significant component of the Utah SO

2

 SIP emission limits conditionally approved on February 20, 1985. Briefly, a condition in that approval required
the State to determine whether the 1215-foot stack would be GEP once the revised stack height regulations were promulgated.
If not, the emission limits would then be revised as necessary.

a. 

Applicability of the NSPS Regulation. 

The federal NSPS regulation for primary copper smelters applies to any such facility that commences construction
or modification after October 16, 1974 (42 FR 37937, July 25, 1977 and 40 CFR 60.160). Modification generally means
any physical or operational change which results in an increase in the emission rate to the atmosphere. NSPS require,
among other things, control of the strong gas streams with a double contact acid plant (i.e., a stack gas of 650 ppm or
less SO

2

, based on a 6-hour average (EPA 450/3-83-018a)). 
The Kennecott Magna smelter expansion/modification began in the early 1970s, with a commitment to the 1215-foot
stack in 1973 and completion of the project in 1977. The modification of the acid plant system resulted in an increase
from 60% sulfur capture to 86%, approximately a 65% reduction of sulfur emissions. Based on this information, EPA
concluded that the 1970's Kennecott expansion/modification did not subject the smelter to NSPS requirements. 


b. Analyses on the 1986 Submittal. 

The Kennecott stack height analyses were undertaken to comply with the July 8, 1985 stack height regulation, as well
as the condition specified in the approval of the Utah SO

2

 SIP. The reader should refer to the February 2, 1985 final conditional approval (50 FR 7056) and March 23, 1984 proposed
approval (49 FR 10946) 

Federal Register

 actions for additional information on the Utah SO

2

 SIP. 

Kennecott originally had two 400-foot stacks (grandfathered stack heights) from which SO

2

 emissions from the smelter were vented. The 1970's modification/expansion included the replacement of the 400-foot
stacks with a single 1215-foot stack. The GEP formula height (H+1.5 L), considering the nearby buildings, is 212.5
feet. The federal regulation established the policy that sources faced with excessive concentrations, due to downwash,
should be required to attempt to reduce those concentrations by reducing emissions to the degree feasible before
seeking credit above the GEP formula. The benchmark for this requirement is the NSPS or the alternative level of control
established through the application of BART if the NSPS is found to be infeasible. The demonstration that the NSPS
is infeasible can be done through a fluid modeling analyses. 
The initial Kennecott GEP demonstration was submitted on May 2, 1986, with subsequent submittals on October 6, 1986,
December 3, 1986, November 13, 1987, and May 11, 1988. There are two basic parts to the Kennecott analyses: the GEP demonstration
and BART analysis. The GEP demonstration consists of three subparts: the fluid modeling protocol, the fluid modeling
results, and an evaluation of the fluid modeling results with respect to the stack height regulations. The BART analysis
is performed if the source contends that the NSPS emission limits are infeasible. Relevant factors for this analysis
include: high cost-effectiveness ratio, excessive local community impact, excessive plant impact, and technological
infeasibility.

Since the Kennecott emissions, as established through Multi-point Rollback (MPR), were used in the 1981 SO

2

 SIP, EPA's primary concern, with the use of any emission rate in the demonstration of GEP, is ensuring protection of
the NAAQS (i.e., to protect health and welfare). The basic concept behind GEP is to prevent sources from using illegal
dispersion techniques to avoid emissions controls. 

Kennecott provided extensive data on its GEP analyses. The reader is referred to 53 FR 48942 for information on the
GEP demonstration and BART analysis. To summarize, the GEP demonstration showed that the existing stack height of
1215-foot (370.4m) met the 40% criterion due to terrain effects and an exceedance of the NAAQS at MPR emission rates.
(Discussion of the MPR emission rates for Kennecott can be found in 49 FR 10948, March 12, 1983, proposed rulemaking).
MPR is a technique designed for sources with variable emission rates (e.g., smelters). MPR allows for a frequency
distribution of emission rates which will permit extremely high emissions on rare occasions. The MPR methodology
is constructed around the recognition that any control strategy will have a predictable probability of allowing
a violation of the NAAQS. The MPR is based upon allowing a 26% probability of recording a violation (Additional information
on MPR is found in Appendix A). The GEP demonstration satisfies the excessive concentration criteria in EPA's regulation
if MPR reflects the proper emission rates. After review, EPA concluded that Kennecott's analyses were acceptable,
since Kennecott performed a fluid modeling study consistent with existing guidance and the study was approved by
EPA. 

The purpose of establishing a BART emission rate in the 1985 stack height regulations was to prevent source owners
from using unreasonably high emission rates to justify credit for excessive stack heights. The regulation requires
that sources faced with excessive concentrations due to downwash should be required to attempt to reduce those concentrations
by reducing those emissions to the degree feasible before seeking credit above the GEP formula. The benchmark for
this requirement is the NSPS, or an alternative level of control established through the application of BART if NSPS
is found to be infeasible. Kennecott provided responses to all the BART factors mentioned above. The cost-effectiveness
ratio and technical infeasibility issues, however, were determined critical to this review because of their relationship
to the emission limitations used in the GEP analyses. 

Application of the level of control required by NSPS would reduce the emissions of SO

2

 at Kennecott during the stable process phase, but would not affect emission rates under startup, shutdown, malfunction,
and upset conditions. This is because the NSPS emission rate is for normal operations and excludes such process conditions.
MPR includes startup, shutdown, malfunction, and upset conditions. From the Kennecott assessment, considering
only long-term averages, the cost portion is consistent with the tons of SO

2

 reduction expected from similar NSPS applications. In the Kennecott BART analysis, the controlling emissions for
the determination of GEP appear to be those under upset, start-up, shutdown, and malfunction. Therefore, while there
would be no difference in the emission rates under these conditions as a result of meeting NSPS, there would be a substantial
additional cost to control these emissions. 

In summary, the emissions at the smelter from startups, shutdowns, upsets, and malfunctions are included in the MPR
emission limits and could be considered in the NAAQS attainment and GEP analyses. Application of NSPS technology
will not affect these emission rates and will, therefore, result in no change in demonstrating GEP. It may be possible
to reduce annual emissions by requiring additional controls on the smelter, but such reduction would have no relevance
to the limiting case for determination of GEP. 

Given the above discussion, EPA proposed to approve (53 FR 48942, December 5, 1988) the Kennecott analysis in the Utah
GEP SIP submitted on May 2, 1986, with subsequent submittals on October 6, 1986, December 3, 1986, November 13, 1987,
and May 17, 1988. However, EPA's review was conducted under a specific assumption: that the emission rate(s) in the
SO

2

 SIP were sufficient to demonstrate attainment. That assumption followed another critical assumption: that Kennecott
owned or controlled the lands in the upper elevation for which no monitoring data exist to demonstrate attainment
of the NAAQS.

Only one comment was received in response to the December 5, 1988 

Federal Register

 proposed approval of the Kennecott GEP demonstration. The comment was from Kennecott in support of this action. However,
prior to publication of the proposed approval 

Federal Register

, EPA did receive a letter from a landowner in the Oquirrh Mountains expressing concerns due to the lack of ambient monitoring
in the nonattainment area. This was EPA's first documented information on public access in the nonattainment area
other than the Kennecott operation. EPA proceeded to continue its evaluation of the State submittal and to publish
its position on the GEP demonstration based on the State submittal, but initiated a reevaluation on land ownership
above the 5600-ft. elevation in the Oquirrh Mountains. Documentation on the claim of land ownership, other than that
of the Kennecott operations, was provided by Howard Haynes, Jr. in March 1989. 



3. Utah 1981 SO

2

 and 1986 GEP SIP Reassessment 



Data from the Salt Lake County and Tooele County Assessor offices showed over 80 landowners in this nonattainment
area. Kennecott, in its land ownership research, verified the list of landowners. 

As stated above, one of the critical assumptions of the conditional approval of the 1981 SO

2

 SIP and the emission rate was Kennecott's ownership or control of those lands in the potential nonattainment area
in the Oquirrh Mountains. The land ownership research revised the EPA's earlier assumptions on the adequacy of the
1981 SO

2

 and the 1986 GEP Stack SIPs. 

EPA entered into discussions with Kennecott and the State for resolution of these issues and attempted to outline
the procedures for addressing the SO

2

 and GEP SIPs. Documentation of these meetings and discussions is found in EPA letters to the State dated July 12, 1989,
and August 14, 1989. Since monitoring has been stated as the only method to conclusively determine the attainment
status of lands in the Oquirrh Mountain, the State and Kennecott proceeded to develop a monitoring program. Maximum
ambient concentration location of the monitors, access to the monitors, and operational logistics of the monitor(s)
were key problems identified. 

During these negotiations, the State was developing the PM

10

 SIP for Salt Lake County. The Salt Lake County PM

10

 SIP development process identified SO

2

 as a precursor for PM

10

. (Precursors are secondary particles which are formed in the atmosphere from gases which are directly emitted by
the source. Sulfates are one of the most common secondary particles in a PM

10

 nonattainment area and result from sulfur dioxide emissions.) The Kennecott smelter SO

2

 emissions comprised 




56% of the total (primary and secondary) PM

10

 emissions in Salt Lake County. 

The PM

10

 SIP was adopted by the State in August 1991 and submitted to EPA in November 1991. The reader is referred to 57 FR 60149,
December 18, 1992, for information on the PM

10

 SIP. The PM

10

 SIP required significant emission reduction for the Kennecott operations (refinery, concentrator, mine, power
plant and smelter). The Kennecott smelter emission limits were reduced from 76,000 tpy or 18,000 lb/hr annual average
(as allowed in the 1981 SO

2

 and 1986 GEP SIPs) to 




18,500 tpy (which includes fugitive emissions, and applies to the entire smelter). (The 1981 SO

2

 and 1986 GEP SIPs addressed emissions from smelter processing units and SO

2

 collection and removal equipment vented to the smelter tall stack. They did not include fugitive emissions. For clarification,
the 76,000 tpy was reduced to the 14,191 tpy limit on the 1215-foot stack for emissions from the smelter processing
units and SO

2

 collection and removal equipment). 



D. The 1991 GEP and 1992 SO

2

 SIP Submittals 



Prior to the State's adoption of the PM

10

 SIP, EPA discussed the uncertainties of finalizing the 1986 GEP SIP with the State and Kennecott. EPA clarified its
position on the need for consistency within the Utah SIP with respect to emission limitations at the Kennecott smelter.
In a letter dated July 18, 1991, EPA outlined the SIP Revisions that must occur to address the inconsistencies between
the 1981 SO

2

 SIP, the 1986 GEP SIP, and 1991 PM

10

 SIP. To summarize, EPA stated that it could not knowingly and legally proceed to approve a regulation and emission
limitation that were no longer applicable, or a stack height demonstration analysis based on an obsolete regulation
or emissions limitation. 

In a letter dated December 23, 1991, the Governor of Utah submitted a revision to Section 16, Demonstration of GEP Stack
Height, of the Utah SIP. The 1991 submittal was received on December 30, 1991. On February 28, 1992, EPA advised the
Governor of Utah that this submittal was administratively and technically complete in accordance with the Federal
SIP completeness criteria. 

The revisions to Section 16 specify the allowable emission limit for the 1215-foot main stack at 14,191 tons/year
as derived in the PM

10

 SIP. This emission limit is based on double contact acid plant technology (which is considered NSPS for the smelter
acid plant tail gas), significant capture improvement of fugitive emissions, and improved operation and maintenance.
The 1991 submittal also contained a reanalysis of other sources in the State for which stack heights above the deminimus
level (65m) were previously reported. (These sources' stack heights were published in 54 FR 24334, June 7, 1989.)

EPA found minor changes between the June 7, 1989 

Federal Register

 and the 1991 revision to Section 16 for the ``actual'' stack height of some sources. EPA is not concerned with these
minor changes since they could be attributed to errors in rounding and the stack height changes are less than one foot.
Listed below are the differences between the June 7, 1989 

Federal Register

 and the 1991 submittal:

On May 15, 1992, the Governor of Utah submitted a revision to Section 9, Part B, Sulfur Dioxide, Utah SIP. The revision
was to address the 1990 CAA requirement that a SIP revision be submitted by May 15, 1992, for any area that did not have
a fully approved SIP (the 1981 SO

2

 SIP was only conditionally approved). The significant change in this SIP revision from that of the 1981 submittal
is as follows: 

a. The MPR emission limitations and assumptions are removed and replaced with the emission limitation which can be
achieved using the NSPS technology, double contact acid plant, or the equivalent of NSPS. (NSPS is the presumptive
norm for RACT for this facility.) The SO

2

 SIP now references the same emission limitations as those stated in PM

10

 SIP. 

b. The SO

2

 NAAQS are the 0.14ppm, 24-hour primary standard, and the 0.5ppm, 3-hour secondary standard. The 24-hour impact analysis
was a rollback analysis which compared the smelter emissions in 1991 (PM

10

 SIP emission limitation) with 1979 emissions. The State had monitoring data showing attainment at Lake Point (an
area originally defined as ambient air and owned by the Bureau of Land Management, but now owned by Kennecott) where
exceedances were recorded. The Lake Point site could be considered representative of the closest point in the elevated
terrain that would be impacted by the tall stack emissions. Demonstrating attainment at Lake Point would technically
support the attainment elsewhere in the elevated terrain that is considered ambient air. The area considered ambient
air in the elevated terrain is a significant distance downwind from Lake Point. 

c. The PM

10

 SIP addressed, to some degree, the 3-hour impact. The PM

10

 SIP emission limitation was based on a 24-hour SO

2

 limit; this emission limitation would be achieved through a given lb/hr calculated on a 6-hour average. The 24-hour
limit was considered ``controlling'' for PM

10

 and SO

2

 (i.e., the 24-hour limitation was believed to be the level of control necessary for PM

10

 attainment, as well as for the SO

2

 attainment demonstration). The SO

2

 SIP established a 3-hour limitation and verified that such limitation would protect the 3-hour NAAQS. 

d. Section 4.2 of the Utah Air Conservation Regulations was revised to include a 24-hour averaging period for the sulfur
content of coal, fuel oil, and fuel mixtures, and to specify the ASTM methods to be used to demonstrate compliance with
the limitation and reporting requirement. (The previous rule specified a limit for the sulfur content of fuels, but
did not specify an averaging time or specific ASTM methods.) Section 4.6 was also revised to include a 3-hour averaging
time for Sulfur Burning Production Sulfuric Acid Plants. 

e. Specific regulations which provided for special consideration (including malfunction provisions) on the smelter
fluctuating operation are removed. Malfunction provisions for the Kennecott smelter operation are now the same
as for any stationary source in Utah. This issue was addressed during the PM

10

 SIP development and is being approved under the PM

10

 SIP federal approval process. These regulation impacts were clarified in this SIP revision. 



II. This Action 



The December 23, 1991 Section 16, Stack Height revision and the May 15, l992 Section 9, Part B, SO

2

 revision are consistent with other provisions in the State-wide SIP. EPA is proposing to approve these revisions
because they are consistent with EPA guidance for GEP stack height demonstration and the attainment demonstration
for the SO

2

 NAAQS. 

These revisions resolve EPA's concerns regarding ambient air, attainment demonstration in the elevated terrain,
and the enforceability issues related to the smelter operations. The previous emission limitations have been the
subject of litigation filed by the Environmental Defense Fund. The legal actions have been stayed pending EPA final
action on the past SIP revisions. The 1991 and 1992 revisions are believed to have settled the litigants' concerns
about applying reasonable control technology and demonstrating attainment per the traditionally accepted federal
requirements (i.e., application of RACT (double contact acid plant or the equivalent), monitoring demonstration,
etc).

Request for Public Comment 



The EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of today's proposal. As indicated at the outset of this document, EPA
will consider any comments received by May 18, 1994. 

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State Implementation Plan. Each request for revision to any State Implementation Plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements. 



Regulatory Flexibility 



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.,

 EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over population of less than 50,000.

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 222) from
the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver
for Table 2 and 
Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request
continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

Redesignation of the Yavapai-Apache Reservation to 
a PSD Class I Area; State of Arizona


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The purpose of this action is to propose approval and seek public comment on the request by the Yavapai-Apache Tribal
Council to redesignate the Yavapai-Apache Reservation (``the Reservation'') in the State of Arizona to Class I under
EPA's regulations for prevention of significant deterioration of air quality. The Class I designation will result
in lowering the allowable increases in ambient concentrations of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen
dioxide on the Reservation.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Part C of the Clean Air Act (``the Act'') provides for the prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) of air quality.
The intent of this part is to prevent deterioration of existing air quality, particularly in areas considered to be
pristine. The Act provides for three basic classifications applicable to all lands of the United States. Associated
with each classification are increments which represent the maximum allowable increase in ambient air pollutant
concentrations above a baseline concentration. A Class I designation applies to areas of special national or regional
value from a natural, scenic, recreational, or historic perspective. The PSD regulations provide special protection
for such areas. Class II applies to areas in which pollutant increases accompanying moderate growth would be allowed.
Class III applies to those areas in which considerably more air quality deterioration would be considered acceptable.



Under the 1977 amendments to the Act, all areas of the country that met the National ambient air quality standards were
initially designated Class II, except for certain international parks, wilderness areas, national memorial parks,
national parks, and any other areas previously designated Class I.

1

 Section 164 of the Act allows States and Indian governing bodies to reclassify areas under their jurisdiction to accommodate
the social, economic, and environmental needs and desires of the local population. Reservations that have previously
been reclassified as Class I areas include the Northern Cheyenne, Fort Peck, and Flathead Reservations in Montana
and the Spokane Reservation in Washington.





A Class I redesignation will result in lowering the allowable increases in ambient concentrations of particulate
matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide on the Reservation. Only facilities defined by the PSD regulations,
40 CFR 52.21, as major stationary sources or major modifications are required to perform an air quality impact analysis
for Class I and Class II areas. These facilities are typically large industrial sources such as refineries and electric
utilities. 
It is important to note that no new permits and no new substantive requirements are applicable as a result of a redesignation
to Class I. The same analyses and control technology requirements apply as if the area was designated as Class II. The
difference between the two designations, in this case, is that the maximum increase in ambient concentration of a
given pollutant

2

 allowed over a baseline concentration is lower in a Class I area. This affords a Class I area greater protection from
the cumulative impacts of many facilities locating in and around the Class I area. 





Typically a facility must be upwind of and quite close to a Class I area for it to have a significant impact (greater than
1 microgram per cubic meter). Facilities that are not found to have a significant impact may usually construct without
performing a ``full'' (detailed) air quality analysis. Those facilities that may have a significant impact on a Class
I area must perform a more detailed air quality analysis and may be required to propose and apply mitigation measures
to reduce emissions to a level that will have an insignificant impact on the Class I area. 


Yavapai-Apache Request for Redesignation


On December 17, 1993, the Yavapai-Apache Tribal Council (herein referred to as ``the Tribal Council'') submitted
to EPA a proposal to redesignate the Yavapai-Apache Reservation from Class II to Class I. With their request, the Tribal
Council submitted an Air Quality Redesignation Plan, documentation of public notification, a record of the public
hearing held on October 21, 1993, and comments received by the Tribal Council on the proposed redesignation.
The Yavapai-Apache Reservation is located in the Verde Valley of Central Arizona about 90 miles north of Phoenix and
55 miles south of Flagstaff. The Reservation was established by Executive Order in 1871 and is composed of five land
parcels, totalling 635 acres, held by the Federal Government as trust lands.
The main parcel, the Middle Verde Reservation, is approximately 458 acres and is located two miles west of Interstate
17. A second parcel, the Camp Verde Reservation, is located approximately five miles southeast of the main parcel,
adjacent to the town of Camp Verde, and is forty acres. The Clark Reservation, a parcel of 58.5 acres, is located in Clarkdale,
25 miles northwest of the Middle Verde Reservation. A forth parcel, the Rimrock Reservation, is located in Rimrock
about 10 miles east of the main parcel and consists of 3.75 acres. The fifth parcel, approximately 75 acres, is located
on Interstate 17 near the entrance to the Montezuma Castle National Monument and is intended for commercial development.




Statutory and Regulatory Requirements for Redesignation


Section 164 of the Clean Air Act and Federal regulations set forth at 40 CFR 52.21(g) outline the requirements for redesignation
of areas under the PSD program. The Act provides that lands within the exterior boundaries of reservations of federally
recognized Indian tribes may be redesignated only by the appropriate Indian Governing Body. Under section 164(b)(2)
and 40 CFR 52.21(g)(5), EPA may disapprove a redesignation only if it finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing,
that the redesignation does not meet the procedural requirements of section 164 or is a mandatory Class I area that
may not be redesignated. The latter does not apply to the area proposed for redesignation. In addition, the Indian
Governing Body may resubmit the proposal after correcting any deficiencies noted by the Administrator.
The procedural requirements for a Class I redesignation by an Indian Governing Body are as follows: (1) At least one
public hearing must be conducted in accordance with the requirements set forth at 40 CFR 51.102; (2) other States,
Indian Governing Bodies, and Federal Land Managers whose lands may be affected by the proposed redesignation must
be notified at least 30 days prior to the public hearing; (3) at least 30 days prior to the public hearing, a satisfactory
description and analysis of the health, environmental, economic, social and energy effects of the proposed redesignation
must be prepared and made available for public inspection and be referenced in the public hearing notice; (4) if any
Federal lands are included in the redesignation, the redesignating authorities must provide written notice to the
appropriate Federal Land Managers and an opportunity to confer and submit written comments and recommendations;
(5) the Indian Governing Body must consult with the State(s) in which the Reservation is located and that border the
Reservation. 


Tribal Council Submittal 


The December 17, 1993 request for redesignation includes evidence that all of the statutory and regulatory requirements
for redesignation of the Yavapai-Apache Reservation from Class II to Class I have been met by the Yavapai-Apache Tribal
Council. The Yavapai-Apache Tribal Council is the Indian Governing Body for the Yavapai-Apache Reservation, and
only lands within the exterior boundaries of the Reservation are proposed for redesignation.
Pursuant to 40 CFR 51.102, the Tribal Council conducted a public hearing on October 21, 1993 at the Clarkdale Community
Building in Clarkdale, Arizona. Notice of the hearing was provided to the required parties and numerous other public
agencies and interested parties, was posted in public locations, and was provided to national and local media. A description
and analysis of the health, environmental, economic, social, and energy effects of the proposed redesignation entitled,
``Yavapai-Apache Tribe Air Quality Redesignation Plan,'' was completed in September 1993, and its availability
was announced in the public hearing notices. Evidence that the Tribe consulted with State officials prior to proposing
the redesignation is also included in the submittal. Therefore, the documentation submitted by the Tribal Council
shows that all statutory and regulatory procedural requirements for redesignation have been met.


Summary of Action


Since EPA's review has not revealed any procedural deficiencies, the redesignation is hereby proposed for approval.
The public is invited to comment on whether the Tribal Council has met all the procedural requirements of section 164
of the Act. Comments should be submitted to the address listed in the front of this document. Public comments received
by May 18, 1994 will be considered in the final rulemaking action taken by EPA.


Administrative Review


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. The proposed action affects only major stationary
sources, as defined by 40 CFR 52.21, will not result in any additional requirements for small entities. Therefore,
I certify that this action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking; extension of comment 
period. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is 
extending the comment period for a proposed rule published on 
March 1, 1994 [59 FR 9808] which proposed to amend the 
regulations for hazardous waste management under the Resource 
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) by proposing to list as 
hazardous certain wastes from the production of carbamate 
chemicals. The original deadline for comments is being extended, 
and comments must now be submitted by May 16, 1994. The Agency 
recognizes that the docket for this proposed listing contains 
many technical documents. In addition, several members of the 
public have specifically requested additional time to submit 
comments to properly address areas of concern. In light of these 
circumstances, the Agency is extending the comment period on the 
proposed rule by two weeks. Because the Agency has committed to 
make its final listing determination for the wastes proposed in 
the notice of March 1, 1994 on or before January 31, 1995, this 
two week extension is the maximum that the Agency can reasonably 
grant.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rules.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In a Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking adopted March 8, 1994, the Commission required that
carriers participating in the offering of calling party number based services must inform telephone customers regarding
the availability of identification services and how to invoke the privacy protection mechanism. For ANI or charge
number services for which such privacy is not provided, the rules require that the notification inform telephone
customers of the restrictions on the reuse or sale of subscriber information.



In the Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking adopted March 8, 1994, the Commission seeks comments on whether the Commission
should prescribe more detailed instructions regarding subscriber education requirements, and on whether the policies
for calling party number delivery adopted in the Report and Order should extend to other services.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This summarizes the Commission's Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the matter of Rules and Policies Regarding
Calling Number Identification Service. The item was adopted by the Commission on March 8, 1994, and released March
29, 1994, and bears the title of ``Rules and Policies Regarding Calling Number Identification Services_Caller ID'',
Report and Order (R&O) and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Further NPRM) (CC Docket 91-281, FCC
94-59). The R&O is summarized elsewhere in this issue.



The Further NPRM and supporting file are available for inspection and copying during the weekday hours of 9 a.m. to
4:30 p.m. in the FCC Reference Center, room 239, 1919 M St., NW., Washington, DC, or copies may be purchased from the
Commission's duplicating contractor, ITS, 2100 M St., NW., Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, phone (202) 857-3800.
The Further NPRM will be published in the FCC Record.



Analysis of Proceeding




This summarizes the Commission's Further NPRM in the matter of Rules and Policies Regarding Calling Number Identification
Services_Caller ID, Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (CC Docket 91-281, FCC 94-59,
adopted March 8, 1994, and released March 29, 1994). In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, adopted October 23, 1991,
(56 FR 53700, November 8, 1991), the Commission proposed to establish federal policies and rules concerning interstate
calling number identification service (caller ID). On March 8, 1994, the Commission adopted a Report and Order which
found that a federal model for interstate delivery of calling party number is in the public interest, that calling
party privacy must be protected, and that certain state regulation of interstate calling party number (CPN) based
services, including interstate caller ID, must be preempted.

 


Specially, the Commission's rules require that common carriers using Common Channel Signalling System 7 (SS7) and
subscribing to or offering any service based on SS7 functionality must transmit the calling party number parameter
and its associated privacy indicator on an interstate call to connecting carriers. The rules also require that carriers
offering CPN delivery services provide, at no charge to the caller, an automatic per call blocking mechanism for interstate
callers. The rules require that terminating carriers providing calling party based services, including caller
ID, honor the privacy indicator. The Commission found that the costs of interstate transmission of CPN are 

de minimis, 

and that the CPN should be transmitted among carriers without additional charge. The rules adopted in the R&O
require that carriers participating in the offering of any service that delivers CPN on interstate calls inform telephone
subscribes that the subscriber's number may be revealed to called parties and describe what steps subscribers can
take to avoid revealing their numbers. Further, the Commission adopts rules restricting the reuse or sale of information
generated by automatic number identification (ANI) or charge number services, absent affirmative subscriber consent.

In the Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Further NPRM) adopted March 8, 1994, the Commission seeks comment on
whether it should prescribe detailed instructions regarding what form education should take or prescribe more precisely
responsibilities of various carriers. The Commission stated a particular interest in specific joint industry education
proposals.

In the Further NPRM, the Commission tentatively concludes that its policies for calling party number delivery should
apply equally to services delivering calling party name, and seeks comment on this tentative conclusion. It also
seeks comment on whether the policies adopted in the Report and Order should be extended to other services that might
identify the calling party.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Proposed Rule To List the Saint Francis' Satyr as Endangered



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to list a butterfly, the Saint Francis' satyr (

Neonympha mitchellii francisci

) as an endangered species pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. This butterfly is known
from a single locality in North Carolina. Recent heavy collecting pressure has resulted in a reduction of the only
known population of this subspecies and is believed to pose an imminent threat to the species' survival. Due to the
need to reduce or eliminate the likelihood of further collection, an emergency rule is published elsewhere in today's


Federal Register

 to provide this butterfly with immediate protection under the Act for a period of 240 days. Proposed listing, if made
final, would implement long-term Federal protection and allow for recovery measures in accordance with the Act's
provisions.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background



Saint Francis' satyr (

Neonympha mitchellii francisci

), one of the rarest butterflies in eastern North America, was described by Parshall and Kral (1989) from materials
collected in North Carolina.

The authors estimate that the single known population probably produces less than 100 adults annually. Shortly after
its discovery in 1989, Saint Francis' Satyr was reported to have been collected to extinction (Refsnider 1991, Schweitzer
1989). In 1992, the subspecies was rediscovered at its type locality during the course of a Service-funded status
survey. The Act defines ``species'' to include any subspecies of fish or wildlife or plants, and any distinct population
segment of any species of vertebrate fish and wildlife. Although 

N. m. francisci

 is recognized taxonomically as a subspecies, it will be referred to as a ``species'' throughout the remainder of this
rule.

Saint Francis' satyr is a fairly small, dark brown butterfly of the subfamily 

Satyrinae

 and the family Nymphalidae, which include many species of butterflies commonly called satyrs and wood nymphs. 

Neonympha m. francisci

 and 

N. m. mitchellii,

 the northern subspecies which is listed as endangered (May 20, 1992: 57 FR 21569), are nearly identical in size and
show only a slight degree of sexual size dimorphism (Hall 1993, Parshall and Kral 1989). Saint Francis' satyr has conspicuous
``eyespots'' (like most members in the wood nymph group) on the lower surfaces of the wings, and these eyespots are
a dark maroon brown in the center_reflecting a silver cast in certain light. The border of the eyespots is straw yellow
with an outermost border of dark brown. These eyespots, usually round to slightly oval, are well developed on the fore
and hind wings. The spots are accentuated by two bright orange bands along the edges of the posterior wing and by two
darker brown bands across the central portion of each wing. Saint Francis' satyr, as well as the nominate subspecies


mitchellii,

 can be distinguished from its congener, 

N. areolata

, by the latter's well-marked eyespots on the upper wings and brighter orange bands on the hinds wings (Refsnider 1991,
McAlpine 

et al

. 1960. Wilsman and Schweitzer 1991, Hall 1993).

Saint Francis' satyr is extremely restricted geographically and it is presently known to exist only from a single
population in North Carolina. The annul life cycle of 

francisci

 unlike that of its northern relative 

mitchellii,

 is bivoltine. It has two adult flights or generations annually. Little is known about its life history, and larval
host plants are thought to be graminoids such as grasses, sedges, and rushes. The habitat occupied by 

francisci

 consists primarily of wide, wet meadows dominated by sedges and other wetland graminoids. In the North Carolina sandhills,
these wet meadows are often relicts of beaver activity. These boggy areas are quite acidic and ephemeral, succeeding
to either pocosin or swamp forest if not kept open by frequent fires or beaver activity.

The sandhills were once covered with an open type of woodland, dominated by longleaf pine, wire grass, and other fire-tolerant
species. The type of forest that presently exists along the creek inhabited by 

francisci

 can only mature under a long period of fire suppression. Parshall and Kral (1988) speculate that 

francisci

 is a relict from a more widespread southern distribution, and its current limited distribution could also be a result
of the enormous environment changes that have taken place in the past 100 years within the southern coastal plain.
Extensive searches of other suitable habitat in North Carolina and South Carolina have turned up no additional populations
of this butterfly (Hall 1993, Schweitzer 1989).

Federal actions on this species began on November 21, 1991 when it was included as a Category 2 species in the Animal
Notice of Review (56 FR 58804). Category 2 species are those species for which the Service believes that Federal listing
as endangered or threatened is possibly appropriate, but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability
and threat are currently not available to support a proposed rule. Based on recent surveys conducted by Service and
State personnel, the Service now concludes that sufficient information exists to propose listing 

Neonympha mitchellii francisci

 as endangered.



Summary of Factors Affecting the Species



Section 4(a)(1) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures
for adding species to the Federal list. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to
one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to Saint Francis'
satyr (

Neonympha mitchellii francisci

) are as follows:

A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range



Due to its recent discovery, it is impossible to determine what the original range of this butterfly was. Based upon
its demonstrated dependency on periodic fires to create new habitat and the present trend of fire suppression on private
lands, it is assumed that 

francisci 

once occupied a more extensive area with a greater number of populations and individuals. Massive habitat alterations
are a major factor in the reduction of the range of 

francisci

. The extensive loss of wetland habitats in the Carolina Coastal plains and the draining of swamps, pocosins, bays,
savannas, flatwoods, and bogs for conversion to agriculture and silviculture is well documented.

The extirpation of beavers from the Carolinas at the turn of the century may have played an important role in the reduction
of this butterfly's range. Beavers play an active role in the creation of sedge meadow habitats which are favored by
Saint Francis' satyr (Hall 1993, Woodward and Hazel 1991). The open woodlands and wetlands of the coastal plain have
declined drastically during the past two centuries; thus the range of 

francisci 

has become increasingly fragmented and the structure of their meta-populations may have been destroyed. The fracturing
of meta-populations is cited in the decline of the aragos skipper and a number of other butterflies associated with
tall grass prairies (Panzer 1988, D. Schweitzer pers. comm.)

Since 

francisci 

may be a relict population already, the further destruction and fragmentation of its existing habitat has brought
it close to extinction. The sole remaining population is now fragmented into less than 5 or 6 small colonies of individuals
which occupy a total area of a few square miles.



B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes



Both subspecies of 

Neonympha mitchellii 

are highly prized by collectors, including commercial collectors, who often collect every available individual.
Several populations of the nominate subspecies, 

mitchellii, 

have been destroyed by collectors and other populations are extremely vulnerable to this threat (Refsnider 1991).
The single known population of 

francisci 

was extremely over-collected following its initial discovery and it is was believed to have been extirpated from
the wild. Since the emergency listing of the nominate subspecies, 

mitchellii, 

in 1991, North Carolina was the only place where 

Neonympha mitchellii 

could be legally collected in the wild. Following the emergency listing of the northern subspecies (Mitchell's satyr),
the North Carolina Heritage Program received several inquiries from collectors concerning the location of the North
Carolina population (Saint Francis' satyr). These collectors expressed apprehension about placing any restrictions
on the collecting of this rare and much sought after satyr_

francisci.

 Collectors have reportedly visited the known site of 

francisci 

on a daily basis during the flight period, taking every available adult (Hall 1993). After this initial wave of over-collecting,
many unsuccessful searches were made for Saint Francis' satyr before it was eventually rediscovered. Little is known
about this butterfly's ecological requirements and life history, but it appears to be more vulnerable than its northern
relative. It may be more dependent upon a longer meta-population structure than its northern cousin in order to colonize
new sites or to recolonize old sites from which it has been extirpated.



C. Disease or Predation



There is no available evidence at this time that predation or disease are factors in this butterfly's decline or threaten
its continued existence in the wild.



D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms



Presently, insects are not protected from taking under North Carolina law. Also the Department of Defense regulations
do not prohibit the take of butterflies on military lands (Saint Francis' satyr occurs on Fort Bragg). Federal listing
of this butterfly will provide legal protection against taking and illegal trade in the species.



E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence



This species is dependent upon some form of disturbance (e.g., periodic fires and/or beaver impoundments) to create
the desired habitat needed for survival. But intense fires at critical stages during its life cycle could eliminate
small colonies of this butterfly. Since only one population of 

francisci

 remains and there are no other known adjacent populations to recolonize extirpated sites, this species is extremely
vulnerable to catastrophic climatic events, inbreeding depression, disease and parasitism. Part of its habitat
is adjacent to a well-traveled road where there is the possible threat of toxic chemical spills into its wetland habitat.
Current military use of the lands favor this species, due to the frequent fires associated with shelling. The Department
of Defense personnel are aware of the species' plight and have limited troop movement through the area. Heavy siltation
of the small drainage areas occupied by 

francisci

 could pose a potential threat to the species. Other potential threats to this butterfly include pest control programs
for mosquitoes and/or gypsy moths and beaver eradication.

<TEXT>
 

In developing this proposal the Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available
regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by this species. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action
is to list Saint Francis' satyr as endangered. With only one population remaining (already diminished by intensive
collecting) and with the other subspecies (

mitchellii

) having been eliminated from half of the States where it historically occurred, the threat of over-collecting is
well documented.

The potential for further reduction of this last known remaining population of 

francisci 

could severely reduce the likelihood of this butterfly's survival. Therefore, the Service is listing the species
as endangered on an emergency basis to provide maximum protection to the remaining population during the 1994 flight
period. At the same time, the Service is initiating the normal listing process by proposing the species for endangered
status.



Critical Habitat



Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
designate critical habitat at the time a species is determined to be endangered or threatened. At this time, the Service
has made a preliminary finding that designation of critical habitat is not prudent for this species. As discussed
under Factor B in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'' section, Saint Francis' satyr has already been
impacted by over-collecting and continues to be threatened by collecting pressure. Publication of critical habitat
descriptions and maps would make this satyr even more vulnerable to collection, and would increase enforcement problems
and the likelihood of extinction. Protection of this species' habitat will be addressed through the recovery process
and through the section 7 jeopardy standard. The single remaining population is located on military lands, where
the Department of Defense is aware of its occurrence. Comments regarding the designation of critical habitat will
be accepted and reviewed during the comment period established by this proposed rule.



Available Conservation Measures



Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under he Endangered Species Act include
recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.
Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies,
groups, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with
the States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal
agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities involving listed animals are discussed, in part, below.

Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section
7(a)(4) requires Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of a proposed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical
habitat. If the species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities
they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy
or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat,
the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. Federal activities that could
impact Saint Francis' satyr and its habitat in the future include, but are not limited to, the following: Road and firebreak
construction, pesticide application, beaver control, troop movements, prescribed burning the fire suppression,
and facilities construction. The only known population of Saint Francis' satyr is located on military lands, where
the Department of Defense is already working with the Service to secure the protection and proper management of this
butterfly, while accommodating military activities to the extent possible. Conservation of this butterfly is consistent
with most ongoing military operations at the occupied site, and the listing of the species is not expected to result
in significant restrictions on military use of the land.

The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions
that apply to all endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States to take (includes harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, or collect; or to attempt
any of these), import or export, ship in interstate commerce in the course of a commercial activity, or sell or offer
for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry,
transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service
and State conservation agencies.

Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibitions activities involving endangered wildlife species under
certain circumstances. Regulations governing permits are found at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are available
for scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and/or for incidental take in connection
with otherwise lawful activities.



Public Comments Solicited



The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible.
Therefore, comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community,
industry, or any other interested party concerning this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments particularly
are sought concerning:

(1) Biological, commercial trade or other relevant data concerning any threat (or lack thereof) of this species;

(2) The location of any additional populations of this species and the reasons why any habitat should or should not
be determined to be critical habitat as provided by section 4 of the Act;

(3) Additional information concerning the range, distribution, and population size of this species; and

(4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possible impacts on this species.

Final promulgation of the regulation on this species will take into consideration the comments and any additional
information received by the Service, and such communications may lead to a final regulation that differs from this
proposal.

The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal, if requested. Requests must be received
within 45 days of the date of publication of the proposal. Such requests must be made in writing and addressed to the
Field Supervisor, Asheville Field Office (see 

Addresses

 section).

 Notice of petition finding.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces a 12-month finding on a petition to list the California tiger salamander
(

Ambystoma californiense

) pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The petition has been found to be warranted but precluded
by pending listing actions on higher priority species. The Service continues to seek data and comments from the public
on the status and threats to this animal.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



Background 



Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq

.), requires that for any petition to revise the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants that presents
substantial scientific and commercial information a finding be made within 12 months of the date of receipt of the
petition on whether the petitioned action is (a) not warranted, (b) warranted, or (c) warranted but precluded from
immediate proposal by other pending proposals to list, delist, or reclassify species. Such 12-month findings are
to be published promptly in the 

Federal Register

. If the finding is warranted but precluded, the Service shall, within 12 months of such finding, again make one of the
three findings described above with regard to the petition.

The California tiger salamander was designated as a category 2 candidate for listing in the November 21, 1991, Animal
Notice of Review (56 FR 58804). A category 2 candidate is a species for which data in the Service's possession indicate
listing is possibly appropriate, but for which substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats
is not currently available to support proposals for listing. In a petition dated February 20, 1992, and received on
February 26, 1992, Dr. H. Bradley Shaffer of the University of California, Davis, requested the Service list the California
tiger salamander as an endangered species. The petition cited numerous threats to the species, including habitat
loss and fragmentation, predation by introduced species, and other anthropogenic factors. The Service announced
its 90-day petition finding in the 

Federal Register

 on November 19, 1992 (57 FR 54545), which concluded that the petition presented substantial information indicating
that the petitioned action may be warranted. 

The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the present
and future threats facing the California tiger salamander. Most of the remaining range of the California tiger salamander
is imminently threatened by urban development, conversion of natural habitat to agriculture, introduction of exotic
predatory animals, and/or other anthropogenic factors (e.g., rodent control programs, vehicular-related mortality).
However, several populations inhabiting refuges, parks, and other public lands are threatened only by exotic predators
and stochastic events that may, in time, result in local extirpation. Moreover, tiger salamander localities in portions
of the Diablo Range, inner Coast Ranges, and Sierra Nevada foothills are not significantly threatened at the present
time. Coupled with the species' wide-ranging distribution (i.e., infrequently scattered population localities
over 250 miles in 24 California counties) and relatively large number of remaining breeding localities, the species
will not face extinction if recovery is temporarily postponed. Therefore, the Service concludes that the threats
facing the species are moderate. 

The Service concludes as a result of its status review that sufficient information is currently available to support
a proposed rule to classify the species as endangered or threatened. According to Service policy announced in the


Federal Register

 on May 12, 1993 (58 FR 28034), such species are placed in category 1 and assigned a listing priority number. Guidelines
for assigning proper listing priorities were published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 21, 1983 (48 FR 43098). Consequently, given the moderate yet imminent threats facing the California
tiger salamander throughout its range, the Service hereby assigns the California tiger salamander a listing priority
number of 8. 

For the current fiscal year that began on October 1, 1993, the Service in central and northern California is making
expeditious progress to propose and list at least 49 high priority taxa (38 species in eight listing packages with
a listing priority of 2, 9 species in four listing packages with a listing priority of 3, and 2 species in a listing package
with a listing priority of 6). In light of these ongoing listing efforts involving plants and animals that are imminently
and highly threatened, the Service finds the petition to be warranted but precluded by pending listing actions on
higher priority species.

ACTION: 

Advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FAA is considering rulemaking to establish requirements to ensure that flight attendants understand sufficient
English language to communicate, coordinate, and perform all required safety related duties. If the FAA actually
proposes such a requirement, it would be comparable to regulatory requirements for other crewmembers and dispatchers.
Improvements in communication, coordination, and performance of required safety related duties that may result
from this regulatory process would benefit crewmembers and passengers.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Comments Invited



Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of a proposed rule by submitting such written data, views,
or arguments as they may desire. Comments relating to the environmental, energy, federalism, or economic impact
that might result from any future rulemaking action are also invited. Substantive comments should be accompanied
by cost estimates. Communications should identify the regulatory docket or notice number and should be submitted
in triplicate to the Rules Docket address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date
for comments specified will be considered by the Administrator before rulemaking action is taken. All comments received
will be available, both before and after the closing date for comment, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested
persons. A report summarizing each substantive public contact with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) personnel
concerned with this rulemaking will be filed in the docket. Persons wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their
comments must include a preaddressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket
No. 27694.'' The postcard will be date stamped and mailed to the commenter.



Availability of ANPRM



Any person may obtain a copy of this ANPRM by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation Administration, Office of
Public Affairs, Attention: Public Inquiry Center, APA-230, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC
20591, or by calling (202) 267-3484. Communications must identify the notice number of this ANPRM.

Persons interested in being placed on the mailing list for future rulemaking actions should request from the above
office a copy of Advisory Circular No. 11-2A, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Distribution System, which describes
the application procedure.



Background



It is essential that all flight crewmembers, dispatchers, and air traffic controllers, be able to communicate with
each other. Sections 61.83, 61.103, and 61.123 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) require that a person, in
order to be eligible to receive a special pilot certificate without limitations, be able to read, write, and understand
the English language. Section 61.151 of the FAR requires that a person, in order to be eligible for an airline transport
pilot certificate, to be able to read, write, and understand the English language and speak it without accent or impediment
of speech that would interfere with two-way radio conversation. Additionally, persons eligible to be flight engineers,
navigators, and dispatchers are required to be able to read, write and understand the English language. The primary
objective of these rules is to insure communication and coordination among crewmembers and others who have duties
related to the safe operation of a flight. The Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee, an entity comprised of aviation
related organizations that advise the FAA on various regulatory issues, has stated that it is inconsistent to assign
flight attendants safety related duties aboard flights without ensuring that they have the ability to effectively
communicate and coordinate these duties with other crewmembers.



Possible Rulemaking



This notice is to inform the public that the FAA is considering amending the applicable portions of parts 121, 125 and
135 of the FAR by requiring certificate holders to establish a program to ensure that flight attendants understand
sufficient English to communicate, coordinate and perform all required safety related duties.

The FAA is issuing this Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to gather operational and economic data for use in determining
whether to develop a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). The FAA is seeking information in the following specific
areas:



Nature of the Problem



(1) What are the safety related duties that would be affected by lack of proficiency in the English language?

(2) What are the actual or potential safety related problems, if any, caused by a lack of English language proficiency
on the part of the flight attendants?

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940418-1-00043 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940418-1-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) What level of understanding and fluency should a flight attendant have in order to perform safety related duties?

(4) What constitutes sufficient English language proficiency for operations conducted by the certificate holders?



Extent of the Problem



(5) How many flight attendants are serving with United States operators who do not possess English language proficiency?
(Please provide information regarding the basis, source or criteria used to formulate the number of flight attendants
that do not possess English language proficiency.)



Cost



(6) What would be the average cost of training each flight attendant who is not proficient in the English language,
to the extent necessary, to be proficient in the English language?

(7) What would be the cost of replacing a flight attendant who is not proficient in the English language?

(8) Would there be a need to hire additional personnel to train flight attendants who are not proficient in the English
language?



Present Practices



(9) How are flight attendants, who are not proficient in the English language, given duty assignments?

(10) Is an effort made to have at least one English speaking flight attendant on each flight?

(11) Are flight attendants, who are not proficient in the English language, routinely assigned to certain positions
on a flight?

(12) When foreign operators function with flight attendants who do not speak the language of the operator or English,
how are these flight attendants assigned to positions on the flight?

(13) How do foreign governments ensure that flight attendants possess the language skills necessary to perform crew
coordination duties?



Method of Ensuring Proficiency



(14) What type of program, procedures, or standard should be used to ensure that flight attendants possess the necessary
proficiency in the English language to communicate, coordinate and perform all safety related duties?

(15) Should all flight attendants be proficient in the English language? If not, why not?

(16) What percentage of flight attendants on a flight should be proficient in the English language? (Please provide
the basis for your analysis).



Regulatory Process Matters



Economic Impact



The FAA is presently unable to determine the likely costs of imposing regulations affecting an operator flight attendant
English language program. Following a review of the responses submitted to this ANPRM, the FAA will determine what
regulatory requirements will be proposed, if any, and will review the potential costs and benefits, as required by
Executive Order 12866. As discussed above, the FAA is seeking relevant cost data to facilitate the FAA's determinations.



Other Regulatory Matters



At this preliminary stage, it is not possible to determine whether there will be a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities or what the paperwork burden might be. These regulatory matters will be addressed
at the time of publication of any NPRM on this subject.



Federalism Implications



Federalism implications, if any, will be discussed if an NPRM is issued.

 Bureau of Indian Affairs, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) proposes to revise part 40 of Chapter I, title 25 of the Code of Federal Regulations,
to ensure consistency with U.S. Department of Education student financial assistance program regulations, to implement
requirements of a court decision regarding eligibility, and to change the title of part 40 to ``Higher Education Grant
Program''. Loans to individual Indians are provided for in 25 CFR part 101 and are, therefore, removed from this part.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The United States Department of Education published regulations in March 1975 setting forth the manner in which student
financial assistance programs are administered. In the absence of regulations specific to the Bureau's Higher Education
Program and eligible Indian students, recipient institutions of higher education often do not understand the purpose
of the Bureau's program. These regulations are proposed to clarify the program and remedy inconsistent practices.




The Bureau previously defined applicants for assistance under the Higher Education Grant Program to mean a person
who is recognized as a member of an Indian tribe by the Secretary of the Interior and who has at least one-fourth degree
Indian blood, Alaska Native, Eskimo or Aleut blood. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has ruled
that such 1/4 blood requirement was not in accordance with the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA), the authorizing statute
that was cited as authority for the regulation. 

Zarr 

v. 

Barlow,

 800 F.2d 1484 (9th Cir. 1986). The authority used for the Higher Education Grant Program is the Snyder Act, which places
no limitation on the definition of Indian. 

The definition in BIA elementary and secondary education programs, ``an eligible Indian student is a student who
is a member of or is at least a one-fourth degree Indian blood descendant of a member of an Indian tribe which is eligible
for the special programs and services provided by the United States through the Bureau of Indian Affairs to Indians
because of their status as Indians'', (Section 2008(f) of 25 U.S.C.), is used. 

For purposes of this part, the definition is, therefore, revised. Comments are especially desired on this section
of eligibility. 

On March 3, 1987, the Bureau published proposed Higher Education Grant Program rules in the 

Federal Register

. In January 1991, the Bureau conducted consultation meetings with Indian tribes, parents, school boards, and other
interested parties concerning the Higher Education Grant Program regulations. Oral testimony and written statements
were received in the Office of Indian Education Programs until February 26, 1991. The Bureau considered the comments,
objections, and suggested changes received in response to the 1987 

Federal Register

 publication and the 1991 consultation meetings in re-proposing these regulations. 

The information and record-keeping requirements contained in this part have been submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget for approval as required by 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

 The collection of this information will not be required until approved by the Office of Management and Budget.

The policy of the Department of the Interior is, whenever practical, to afford the public an opportunity to participate
in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written comments regarding the proposed
rule, by the date specified in the Dates section, to the location identified in the Addresses section of this document.


The primary author of this document is Mr. Harvey Jacobs, Jr., Branch of Post Secondary Education, Office of Indian
Education Programs. 

The Department of the Interior has determined that this proposed rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment and that no detailed statement is required pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969. 

This document is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and therefore will not be reviewed
by the Office of Management and Budget. This rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small
entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 606 

et seq

). These regulations will affect only the delivery of higher education services to eligible, individual Indian students.
