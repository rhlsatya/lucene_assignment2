In 1988, another restructuring took place in which Finsider and its main operating companies (TAS, Italsider, and
Nuova Deltasider) entered into liquidation and a new company, ILVA, was formed. ILVA took over some of the assets and
liabilities of the liquidating companies. With respect to TAS, part of its liabilities and the majority of its viable
assets, including all the assets associated with the production of electrical steel, were transferred to ILVA on
January 1, 1989. ILVA itself became operational on that same day. Part of TAS' remaining assets and liabilities were
transferred to ILVA on April 1, 1990. After that date, TAS no longer had any manufacturing activities. Only certain
non-operating assets (

e.g., 

land, buildings, inventories), remained in TAS. 

From 1989 to 1994, ILVA consisted of several operating divisions. The Specialty Steels Division, located in Terni,
produced the subject merchandise. ILVA was also the majority owner of a large number of separately incorporated subsidiaries.
The subsidiaries produced various types of steel products and also included service centers, trading companies,
an electric power company, etc. ILVA together with its subsidiaries constituted the ILVA Group. The ILVA Group was
owned by the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (``IRI''), a holding company wholly-owned by the GOI. 

As of January 1, 1994, ILVA entered into liquidation and its divisions formed three companies. ILVA's former Specialty
Steels Division is now a separately incorporated company, Acciai Speciali Terni, which produces electrical steel.




Spin-Offs 



ILVA sold several ``productive units,'' as defined in the General Issues Appendix to the Final Affirmative Countervailing
Duty Determination: Certain Steel Products from Austria (``GIA''), 58 FR 37225, 37265-8 (July 9, 1993), from
1990 through 1992. At verification, we established that one of the companies had been sold to a government entity and
one other company had been sold by Italsider rather than ILVA. Our spin-off methodology does not apply in these situations.
For the other companies, 

i.e., 

those sold to private parties, we have applied the pass-through methodology described in the GIA to calculate the
proportion of subsidies received by ILVA that ``left'' the company as a result of the sales of these productive units.




Period of Investigation 



For purposes of this final determination, the period for which we are measuring subsidies (the period of investigation
(``POI'')) is calendar year 1992. We have calculated the amount of subsidies bestowed on the subject merchandise
by cumulating benefits provided to Terni, TAS and ILVA from 1978 through 1992. 



Analysis of Programs 



Based on our analysis of the petition, the responses to our questionnaires, verification, and comments by interested
parties, we determine the following.

Equityworthiness 



Pursuant to section 355.44(e)(1) of the Proposed Regulations (Countervailing Duties; Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
and Request for Public Comments (``Proposed Regulations''), 54 FR 23366, May 31, 1989), we preliminarily determined
that Terni, TAS, and ILVA were unequityworthy from 1978 through 1992, except in 1979, 1983, 1988, and 1989 when equity
infusions were not an issue. From the perspective of a reasonable private investor examining the firm at the time of
the equity infusions, neither Terni, TAS, nor ILVA showed an ability to earn a reasonable rate of return over a reasonable
period of time. We did not learn anything at verification that would lead us to reverse this finding. 

As we stated in the preliminary determination, the companies which were restructured to form ILVA sustained losses
from 1978 onward. Although ILVA had a brief period of operating profits for 1989 through 1991, its return on equity
during this period declined until there was a negative return. Terni and ILVA's debt to equity ratios were relatively
high. Read in conjunction with other financial indicators, such as net losses for numerous years, negative rates
of return on equity and sales, the companies' financial performance was weak. Given this, we continue to find that
Terni, TAS, and ILVA were unequityworthy from 1978 through 1992. Because the companies received no equity infusions
during 1979, 1983, 1989, and 1990, we did not determine equityworthiness for those years. (See also Memorandum to
Director of Accounting dated April 11, 1994 on file in Room B-099 of the Main Commerce Building concerning the
Department's evaluation of Terni's, TAS', and ILVA's equityworthiness.)

For the preliminary determination, we did not include 1988 in our equityworthy analysis because petitioners did
not allege an infusion had occurred in that year and we were not aware of any such investment. However, in our review
of ILVA's annual reports at verification, we learned that IRI contributed capital to ILVA in 1988 in the form of an equity
infusion. Therefore, in accordance with  355.44(e)(2) of the Proposed Regulations, we have considered whether
ILVA was equityworthy in that year to determine whether the equity infusion was made on terms inconsistent with commercial
considerations. As explained below, we have determined that ILVA was not equityworthy in that year. 



Creditworthiness 



Pursuant to section 355.44(b)(6)(i) of the Proposed Regulations, we preliminarily determined that Terni, TAS,
and ILVA were uncreditworthy, 

i.e., 

that they did not have sufficient revenues or resources to meet their costs and fixed financial obligations, from
1978 through 1992. In making that determination, we examined Terni's, TAS', and ILVA's current, quick, times interest
earned and debt to equity ratios. We determined, for example, that the companies' times interest earned ratios were
anemic for approximately 16 years, indicating a weak long-term solvency. Furthermore, the debt to equity ratios
for both Terni and ILVA were relatively high.
We did not learn anything at verification that would lead us to reconsider our preliminary determination. Therefore,
we continue to find that Terni, TAS, and ILVA were uncreditworthy from 1978 through 1992. (See also Memorandum to Director
of Accounting dated April 11, 1994, on file in Room B-099 of the Main Commerce Building concerning the Department's
evaluation of Terni's, TAS', and ILVA's creditworthiness.) 



Benchmarks and Discount Rates 



For uncreditworthy companies,  355.44(b)(6)(iv)(A)(1) of the Proposed Regulations directs us to use, as
the benchmark interest rate, the highest long-term fixed interest rate commonly available to firms in the country
plus an amount equal to 12 percent of the prime rate. Because we were unable to obtain information on the highest long-term
interest rate commonly available in the country, we used the Bank of Italy reference rate which is the highest average
long-term fixed interest rate we were able to verify. We then added to this rate an amount equal to 12 percent of the Italian
Bankers Association (``ABI'') prime rate. We have used the resulting interest rate as the benchmark for our long-term
loans. In calculations where we have not used this rate, we have otherwise indicated. We have also used this amount
as the discount rate for allocating over time the benefit from equity infusions and non-recurring grants for the same
reasons explained in Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Steel Products From Spain,
58 FR 37374, 37376 (July 9, 1993).

Calculation Methodology 



In determining the benefits to the subject merchandise from the programs described below, we used the following calculation
methodology. We first calculated the benefit attributable to the POI for each countervailable program, using the
methodologies described in each program section below. For those subsidies received by ILVA that were allocated
over time, we then performed the pass-through analysis discussed in the GIA at 37269. The pass-through analysis accounts
for any reduction in ILVA's subsidies that resulted from the sale of several productive units. 

For the subsidies remaining with ILVA, we divided the benefit allocable to the POI by the sales of ILVA or the sales of
the Specialty Steels Division of ILVA, depending on which company had received the benefit. (The program sections
below indicate which denominator has been used for each program.) Next, we added the benefits for all programs, including
the benefits for programs which were not allocated over time, to arrive at ILVA's total subsidy rate. Because ILVA
is the only respondent company in this investigation, this rate equals the country-wide rate. 



I. Programs Determined To Be Countervailable 



A. Benefits Associated With the 1988-90 Restructuring 



As discussed above under the ``Corporate History'' section of this notice, the GOI liquidated Finsider and its main
operating companies in 1988 and assembled the group's most productive assets into a new operating company, ILVA.
In 1990, additional assets and liabilities of TAS, Italsider, and Finsider went to ILVA. 

In the preliminary determination, we found that a countervailable benefit was provided to ILVA through the 1988-1990
restructuring. In reaching this determination, we did not look at the transformation of Finsider as a whole into ILVA.
Instead, we focused on the restructuring of TAS into the Specialty Steels Division of ILVA. We found that although
TAS' net worth was negative prior to the restructuring, ILVA received a division with assets in excess of liabilities.
In effect, TAS' balance sheet was rewritten so as to change its equity from negative 99,886 million lire to positive
317,836 million lire. For the preliminary determination, we treated the difference (417,722 million lire) as a countervailable
benefit to ILVA. 

We have reconsidered the methodology employed in the preliminary determination and have revised it for the final
determination. We now believe that the approach taken in the preliminary determination understated the benefit
to ILVA from the restructuring. It failed to take into account a portion of the liabilities not assumed by ILVA, that
would otherwise have had to be repaid, and the losses incurred by TAS in connection with a write down of its assets in
the restructuring process. 

The purpose of the 1988-90 restructuring was to create a new, viable steel company (ILVA) by having it take over
most of the productive assets of Finsider's operating companies like TAS, but only some of the liabilities. In April
1990, after all of TAS' manufacturing activities had either been transferred or shut down, TAS was nothing but a shell
company in the process of liquidation, with liabilities exceeding its assets. ILVA, on the other hand, had received
most of TAS' assets without being burdened by TAS' liabilities. 

The liabilities remaining with TAS through the restructuring process had to be repaid, assumed, or forgiven. We have
identified one specific instance of forgiveness. This occurred in 1989 when Finsider forgave 99,886 million lire
of debt owed to it by TAS. Even with this forgiveness, TAS retained a substantial amount of liabilities after the 1990
transfer of assets and liabilities to ILVA. While no specific act eliminated this debt_indeed some of it is still outstanding_we
believe that ILVA (and consequently the subject merchandise) received a benefit as a result of the debt being left
behind in TAS. 

In addition, we learned at verification that losses had been left behind in TAS, because the value of the assets transferred
to ILVA had been written down. TAS gave up assets whose book value was higher than their appraised value. As a result,
TAS was forced to absorb losses. The loss from the first transfer was reflected as an extraordinary loss in TAS' 1988
Annual Report. With respect to the 1990 transfer, TAS had created a reserve in 1989 for the anticipated loss. At verification,
we found that this loss was included in the liabilities that were left in TAS after the 1990 transfer. 

In summary, in restructuring TAS into the Specialty Steels Division of ILVA, liabilities and losses due to asset write
downs were left behind in TAS, a shell company. Although there was only one specific act of debt forgiveness, which
only covered a portion of the liabilities in TAS, we believe that ILVA received a benefit when it was able to leave the
debt and losses remaining in TAS. Because this benefit was specific to ILVA, we find a countervailable subsidy to ILVA
in the amount of the debt and losses that should have been taken by ILVA when it took on the assets of TAS.

Treating these liabilities and losses as a subsidy to ILVA is consistent with the Department's determination in Certain
Steel from Austria at 37221. In that case, we examined a government-owned operating company (VAAG) which was split
up into numerous operating companies, one of which was subject to the investigation. In order to effect this split-up,
the assets and liabilities of the original company were divided among the new companies. We determined that the creation
of the new companies was merely a redistribution of existing assets which, in and of itself, did not give rise to any
benefits. However, we also determined that a benefit arose because losses that had been incurred by VAAG were not distributed
to the new companies. Therefore, we determined that the company under investigation effectively received a grant
in the amount of the losses that should have been distributed to it.
 
Similarly, in the case of TAS and ILVA, the transfer of assets to ILVA is, in itself, a redistribution of assets which
does not give rise to subsidies. However, a substantial portion of the liabilities and the losses associated with
the assets were not distributed to ILVA. Instead, they remained behind in TAS. We are countervailing these amounts
as grants to ILVA. 

To calculate the benefit during the POI, we used our standard grant methodology (see section 355.49(b) of the Proposed
Regulations). Finsider's 1989 forgiveness of TAS' debt and the loss resulting from the 1989 write down were treated
as grants received in 1989. The second asset write down and the debt outstanding after the 1990 transfer (adjusted
as described below) were treated as grants received in 1990. 

After the 1990 transfer, certain non-operating assets (

e.g.,

 land, buildings, inventories), remained in TAS. These assets are being disposed of in the liquidation process and
the proceeds from the sale of the assets are available to pay off TAS' remaining liabilities. 

In order to account for the fact that certain assets were left behind in TAS, we have adjusted the amount of liabilities
outstanding after the 1990 transfer. We did this by writing down the value of the assets by taking a weighted average
of the earlier write downs and subtracted this amount from the outstanding liabilities. 

We then divided the benefits by ILVA's sales in the POI. On this basis, we determine the estimated net subsidy to be 12.10


ad valorem 

for all manufacturers, producers, and exporters in Italy of the subject merchandise. 



B. Interest-Free Loans to ILVA 



In 1992, ILVA received a 300 billion lire payment from IRI. At verification, we reviewed documents which established
this payment as a ``provisional'' or ``anticipated'' capital increase. The reason that the payment was provisional
was that before it could be considered as an equity infusion, authorization was needed from: (1) The shareholders,
and (2) the EC. 

IRI clearly intended that the money become share capital, as there were no arrangements for repayment (

e.g.,

 a repayment schedule), nor was interest to be paid. Therefore, as IRI was the sole shareholder in ILVA, its approval
was a formality and the only real condition was the EC approval. If the EC approval was not received, the amount would
have to be repaid to IRI. Although the GOI asked for the EC's approval, it was not granted during the POI. 

ILVA's 1992 Annual Report shows that the company received a similar payment from IRI in 1991 which was entered in its
accounting records in the same way as the 300 billion payment received in 1992. At verification, we learned that the
background to the 1991 payment was the same as for the 1992 payment. 

Because these payments were not converted to equity prior to the end of the POI, we cannot find the payments to be equity
infusions. Thus, we have determined to treat the payments as short-term interest-free loans, which are being rolled
over until such time as they are repaid or converted to equity upon EC approval. 

The typical maturity in Italy for short-term loans is at most six months and roll-overs are common. In accordance with
 355.44(b)(3)(i) of the Proposed Regulations, we used the 1992 International Monetary Fund's annualized
``lending rate,'' converted to a semi-annual interest rate as the short-term benchmark interest rate. Since ILVA
paid zero interest, the benefit to ILVA was the interest it would have owed on both payments. These benefits were then
divided by ILVA's sales in the POI. On this basis, we determine the estimated net subsidy to be 0.49 percent 

ad valorem 

for all manufacturers, producers, and exporters in Italy of the subject merchandise.

C. Equity Infusions 


The GOI, through IRI, provided new equity capital to Terni, TAS, or ILVA in every year from 1978 through 1991, except
in 1979, 1983, 1989, and 1990. Respondents have not provided any argument refuting our preliminary determination
that the GOI's equity investments were provided specifically to the steel industry. 
As discussed above, we have determined that Terni, TAS, and ILVA were unequityworthy in each year that they received
new equity capital. Therefore, these provisions of equity were inconsistent with commercial considerations and
are countervailable. 
To calculate the benefit for the POI, we treated each of the equity amounts as a grant and allocated the benefits over
a 15-year period. (Our treatment of equity as grants and our choice of allocation period is discussed in the GIA, at
37239 and 37225, respectively.) 
In the preliminary determination, we treated a capital increase received by ILVA in the amount of 205,097 million
lire in 1990 as a countervailable equity infusion because ILVA reported it as an equity infusion in its responses.
At verification, we established that the amount reported as an equity infusion was, in fact, due to the transfer of
residual assets from Italsider, TAS, and Finsider, which were all in liquidation. As explained in connection with
the 1988-1990 restructuring, we do not consider the transfer of assets in connection with a restructuring to
be an ``equity infusion'' since the transfer merely redistributes existing assets. Therefore, we have excluded
the amount of this capital contribution from our calculations. 
For the equity infusions provided to Terni and TAS, we have divided the benefit allocated to the POI by the sales of the
Specialty Steels Division of ILVA. We chose this sales denominator because this division most closely resembles
the former companies, Terni and TAS. For equity infusions into ILVA, we used ILVA's sales as our denominator, as benefits
from these investments are not tied to any division of ILVA. On this basis, we find the estimated net subsidy to be 9.71
percent 

ad valorem 

for all manufacturers, producers, and exporters in Italy of the subject merchandise. 


D. The Transfer of Lovere and Trieste to Terni in 1982 


As discussed in the ``Corporate History'' section of this notice, Lovere and Trieste were transferred from Italsider
to Terni as part of a 1982 restructuring. 
We have determined that this transaction is correctly characterized as an internal corporate restructuring. No
new equity capital was provided to Terni through the transfer of these assets. However, just as subsidies given to
Terni and TAS continued to bestow a benefit on ILVA when ILVA received TAS' assets, subsidies received by Italsider
flowed to Terni when Terni received Lovere and Trieste. 
We determined the amount of Italsider's subsidies attributable to Lovere and Trieste by calculating the percentage
of assets these two companies represented of the total Italsider assets. We applied this percentage to the ``untied''
subsidies received by Italsider to calculate the portion of the benefit that flowed to Terni when it received Lovere
and Trieste. 
The benefit allocated to the POI was divided by the total sales of the Specialty Steels Division of ILVA. On this basis,
we find the estimated net subsidy to be 0.41 percent 

ad valorem 

for all manufacturers, producers, and exporters in Italy of the subject merchandise. 


E. Law 675/77 Preferential Financing 


Law 675/77 was designed to bring industrial assistance measures from the GOI under a single system. The program had
at its core three main objectives: (1) the reorganization and development of the industrial sector as a whole; (2)
the increase of employment in the South; and (3) the promotion of employment in depressed areas. To achieve these goals,
Law 675/77 provided six types of benefits: (1) grants to pay interest on bank loans; (2) mortgage loans provided by
the Ministry of Industry (``MOI'') at subsidized interest rates; (3) other grants to pay interest on loans financed
by IRI bond issues; (4) capital grants for the South; (5) VAT reductions on capital good purchases for companies in
the South; and (6) personnel retraining grants. (The fourth, fifth, and sixth components of Law 675/77 are discussed

As we stated in our preliminary determination, the GOI identified a number of different sectors as having received
benefits under Law 675/77. These sectors were: (1) Electronic technology; (2) the mechanical instruments industry;
(3) the agro-food industry; (4) the chemical industry; (5) the steel industry; (6) the pulp and paper industry; (7)
the fashion sector; (8) the automobile industry; and (9) the aviation sector. Law 675/77 also sought to promote optimal
exploitation of energy resources, and ecological and environmental recovery. 
Despite the fact that Law 675/77 benefits were available to and used by numerous and varied industries, we preliminarily
determined Law 675/77 benefits specific within the meaning of section 771(5)(A)(ii) of the Act, and therefore, countervailable
because the steel industry was a dominant user pursuant to section 355.43(b)(2)(iii) of the Proposed Regulations.
It received 34 percent of the benefits provided under the interest subsidy and capital grant components of the program.

The GOI has argued that the steel and automobile industries did not receive a disproportionate share of benefits when
the extent of investment in those industries is compared to the extent of investment in other industries. We did not
consider the level of investment in the industries receiving benefits under Law 675/77. Instead, we followed the
policy explained in Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Steel Products from Brazil,
58 FR 37295, 37295 (July 9, 1993), of comparing the share of benefits received by the steel industry to the collective
share of benefits provided to other users of the program. Consistent with our determination in Final Affirmative
Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Steel Products from Italy (``Certain Steel from Italy''), 58 FR 37327
(July 9, 1993), we found that the steel industry accounted for 34 percent of the benefits and the auto industry accounted
for 33 percent of the benefits. Thus, these two industries represented 77 percent of the assistance while the remainder
was spread among the other seven industries. 
On this basis, we determine that the steel industry was a dominant user of programs under Law 675/77 and, therefore,
that benefits received by ILVA under this law are being provided to a specific enterprise or industry or group of enterprises
or industries. Therefore, we find Law 675/77 financing to be countervailable to the extent that it is provided on terms
inconsistent with commercial considerations. 


1. Grants to Pay Interest on Bank Loans 


Italian commercial banks provided long-term loans at market interest rates to industries designated under Law 675/77.
The interest owed by the recipient companies on these loans was offset by contributions from the GOI. Terni received
bank loans with Law 675/77 interest contributions which were outstanding in the POI. 
To determine whether this assistance conferred a benefit, we compared the effective interest rate paid on these loans
to the benchmark interest rate, described above. Based on this comparison, we determine that the financing provided
under this program is inconsistent with commercial considerations, 

i.e., 

on terms more favorable than the benchmark financing. 
Because Terni knew that it would receive the interest contributions when it obtained the loans, we consider the contributions
to constitute reductions in the interest rates charged rather than grants (see Certain Steel from Italy at 37331).

Therefore, to calculate the benefit, we used our standard long-term loan methodology as described in  355.49(c)(1)
of the Proposed Regulations. We divided the benefit allocated to the POI by the sales of the Specialty Steels Division
of ILVA. On this basis, we determine the estimated net subsidy to be 0.03 percent 

ad valorem 

for all manufacturers, producers, and exporters in Italy of the subject merchandise. 
2. Mortgage Loans from the Ministry of Industry 
Under Law 675/77, companies could obtain long-term low-interest mortgage loans from the Ministry of Industry. Terni
received several loans which were still outstanding in the POI. 
To determine whether these loans were provided on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations, we used the
benchmark interest rates described above. Because the interest rates paid on the Law 675/77 loans were below the benchmark
interest rates, we determine that loans provided under this program are countervailable.

We calculated the benefit using our standard long-term loan methodology. We then divided the benefit allocated to
the POI by the sales of the Specialty Steels Division of ILVA. On this basis, we determine the estimated net subsidy
from this program to be 0.30 percent 

ad valorem 

for all manufacturers, producers, and exporters in Italy of the subject merchandise. 


3. Interest Contributions on IRI Loans/Bond Issues 




Under Law 675/77, IRI was allowed to issue bonds to finance restructuring measures of companies within the IRI Group.
The proceeds from the sale of the bonds were then re-lent to IRI companies. The effective interest rate on such loans
was reduced by interest contributions made by the GOI. Terni had two of these loans outstanding during the POI. Both
loans had variable interest rates. 
To determine whether these loans were countervailable, the Department used a long-term variable rate benchmark
as described in  355.44(B) of the Proposed Regulations. We compared this benchmark rate to the effective rates
paid by Terni in the years these loans were taken out and found that these loans were provided on terms inconsistent
with commercial considerations. 
To determine the benefit, we first calculated the difference between what was paid on these loans during the POI and
what would have been paid during the POI had the loans been provided on commercial terms. We divided the resulting difference
by the sales of the Specialty Steels Division of ILVA. On this basis, we determine the estimated net subsidy from this
program to be 0.26 percent 

ad valorem 

for all manufacturers, producers, and exporters in Italy of the subject merchandise. 


F. Urban Redevelopment Financing Under Law 181/89 


Law 181/89 was implemented to ease the impact of employment reductions in the steel crisis areas of Naples, Taranto,
Terni, and Genoa. The program had four main components: (1) reindustrialization projects; (2) job promotion; (3)
training; and (4) early retirement. (Early retirement under Law 181/89 was not used by ILVA and the job promotion component
has been found not countervailable (see relevant sections below). 
Because benefits under this program are limited to specific regions, we determine that assistance under this program
is limited to a group of industries in accordance with section 355.43(b)(3). 


1. Reindustrialization Under Law 181/89 


Under the reindustrialization component of Law 181/89, the GOI partially subsidized certain investments. ILVA
received payments under Law 181/89 for a training center to update the technical skills of its workers. Training also
took place at this center to improve workers' skills for employment outside the steel industry. 
Since the information provided to the Department indicates that the center supported the training of steel workers
who continued to be employed by ILVA, we determine that ILVA received a benefit from reindustrialization payments
under Law 181/89. 
In addition, we established that ILVA received payments under Law 181/89 for service centers. However, these service
centers were involved in steel processing unrelated to electrical steel. Therefore, payments to these service centers
were not included in our calculations. 
To calculate the benefit to ILVA during the POI, we used our standard grant methodology (see  355.49(b) of the
Proposed Regulations) and the discount rate described above. It is the Department's practice to treat training benefits
as recurring grants (see GIA at 37226). 

Accordingly, we divided the amount received in the POI by the 1992 sales of the ILVA. On this basis, we determine the
estimated net subsidy to be 0.00 percent 

ad valorem 

for all manufacturers, producers, and exporters on Italy of the subject merchandise. 


2. Worker Training 


Retraining grants were provided to ILVA under Law 181/89. These funds constituted the GOI's matching contribution
to ECSC Article 56(2)(b) training grants (see ECSC Article 56 Redeployment Aid section below).

<TEXT>
 

Since information provided at verification indicates that these funds were used to train workers remaining at ILVA,
we determine that the GOI's training contribution under Law 181/89 constitutes a benefit to ILVA. 
It is the Department's practice to treat training benefits as recurring grants (see GIA at 37226). Accordingly, we
divided the amount received by the sales of the Specialty Steels Division of ILVA. On this basis, we determine the estimated
net subsidy from this program to be 0.10 percent 

ad valorem

 for all manufacturers, producers, and exporters in Italy of the subject merchandise. 


G. ECSC Article 54 Loans 


Under Article 54 of the 1951 ECSC Treaty, the European Commission can provide loans directly to iron and steel companies
for modernization and the purchase of new equipment. The loans finance up to 50 percent of an investment project. The
remaining financing needs must be met from other sources. The Article 54 loan program is financed by loans taken by
the Commission, which are then re-lent to iron and steel companies in the member states at a slightly higher interest
rate than that at which the Commission obtained them. 
ILVA had outstanding Article 54 loans in the POI. These loans were transferred to ILVA as part of the partial transfer
of Terni's assets and liabilities in 1989. Two of these loans were denominated in U.S. dollars and two in European Currency
Units (``ECU''). 
Because Article 54 loans are limited to iron and steel companies, we find these loans to be specific and, therefore,
countervailable to the extent that they were provided on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations. 
Because these loans were denominated in foreign currencies, we used foreign currency benchmarks for our preliminary
determination. However, the Article 54 loans had exchange rate guarantees that allowed Terni to calculate the maximum
lire amount payable (

see

 Law 796/76 Exchange Rate Guarantee Program described below). Since these loans were effectively insulated from
any future changes in the exchange rate, we are not using foreign currency benchmark interest rates as we did in the
preliminary determination. Rather we are using the uncreditworthy benchmark discussed in the 

Benchmark and Discount Rate

 section above. 
At verification we found that one of the U.S. dollar loans had been assumed by Terni when it became the parent company
of the original debtor. We are using the uncreditworthy benchmark interest rate for the year in which the loan was assumed
by Terni in order to calculate the benefit from this loan, as that was the year in which Terni incurred the liability.

Because the interest rates paid on all the Article 54 loans were below the benchmark interest rates, we determine that
the loans provided under this program are countervailable. We calculated the benefit using our standard long-term
loan methodology. We then divided the benefit allocated to the POI by the sales made by the Specialty Steels Division
of ILVA. On this basis, we determine the estimated net subsidy to be 1.02 percent 

ad valorem

 for all manufacturers, producers, and exporters in Italy of the subject merchandise. 


II. Programs Determined To Be Not Countervailable 


A. Early Retirement 


In Certain Steel from Italy, we determined that the threat of strikes and social unrest prevented Italian steel companies
from laying off surplus labor. As a result, these companies were effectively obligated to retain their workers until
the workers reached retirement age. Given this obligation, when the GOI created a program to allow for early retirement,
we determined that the steel companies had been relieved of the burden of retaining these employees at full salary
until the normal retirement age. 
In the preliminary determination of this investigation, we relied on Certain Steel from Italy and determined that
early retirement provided a countervailable benefit which we measured as the savings to ILVA arising from not having
to pay wages to the workers who took early retirement in the POI. 
At verification in this case, the GOI provided evidence showing that companies in Italy have the legal right to fire
workers. Small companies (those with less than 15 employees) could simply eliminate surplus workers. Large companies,
however, go through certain steps and procedures before they can lay workers off (other than for cause). The procedures
and the benefits paid to employees laid off by these companies are provided for in Law 223/91.

<PARENT> FR940418-2-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Law 223/91 provides two means of removing surplus workers: early retirement and lay-offs under CIG-S. 


1. Early Retirement 


Early retirement is regulated in two separate articles of Law 223/91, both of which were used by ILVA workers in the
POI. Each article has different eligibility criteria, but essentially the program is available to companies in high-technologies
and competitive industries that are undergoing restructuring. Under both articles, the companies pay 30 percent
of the early retirement benefits, while the GOI pays the rest. The GOI sets an annual cap on the number of workers that
can be retired under this provision. In 1992, 21 percent of the quota was set aside for steel workers. 


2. CIG-S 


CIG-S (the extraordinary compensation fund) is also regulated by Law 223/91. CIG-S provides for lay-offs
by companies that (1) are undergoing restructuring, (2) have more than 15 employees, and (3) belong to a wide range
of industries. The GOI must approve use of this program, under which laid-off workers receive a certain percentage
of their wages for three years. Thereafter, they may receive further compensation under a follow-up program (mobility).
The GOI pays 80 percent and the companies 20 percent of the benefits. 
In a meeting with a U.S. Embassy official at verification, we learned that approximately 25 percent of the Italian
workforce is employed in companies eligible for the provisions under Law 223/91. The remaining 75 percent work for
companies that do not have to offer their employees any benefits upon separation except the obligatory severance
payment that is also paid to workers who take early retirement or are placed on the CIG-S. Employees in these smaller
companies who are laid off receive only government-provided unemployment compensation. 
ILVA, on the other hand, belongs to that category of companies (larger companies in structural and economic crisis),
that have to undertake certain specific steps before actually getting rid of surplus labor. Therefore, the alternatives
facing ILVA are early retirement and the permanent lay offs under CIG-S, provided under Law 223/91. 
In determining whether worker benefits such as early retirement confer a subsidy on the company, we look to whether
the company has been relieved of an obligation it would otherwise incur. (See section 355.44(j) of the Proposed Regulations.)
In this instance, we find that, in the absence of the early retirement program, the obligation that would be incurred
is that imposed by the alternative available to ILVA, the CIG-S program. We have found that large companies in
a wide variety of industries that are undergoing restructuring can use the CIG-S program to lay off workers.
Therefore, we believe that this program establishes the benchmark for the obligations ILVA would otherwise have
towards the workers it retires early. 
Based on the information we have received, we have not been able to make an exact comparison of the financial obligations
ILVA would incur under CIG-S as opposed to the early retirement scheme. Because the benefits paid to a worker
under early retirement can extend from one to more than ten years (whereas CIG-S payments are limited to three
years) and because the percentage paid by the company is based on different amounts (the worker's pension, which varies
from worker to worker, for early retirement and the worker's salary for CIG-S), we are doubtful that exact comparisons
can be made. However, we have used the information we have and made certain limited assumptions to calculate the financial
obligations on ILVA imposed by early retirement exceed the financial obligations that would be imposed by CIG-S.
(See Memorandum from Team to Barbara R. Stafford dated April 11, 1994 on file in room B-099 of the main Commerce
Building.) Therefore, we find that the early retirement program is not countervailable. 


B. Law 796/76 Exchange Rate Guarantee Program

<PARENT> FR940418-2-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

This program applies to foreign currency loans taken out by Italian companies. Under the program, repayment amounts
are calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect at the time the loan is taken out. If the exchange rate changes
over time, the program sets a ceiling and a floor to limit the effect of the exchange rate change on the borrower. For
example, if the lire depreciates five percent against the DM (the currency in which the loan is taken out), borrowers
would normally find that they would have to repay five percent more (in lire terms). However, under the Exchange Rate
Guarantee Program, the ceiling would act to limit the increased repayment amount to two percent. There is also a floor
in the program which would apply if the lire appreciated against the DM. The floor would limit any windfall to the borrower.

In the preliminary determination (as in Certain Steel), we found this program to be 

de jure

 specific because we believed the program was limited to ECSC loans. However, we discovered at the verification in
this investigation that we had overlooked information in the response which indicated that guarantees under this
program were also available for loans made by the Council of Europe Resettlement Fund (``CER''). We attempted to learn
more about the program's 

de facto

 specificity at verification as it became clear that the program was not 

de jure

 specific. 
We established that exchange rate guarantees for CER loans are provided for in Law 796, the same law that provides guarantees
for ECSC loans. We learned that CER loans are designed to improve social conditions in the weakest sectors of society
by providing loans to small- and medium-sized businesses to create employment opportunities. Officials named the
following examples of areas/activities that receive funds from the CER: agriculture, handicraft, tourism. We examined
certain loan documents and established that guarantees were in effect on CER loans. However, given the limited time
and the manner in which the data were organized, Italian officials were not able to provide information regarding
the distribution of benefits provided to CER and ECSC borrowers. 
Based on the information we have, the exchange risk guarantees may be non-specific. Moreover, we cannot draw adverse
inferences regarding the distribution of benefits under the program because the GOI was not uncooperative or otherwise
remiss in providing the requested data. Therefore, we determine that the program is not countervailable. 
Given the circumstances under which we have reached this determination, 

i.e.,

 lacking certain important information, this finding of non-countervailability will not carry over to future investigations.
Therefore, until a fuller record is developed which allows us to undertake a thorough analysis, petitioners will
not have to provide new evidence in order for us to investigate this program. In addition, we intend to reinvestigate
this program in the first administrative review requested should this investigation result in a countervailing
duty order. 


C. Finsider Loan Guarantees 


Certain loans made to Terni were assumed by ILVA, and were still outstanding during the POI. At the time the loans were
taken out they were guaranteed by Finsider, the holding company of Terni and then TAS. Finsider entered into liquidation
in 1988. Nevertheless, ILVA continued to pay the guarantee fees for these loans to Finsider until 1991. At that time,
ILVA ceased to pay guarantee fees to Finsider and, in essence, ``self-guaranteed'' these loans. 
Petitioners argue that the Department should countervail these loan guarantees because: (1) The fees paid for the
guarantees were less than what would have been paid to a commercial guarantor; and (2) guarantees to Terni, an uncreditworthy
company, constitute government intervention ensuring the extension of the loans.

<DOCNO> FR940418-2-00017 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940418-2-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Although information obtained at verification indicates that ILVA paid Finsider less than it would have paid a commercial
guarantor, we have concluded that ILVA received no benefit. Given that Finsider was in liquidation and presumably
could not have carried out the guarantee, ILVA was receiving nothing in exchange for its payments. Therefore, we find
that these loan guarantees are not countervailable. 



D. Interest Grants for ``Indirect Debts'' Under Law 750/81 



At verification, we established that Law 750/81 was passed as a result of the 1981 Iron and Steel plan to provide interest
grants to sectors within the steel industry which were designated as strategic sectors. The program was in place from
1981 through 1983. 

One of the sectors designated as a strategic sector was forgings and castings, as these steel products were used in
the construction of electrical power plants. Since Terni was the only producer of this type of forgings and castings,
the GOI provided assistance to Terni to allow it to reach full production capacity. 

Because these benefits were provided for the production of forgings and castings, we determine that they do not provide
a benefit to the subject merchandise. 



E. ECSC Article 56 Redeployment Aid 



Under Article 56(2)(b) of the ECSC Treaty, redeployment assistance is provided to workers affected by the restructuring
of the coal and steel industries in the ECSC member states. The assistance consists of the following types of grants:
(1) Income support grants for workers affected by unemployment, re-employment at a lower salary or early retirement;
(2) grants to enable companies to continue paying workers who have been laid off temporarily; (3) vocational training
grants; and (4) resettlement grants. The decision to grant Article 56 assistance is contingent upon a matching contribution
from the member state. 

The portion of Article 56 redeployment grants funded by the ECSC comes from the European Commission's operational
budget for the ECSC steel program. This budget is funded by (1) levies imposed on coal and steel producers in the member
countries; (2) income from ECSC's investments; (3) guarantee fees and fines paid to the ECSC; and (4) interest received
from companies that have obtained loans from the ECSC. 

Because payments from the ECSC under Article 56 are sourced from producer levies, we find them to be not countervailable
(see Certain Steel from Italy at 37336). (The matching contributions from the GOI for the training elements of Article
56 were discussed above under Law 181/89.)

F. European Social Fund (``ESF'') Grants 



The ESF was established by the 1957 European Economic Community Treaty to increase employment and help raise the living
standards of workers. 

We found in Certain Steel from Italy that the ESF receives its funds from the EC's general budget, whose main revenue
sources are customs duties, agricultural levies, value-added taxes collected by the member states, and other member
state contributions. 

The member states are responsible for selecting the projects to be funded by the EC. The EC then disburses the grants
to the member states which manage the funds and implement the projects. According to the EC, ESF grants are available
to (1) people over 25 who have been unemployed for more than 12 months; (2) people under 25 who have reached the minimum
school-leaving age and who are seeking a job; and (3) certain workers in rural areas and regions characterized by industrial
decline or lagging development. 

ESF grants received by Italy were used for two purposes: (1) training laid-off employees for jobs outside the sector
in which they had previously been working; and (2) training of workers to perform new jobs within the same company.


Every region in Italy has received ESF funds. Therefore, we determine that this program is not regionally specific
within the meaning of  355.43(b)(3) of the Proposed Regulations. Furthermore, we note that to the extent there
is any disproportionality in the regional distribution of ESF benefits (

i.e.

, to the regions of southern Italy), it has not resulted in a countervailable benefit to the production of the subject
merchandise, which is produced in northern Italy. 



G. Aid Under the National Research Plan 



In 1985, the Ministry for University, Technology and Scientific Research assigned 19 billion lire to Terni under
the National Research Plan for steel. The research funds covered costs of personnel assigned to specific research
projects in research laboratories. The research under this plan was contracted out to Terni as the result of a competitive
bidding process. 

At verification, we established that the assistance under the National Research Plan was provided under Law 46/82.
Under the same law, the GOI has supported similar research plans for 17 other industries or sectors. Moreover, documentation
provided by the GOI showed that the steel industry did not receive a disproportionate share of the funds provided for
research plans. 

Thus, we determine that benefits under the program are not limited to a specific enterprise or industry or group of
enterprises or industries. Therefore, we find this program to be not countervailable. 



H. Job Promotion Under Law 181/89 



The job promotion component of Law 181/89 involved a number of measures designed to promote self-employment among
workers in Naples, Taranto, Terni, and Genoa. These measures included, among others, assisting former workers in
starting their own businesses, providing specialized management training, and increasing the level of financing
available to new businesses. In general, these measures were coordinated by an IRI-owned company, Societa Finanziaria
di Promozione e Sviluppo Imprenditoriale. 

Based on the information provided at verification, we determine that the ``job promotion'' component of Law 181/89
provides for workers leaving the steel industry. Moreover, there is no indication that ILVA (or other companies in
Italy) had an obligation, legal or otherwise, to provide assistance to workers leaving the steel industry. Therefore,
we determine that ILVA did not receive a benefit from assistance provided under the job promotion component of Law
181/89. 



III. Programs Which Were Not Used or Which Did Not Benefit the Subject Merchandise in the POI 



A. We established at verification that the following programs were not used during the POI.

merchandise. 




1. Law 675/77 Capital Grants 
2. Reductions of the Value Added Tax (``VAT'') under Law 675/77 
3. Interest Contributions under the Sabatini Law (Law 1329/65) 
4. Social Security Exemptions 
5. ILOR and IRPEG Exemptions 


Interested Party Comments 


Comment 1 


Petitioners argue that the Department's preliminary decision to measure subsidization by a comparison of TAS' equity
before and after restructuring, which they labeled the ``snapshot'' approach, was improperly substituted for,
and contrasts sharply with, the cash flow approach the Department has historically used to measure subsidies. Petitioners
allege that by focusing only on the differences in TAS' balance sheet at two different points in time, to the exclusion
of a review of the intermediate activities undertaken by the GOI to bestow funds on ILVA, the Department ignored the
full measure of debt forgiveness and other assistance provided to ILVA. 

Petitioners also argue that the problem with the Department's approach is that it ignored the sizeable liabilities
and negative equity position left behind in the ``empty shell'' of TAS which were brought about by the restructuring
as a result of the artificial separation of TAS' assets and liabilities. Petitioners maintain the Department's approach
focuses exclusively on net changes in equity, regardless of the individual transactions that caused the changes
which would have been captured in a cash flow analysis. According to petitioners, the only way to accurately measure
the subsidies provided to Terni/TAS is to identify and measure the value of each individual transaction, be it a grant,
equity infusion, debt forgiveness, or loss coverage. 

Respondents contend that the Department should exclude from the calculation of any countervailable subsidy any
of the TAS assets transferred to ILVA or assets remaining in TAS. In addition, respondents argue that changes in TAS'
equity position resulting from the official appraisal of assets and liabilities conferred no countervailable benefit
to ILVA. Furthermore, according to respondents, assets and liabilities remaining in TAS could not have conferred
a countervailable benefit to ILVA. Finally, respondents argue that  355.48 of the Proposed Regulations explicitly
provides for a departure from the cash flow methodology in ``unusual circumstances.'' Respondents argue that it
would be unreasonable to review each of the transactions as suggested by petitioners because of the extreme complexity
of the transactions involved in this case. Respondents maintain the Department has performed a transaction-specific
analysis wherever practicable. 



DOC Position 



Insofar as our preliminary determination focused on the change in the net equity position of TAS, it failed to account
for certain liabilities and losses left behind in TAS. In this final determination, we have addressed this shortcoming.
We recognize that the restructuring resulted in TAS holding liabilities and absorbing losses, and that those liabilities
and losses would somehow have to be covered. As ILVA would not be covering them, ILVA received a benefit in that amount.


However, we disagree with petitioners that the so-called snapshot approach cannot be substituted for the cash flow
approach traditionally used by the Department. First, our approach in this final determination is consistent with
the methodology used to assess countervailable benefits arising out of restructuring in Certain Steel from Austria.
Second, it fully and accurately measures the benefits conferred on the production of the subject merchandise. Finally,
petitioners misuse the concept of the cash flow effect.

As explained above, in Certain Steel from Austria, when the company producing steel was restructured, we found that
a benefit to the new company arose because the new company did not receive any of the losses accumulated by the former
company. There was no specific act of payment or loss coverage undertaken by the Government of Austria to eliminate
those losses as part of the restructuring. Instead, the losses were simply left behind in the former company. In Certain
Steel from Austria, these losses left in the ``shell'' company were determined to be countervailable. 

Similarly, in the case of restructuring TAS into the Specialty Steels Division of ILVA, the liabilities and losses
left behind in TAS have been found to give rise to a benefit to ILVA. There was one specific act of debt forgiveness between
Finsider and TAS. That was accounted for in our calculations, but only as a part of the totality of the restructuring
action. 


We further believe that the snapshot approach has fully captured the benefit to the subject merchandise. Based primarily
on the annual reports of IRI, Finsider and TAS, petitioners have developed a long list of ``subsidies'' that include
IRI's forgiveness of Finsider's debt and numerous and varied forms of payments to TAS throughout and subsequent to
the restructuring. We have concluded that countervailing subsidies from IRI to Finsider and from Finsider to TAS
would lead to an overstatement of the benefit. (See DOC response to Comment 2.) 

With respect to the subsidies received by TAS after the second asset transfer to ILVA (e.g.,

 interest paid to TAS on its shares in ILVA, capital gain on real estate received by TAS, etc.), we recognize that these
payments did, in fact, reduce the liabilities in TAS. However, because we included in the restructuring benefit the
amount of liabilities remaining in TAS after the second transfer, we have already captured the benefits from these
subsidies. 

This is similar to the situation that occurred in Certain Steel from Austria. As discussed above, we treated as a subsidy
the amount of losses left behind in the former company, without regard to whether there was a specific act by the government
to cover those losses. In fact, the Government of Austria did make a payment a few years later to that company. Recognizing
that the second transaction was basically to clean up the company's books for an event that had occurred earlier (the
failure to transfer losses), we did not countervail the payment by the Government of Austria as it would have amounted
to double-counting. 

Finally, petitioners misuse the concept of cash flow effect when they argue that this concept prohibits us from using
a snapshot approach. Cash flow effects do not identify subsidies. Instead, the cash flow concept tells us when to assign
the benefit from a particular subsidy. For example, the cash flow concept tells us to assign the benefits received
from a subsidized loan to the point in time when the company would have made the interest payment because this is when
the company's cash flow is affected. In this case, the effect on ILVA of not assuming TAS' liabilities and losses occurred
when the assets were transferred, in 1989 and 1990, and we have assigned the benefits to these years. 



Comment 2 



Petitioners argue that the Department did not directly address the question of the benefit to the Finsider group as
a whole, and through the Finsider group to TAS, of a multi-billion lire debt forgiveness provided in connection with
the 1988/90 steel industry restructuring. The only debt forgiveness that was included in the Department's preliminary
calculations was the 99.9 billion lire in debt forgiveness provided to TAS. 

Petitioners claim that the Department should countervail a debt forgiveness in the amount of 6.2 trillion lire to
the Finsider Group in 1988 and allocate the resulting benefit over a sales denominator reflecting the scope of operations
of the Finsider companies that were liquidated and merged into ILVA. Moreover, petitioners argue that the Department
should countervail the 99.9 billion lire debt forgiveness provided specifically to TAS in 1989 as a separate benefit.


Respondents argue that petitioners have failed to establish that the forgiveness of Finsider's debt is tied to the
subject merchandise. Respondents argue that the 1988 debt forgiveness to Finsider pre-dates the restructuring
of Finsider into ILVA by nearly one year. Thus, Finsider at the time of the debt forgiveness was not the same company
as it was when its assets were transferred into ILVA. Respondents maintain that Finsider and TAS existed and functioned
as two separate corporate entities and, therefore, argue that TAS was never potentially responsible for the assumption
of Finsider's debt. Respondents assert that only the 99.9 billion lire debt forgiveness provided directly to TAS
should be treated as a countervailable debt forgiveness. 



DOC Position 



In the early stages of this investigation, it became clear to us that there were two alternative approaches to addressing
the allegations in the petition regarding subsidies to the producers of electrical steel. One approach would have
been to analyze the restructuring of the entire Finsider group into ILVA and to examine all subsidies provided to Finsider
by IRI and the GOI. Using this approach we would, in essence, be measuring subsidies provided to the Finsider group
as a whole. Therefore, we would not have allocated subsidies to any of the group's operating companies, such as TAS.


The second approach would measure the subsidies provided to the producer of the subject merchandise. In other words,
our analysis would focus on subsidies such as equity infusions, loans, and grants specifically provided to the producer
of the subject merchandise, 

i.e.,

 Terni/TAS and the Specialty Steels Division of ILVA.

<TEXT>
 

We chose the second approach for several reasons. First, it is the Department's policy to try to ``tie'' subsidies
to the subject merchandise whenever possible (see GIA at 37267). Second, since the Finsider group was very large,
consisting of numerous state-owned steel producers, only one of which produced the subject merchandise, we believed
it would be more appropriate to focus our analysis on the producer of the subject merchandise. Finally, due to the extremely
complex restructuring which occurred at the Finsider group level, we felt we would be able to more accurately measure
the subsidies provided to the producer of the subject merchandise by following the second approach. 

Petitioners have argued that the Department should countervail the subsidies emanating from the debt forgiveness
provided to Finsider. Petitioners also argue that we should countervail the 99.9 billion lire debt forgiveness provided
to TAS as well. However, countervailing both instances of debt forgiveness would overstate the benefit to TAS because
we would then be looking at the forgiveness from two different levels of analysis at the same time. As stated in the verification
reports, the 99.9 billion debt forgiveness to TAS was part of the larger debt forgiveness provided to Finsider. Therefore,
in order to be consistent with the approach chosen in this investigation, 

i.e.

, to focus on the producer of the subject merchandise, we are countervailing only the debt and loss forgiveness provided
to TAS. 




Comment 3 



Petitioners argue that the 300 billion lire payment from IRI to ILVA in 1992 should be countervailed as an equity infusion
and not as an interest-free loan. Petitioners maintain that this capital contribution in 1992 was called an ``interest
free loan'' because, at that time, it had not been expressly approved as an equity infusion. Also, petitioners point
to the fact that there was no loan agreement. Petitioners maintain that the Department should not base its decision
on ``technicalities'' such as the EC's delayed approval and the continued absence of a shareholders' decision approving
a capital increase. Petitioners conclude that since the Department determined at verification that the EC has recently
sanctioned this amount as an equity infusion, the Department should treat it as such. 

Petitioners also argue that the 10,900 million lire ``payment on capital account'' to ILVA in 1991, which the Department
found at verification, should be countervailed as an equity infusion. The nature of this payment was identical to
that of the 1992 payment. Respondents argue that the Department's verification confirmed that this 1992 infusion
was a liability as opposed to an equity infusion. Additionally, respondents state that there were two conditions
which had to be met before the 1992 capital contribution could be considered an equity infusion: (1) Authorization
from the EC; and (2) authorization from the company's shareholder. Neither of these two conditions was met during
the POI and the amount was considered a ``provisional capital increase.'' Thus, the Department properly recognized
the legal limitations placed on this fund and, treated it as a short-term loan. 

Respondents state that EC's preliminary approval of the capital contribution in 1993 did not occur until nearly a
year and a half after the POI. Citing Countervailing Duty Determinations: Certain Steel Products from France (``Certain
Steel from France''), 58 FR 37313 (July 9, 1993), respondents argue that it is the reclassification of debt into equity
which itself constitutes the potentially countervailable event in this case. According to respondents, since the
potentially countervailable event took place after the POI, it is not subject to analysis in this investigation.




DOC Position 



Based on an analysis of the primary features of the 1991 and 1992 provisional capital contributions, we find that the
potential obligation to repay IRI (in the event that the EC did not approve the capital contribution) effectively
makes these contributions contingent liabilities. To reflect their contingent nature, we have modelled the provisional
capital contributions as short-term zero-interest loans which are rolled over every six months until such time as
they are repaid or the EC approves their conversion to equity. 


We disagree with respondents that Certain Steel from France is applicable in this instance. In the French case, we
were looking at the year the debt-to-equity conversion occurred and decided that the equity infusion was the potentially
countervailable event rather than the loan. In this case, the provisional capital increase is being treated as a loan
throughout the POI. Therefore, there is no other potentially countervailable event in the POI. 

We disagree with petitioners that there must be a loan repayment schedule or payment of interest in order for the Department
to consider these payments to represent liabilities. The possibility of repayment was real. Therefore, the provisional
capital increase is properly treated as a loan.

Comment 4 



Petitioners argue that the scope of operations of the various entities that produce(d) electrical steel (

i.e., 

Terni, TAS, and the Specialty Steels Division of ILVA) has changed significantly over the years as a result of a series
of restructurings. Petitioners argue that since TAS was created during the 1987 restructuring out of the assets of
Terni, I.A.I. and Terninoss, Terni between 1978 and 1986 was not the same as the Specialty Steels Division of ILVA after
1989, which includes the assets of I.A.I. and Terninoss. According to petitioners, the Department must use a denominator
which represents the ability to generate sales at the time a subsidy was given. 

According to petitioners, the significant difference between 1986 sales of Terni and 1992 sales of ILVA's Specialty
Steels Division indicates that these two entities are similar in name only. Petitioners note that, in cases involving
a merger, it is the Department's practice to perform a ``tying analysis'' in order to measure the benefits to the entity
originally receiving the subsidy. Petitioners argue that since the 1987 restructuring of Terni cannot be separated
from the overall Finsider restructuring, the Department, as it did in the preliminary determination of Certain Steel
from Italy, should adjust ILVA's sales denominator in order to ``reflect steel activities prior its restructuring.''
According to petitioners, the Department should use the sales of ILVA's Specialty Steels Divisions Terni plant (plus
its share of intercompany sales) as the denominator for Terni-specific loans and grants, thereby excluding the stainless
steel activities of ILVA's Specialty Steels Division. 

Respondents argue that, since Terni's stainless steel producing subsidiaries (I.A.I. and Terninoss), and other
Terni assets were merely merged into a new entity, TAS, which subsequently became the Specialty Steels Division of
ILVA, the restructurings did not dramatically alter the entity producing the subject merchandise. As such, according
to respondents, the Department should reject suggestions that stainless steel sales be subtracted from the denominator.


Respondents further argue that the difference between Terni sales in 1986 and ILVA's Specialty Steels Division sales
in 1992 can be explained by increased activity in areas whose production capability was enhanced pursuant to restructuring.
Moreover, respondents argue that a company's sales cannot be expected to remain ``static'' as petitioners suggest.
Finally, respondents also argue that, according to the Department's ``pass-through'' methodology, the Department
should find that the price paid by TAS for I.A.I. and Terninoss represented the exchange of one ``subsidized'' asset
for another asset. 



DOC Position 



We disagree with petitioners that the 1987 restructuring was so fundamental that a comparison cannot be made between
Terni and the Specialty Steels Division of ILVA. We believe that it is incorrect to characterize the merger of I.A.I.
and Terninoss into TAS as the introduction of unrelated assets to the producer of the subject merchandise. Since I.A.I.
and Terninoss were both subsidiaries of Terni prior to the 1987 restructuring, we find no reason to eliminate stainless
steel sales from the Terni-specific denominator. 

We do not disagree with petitioners that ILVA's sales have to be adjusted to properly measure subsidies given to Terni/TAS.
As noted by petitioners, in Certain Steel from Italy the Department adjusted ILVA sales to calculate subsidy margins
for benefits accruing to Italsider and/or Nuova Italsider. To accomplish the same results in this investigation,
we have used the sales of the Specialty Steels Division of ILVA to calculate the subsidy margin for Terni-specific
benefits, rather than the sales of ILVA. 

Finally, we agree with respondents that a company's sales cannot be expected to remain the same over time; 

i.e., 

a comparison of nominal sales values separated by six years does not take into consideration inflation or the internal
economies of scale resulting from restructuring. 



Comment 5 



Petitioners state that the Department did not use the highest interest rate on the record of the investigation for
calculating the benchmark in its preliminary determination. Petitioners note that the IMF interest rates that it
submitted in the petition are higher in some instances than the interest rate used by the Department. 

The GOI, on the other hand, argues that petitioners' suggestion that the Department use the Italian ``lending rate,''
as provided by the IMF, should be rejected since this is a short-term interest rate. Therefore, according to the GOI,
this interest rate should not be considered representative of the highest long-term interest rate in Italy. Respondents
state that the Department, as it did in the final determination of Certain Steel, correctly used the reference rate
provided by the Bank of Italy to calculate benchmark rates.

DOC Comment 


We note that the Bank of Italy's reference rate is the highest average long-term fixed interest rate on the record of
this investigation. Because section 355.44(b)(6)(iv)(A) of the Proposed Regulations lists short-term interest
rates as the least preferred choice for an uncreditworthy long-term interest rate benchmark, we cannot use the IMF
``lending rate'' as suggested by petitioners. Accordingly, the Department has continued to use the reference rate
plus 12 percent of the ABI prime rate for purposes of constructing benchmark and discount rates. 


Comment 6 


Respondents argue that in cases involving companies experiencing a major restructuring or expansion, the Department
recognizes that a reasonable private investor's analysis may depend on the company's prospects, rather than its
past financial experience. Respondents cite to Certain Carbon Steel Products from Sweden, 58 FR 37385 (July 9, 1993)
in support of their argument. 
According to respondents, the ECSC Treaty permits government investment in a state-owned steel company only in cases
where the EC determines that such investment is provided ``under circumstances acceptable to a private investor
operating under normal market economy conditions.'' Because of this requirement, a team of independent experts
examined the GOI's proposed restructuring plan and concluded that the implementation of the plan afforded ILVA reasonable
chances of achieving financial viability under normal market conditions. 
Respondents further argue that the Department has considered the EC's approval of government equity investments
as evidence that the transaction confers no countervailable benefits. Respondents cite to the administrative review
of Industrial Nitrocellulose from France, 52 FR 833 (January 9, 1987), which involved the French nitrocellulose
industry. 
Petitioners argue that ILVA's claim of equityworthiness in 1988 is without merit. ILVA's predecessor companies,
including Terni, incurred losses in every year examined by the Department. In addition, petitioners argue that nothing
on the record suggests that ILVA's prospects after 1988 were so optimistic as to overcome years of poor financial performance
and justify commercial investment by a private investment company. 


DOC Position 


We agree with respondents that where a major restructuring or expansion occurs, it may be appropriate to place greater
reliance on the future prospects of the company than would be the case where an equity investment is made in an established
enterprise (see GIA at 37244). For example, in the Swedish Steel case cited by respondents, we considered such factors
as: (1) The anticipated rate of return on equity; (2) the extended length of time before the company was projected to
be profitable; (3) the prospects of the world steel industry; (4) the cost structure of the company. 
In this instance, the 1988 equity investment was made in ILVA, a company which would differ from the operating companies
that went into it principally because of the substantial debt forgiveness that occurred as part of the 1988-90
restructuring. Relieved of this debt, ILVA's balance sheet, when it began operations in 1989, would be much improved
over that of its predecessor, Finsider. 
Beyond this, however, we have little indication of ILVA's future prospects. There is no information on expected rates
of return, the time frame for achieving profitability, or developments in the steel market that would allow us to reach
a conclusion that ILVA would yield a reasonable rate of return in a reasonable period of time. 
Respondents have discussed two indicators of the future prospects of ILVA, the independent study undertaken by the
EC and the EC's decision allowing the investment. With respect to the study, it was not placed on the record and we have
had no opportunity to analyze it. Without such analysis, we cannot simply accept respondents' characterization
of the study's conclusion. 
We also disagree with respondents that the EC's finding on this investment is dispositive. Our determinations of
equityworthiness are made in accordance with the Department's standards, not the EC's. In Final Affirmative Countervailing
Duty Determination: Certain Hot Rolled Lead and Bismuth Carbon Steel Products from France, 58 FR 6221, 6232 (January
27, 1993), we explicitly rejected the EC approval of the investment as not relevant. In Industrial Nitrocellulose
from France, cited by respondents, the Department performed its own analysis and, contrary to respondents' assertion,
did not rely on an EC finding. Respondents' reliance on ``principles of comity'' (citing the Restatement (Third)
of Foreign Relations Law of the United States (ALI) section 481, is also inapposite, because comity involves respecting
foreign judgments regarding the disposition of property and the status of persons.

Finally, while indicators of past performance may be less important, we do not believe that a private investor would
ignore them entirely. As explained in our discussion of Terni's equityworthiness above, that company had performed
poorly. Similarly, Italsider, another company that was restructured into ILVA, had performed poorly (see Certain
Steel from Italy). Therefore, the past performance of companies that became ILVA offered no basis to believe that
the 1988 investment in ILVA was consistent with commercial considerations. 


Comment 7 


Respondents argue that the Department only countervails worker assistance when a company is relieved of an obligation
it would otherwise incur. According to respondents, because it confirmed at verification that Italian companies
have no obligation to retrain their workers, the Department should conclude that ECSC Article 56 worker training
is not countervailable. 



DOC Position 


First, it should be noted that we did not countervail the portion of Article 56 retraining grants funded by the ECSC.
With respect to the portion funded by the GOI under Law 181/89, we disagree that the workers assistance provision of
the Proposed Regulations is applicable in this situation. There is a distinction between funds which cover the cost
of upgrading the skills of workers remaining at ILVA (which is a cost normally born by the company to improve the efficiency
of its work force), and funds provided to train workers leaving ILVA, which we consider a benefit solely to the worker.
Only the former is properly categorized as countervailable ``worker assistance'' under section 355.44(j) of the
Proposed Regulations, to the extent that it relieves the company of the cost of improving its workers' skills. 
Since the GOI's contributions to match the ECSC Article 56 payments were only available to steel companies and these
funds were used to cover part of ILVA's costs of training workers who remained at ILVA, we find that a countervailable
benefit is being provided. 


Comment 8 


The GOI states that, based on the clearer understanding gained by the Department at verification regarding the types
of loans eligible for Law 796/76 exchange rate guarantees, this program should be found not countervailable. 


DOC Position 


We note that the Department failed to send the GOI a deficiency questionnaire indicating that more information was
needed to demonstrate the 

de facto

 use of Law 796/76. When it became evident at verification that such information was needed, we attempted to gather
it. However, the information could not be provided in the form necessary in the limited time available during verification.

Accordingly, we have not made the adverse inference that this program is 

de facto

 specific to the steel industry. However, we note that this finding of non-countervailability only relates to this
investigation and is subject to revision at the first administrative review if a countervailing duty order is issued.



Comment 9 


The GOI notes that exports of the subject merchandise to the U.S. were not financed using Law 227/77. According to the
GOI, this financing should not be considered countervailable because it is not limited to a particular industry and
is also consistent with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Understanding on official export
credits. The GOI argues that since this financing is permitted by a multilateral agreement binding both the U.S. and
Italy, it should not be considered countervailable. 


DOC Position 


We found no countervailable benefits under this program because ILVA did not use this financing for exports to the
United States. With respect to the other arguments raised by the GOI, since this program provided export financing,
its availability to a large number of industries is not relevant. For export subsidies, we need only find, pursuant
to 355.43(a)(1) of the Proposed Regulations, that the financing for exports is provided at preferential rates. Second,
although the U.S. and Italy participate in the OECD arrangement which establishes the interest rates that can be charged
on export loans, nothing in that arrangement would preclude the application of countervailing duties on merchandise
entering the U.S. which received subsidized financing.

Comment 10 



Respondents note that at verification, the Department determined that Law 181/89 actually had three components:
(1) the creation of alternative employment opportunities; (2) the development of new industrial initiatives (``reindustrialization'');
and (3) worker retraining. Respondents state that the Department further determined that ILVA only received funds
under the reindustrialization provision of Law 181/89. 

Of the three reindustrialization projects, respondents claim that two were tied to non-subject merchandise. Therefore,
they are not countervailable pursuant to section 355.47 of the Proposed Regulations. The third reindustrialization
project was a ``retraining center.'' Respondents argue that the Proposed Regulations state that ``worker assistance''
is only countervailable to the extent that it relieves a company of an obligation that it would otherwise incur (see
section 355.44(j) of the Proposed Regulations). Since there is no obligation in Italy to retrain workers, this project
does not provide a countervailable benefit. 



DOC Position 



As a matter of clarification, we found that Law 181/89 has four components, the fourth being early retirement. However,
the early retirement component expired prior to the POI. Since early retirement is typically considered a recurring
benefit and, therefore, allocable to the year in which received, we did not establish the extent to which it had or had
not been used by ILVA. 

Regarding the reindustrialization component, we agree that two of the projects involved the further processing
of non-subject merchandise. Therefore, we have found them not countervailable. 

However, with respect to the training center, we disagree that this amounted to worker assistance within the meaning
of the Proposed Regulations. As discussed in Comment 7 above, there is a distinction between worker assistance and
funds that are being used to cover the costs that ILVA would incur to train its work force. Although not exclusively,
the training center in question is used to upgrade the technical skills of ILVA workers. 
Therefore, we have determined that the GOI payments to cover part of the cost of building a training center provide
a countervailable benefit to ILVA. 



Comment 11 



The GOI argues that the early retirement program would only be countervailable if companies had no choice but to keep
surplus workers on the payroll. However, companies can carry out large-scale lay-offs under Italian law. Thus, the
GOI contends that early retirement is an alternative to lay-offs and not an alternative to maintaining excess workers.
The GOI contends that because companies are required to contribute to the costs for early retirement, the program
is a burden, not a benefit, to them. The only beneficiaries under the early retirement program are the workers. 

Moreover, according to respondents, early retirement is available to workers in a broad range of industries. The
Department should, therefore, find that there is no selective treatment under the program. 

According to petitioners, verification confirmed that early retirement is only available to a limited group of industries.
Moreover, because use of early retirement under Article 27 is contingent upon approval from a government committee,
the GOI exercises discretion in determining which industries can use the program. Petitioners also argue that Italian
companies have an obligation to provide early retirement benefits once the workers have opted for the program. The
benefit should, therefore, be calculated as the GOI's contribution to the program because if government funds had
not been provided, ILVA would have been legally responsible for the entire cost, according to petitioners. 



DOC Position 



We agree with the GOI that, by law, companies in Italy can carry out large-scale lay-offs. Moreover, we have no evidence
that Italian companies have a legal obligation to keep workers on the payroll until they reach normal retirement age.
However, based on verification, we have found that some companies, including ILVA, belong to a category of firms that
must go through certain ``steps and procedures,'' in the form of the provisions under Law 223/91 before they actually
can reduce the workforce. In practice, therefore, large companies are obligated to use Law 223/91 to deal with surplus
workers. 

Regarding the general availability of early retirement, the structure of Law 223/91 is such that the early retirement
option is available to a smaller group of companies than the lay-off option, CIG-S. Because the GOI was not able
to provide evidence showing that the steel producers did not receive a disproportionate share of the quota granted
under the early retirement option, we have used CIG-S as our ``benchmark.'' Since the financial obligations
imposed on the company under early retirement are more onerous that the obligations under CIG-S, we have determined
that ILVA did not receive a benefit under the early retirement program. 



Comment 12 



Petitioners argue that the shares in ILVA owned by Italsider (in liquidation) were transferred to TAS free-of-charge
in 1990. 
Respondents argue that ILVA did provide an invoice from Italsider requesting payment from TAS but that ILVA was unable
to locate the payment record during verification. Moreover, respondents argue that the Department never posed the
question of payment to TAS (in liquidation), nor did the Department verify the records of TAS (in liquidation). Therefore,
respondents argue, ILVA should not be penalized for any missing information over which it has no control.

As discussed above in connection with the 1988-90 restructuring, petitioners alleged several subsidies to
TAS after the second asset transfer and receipt of Italsider's shares by TAS was among them. As we explained, we believe
that we have captured the full benefit to the subject merchandise from the restructuring without analyzing these
individual transactions. Therefore, TAS' payment or non-payment to Italsider is irrelevant to our analysis. 

However, although we did not verify that TAS (in liquidation) paid Italsider for the shares, we do not believe that
TAS kept the proceeds from the sale. This is because the proceeds were so large (1,563 billion lire) that they would
have been more than enough to pay off all of TAS' outstanding liabilities and to return the company to a positive equity
position. However, as TAS' books indicate, this did not happen. 



Comment 13 



Petitioners maintain that although evidence presented at verification may demonstrate that Terni received Law
750/81 funds based on its identity as a producer of forgings and castings, the Department nevertheless found that
Terni's accounting records did not reflect that these grants were designated only for the production of forgings
and castings. Therefore, petitioners argue that Terni treated and accounted for these grants as general funds, and
did not specifically allocate them to its forgings and castings operations. 



DOC Position 



We find these grants to be not countervailable since they applied to merchandise not subject to this investigation.
We disagree with petitioners' argument that Terni's treatment of these funds as ``general funds'' demonstrates
that they were not specifically allocated to the production of forgings and castings. We stated in the 

GIA

 that when a company receives a general subsidy, the Department does not attempt to ``trace'' or establish how the subsidy
was used. Conversely, if the subsidy is tied to the production of merchandise other than the merchandise under investigation,
the Department also does not attempt to trace or establish how the subsidy was ultimately used. Furthermore, we believe
that respondents provided sufficient documentation, which is fully discussed in the ILVA verification report,
that grants under this program specifically applied to the production of forgings and castings. As stated in the GIA
at 37267, if the benefit is tied to a product other than the merchandise under investigation, the Department will not
find a countervailable subsidy on the subject merchandise. 



Verification 



In accordance with section 776(b) of the Act, we verified the information used in making our final determination.
We followed standard verification procedures, including meeting with government and company officials, examination
of relevant accounting records and examination of original source documents. Our verification results are outlined
in detail in the public versions of the verification reports, which are on file in the Central Records Unit (room B-099
of the Main Commerce Building). 



Suspension of Liquidation 



In accordance with our affirmative preliminary determination, we instructed the U.S. Customs Service to suspend
liquidation of all entries of electrical steel from Italy, which were entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption,
on or after February 1, 1994, the date our preliminary determination was published in the 

Federal Register

. If the ITC issues a final affirmative injury determination, we will instruct Customs to require a cash deposit for
entries of the merchandise after that date in the amounts indicated below. 




ITC Notification 


In accordance with section 705(d) of the Act, we will notify the ITC of our determination. In addition, we are making
available to the ITC all nonprivileged and nonproprietary information relating to this investigation. We will allow
the ITC access to all privileged and business proprietary information in our files, provided the ITC confirms that
it will not disclose such information, either publicly or under an administrative protective order, without the
written consent of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Investigations, Import Administration. 

If the ITC determines that material injury, or threat of material injury, does not exist, these proceedings will be
terminated and all estimated duties deposited or securities posted as a result of the suspension of liquidation will
be refunded or cancelled. If, however, the ITC determines that such injury does exist, we will issue a countervailing
duty order directing Customs officers to assess countervailing duties on electrical steel from Italy. 



Return of Destruction of Proprietary Information 



This notice serves as the only reminder to parties subject to Administrative Protective Order (APO) of their responsibility
concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 355.34(d).
Failure to comply is a violation of the APO. 

This determination is published pursuant to section 705(d) of the Act and 19 CFR 355.20(a)(4).

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council's Mackerel Advisory Panel (AP) and Reef Fish, Mackerel, Spiny Lobster,
and Stone Crab Scientific and Statistical Committees (SSC) will hold public meetings on May 2-4, 1994, to review,
and advise the Council on, amendments to Federal rules affecting mackerel, reef fish, stone crab and spiny lobster.



The meetings will be held at the Radisson Inn, New Orleans Airport, 2150 Veterans Memorial Boulevard, Kenner, LA;
telephone: (504) 467-3111.

On May 2, beginning at 2:30 p.m., the SSC will develop recommendations on an amendment that proposes to allow certain
fishermen landing reef fish with traps, or investing in traps prior to February 7, 1994, to be granted permits to use
fish traps during the current 3-year moratorium on issuance of such permits.

On May 3, beginning at 8 a.m., the SSC will review and make recommendations on an amendment to the stone crab regulations
which proposes a 4-year moratorium on issuance of commercial vessel registrations to participate in the fishery
and a procedure for implementing state rules in the Federal waters. The SSC will also develop recommendations on a
generic amendment that contains proposals for defining traps used in the reef fish, spiny lobster, stone crab and
other fisheries, as well as areal and seasonal limitations on trap use. Beginning at noon, the SSC will review the mackerel
and cobia information and formulate its recommendations to the Council.

The Mackerel AP will meet on May 4 beginning at 10 a.m., to review stock assessment and social and economic information
on king mackerel, Spanish mackerel, and cobia (ling). Based on this review, it will recommend to the Council levels
for setting total allowable catch (TAC), commercial vessel trip limits, bag limits, and commercial quotas for these
species for the 1994-95 season.

<DOCTITLE>Intent To Prepare a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for a Municipal Solid-Waste Landfill Proposed by
Resource Investments, Inc. in Pierce County, WA</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Seattle District, DOD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Resource Investments, Inc. (RII) of Puyallup, Washington is proposing construction and operation of a private solid-waste
landfill on a 320-acre site in central Pierce County, Washington. The project site is located at the intersection
of State Route (SR) 161 (Meridian) and 304th Street East (Kapowsin Highway), approximately 15 miles south of Puyallup,
Washington. Construction of the landfill's cells and support facilities will impact approximately 33 acres of wetlands,
including palustrine emergent, scrub-shrub, and forested wetlands. The proposed project may also require relocating
2,600 linear feet of the South Fork of Muck Creek (South Creek) which flows through the northwest corner of the site.
South Creek is a seasonal tributary to Much Creek, which is a tributary of the Nisqually River. The proposed site is
located over the Clovers-Chambers Creek Sole Source Aquifer which has been designated by the Environmental Protection
Agency as a ``Sole Source Aquifer.'' Work in wetlands and South Creek will require a Department of the Army Permit under
section 404 of the Clean Water Act.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Proposed Action



RII has proposed the facility because the existing landfill in Pierce County (Hidden Valley, owned and operated by
an affiliated company, Land Recovery, Incorporated) has nearly reached maximum capacity and is scheduled for closure
sometime between January and September 1996. To extend the life of the existing Hidden Valley Landfill, Pierce County
has opted to use this existing facility for approximately 80 percent of Pierce County's solid-waste disposal needs.
The remaining 20 percent is long-hauled to the Rabanco Landfill (located in eastern Washington) via truck and rail.

The proposed project site is located in central Pierce County, approximately 15 miles south of Puyallup, Washington
and approximately 12 miles north of Eatonville, Washington, adjacent to SR 161. The site is bounded by SR 161 (Meridian)
to the west and 304th Street East (Kapowsin Highway) to the north. The landfill facility will occupy up to 177 acres
of the relatively level 320-acre site. Fill in wetlands and in South Creek is necessary under the proposed action to
construct the landfill's cells and support facilities.

The landfill design includes a bottom liner, temporary and permanent cover cap systems, a leachate collection system,
a leak detection and collection system, a gas collection and combustion system, and a storm drainage system. The landfill
would be constructed in a series of seven cells (one cell constructed and filled at a time) over approximately 20 years.
The life of the proposed project would depend upon the waste stream volume and any fluctuations (i.e., increases or
decreases from established 20-year projections.

RII's project purpose is to provide the unincorporated areas and the incorporated cities in Pierce County that participated
in the 1989 Tacoma-Pierce County Solid Waste Management Plan and specifically not the military bases located within
Pierce County with a viable, affordable, environmentally sound solid waste project to meet projected needs for the
next 20 years.

Alternatives



a. The Corps of Engineers has three alternative courses of action available:

(1) The section 404 permit could be issued with standard conditions for the proposed action as described above.

(2) The section 404 permit could be issued with standard and special conditions that would mitigate impacts resulting
from the proposed action.

(3) The section 404 permit could be denied. This option would prohibit all proposed work impacting the wetlands and
the stream on the project site as well as prevent environmental impacts associated with the proposed action in these
areas. The economic and social benefits of the project to Pierce County residents would also be foregone.

b. Alternatives to be examined in the EIS include:

(1) No action.

(2) Off-site alternatives.

(3) On-site alternatives.



Scoping and Public Involvement



An EIS was prepared under the Washington State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) regarding this proposal. A public
scoping meeting and public hearings were held by Pierce County during development of the Draft SEPA EIS. After receiving
extensive comments on the Draft, Pierce County issued a Final SEPA EIS in November 1990. In addition, over 200 comments
have been submitted to the Corps of Engineers in response to the Corps' public notice for the permit application. Public
involvement will be sought during scoping and conduct of the EIS in accordance with National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) procedures. This Notice of Intent formally commences the scoping process under NEPA. As part of the scoping
process, all affected Federal, State and local agencies, Indian Tribes, and other interested private organizations
and citizens, including environmental groups, are invited to comment on issues of major concern and to identify any
additional studies that might be needed in order to analyze and evaluate impacts. Comments are requested concerning
project alternatives, probable significant environmental impacts, mitigation measures, and permits or other
approvals that may be required. The following key areas have been identified to be analyzed in depth in the draft EIS:




 1. Alternative Sites
 2. Project Design
 3. Potential for Surface and Groundwater Contamination
 4. Wetlands
 5. Water Quality
 6. Amphibians and Reptiles
 7. Waterfowl and Fisheries
 8. Cultural Resources
 9. Aesthetics
10. Transportation/Traffic
11. Social and Economic Characteristics
12. Cumulative Impacts
13. Endangered Species
14. Air Quality
15. Noise
16. Land Use/Zoning
17. Human Health and Safety
18. Earth/Geologic Resources
19. Wildlife and Plants



Scoping Meeting



Because over 200 comments have been submitted in response to a Corps of Engineer's public notice for the permit application
covering a wide variety of issues, a formal scoping meeting pursuant to NEPA is not planned at this time. To assist the
Corps in developing the scope of the EIS and in identifying important issues, comments are invited to be submitted
in writing and should be forwarded to Seattle District, Corps of Engineers, before 15 May 1994. Previous comments
provided to the Corps of Engineers on this project are on file and will be addressed in the NEPA EIS.



Other Environmental Review, Coordination, and Permit Requirements



Other environmental review, coordination, and permit requirements include preparation of a section 404(b)(1)
evaluation by the Corps of Engineers; consultation among the Corps, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the State
of Washington per section 7 of the Endangered Species Act; acquisition by the applicant of a Conditional Use Permit
and a Solid Waste Handling Permit from Pierce County, a Water Quality Certification and Hydraulics Project Approval
from Washington State, and State concurrence with consistency pursuant to the Washington State Coastal Zone Management
Program.



Availability of Draft EIS



The draft EIS is scheduled for release in December 1994.

15. Medina Power Company



[Docket No. QF91-040-000] 



Take notice that on January 19, 1994, the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation (Niagara Mohawk) filed a motion with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) seeking the revocation of Medina Power Company's (Medina) self-certification
of qualifying facility (QF) status for Medina's Cogeneration facility. 

On December 5, 1990, Medina, in Docket No. QF91-040-000, filed with the Commission a notice of self-certification
as a QF pursuant to 18 CFR 292.207(a)(2). 

Niagara Mohawk is the purchaser of electric power generated by Medina's QF. According to Niagara Mohawk, Medina's
QF does not currently and has not had in the past, a thermal output customer. Niagara Mohawk states that during a plant
visit to Medina's QF in 1992, Medina represented that a greenhouse would be the facility's thermal output customer,
but that Medina subsequently discontinued its plans to construct a greenhouse. Thus, Niagara Mohawk contends that
Medina's QF is not in compliance with  292.205(a) of the Commission's regulations.

<DOCTITLE>Mojave Pipeline Co.; Preparation/Intent to Prepare a Joint Draft Environmental Impact Report/Statement for the
Proposed Mojave Northward Expansion Project and Request for Comments on Environmental Issues </DOCTITLE>


April 12, 1994.


The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) will prepare a joint environmental impact
report/statement (EIR/EIS) with the California State Lands Commission (SLC) that will discuss the environmental
impacts of the construction and operation of facilities proposed in Mojave Pipeline Company's Northward Expansion
Project.
 The FERC will use this EIR/EIS in its decision-making process (whether or not to certificate the proposed project).






The SLC will be the lead State agency for California and the FERC will be the lead Federal agency in the preparation of
this joint EIR/EIS. The joint document, which will avoid much duplication of environmental analyses, will satisfy
the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).


The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) will be cooperating with the FERC in the preparation of the EIR/EIS because of the
significant amount of BLM-managed land that the proposal would affect. The other Federal agencies we are asking to
cooperate (see appendix 1) may choose to participate once they have evaluated Mojave's proposal relative to their
respective responsibilities.
 





Summary of the Proposed Facilities 



Mojave Pipeline Company (Mojave) has an existing natural gas transmission system which begins near Topock, Arizona
and terminates near Bakersfield, California. Mojave requests FERC authorization to construct and operate certain
pipeline and compression facilities that will extend its system into Central and Northern California (Northward
Expansion Project). These additional facilities would enable Mojave to transport 475 million cubic feet per day
of natural gas to customers in the San Joaquin Valley and Northern California (San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento).


Mojave's application proposes two facility schemes. One plan includes the facilities Mojave would construct in
the event the Kern River Gas Transmission Company (Kern River) also expands its existing system. The second plan includes
the facilities Mojave would construct without any expansion by Kern River. This EIR/EIS will analyze the most construction-intensive
combination of Mojave facilities.
 





The proposed Northward Expansion Project consists of the following facilities: 

 557 miles of new pipeline with diameters ranging from 4 inches to 30 inches; 
 100 miles of 30-inch-diameter looping pipeline;
 





 Three new compressor stations in California with a total of 73,058 horsepower (hp) of compression, and 24,470
hp of additional compression at Mojave's existing compressor station in Topock, Arizona; and 
 Construction of 55 new meter stations and the modification of 1 existing meter station. 
The general locations of the facilities proposed by Mojave are shown in appendix 2. A detailed listing of the facilities
is in appendix 3.

Mojave informed the Commission that it plans to amend its application after the issuance of this notice. Specific
details regarding any changes to the proposed project will be available at the public scoping meetings. The landowners
who would be affected by that amendment will receive a copy of this notice. At a minimum Mojave expects the amendment
to include: 
(1) An alternative pipeline alignment between Bakersfield and Lindsay; 
(2) An extension of its Palo Alto Segment of approximately 30 miles to a location near Hunters Point; 
(3) An alternative siting of its Famoso Compressor Station near Lindsay; and 
(4) An alternative pipeline alignment to avoid the Contra Costa Water District's Los Vaqueros Reservoir Project.

Several of the customers receiving gas from Mojave as part of this project will need to build pipelines to take the gas
delivered to them. Although these facilities are not under the jurisdiction of the FERC, they will be discussed in
the EIR/EIS. 



Land Requirements for Construction 


Mojave proposes to build its new mainline and pipeline segments in construction rights-of-way ranging from 30 to
75 feet wide. After construction, 0 to 30 feet would be maintained as permanent easement. Specific widths of the rights-of-way
vary, depending on the proposed pipeline diameter for specific locations. The proposed loops would be built parallel
and adjacent to Mojave's existing pipelines, using as much of the existing rights-of-way as possible for the construction
right-of-way. The three new compressor stations would require approximately 20 acres each. 
Additional temporary work space may be required at major river, road or railroad crossings, or where similar obstacles
are encountered. Mojave would purchase the temporary and permanent easements necessary for constructing the project.

Construction of the pipelines would normally follow standard pipeline construction methods: right-of-way clearing
and grading; trenching; pipe stringing, bending, welding, joint coating, and lowering in; backfilling of the trench;
and cleanup and restoration. Mojave proposes to implement erosion control and revegetation measures and to use special
construction techniques for wetland and water crossings and for construction in residential areas. These construction
procedures and mitigation plans will be discussed further in the Draft EIR/EIS. 
Pipeline loops in or adjacent to existing rights-of-way would generally require less clearing and grading. Rotary-wheeled
ditching machines, backhoes, or rippers would be used to excavate a sufficiently deep trench. For buried pipelines,
the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) requires a minimum of 30 inches of cover in normal soils and 18 inches in
consolidated rock. In populated areas, this increases to 36 and 24 inches of cover, respectively. Blasting would
be required when areas of consolidated rock are encountered. 

Pipeline segments would be designed according to DOT minimum safety standards and specifications (49 CFR part 192)
and would be hydrostatically tested before being placed in service. Mojave would be required to obtain appropriate
Federal and state discharge permits prior to hydrostatic testing. No chemicals would be used during this testing.




The EIR/EIS Process 


The NEPA requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts that could result from a major Federal
action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. The California SLC,
as a cooperating state agency, is required to consider the same potential impacts within the State of California under
the CEQA. The EIR/EIS we are preparing will give both the SLC and the Commission the information we need to do that. 
NEPA (and CEQA) also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this
``scoping''. The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EIR/EIS on the important environmental
issues, and to separate those issues that are insignificant and do not require detailed study. 
The EIR/EIS will discuss impacts that 

could

 occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed project. These impacts may include, but are not
limited to: 




Geology and Soils 


Geological and seismic hazards 
Erosion control 
Right-of-way restoration 



Water Resources 

Impact on potable water supplies 
Impact on wetland hydrology 
Effect of construction in areas with shallow, contaminated groundwater 
Effect of pipeline crossings on streams and canals

We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the project and recommend specific mitigation measures to lessen
or avoid impacts on the various resource areas.

Our independent analysis of the issues will result in the publication of a Draft EIR/EIS which will be mailed to Federal,
state, and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, affected landowners, newspapers,
libraries, and the Commission's official service list for these proceedings. A 45-day comment period will be allocated
for the review of the Draft EIR/EIS. We will consider all comments on the Draft EIR/EIS and revise the document, as necessary,
before issuing a Final EIR/EIS. The Final EIR/EIS will include our response to each comment received.



Public Participation and Scoping Meetings



You can make a difference by sending a letter with your specific comments or concerns about the project. You should
focus on the potential environmental effects of the proposal, alternatives to the proposal (including alternative
routes), and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impact. The more specific your comments, the more useful they
will be. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that your comments are received and properly recorded:

 Address the letter to: Ms. Lois Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol
Street NE., Washington, DC 20426;

 Reference Docket Nos. CP93-258-000, 

et al.;

 Mail comments before May 20, 1994.

In addition to asking for written comments, we invite you to attend any of the joint public scoping meetings the FERC
and SLC will conduct. The locations and times for these meetings are listed on the next page. Requests to hold additional
public scoping meetings will be considered.

The public meetings will be designed to provide you with more detailed information and another opportunity to offer
your comments on the proposed project. Those wanting to speak at the meetings can call the EIS Project Manager to pre-register
their names on the speaker list. Those people on the speaker list prior to the date of the meeting will be allowed to speak
first. A second speaker list will be developed at each meeting. Priority will be given to people representing groups.
A transcript of each meeting will be made so that your comments will be accurately recorded.



Becoming an Intervenor



In addition to involvement in the EIR/EIS scoping process, you may want to become an official party to the FERC proceedings
by becoming an intervenor. Among other things, intervenors have the right to receive copies of case-related Commission
documents and filings by other intervenors. Likewise, each intervenor must provide copies of its filings to all other
parties. If you want to become an intervenor, you must file a Motion to Intervene according to Rule 214 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) which is attached as appendix 4.

The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file
late interventions must show good cause, as required by  385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be
waived. Environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. You do not need intervenor status
to have your scoping comments considered or to speak at a meeting.

p. 

Scoping Process:

 In gathering background information for preparation of the environmental document for the issuance of a Federal
hydropower license, staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, is using a scoping process to identify significant
environmental issues related to the construction and operation or the continued operation of hydropower projects.
The staff will review all issues raised during the scoping process and identify issues deserving of study and also
deemphasize insignificant issues, narrowing the scope of the environmental assessment as well. If preliminary
analysis indicates that any issues presented in the scoping process would have little potential for causing significant
impacts, the issue or issues will be identified and the reasons for not providing a more detailed analysis will be given.



q. 

Request for Scoping Comments:

 Federal, state, and local resource agencies; licensees, applicants and developers; Indian tribes; other interested
groups and individuals, are requested to forward to the Commission, any information that they believe will assist
the Commission staff in conducting an accurate and thorough analysis of the site-specific and cumulative environmental

Scoping Process:

 In gathering background information for preparation of the environmental document for the issuance of a Federal
hydropower license, staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, is using a scoping process to identify significant
environmental issues related to the construction and operation or the continued operation of hydropower projects.
The staff will review all issues raised during the scoping process and identify issues deserving of study and also
deemphasize insignificant issues, narrowing the scope of the environmental assessment as well. If preliminary
analysis indicates that any issues presented in the scoping process would have little potential for causing significant
impacts, the issue or issues will be identified and the reasons for not providing a more detailed analysis will be given.



q. 

Request for Scoping Comments:

of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205 and 157.216) for authorization under its
blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-407-000, to abandon facilities, all as more fully set forth

Texas Gas proposes to abandon by removal the Vandergrift 
sales tap located on the 10'' Tie-Over Line in Tipton County, Tennessee, and the Westover sales tap located on the Ripley-Jackson
8'' Line in Madison County, Tennessee. 

Texas Gas states it has received letter requests from the Covington Gas Company, City of Covington, and the Jackson

customers will be using the Covington and Jackson No. 3 existing taps, respectively. Texas Gas states that service
to customers of Covington and Jackson will not be affected by these two abandonments. 

The Vandergrift delivery point is an existing farm tap served by Covington and in turn served by Texas Gas under a Firm
No Notice Transportation Agreement between Texas Gas and Covington dated November 1, 1993. The Westover delivery
point is an existing tap served by Jackson and in turn served by Texas Gas under a Firm No Notice Transportation Agreement
between Texas Gas and Jackson dated November 1, 1993.

Title:

 Laboratory Performance Evaluation Studies for Water Analyses (EPA No. 0234.05; OMB No. 2080-0021). This ICR
requests an extension to an existing information collection. 


Abstract:

 Pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act (Public Law 93-523) 40 CFR parts 141 through 142, and the Federal Water
Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (Public Law 92-500), the EPA's Environmental Monitoring Systems
Laboratory (EMSL-CIN) must conduct performance evaluation (PE) studies on laboratories that routinely analyze
several types of water samples. There are three types of PE studies that are conducted:



(1) Water Pollution (WP) Studies, which provide EPA with information on laboratories producing critical data for
regulatory purposes, and to support the wastewater certification programs administered by many States; 
(2) Discharge Monitoring Report-Quality Assurance (DMR-QA) Studies, which provide EPA with an objective estimate
of the analytical capability of laboratories performing self-monitoring analyses, as required in major National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits; and
(3) Water Supply (WS) Studies, which support the drinking water laboratory certification program administered
by the States.
On a routine basis, EMSL-CIN will distribute samples containing concentrations of chemical that are unknown to the
receiving laboratory. The laboratory analyzes the samples and reports their results by completing the appropriate
EPA form and returning it to EMSL-CIN for evaluation. EMSL-CIN sends each laboratory a copy of their performance evaluation
that includes the data they submitted to EMSL-CIN, the true values of the related study and PE limits, and an evaluation
for each reported value. 
The results are used by EPA, State, and private laboratory personnel to identify and correct analytical deficiencies
of laboratories, thereby improving the data quality of their monitoring operations. WP and WS study results can be
decisive in the laboratory certification process, and DMR-QA study results are used to target NPDES laboratories
with apparent analytical problems for on-site inspection by EPA or State regulatory personnel.


Burden Statement:

 Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 8 hours per response including
the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing information sources, and completing and reviewing the
collection of information.


Respondents:

 Businesses or other for-profit organizations, non-profit institutions, small businesses or organizations, State
and local organizations.


Estimated Number of Respondents:

 17,700.


Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent:

 1.


Frequency of Collection:

 Semiannually for WP and WS Studies, annually for DMR-QA Studies.


Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents:

 141,550.
Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other 

aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for 
reducing the burden, to:




Sandy Farmer, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Information Policy Branch (2136), 401 M Street, SW., Washington,
DC 20460.




and 




Tim Hunt, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 725 17th Street, NW., Washington,

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, Public Law 92463, EPA gives notice of a one-day meeting of the Information
Resources Management (IRM) Strategic Planning Task Force. The IRM Task Force is a special task force formed under
the Environmental Information and Assessment (EIA) Committee, which is one of the standing committees of the National
Advisory Council for Environmental Policy and Technology (NACEPT). NACEPT provides advice and recommendations
to the Administrator of EPA on a broad range of environmental policy issues, and the EIA Committee examines issues
associated with the gathering, dissemination, and use of environmentally related data and information.




The IRM Task Force was formed to provide recommendations on key elements that EPA should include in an Information
Resources Management Strategic Plan for the Agency. The meeting is being held to discuss the comments the Task Force
has received on its Interim Recommendations.

Scheduling constraints preclude oral comments from the public during the meeting. Written comments can be submitted
by mail, and will be transmitted to Task Force members for consideration.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Opportunity to Participate in Negotiations for Testing of ETBE and TAME Under TSCA Section 4 </DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice invites manufacturers and processors of ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE)(CAS No. 637-92-3)
and tertiary-amyl methyl ether (TAME)(CAS No. 994-05-8) and other interested persons who wish to participate
in or monitor consent agreement negotiations pursuant to 40 CFR 790.22(b) to contact the EPA in writing. In addition,
this notice announces a public meeting to initiate testing negotiations for these chemicals.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This notice announces an opportunity to participant in negoatiations for an enforceable consent agreement for:

ETBE (Docket No. 42052Q/42179) and TAME (Docket No. 42052Q/42180). 
 


I. Background 
 


Requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7401-1671q, 
along with reports of adverse human health effects 
associated with the use of methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) in 
winter-blend gasoline, have contributed to the need for health 
effects testing of ETBE and TAME. 
 
MTBE, ETBE and TAME are fuel oxygenates which may be used to 
satisfy the following requirements under the CAA. Under section 
211(m) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7545, states which have certain 
nonattainment areas for carbon monoxide (CO) must require that 
any gasoline sold or dispensed to ultimate consumers in a 
specified portion of the nonattainment area be blended, during 
wintertime, to contain not less than 2.7 percent oxygen by weight 
(or applicable percentage to meet the national primary air 
quality standard for CO by the established attainment date). 
Under section 211(k), reformulated gasoline must be used in nine 
major metropolitan areas designated as ozone nonattainment areas 
as well as various nonattainment ``opt-in'' areas by 1995 and the 
oxygen content of this gasoline must be equal to or exceed 2 
percent by weight. See Final Rule, Regulation of Fuels and Fuel 
Additives: Standards for Reformulated and Conventional Gasoline, 
February 16, 1994 (59 FR 7716). In addition, a proposed 
regulation would require that at least 30 percent of the oxygen 
content in reformulated gasoline come from renewable oxygenates, 
which would include ETBE (Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 
Regulation of Fuels and Additives: Renewable Oxygenate 
Requirement for Reformulated Gasoline, December 27, 1993 (58 FR 
68343)). 
 
Recently there have been reports from the State of Alaska 
and several areas in the lower 48 of adverse human effects 
associated with the use of MTBE in winter-blend gasoline. See 
Assessment of Potential Health Risks of Gasoline Oxygenated with 
MTBE, Office of Research and Development, U.S. EPA, November 
1993. 
 
EPA believes that additional health effects test data on fuel oxygenates are needed to allow government agencies
and industry to compare the health risks associated with the use of these substances to augment or substitute for MTBE
as a fuel oxygenate. For this reason, researchers and policy makers from EPA's Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) and
Office of Research and Development (ORD) initiated a conference with the State of Alaska, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, and the chemical and petroleum industries in Research Triangle Park, NC on December 7-8,
1993 to discuss research on the health effects of and human exposure to fuel oxygenates. 
 
One of the products of this meeting was a research project proposal to conduct toxicity testing to develop a broad base
of health effects data on ETBE and TAME. The research proposal was developed to expedite the process of identifying
data needs on these substances. The research proposal recommends testing of ETBE and TAME for the following endpoints:



 

1st Tier genotoxicity 
 
90-day inhalation subchronic 
 
Neurotoxicity (Functional observational battery, neuropathology, motor activity) 
 
Developmental toxicity 
 
Reproductive effects 
 
Pharmacokinetics 
 
 


II. Testing Program 
 


EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) administers the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and the
TSCA section 4 testing program. Under TSCA section 4, 15 U.S.C. 2603, EPA may require, in specific circumstances,
that chemical manufacturers and processors provide to EPA test data that can be used to assess the impact on human health
and the environment from exposure to such chemicals. In addition to imposing section 4 testing requirements by rulemaking,
OPPT has developed an enforceable consent agreement (ECA) process for obtaining needed testing often with less time
and resources and more flexibility than under a test rule. See 40 CFR part 790. Finally, industry may conduct voluntary
testing of specific chemicals in anticipation of data needs. 
 
In a memorandum dated March 1, 1994, EPA's OAR requested OPPT to inquire regarding the likelihood that industry would
develop a voluntary testing
program for ETBE and TAME. In the absence of such a voluntary commitment, OAR requested that OPPT use its authority
under TSCA to require such testing. 
 
OPPT sent out a form letter dated March 1, 1994 to approximately 45 chemical and petroleum companies. The letter described
the December 7, 1993 meeting and enclosed a copy of the research proposal developed at that meeting, and sought to establish
a dialogue with industry regarding the testing of ETBE and TAME. Subsequently, OPPT elected to pursue the testing
of ETBE and TAME through the ECA process. The purpose of the meeting on May 9, 1994 is to initiate negotiations for the
development of an ECA for the testing of ETBE and TAME. If an ECA approach does not appear feasible, EPA will initiate
rulemaking under section 4 of TSCA to require the development of data on ETBE and TAME. 
 
EPA is adding ETBE and TAME to the Master Testing List (MTL), which sets priorities for OPPT's testing agenda, because
EPA considers testing of these substances to be a high priority. EPA has been using the MTL since 1990 to set the Agency's
testing agenda and communicate it to the public.

Job Training Partnership Act: Learning Consortia Project


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Employment and Training Administration, Labor.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Availability of Funds and Solicitation for Grant Applications (SGA).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration, under Title IV of the Job Training Partnership
Act is soliciting proposals on a competitive basis to assist consortia of for-profit organizations in addressing
their workforce and workplace improvement needs to develop highly skilled workers and increase company competitiveness.
The Department has set aside approximately $500,000 for this procurement. As a result of this solicitation, multiple
awards will be made. All information required to submit a proposal is contained in this announcement.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This announcement consists of five parts: Part I_Background, Part II_Application Process, Part III_Statement
of Work, Part IV_Evaluation Criteria, and Part V_Reporting Requirements.


Part I_Background


The Department of Labor's (DOL's) mission is to ensure that all Americans have access to the resources they require
to successfully manage their job lives, and that U.S. businesses have access to the skilled workers and training and
technical assistance resources they need to successfully compete in a global economy. DOL's strategy for accomplishing
this mission involves the building of new relationships with state and local partners and investing federal dollars
to strengthen the effectiveness of local labor markets.
This solicitation represents an attempt to build such a new relationship through learning consortia, networks of
otherwise unrelated for-profit organizations, particularly small businesses, forged to develop interfirm learning
and information-sharing systems focused on workforce development and the changing workplace. Through each consortium,
DOL hopes (1) to share human resource development tools or information about new work systems implementation, and
(2) establish a cooperative learning system like a learning center or teaching factory.
Forming a learning consortium makes sense from the individual small companies' standpoint because a network of small
organizations are better positioned to facilitate cost-effective, high quality workforce and workplace development
programs than a small business acting alone. A consortium enables small businesses to more accurately identify common
training needs, to locate and coordinate the services of assistance providers that can effectively address those
needs, and to share training programs and other resources among member organizations.

From a public policy perspective, learning consortia afford regional, state and local workforce and economic development
policy makers and assistance providers points of access to reach a wider spectrum of firms through their business
outreach efforts. Dealing with consortia of small organizations rather than individual organizations allows assistance
providers to leverage the investment of scarce resources. Learning consortia have tremendous potential to help
alleviate this nation's growing dislocated worker problem in several ways:

(1) Consortia of businesses can be effective training and technical assistance delivery systems to upgrade incumbent
workers' skills and improve company productivity to prevent worker dislocations.

(2) Consortia learning systems, like learning centers and teaching factories, have the potential of being effective
providers for dislocated worker retraining.

(3) Networks of globally competitive small businesses could create new jobs for the reemployment of dislocated workers.

Currently, there are hundreds of examples of successful interfirm networks operating across the country. For some,
a geographic cluster is the basis for forging the network. Others are formed as part of a supplier development strategy,
an industry association strategy, or as a regional economic development strategy.



Part II_Application Process



A. Eligible Applicants



This solicitation is open to consortia of for-profit organizations. A consortium whose members include non-profit
organizations and other entities may submit an application if the majority of the consortium members are for-profit
organizations. A consortium applicant must include either ``small businesses'' with 500 or fewer employees or small
entities, such as subsidiaries or divisions of large businesses, with 500 or fewer employees. In addition, an application
shall identify a ``host organization'' to represent the consortium applicant. The host organization need not be
a member of the consortium.

Examples of host organizations include: companies, trade associations, unions, economic development organizations,
local government or state agencies, technology assistance organizations, and educational institutions. In addition,
the host organization will provide for a ``Network broker,'' an individual who serves to convene the consortium on
a regular basis, administers and coordinates supportive services, and assists in defining goals of the consortium.
Any award made as a result of this solicitation will be non-fee bearing.



B. Submission of Proposal



An original and three (3) copies of the proposal shall be submitted. The proposal shall consist of two (2) separate
and distinct parts.

Part I_shall contain the cost proposal, consisting of the following items: Standard Form (SF) 424, ``Application
for Federal Assistance'' (Appendix No. 1) and SF 424A, ``Budget'' (Appendix No. 2). The cost proposal shall also include
on a separate page(s) a detailed cost analysis of each line item in the budget.

Part II_shall contain a technical proposal that demonstrates the applicant's capabilities in accordance with the
Statement of Work contained in this announcement. Applicants are strongly encouraged to submit a technical proposal
of less than thirty (30) pages in length (exclusive of appendices) which sets forth the applicant's explanation of
how it proposes to accomplish the elements described in the Statement of Work.

<PARENT> FR940418-2-00058 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

No cost data or reference to price shall be included in the technical proposal. In order to assist applicants in preparing
their proposals and to facilitate the expeditious evaluation by the review panel, proposals should be organized
and presented in the same sequential order as the Evaluation Criteria in Part IV of this announcement.



C. Hand-Delivered Proposals



Proposals should be mailed at least five (5) days prior to the closing date. However, if proposals are hand-delivered,
they shall be received at the designated place by 2 p.m., Eastern Time by May 20, 1994. All overnight mail will be considered
to be hand-delivered and must be received at the designated place by the specified closing date. Telegraphed and/or
faxed proposals will not be honored. Failure to adhere to the above instructions will be a basis for a determination
of nonresponsiveness.



D. Late Proposals



Any proposal received at the office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt will
not be considered unless it is received before award is made and it_

(1) Was sent by U.S. Postal Service registered or certified mail not later than the fifth calendar day before the date
specified for receipt of application (e.g., an offer submitted in response to a solicitation requiring receipt of
applications by the 20th of the month must have been mailed by the 15th); or

(2) Was sent by U.S. Postal Service Express Mail Next Day Service_Post Office of Addresses, not later than 5 p.m. at
the place of mailing two working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals. The term ``working days''
excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.

The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a late proposal sent either by U.S. Postal Service
registered or certified mail is the U.S. postmark both on the envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt from the
U.S. Postal Service. Both postmarks must show a legible date or the proposal, shall be processed as if mailed late.
``Postmark'' means a printed, stamped, or otherwise placed impression (exclusive of a postage meter machine impression
that is readily identifiable without further action as having been supplied and affixed by employees of the U.S. Postal
Service on the date of mailing. Therefore, applicants should request the postal clerk to place a legible hand cancellation
``bull's eye'' postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper.

The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a late proposal sent by ``Express Mail Next Day Service_Post
Office to Addressee'' is the date entered by the post office receiving clerk on the ``Express Mail Next Day Service_Post
Office to Addressee'' label and the postmark on both the envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt from the U.S.
Postal Service. ``Postmark'' has the same meaning as defined above. Therefore, applicants should request the postal
clerk to place a legible hand cancellation ``bull's eye'' postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper.



E. Withdrawal of Proposals



Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice or telegram (including mailgram) received at any time before award.
Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an applicant or an authorized representative thereof, if the representative's
identity is made known and the representative signs a receipt for the proposal before award.

F. Period of Performance


The period of performance will be 12 months from the date of grant execution.


G. Funding


DOL has set aside up to $500,000 to be disbursed. It is anticipated that multiple grant awards will be made with the maximum
award amount to be $100,000.


H. Option To Extend


Based on the availability of funds, effective program operation, and the needs of the Department, the grant(s) may
be extended for up to one (1) additional year.


Part III_Statement of Work


The Department of Labor is soliciting proposals for the development or enhancement of interfirm networks of companies
focused on human resource development and related workplace practices in member small businesses.
The proposals should discuss the following items:
1. The applicant's vision of how the project will contribute to the Department of Labor's mission to ensure that all
Americans have access to the resources they require to successfully manage their job lives, and that U.S. businesses
have access to the skilled workers and technical assistance (training, labor-management relations, work restructuring,
basic skills, workplace practices) resources they need to successfully compete in a global economy.
2. An analysis of economic, technological and workplace trends, within a consortium's geographic region or industrial
sector, that require specific skills or workers in consortium small businesses and demonstrate the need for the learning
consortium.
3. Clear articulation of workforce and workplace development goals of the consortium and its member organizations,
as tied to identified economic, technological and workplace trends; and a justification of the consortium approach
as the best vehicle for accomplishing these goals.
4. The identification of ``best practice'' examples of successful learning consortia both in the U.S. and abroad
and suggested incorporation of ``lessons learned'' from those examples in the proposed project.
5. A plan for the development of a learning system for the member firms linked to the internal training and workplace
practices needs of the firms as well as to the collective goals and objectives of the network.
6. Identification of training and technical assistance providers involved in the consortium learning system, that
can address member firms' workforce and workplace development needs.
7. A plan for the evaluation of outcomes related to the consortium's workforce and workplace development and training
goals.
8. The role of the learning consortium in the development and implementation of broader regional economic development
strategies.
9. The role of the consortium in the retraining and reemployment of dislocated workers.
10. The proposal should explain its commitment to maintaining the workforce and workplace development focus of the
consortium through a contribution of resources to these activities during the grant period, as well as in the future.
The role of the network broker and the host organization is key to successful planning and implementation of the project.
The network broker and host organization must be able to assist the consortium in identifying its workforce and workplace
development goals, help choose the targeted companies, facilitate the needs assessment, coordinate program development
with the service providers, prepare the development plan, serve as a liaison between the consortium and service providers,
monitor the training and the workplace change process, and prepare the evaluation and dissemination of results.

<DOCTITLE>Utah State Standards; Approval</DOCTITLE>





Background: 

Part 1953 of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations prescribes procedures under section 18 of the Occupational Safety
and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 667), (hereinafter called, the Act) by which the Regional Administrator for Occupational
Safety and Health (hereinafter called the Regional Administrator) under delegation of authority from the Assistant
Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health (hereinafter called the Assistant Secretary), (29 CFR 1953.4)
will review and approve standards promulgated pursuant to a State Plan which has been approved in accordance with
section 18(c) of the Act and 29 CFR part 1202.

On January 10, 1973, notice was published in the 

Federal Register 

(38 FR 1178) of the approval of the Utah State Plan and the adoption of subpart E to part 1952 containing the decision.
Utah was granted final approval on section 18(e) of the Act on July 16, 1985. By law (section 63-46a-16 Utah
Code,) the Utah Administrative Rulemaking Procedure is the authorized compilation of the administrative law of
Utah and ``shall be received in all the courts, and by all the judges, public officers, commissioners, and departments
of the State government as evidence of the administrative law of the State of Utah * * *.'' The Utah Occupational
Safety and Health Division revised its Administrative Rulemaking Act (chapter 46a, title 63, Utah annotated, 1953)
which became effective on April 29, 1985. On May 6, 1985, a State Plan Supplement was submitted to the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for approval and publication in the 

Federal Register

. The plan supplement was published in the 

Federal Register 

(53 FR 43688) on October 28, 1988. The supplement provides for adoption of Federal standards by reference through
the publication of standards in the Utah State Digest. Utah now adopts Federal OSHA standards by reference using the
OSHA numbering system.

Following the publication date, the agency shall allow at least 30 days for public comment on the rule. During the public
comment period the agency may hold a hearing on the rule. Except as provided in statutes 63-46a-6 and 63-46a-7,
a proposed rule becomes effective on any date specified by the agency which is no fewer than 30 nor more than 90 days after
the publication date. The agency shall provide written notification of the rule's effective date to the office. Notice
of the effective date shall be published in the next issue of the bulletin.

OSHA regulations (29 CFR 1953.22 and 1953.23) require that States respond to the adoption of new or revised permenent
Federal Standards by State promulgation of comparable standards within six months of OSHA publication in the 

Federal Register

, and within 30 days for emergency temporary standards. Although adopted State Standards or revisions to standards
must be submitted for OSHA review and approval under procedures set forth in part 1953, they are enforceable by the
State prior to Federal review and approval. The State submitted statements along with copies of the Utah State Digest,
to verify the adoption by reference of a standard for the Code of Federal Regulations. The adoption by reference standards
actions occurred as follows: The Industrial Commission of Utah, Occupational Safety and Health Division, adopted
by reference on December 1, 1993, the Federal Standard, Lead Exposure in Construction; Interim Final Rule of 29 CFR
part 1910 as published in 58 FR 26590. The effective data of the State Rule was January 3, 1994.



Decision: 

The statement of incorporation of the aforementioned Federal Standard by reference has been printed in the Utah Administrative
Code. The code contains the statement of the incorporation of Federal Standards by reference as compiled by the Occupational
Safety and Health Division of the Industrial Commission of Utah. Copies of the Utah Administrative Code have been
reviewed and verified at the Regional Office. OSHA has determined that the Federal Standards incorporated by reference
from 29 CFR part 1910 are identical to Federal Standards with no differences and therefore approves the Utah Standards.



Location of Supplement For Inspection and Copying. 

A copy of the standards along with the approved plan may be inspected and copied during normal business hours at the
following location: Office of the Regional Administrator, room 1576 Federal Office Building, 1961 Stout Street,
Denver, Colorado 80294; Utah State Industrial Commission, UOSH Offices at 160 East 300 South, Salt Lake City, Utah
84151; and the Director, Federal-State Operations, room N3700, 200 Constitution Ave, NW., Washington, DC 20210.



Public Participation. 

Under 29 CFR 1953.2 (c), the Assistant Secretary may prescribe alternative procedures, or show any other good cause
consistent with applicable laws, to expedite the review process. The Assistant Secretary finds that good cause exists
for not publishing the supplements to the Utah State Plan as a proposed change and makes the Regional Administrator's
approval effective upon publication for the following reason(s): The Standards were adopted in accordance with

<DOCTITLE>Florida Power and Light Co.; Issuance of Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact </DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or the staff) is considering the issuance of proposed amendments
which would change the expiration date for Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-31 and DPR-41 issued to
Florida Power and Light Company (the licensee), for operation of the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Units 3 and 4,
(Turkey Point or the facility) located in Dade County, Florida. The proposed amendments would extend the operating
license (OL) terms for Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 from April 27, 2007 to July 19, 2012 and to April 10, 2013, respectively.




Environmental Assessment 



Identification of Proposed Action 



The currently-licensed term for Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 is 40 years commencing with the issuance of the construction
permits (April 27, 1967). The operating licenses expire on April 27, 2007. Accounting for the time that was required
for plant construction, this represents an effective operating license term of approximately 34 years for each unit.
By application dated February 25, 1992, the licensee requested recapture of the construction period in the 40-year
OL term, thus extending the operating license terms for Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 to July 19, 2012 and April 10, 2013,
respectively. The granting of the proposed license amendments would allow the licensee to operate Turkey Point Units
3 and 4 for an addition 5.25 years and 6 years, respectively, beyond the current expiration dates. Additional information
in support of the request is provided by the licensee's letters of June 22 and July 13, 1993. 



Summary of Environmental Assessment 



The Commission has reviewed the potential environmental impact of the proposed change and issued ``Environmental
Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact by the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation Related to the Change
in Expiration Dates of Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-31 and DPR-41, Florida Power and Light Company,
Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Units 3 and 4, Docket Nos. 50-250 and 50-251'' dated April 7, 1994. This
review considered both the radiological and non-radiological impacts of extended operation compared with those
projected in the Turkey Point Final Environmental Statement (FES) dated July 1972. This review evaluated the historical
annual collective dose at the facility, dose reduction measures implemented by the licensee, and more recent Commission
policy contained in a memorandum from the Executive Director for Operations to the Commission dated August 19, 1982.




Radiological Impacts 



The staff considered potential radiological impacts on the general public residing in the vicinity of the facility
and workers at the plant due to normal radiological releases, potential accidents, the uranium fuel cycle, and the
transportation of fuel and waste. 

The 1990 U.S. Government Census population update shows that the nearest population centers to Turkey Point, all
to the west and north beyond a 5-mile radius from the facility, are lower than the population projections in the FES.
The FES conservatively estimated a population of 170,000 in the year 1986 within the 10-mile emergency planning zone
(EPZ) compared to the U.S. Government Census population update of 105,679 for the year 1990 and projected population
of 144,638 for the year 2013. The exclusion area and nearest population center, and local land usage, are not changed.
The site will continue to meet the requirements of 10 CFR part 100. Station radiological effluents to unrestricted
areas during normal operation have been well within Commission regulations relating to as-low-as-reasonably-achievable
(ALARA) limits, and are indicative of future releases. As a result of low radiological exposure from plant releases
during normal operation, low public risk from accidents, and conservative population estimates within the EPZ,
the environmental impact findings in the FES are not affected. With regard to station personnel, the licensee complies
with Commission guidance and requirements for keeping radiation exposures ALARA for occupational exposures. The
licensee will continue to comply with these requirements during the additional years of facility operation and apply
advanced technology when available and appropriate. Accordingly, radiological impacts on individuals, both onsite
and offsite, are not significantly changed from those previously estimated in the FES and its conclusions remain
valid. 

The net annualized environmental effects associated with the uranium fuel cycle, which form the basis for Table S-3,
``Table of Uranium Fuel Cycle Environmental Data'' of 10 CFR 51.51, remain essentially unchanged from those addressed
in the FES. The environmental impacts attributable to the transportation of spent fuel and waste from the Turkey Point
site with respect to the normal conditions of transport and possible incidents in transport would continue to be as
set forth in Summary Table S-4, ``Environmental Impact of Transportation of Fuel and Waste to and from One Light
Water-Cooled Nuclear Power Reactor'' of 10 CFR part 51.52. The combined storage capacity of the two spent fuel pools
is 2808 fuel cells and, based upon the licensee's current projections, this capacity will accommodate spent fuel
discharges throughout the recaptured operating period for Turkey Point Units 3 and 4.

The estimated additional volume of low-level radioactive waste (LLRW) that would be generated and would require
disposal during the approximately 11.25 additional reactor-years of operation is a small fraction of the volume
of LLRW that will be produced by the facility during the current authorized operating period. The staff, therefore,
concluded that conditions of 10 CFR 51.52(c) will be met and that no new analysis of the environmental effects of transportation
of fuel and waste to and from the reactor is necessary.



Non-Radiological Impacts



The FES evaluated the non-radiological impacts associated with 40-year facility operation. The assumptions and
bases for the FES assessments have not changed and have remained valid throughout the operating period of the facility.
The licensee will continue to submit annual non-radiological environmental reports concerning unusual or important
events impacting the environment and comply with applicable Federal, State and local agency requirements relating
to environmental protection. Compliance with these requirements will preclude any significant non-radiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.



Alternative to the Proposed Action



As an alternative to the proposed action, the staff considered denial of the proposed action. The denial alternative
is, in effect, the same as the ``no-action'' alternative. Denial of the application would result in no change in current
environmental impacts since the environmental impacts of the proposed action are insignificant.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action did not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the FES dated July 1972, related to
operation of the facility.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The NRC staff consulted with the State of Florida regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. The State
of Florida had no comments on the proposed action.



Finding of No Significant Impact



The Commission has reviewed the FES and the additional information provided by the licensee to determine the environmental
impact of operation of the facility for the proposed additional 11.25 reactor-years. Based upon the foregoing environmental
assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of
the human environment. Therefore, the Commission has determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.31, not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed action.

For further details with respect to this action, see (1) the application for amendments dated February 25, 1992, and
additional information provided by the licensee's letters of June 22, and July 13, 1993, (2) ``Final Environmental
Statement Related to the Operation of Turkey Point,'' Florida Power and Light Company, Docket Nos. 50-250 and
50-251 dated July 1972, and (3) the Environmental Assessment dated April 7, 1994. These documents are available

Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Options Clearing Corporation; Notice of Amendment to Filing and Order Granting
Accelerated Approval to Proposed Rule Change Amending the Valuation Rate Applied to Securities Deposited as Clearing
Margin


April 14, 1994.


On May 4, 1992, The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'')
a proposed rule change pursuant to section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 relating to the valuation of securities deposited as clearing margin (File No. SR-OCC-92-13).
On June 8, 1992, OCC filed a technical amendment with the Commission.
 Notice of the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on September 17, 1992, to solicit comment from interested persons.
 Two comments letters supporting the proposal were received by the Commission.
 On March 9, 1994, OCC again filed an amendment with the Commission.
 The Commission is publishing this notice and order to solicit comments on the amendment to the filing and to approve
the amended proposal on an accelerated basis.








I. Description of the Proposal


A. The Proposal


The proposed rule change amends the rate used to value equity and corporate debt issues deposited for clearing margin
purposes pursuant to OCC Rule 604(d)(1).
 Currently, OCC Rule 604(d)(1) provides that deposited stock and convertible bonds shall be valued on a daily basis
at the maximum loan value permitted under the provisions of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (``FRB'')
 or at such lower value as the OCC Membership/Margin Committee may prescribe, and that non-convertible debt shall
be valued on a daily basis at 70% of current market value or at such lower value as the Membership/Margin Committee may
prescribe.
 Interpretations and Policies (``I&P'') .09 to OCC Rule 604 currently provides that for clearing margin purposes
equity and debt issues shall not be valued in excess of 50% of current market value.
 The proposal permits OCC to value deposits of stocks and bonds
 at 60% of current market value or at such lower rate as determined by OCC's Membership/Margin Committee.

OCC also is amending its Rule 705, which describes the forms of margin that may be deposited for cross-margin obligations,
to provide that common stock may be deposited as margin only if mutually acceptable to OCC and the participating commodities
clearing organization (``CCO''). Such deposits, if acceptable, will be valued in accordance with the cross-margining
agreement between OCC and the participating CCO. This amendment is intended to preserve OCC's and the participating
CCO's rights to determine whether they will accept common stock as a form of margin collateral, and it provides a means
for OCC and the participating CCO to value these deposits without requiring OCC to further amend Rule 705. 



B. OCC's Valued Securities Program



In 1975, OCC proposed to institute a program through which it would accept deposits of common stocks as clearing margin
collateral (``valued securities program'') under Rule 604(d).
 The novelty of the proposed program, however, resulted in extensive regulatory review by the staffs of the FRB and
the Commission. As a result of this review process, several significant changes were made to the OCC valued securities
program that the Commission subsequently approved in 1982.
 In 1983, the Commission approved a proposal whereby OCC was authorized to expand the types of stocks that clearing
members could deposit to meet their clearing margin obligations.
 Pursuant to that amendment, however, clearing members are permitted to deposit only stocks that have a market value
of greater than $10 a share and either (1) are traded on a national securities exchange that has last sale reports collected
and disseminated pursuant to a consolidated transaction reporting plan or (2) are traded in the over-the-counter
market and are designated as a National Market System security.
 The proposal also established that such deposits are to be valued at the lesser of the maximum loan value prescribed
by the FRB in Regulation U for margin stocks or 70% of current market value.










In 1991, the Commission authorized OCC to add preferred stock and corporate debt to the valued securities program.
 To be eligible for deposit as clearing margin collateral, preferred stock has to meet the same eligibility standards
as those previously approved for common stocks. Corporate bonds are required to be listed on a national securities
exchange, to not be in default, and to have a current market value that is readily determinable on a daily basis. The
maximum loan value for preferred stocks and corporate debt also was set at 50% of current market value.

OCC states in its filing that it has accepted deposits of common stock as clearing margin since 1982 and preferred stock
and corporate debt since 1991 and that, accordingly, it has gained substantial experience in operating its valued
securities program. OCC claims that the valued securities program has been successful in (1) reducing OCC's reliance
on letters of credit by expanding acceptable forms of margin deposits and (2) enhancing the efficient allocation
of clearing member capital.





OCC further states in its filing that from the program's commencement clearing members have requested that deposits
of securities be valued at greater than 50% of current market value. OCC has been unable to accommodate these requests
because of its agreement with the staffs of the FRB and the Commission that the OCC clearing margin would be capped at
the maximum loan rate provided by Regulation U for margin securities. In response to OCC's filing, the FRB's staff
has stated that the FRB will not object to an increase in the valuation rate applied to OCC's deposits of debt and equity
issues.
 OCC proposes to value stocks and bonds deposited as clearing margin at a maximum of 60% of current market value or at
such lesser value as OCC's Membership/Margin Committee may prescribe from time to time.




OCC states that in addition to the 60% valuation rate providing a safe level of protection for OCC, there are additional
safeguards in place for its protection. These safeguards include:
(1) The Commission's Uniform Net Capital Rule, which applies to OCC clearing members;





(2) The authority of OCC's Membership/Margin Committee to prescribe a lower valuation rate from time to time; and
(3) OCC Rule 604(d)(1) which, among other things, establishes high eligibility standards for securities in the valued
securities program and limits deposits of valued securities program and limits deposits of valued securities issued
by any one issuer to 10% of the margin requirement of the account for which the securities are deposited.

II. Discussion 



The Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the Act and particularly with Section 17A of the Act.
 Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act
 requires that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to assure the safeguarding of funds in the custody or control
of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible. 






The Commission believes that the effective functioning of the OCC valued securities program and OCC's various financial
safeguards and risk monitoring systems,
 taken as a whole, suggest that an increase in the valuation rate for securities deposited as clearing margin should
not detract from OCC's ability to safeguard securities and funds for which it is responsible. Increasing the valuation
rate also should help reduce OCC's reliance on letters of credit as margin collateral.
 






The Commission also finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date
of publication of notice of the filing of the amendment. Because the comment letters the Commission received to OCC's
proposal as originally filed were in favor of increasing the valuation rate from 50% to 70% for equity and corporate
debt issues deposited for clearing margin, the Commission does not foresee receiving any adverse comment letters
with regard to the March 9, 1994, amendment which amended the filing to increase the valuation rate from 50% to 60%.




III. Solicitation of Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of OCC. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-OCC-92-13
and should be submitted by May 9, 1994. 



IV. Conclusion 



For the reasons discussed above, the Commission believes that the amended proposal is consistent with the requirements
of the Act, particularly with those of section 17A of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. 

It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the above-mentioned proposed rule change (File No. SR-OCC-92-13) be, and hereby is, approved.




For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to
Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3 to Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to a Proposal To List
for Trading Options and Long-Term Options on the Amex Hong Kong Option Index</DOCTITLE>



April 11, 1994.



I. Introduction and Background


On October 27, 1993, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to list for trading options based on the Hong Kong Option Index (``Hong Kong Option Index'' or
``Index'')_an index comprised of Hong Kong stocks traded on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (``HKSE''). The Amex amended
the proposal on February 10, 1994, March 10, 1994, and April 8, 1994.
 Notice of the proposal to approve Index options for listing and trading appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on December 15, 1993 (``Notice'').
 No comments were received on the proposed rule change set forth in the Notice. This order approves the Exchange's proposal.







II. Description of the Proposal


The Amex proposes to trade standardized index option contracts based on the Hong Kong Option Index. The Amex also intends
to list long-term options on the full-value Index, or long-term options on a reduced-value Index that will be computed
at one-tenth of the value of the Index. Recently, the Commission approved an Amex rule proposal to list and trade warrants
based on the Amex Hong Kong 30 Index,
 which is based entirely on the market capitalization of thirty companies traded on the HKSE. The Amex also proposes
to amend Rule 904C(b) to provide for a position limit of 25,000 contracts on the same side of the market, provided no
more than 15,000 of such contracts are in series in the nearest expiration month.

A. Description of the Hong Kong Option Index


The Hong Kong Option Index is identical to the Amex Hong Kong 30 Index,
 except that the Hong Kong Option Index has a different index level, which was recently set at 0.40 times that of the Amex
Hong Kong 30 Index.
 The Hong Kong Option Index is a capitalization-weighted stock index designed and maintained by the Amex, and based
on the capitalizations of 30 stocks that are traded on the HKSE and whose issuers have major business interests located
in Hong Kong.
 The HKSE is the primary trading market for 25 of the 30 Index component stocks, while the primary trading market for
all of the Index component stocks is either Hong Kong or London.








Since the Exchange created the Hong Kong 30 Index on June 25, 1993, its level has risen from an initial 350 to a current
range of 570-600. In late December 1993 and early January 1994, the Amex Hong Kong 30 Index approached the 640
level, before falling to its present level after a recent downturn in the Hong Kong market.
 The Amex has stated its concern that introducing options at an index level and volatility as high as that of the Amex
Hong Kong 30 Index would create very high premiums on near-term series, and that this concern justifies a lower index
level for options. Because the Amex Hong Kong 30 Index serves as the basis for warrant issues, the Amex will continue
to calculate and disseminate the Amex Hong Kong 30 Index at its current level, retaining the ticker symbol ``HKX'',
since it serves as the basis for the Index warrant issues.
 The Hong Kong Option Index, which will serve as the basis for standardized options trading, will use the ticker symbol
``HKO'' (or similar symbol) for both standardized options trading and the underlying Index level.
 The Amex has set the Index level at 0.40 times that of the Amex Hong Kong 30 Index.








As of February 28, 1994, the total capitalization of the Index was US$222.214 billion.
 Market capitalizations of the individual stocks in the Index ranged from high of US$25.101 billion to a low of US$519
million, with the median being US$5.140 billion. The total number of shares outstanding for the stocks in the Index
ranged from a high of approximately 11.152 billion shares to a low of 561.392 million shares. The price per share of
the stocks in the Index, as of February 28, 1994, ranged from a high of US$14.76 to a low of US$0.76. In addition, the average
daily trading volume of the stocks in the Index, for the six-month period ending February 28, 1994, ranged from a high
of 16.826 million shares to a low of 1.449 million shares, with the median being 3.579 million shares. The highest weighted
component stock in the Index accounts for 11.30% of the Index. The five largest Index components account for approximately
43.18% of the Index's value. The lowest weighted component stock comprises 0.23% of the Index.

B. Eligibility Standards for the Inclusion and Maintenance of Component Stocks in the Index


The Amex states that it selects securities comprising the Index based on their market weight, trading liquidity,
and representativeness of the business industries reflected on the HKSE. The Amex will require that each Index component
security be one issued by an entity with major business interests in Hong Kong, listed for trading on the HKSE, and have
its primary trading market located in a country with which the Amex has an effective surveillance sharing agreement.
The Amex will remove any Index component security that fails to meet any of the foregoing listing and maintenance criteria
within 30 days after such a failure occurs.
To ensure that the Index does not consist of a number of thinly-capitalized, low-priced securities with small public
floats and low trading volumes, the Amex has established additional listing and maintenance criteria:
(1) All component securities selected for inclusion in the Index must have, and thereafter maintain, an average daily
capitalization, as calculated by the total number of shares outstanding times the latest price per share (in Hong
Kong dollars), measured over the prior six month period, of at least HK$3 billion (approximately US$380 million);
(2) All component securities selected for inclusion in the Index must have, and thereafter maintain, a minimum free
float value (total freely tradeable outstanding shares less insider holdings), based on a monthly average measured
over the prior three month period, of US$238 million, although up to, but no more than, three Index component securities
may have a free float value of less than US$238 million but in no event less than US$150 million, measured over the same
period;
(3) All component securities selected for inclusion in the Index must have, and thereafter maintain, an average daily
closing price, measured over the prior six month period, not lower than HK$2.50 (approximately US$0.32); and
(4) All component securities selected for inclusion in the Index must have, and thereafter maintain, an average daily
trading volume, measured over the prior six month period, of more than one million shares per day, although up to, but
no more than, three component securities may have an average daily trading volume, measured over the prior six month
period, of less than one million shares per day, but in no event less than 500,000 shares per day.
Beginning in 1994, the Amex will review the Index's component securities on a quarterly basis, conducted on the last
business day in January, April, July, and October. Any component security failing to meet the above listing and maintenance
criteria will be reviewed on the second Friday of the second month following the quarterly review again to determine
compliance with the above criteria. Any Index component stock failing this second review will be replaced by a ``qualified''
Index component stock effective upon the close of business on the following Friday, provided, however, that if such
Friday is not a business day, the replacement will be effective at the close of business on the first preceding business
day. The Amex will notify its membership immediately after it determines to replace an Index component stock.

<PARENT> FR940418-2-00073 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


The Index will be maintained by the Amex and will contain at least thirty component stocks at all times. Pursuant to
Exchange Rule 901C(b), the Amex may change the composition of the Index at any time in order to reflect more accurately
the composition and track the movement of the Hong Kong stock market. Any replacement component stock must also meet
the component stock listing and maintenance standards as discussed above. If the number of Index component securities
in the Index falls below thirty, no new option series based on the Index will be listed for trading unless and until the
Commission approves a rule filing pursuant to section 19(b) of the Act reflecting such change.



At the close of the market on February 28, 1994, the average closing price of the component stocks of the Index was HK$30.70
(US$3.97), with the highest price stock closing at HK$114.00 (US$14.76) and the lowest price stock closing at HK$5.85
(US$0.76). On that same date, of the thirty component stocks included in the Index, four closed at prices lower than
HK$7.50, or approximately US$1.00. As of February 28, 1994, the total market capitalization of the Index component
stocks was US$222.214 billion.








C. Calculation and Settlement of Index





The Hong Kong Option Index is a capitalization-weighted index the value of which is calculated my multiplying the
price of each component security (in Hong Kong dollars) by the number of shares outstanding of each such security,
adding the sums and dividing by the current Index divisor. The Amex has set the Index level at 202.628 at the close of
the market on March 10, 1994. The Amex calculated the Index level by taking the Amex Hong Kong 30 Index, which was at a
level of 506.57 on March 10, 1994, and multiplying it by 0.40.








Because the HKSE does not operate during the Amex's trading hours, the Amex calculates the Index once each day based
on the most recent official closing price of each Index component security as reported by the HKSE. The Amex will administer
the Index, making such adjustments to the divisor as may be necessary in light of stock splits, stock replacements,
or other corporate actions which would cause a discontinuity in the Index value. The Index value is being published
through the Exchange's market data system and will be made available to vendors.








D. Expiration and Settlement





The Exchange's proposed options on the Index are to be European-style (

i.e., 

exercises are permitted at expiration only) and cash-settled. Standard option trading hours for broad-based index
options (9:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. New York time) will apply. Options on the Index will expire on the Saturday following
the third Friday of the expiration month (``Expiration Friday''). The last trading day in an option series will normally
be the second to last business day preceding the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month (normally
at Thursday). Trading in expiring options will cease at the close of trading on the last trading day. The exercise settlement
value for all of the Index's expiring options will be calculated based upon the most recent official closing price
of each of the component securities as reported by the HKSE on the last trading day prior to expiration.

<DOCNO> FR940418-2-00128 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940418-2-00073 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Exchange plans to list options series with expirations in the three near-term calendar months and in the two additional
calendar months in the March cycle. In addition, longer term option series having up to thirty-six months to expiration
may be traded.
 In lieu of such long-term options on a full-value Index level, the Exchange states that it may instead list long-term,
reduced-value put and call options which will be computed by dividing the value of the full-value Index by 10 and rounding
the resulting figure to the nearest one-hundredth. The interval between expiration month for either full-value
or reduced-value long-term options will not be less than six months. The strike price interval for reduced-value
Index options will be no less than $2.50 instead of $5.00. 





E. Applicable Options Rules 
 


Options on the Index, including long-term options based on the full or a reduced-value Index, will be governed by Exchange
Rules 900 C through 980C. These rules govern matters such as disclosure, account approval and suitability, position
and exercise limits, margin, trading halts and suspensions, and floor procedures. Surveillance procedures currently
used by the Exchange to monitor trading in each of the Exchange's other index options will also be used to monitor trading
in regular and long-term options on the Index. The Index is deemed by the Exchange to be a Stock Index Option under Amex
Rule 901C(a), and a Broad Stock Index Group under Amex Rule 900C(b)(1). 
 
 
The Exchange seeks to list near-the-money (

i.e.

, within ten points above or below the current index value) option series on the Index at 21/2 point strike (exercise)
price intervals when the value of the Index is below 200 points. The Exchange has also proposed to amend Rule 904C(b)
to establish a position limit of 25,000 contracts on the same side of the market, provided no more than 15,000 of such
contracts are in series in the nearest expiration month. 
 
The Exchange states that it expects the Hong Kong Option Index to attract a substantial number of customers, including
institutional activity, and is therefore seeking Commission approval permitting it to use its Auto-Ex system for
orders in the Index options of up to 50 contracts.
 Auto-Ex is the Exchange's automated execution system which provides for the automatic execution of market and marketable
limit orders at the best bid or offer at the time the order is entered. 
 




III. Discussion 
 


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, the requirements of section
6(b)(5) of the Act.
 Specifically, the Commission finds that the trading of options based on the Hong Kong Option Index, including long-term
options based on either the full or a reduced-value of the Index, will serve to protect investors, promote the public
interest, and help to remove impediments to a free and open securities market by providing investors with a means to
hedge exposure to market risk associated with the Hong Kong equity market and provide a surrogate instrument for trading
in the Hong Kong securities market.
 In particular, Hong Kong Option Index options will benefit U.S. investors by allowing them to obtain differential
rates of return on a capital outlay if the Hong Kong Option Index moves in a favorable direction within a specified time
period. Of course, if the Hong Kong Option Index moves in the wrong direction or fails to move in the right direction,
the options expire worthless and the investors will have lost their entire investment. Thus, the trading of options
based on the Hong Kong Option Index will provide investors with a valuable hedging vehicle that should reflect accurately
the overall movement of the Hong Kong equity market.

Nevetheless, the trading of options based on the Index, including long-term options based on either the full or a reduced-value
of the Index, raises several concerns, namely issue related to customer protection, index design, surveillance,
and market impact. The Commission believes, for the reasons discussed below, that the Amex has adequately addressed
these concerns. 



A. Customer Protection 



The Commission believes that a regulatory system designed to protect public customers must be in place before the
trading of sophisticated financial instruments, such as Hong Kong Option Index options, can commence on a national
securities exchange. The Commission notes that the trading of standardized exchange-traded options occurs in an
environment that is designed to ensure, among other things, that; (1) The special risks of options are disclosed to
public customers; (2) only investors capable of evaluating and bearing the risks of options trading are engaged in
such trading; and (3) special compliance procedure are applicable to options accounts. Accordingly, because the
Index options will be subject to the same regulatory regime as the other standardized options currently traded on
the Amex, the Commission believes that adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the protection of investors in Index
options. 



B. Index Design and Structure 



The Commission finds that it is appropriate and consistent with the Act to classify the Index as a broad-based index.
In addition, the basic character of the reduced-value Hong Kong Option Index, which is comprised of the same component
securities as the Hong Kong Option Index, and calculated by dividing the Hong Kong Option Index by ten, is essentially
identical to the Hong Kong Option Index. Specifically, the Commission believes the Index is broad-based because
it reflects a substantial segment of the Hong Kong equities market. First, the Index consists of 30 actively traded
stocks traded on the HKSE. Second, the total capitalization of the Index, as of February 28, 1994, was US$222.214 billion,
with the market capitalization of the individual stocks in the Index ranging from a high of US$23.48 billion to a low
of US$549 million, with a median value of US$3.89 billion. Third, the Index includes stocks of companies from a broad
range of industries and no industry segment comprises more than 25.78% of the Index's total value. Fourth, no single
stock comprises more than 14.92% of the Index's total value and the percentage weighting of the five largest issues
in the Index accounts for 45.86% of the Index's value. Fifth, the Index component stock listing and maintenance criteria
will serve to ensure that the Index maintains its broad representative sample of stocks in the Hong Kong stock market.
 Accordingly, the Commission believes it is appropriate to classify the Index as broad-based. 








C. Surveillance 



In evaluating derivative instruments, the Commission, consistent with the protection of investors, considers
the degree to which the derivative instrument is susceptible to manipulation. The ability to obtain information
necessary to detect and deter market manipulation and other trading abuses is a critical factor in the Commission's
evaluation. It is for this reason that the Commission requires that there be a surveillance sharing agreement in place
between an exchange listing or trading derivative product and the exchange(s) trading the stocks underlying the
derivative contract, and that the agreement specifically enables officials to surveil trading in the derivative
product and its underlying stocks.
 Such agreements provide a necessary deterrent to manipulation because they facilitate the availability of information
needed to investigate fully a potential manipulation if it were to occur. For foreign stock index derivative products,
these agreements are especially important to facilitate the collection of necessary regulatory, surveillance
and other information from foreign jurisdictions.

To address the foregoing concerns, the Amex has entered into a surveillance sharing agreement with the HKSE that provides
for the exchange of information relating to the trading of Index options on the Exchange and trading in the component
securities of the Index on the HKSE.
 The agreement, among other things, provides for the sharing of time and sales information, clearing data, and the
identity of persons who have bought or sold securities. This agreement obligates the Amex and the HKSE to compile and
transmit all relevant market surveillance information and to resolve in ``good faith'' any disagreements regarding
requests for information in response thereto. In addition, the Amex has represented that if information pursuant
to the surveillance sharing agreement is not promptly forthcoming from the HKSE, options based on the Index will be
removed from trading on the Amex.






The Commission believes that the surveillance sharing agreement entered into between the Amex and HKSE adequately
addresses its concerns relating to the ability of the Amex to detect and deter manipulation of the Index through the
use of the Index component stocks.

D. Market Impact



The Commission believes that the listing and trading of Hong Kong Index options, including long-term options based
on either the full or a reduced value of the Index, on the Amex will not adversely affect the securities markets in the
U.S. or Hong Kong.

29

 First, the existing index option surveillance procedures of the Amex will apply to options based on the Index. Second,
the Commission notes that the Index is broad-based and diversified and includes highly capitalized securities that
are actively traded on the HKSE. Third, the Commission notes that at the present time, index options and futures contracts
based on another Hong Kong market index, the Hang Seng Index, are traded on Hong Kong securities and futures exchanges,
and that numerous warrants and off-exchange options based on the Hang Seng Index and other Hong Kong related indexes
are traded worldwide. Fourth, the position limit of 25,000 contracts on the same side of the market, provided no more
than 15,000 of such contracts are in series in the nearest expiration month, will serve to minimize potential manipulation
and market impact concerns.

30

 Fifth, the risk to investors of contra-party non-performance will be minimized because Index regular and long-term
options will be issued and guaranteed by the Options Clearing Corporation just like any other standardized option
traded in the United States.






The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. The purpose and effect of Amendment No. 1 is limited to renaming the Index, clarifying that options based on the Index
will begin trading at a certain Index level, and reaffirming that regular Index options will be subject to 21/2 point
strike intervals if the Index falls below 200. These are non-substantive changes. Amendment No. 2 establishes an
Index level of 0.40 times that of the Amex Hong Kong 30 Index. The Commission shares the Amex's concern that the introduction
of options at the current higher Amex Hong Kong 30 Index level with a standardized 100 multiplier could result in very
high premiums on near-term series, even those slightly out-of-the-money.

31

 By introducing a lower Index level for standardized options, Amendment No. 2 addresses this concern, thereby strengthening
the Exchange's proposal. Amendment No. 3 reduces from 99 contracts to 50 contracts the maximum number of contracts
for market and marketable limit orders in options on the Hong Kong Option Index for which the Amex Auto-Ex system may
be used. The Commission believes that reducing the number of contracts subject to Auto-Ex will ensure that only relatively
small orders are entitled to automatic execution at the current quote and that larger orders are exposed to the floor
for potential price improvement. Further, no comments were received on the original Auto-Ex proposal. Amendment
Nos. 1, 2, and 3 help to remove impediments to a free and open securities market and facilitate transactions in securities.
Additionally, no comments were received on the proposed rule change set forth in the original notice. Therefore,
the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 19(b)(2) of the Act to approve Amendment Nos. 1,
2, and 3 to the proposal on an accelerated basis.





IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3.
Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission,
450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Amex-93-32
and should be submitted by (insert date 21 days from date of publication).



V. Conclusion



For the reasons set forth above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements
of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular,
the requirements of section 6(b)(5).

32









It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (SR-Amex-93-32), as amended, is approved.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule
Change Relating to Specifications and Study Outline for the Registered Options Limited Representative Examination</DOCTITLE>



April 11, 1994.



On March 23, 1989, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to establish examination questions, specifications, and a study outline for a Registered
Options Limited Representative Examination (``Series 42'') to be administered by the NASD.







The proposed rule change was published for comment in the 

Federal Register

 on April 12, 1989.
 The Commission received a total of seven comment letters opposing the proposed rule change. The comment letters were
submitted by the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''),
 the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''),
 the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx''),
 and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'')
 The Commission also received two letters from the NASD in response to those comment letters.












I. Background



Since the inception of the Series 7 General Securities Representative Examination program (``Series 7'') in 1974,
 the NASD has continually maintained limited qualification programs for specialized product areas.
 The NASD represents that the limited qualification programs provide qualification mechanisms that are appropriate
to NASD-only member firms that are involved in limited aspects of the securities industry.
 Until 1988, the NASD maintained two limited representative qualification programs: (1) The Series 6, for investment
company products and variable contracts; and (2) the Series 22, for direct participation programs.
 In 1988, the NASD implemented the Series 62 examination (``Series 62'') which qualifies candidates to sell only stocks,
bonds, rights, warrants, closed-end investment company shares, real estate investment trusts, and money market
funds.
 The NASD has also acted as the administrative agent for the Series 52 Municipal Securities Representative Examination
since it became effective in 
1978.











II. Description of the Proposal



The NASD is now proposing to establish a Series 42 examination which would be used to qualify persons seeking registration
as registered options representatives (``RORs'') for options overlying equity, debt, foreign currency, and index
options. The Exchange represents that the Series 42 examination, when combined with the NASD's other limited product
examinations and the Series 52 examination would provide an alternate to the Series 7 for full general securities
representative registration.






The examination will be a ninety-minute, 50 question multiple-choice examination, covering all option product
areas. A prerequisite to registration as an ROR is registration as a Corporate Securities Limited Representative
which requires passing the Series 62, or registration as a General Securities Registered Representative which requires
passing the Series 7.






III. Comments Received on the Proposal



The Commission received comment letters from the Amex, Phlx, NYSE, and CBOE in opposition to the proposal, and response
letters from the NASD.
 The commentators raised objections regarding the utility of the Series 42 and believe that the availability of an
alternative qualification scheme to the existing Series 7 could result in investor and regulatory confusion, and
could limit investors' access to the options markets.

<TEXT>
 


A. Utility of the Series 42 




The Amex, Phlx, NYSE, and CBOE argue that the usefulness of the Series 42 is limited because broker-dealers who trade
options should understand the entire marketplace, especially instruments which underlie options. The Amex believes
that the Series 42 will result in broker-dealers having only a narrow understanding of just one type of product, namely
options.
 Furthermore, the Amex, CBOE, NYSE, and Phlx each believe that the Series 7 is the most effective way of ensuring that
the investing pubic will be served by qualified and informed options representatives because the examination covers
virtually every securities product trading on U.S. exchanges and the NASD Automated Quotation System (``NASDAQ'').







The Phlx, CBOE, and NYSE believe that except for the Series 62,
 the NASD's current limited product examinations can be justified because these examinations are intended to accommodate
limited purpose broker-dealers and their representatives whose securities activities are limited to specific,
discrete product lines, such as investment company products/variable annuities 
(Series 6), direct participation programs (Series 22), and 
municipal securities (Series 52) and, therefore, the potential 
for investor confusion is minimal.
 In this context, the CBOE 
notes that unlike the Series 42 and 62, the NASD's other limited 
product exams do not conflict with the current Series 7 test 
because such non-exchange traded securities are within the 
regulatory purview of the over-the-counter market.
 Further, 
the Phlx believes that the same economic efficiencies will not be 
realized from the implementation of the Series 42 because there 
is not a sufficient number of firms whose business is limited 
solely to options, or to corporate securities and options, to 
achieve these efficiencies.









Finally, the CBOE and Phlx argue that the usefulness of the 
Series 42 is limited because it is likely that no national securities exchange will recognize the examination.





B. Investor Confusion 




The CBOE and NYSE argue that the Series 42 will confuse investors by fragmenting the elements of qualification for
the offering of listed securities options contracts, thus requiring an investor to determine whether or not his stockbroker
is 


 qualified to accept his orders in certain products.
 The CBOE 
and NYSE also believe that the knowledge and capabilities of a 
limited product stockbroker may not be as sound as those of a 
stockbroker who is qualified for all products in the securities 
markets. For this reason, the CBOE and NYSE recommend that 
limited product representatives be required to disclose 
limited qualifications in writing.







Further, the Phlx argues that use of the Series 42 could 
confuse and mislead public investors by creating specialized 
representatives within general purpose firms.
 The Phlx 
believes that it is possible that a representative qualified 
under the Series 42 and Series 62 examinations would be 
unqualified to make recommendations on the range of available 
investment products suitable to a particular customer, or might 
seek to dissuade an investor from pursuing certain otherwise 
appropriate investment products because the representative is not 
qualified to recommend them.
 Further, the Phlx believes that 
because there is no requirement for disclosing the capacities in 
which a representative is qualified, a customer would not know 
whether a representative was fully qualified, nor be able to 
assess any possible ``extraneous motives'' for a representative's 
advice.

C. Regulatory Confusion


The Phlx argues that because the Series 42 covers a product traded almost exclusively on the nations options exchanges,
those exchanges should have substantial input in determining the qualifications of representatives who market
exchange-traded options.
 The Phlx states that it is unclear whether the Series 42 is sufficient to qualify a representative to trade certain
products, such as non-equity options and whether the examination will be updated to encompass new exchange-traded
products.






The Phlx argues that regulatory confusion is also created because it does not appear likely that any exchange will
recognize the validity of the Series 42.
 The Phlx believes that regulatory concern is raised by Phlx products, such as foreign currency options being marketed
to customers by representatives who have not passed the Series 7, which is one of the Exchange's qualification requirements.






Further, the Phlx and CBOE believe that the Series 42 raises concerns for their member firms because the Phlx and CBOE
believe that they will have to notify their members that they may incur liability by accepting orders from broker-dealers
whose representatives are not Series 7 qualified if the exchanges determine that successful completion of the Series
42 (and Series 62) is inadequate for entry into their markets.





The CBOE believes that regulatory concern is raised by the Series 42 because individuals registered with organizations
which are members solely of the NASD may have the ability to recommend listed options trading on an exchange without
any assurance that such individuals have the requisite knowledge to do so.





D. Limited Access to Options Markets


The CBOE argues that the introduction of the Series 62 represented the first time since options were integrated into
the Series 7 exam that individuals have been permitted to qualify to trade the underlying securities without being
qualified to trade the derivative product.
 As a result, the CBOE believes the Series 62 permits individuals to deal with the public concerning products with option-like
characteristics (

e.g., 

index warrants) without being qualified to deal in options.
 While these concerns apply to the Series 62, the CBOE believes the NASD should be required to amend that exam to test
for options products rather than introducing the Series 42 as a separate exam.







Similarly, the NYSE and the Phlx argue that the implementation of the Series 42 could result in limiting investor access
to the options markets by erecting artificial barriers that could impede or deny access by customers to closely interrelated
products because their representatives had not been qualified to trade those products.





E. NASD Response to Commentators


The NASD does not agree that the usefulness of the Series 42 is limited.
 The NASD believes that the Series 42 would raise qualification standards in the options regulatory area and provide
a modular alternative route for NASD-only members to achieve a general securities representative status.
 Additionally, the NASD believes that the Series 42 would improve qualification standards by replacing the Put and
Call Questionnaire, which is given ``in-house'' by the member firms, as a method of testing the qualifications of
representatives to trade equity options who have not previously been options qualified.
 The NASD believes the Series 42 would, accordingly, raise qualification standards by eliminating the use of this
questionnaire which is administered by the firms and not by the NASD under test conditions,
 and provide the NASD with a means of maintaining a permanent record of its registered representatives who have taken
the exam and are options qualified.









The NASD further argues that implementation of the Series 42 will not result in investor confusion. The NASD states
that there is no evidence that the introduction of the Series 62 has caused investor confusion.
 The NASD further states that it has not received any inquiries from the investing public which suggest confusion over
broker registration regarding the limited registration categories and that the routine examination of their member
firms by its surveillance staff shows no particular problems in supervising or controlling marketing staffs with
limited registrations, even within general securities firms.
 The NASD believes that the investing public is more concerned with the fact that a representative is registered and
properly qualified with the NASD or a national securities exchange than with the specific examination taken by the
representative.

<DOCNO> FR940418-2-00135 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940418-2-00074 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Finally, the NASD argues that the Series 42 is a substantively adequate examination which will not result in regulatory
confusion. The NASD states that the Series 42 was developed by the same industry participants responsible for the
development and maintenance of the Series 4 Registered Options Principal (``ROP'') Examination. The NASD represents
that these individuals are ROPs at general securities firms which are members of all the option exchanges.





The NASD believes that its modular qualification program is fully comparable to the Series 7 and that it provides needed
flexibility in meeting appropriate qualification standards for the NASD's diverse membership.
 The NASD states that candidates electing the NASD modular approach are subject to five tests totaling 450 questions
compared to the 250-question Series 7 examination.
 The NASD further believes that requiring candidates to take the Series 62 prior to taking the Series 42 adequately
addresses the derivative nature of the options markets.
 The NASD, for these reasons, does not believe that implementation of the Series 42 will lessen the basic qualification
standards for registered representatives.






IV. Discussion


A. General


After a careful review of the proposal, the comment letters received, and the NASD's responses to these comment letters,
the Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act. Specifically,
the Commission believes that implementation of the Series 42 examination is a proper exercise of the NASD's responsibility
under section 15A(g)(3) of the Act
 to prescribe standards of training, experience, and competence for persons associated with NASD members.




The Commission notes that Article III, section 33 of the NASD Rules of Fair Practice grants NASD members or persons
associated with NASD members the authority to effect transactions in options contracts if those transactions are
effected in accordance with the rules, regulations, and procedures adopted by the NASD's Board of Governors. Further,
each person associated with an NASD member whose activities in the investment banking or securities business include
the solicitation and/or sale of options contracts is required, by paragraph 1785(2)(d) of Schedule C to the NASD By-Laws,
to be certified as a registered options representative and pass an appropriate certification examination.
For these reasons, the NASD has the responsibility, under section 15A(g)(3) of the Act, to prescribe standards of
competence for persons associated with NASD member firms who effect transactions in options. The Commission believes
that the Series 42, in conjunction with the Series 62, satisfies the NASD's responsibility for prescribing these
standards for competence. As described below, the Series 42 has been reviewed by the Commission's Division of Market
Regulation and found to be substantively adequate.
 As also discussed below, the Commission does not agree with the commentator's assertions that the usefulness of the
Series 42 is limited or that implementation of the examination will cause regulatory or investor confusion, or will
limit access to the options markets.




B. Utility of the Series 42


The Series 42 will complete the NASD's modular examination program and provide an alternative route to the Series
7 examination for NASD-only members to achieve a general securities representative status. As such, the Series 42
is within the NASD's discretion for providing adequate qualification mechanisms for persons associated with its
members.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940418-2-00136 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940418-2-00074 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission staff has reviewed the Series 42 as proposed and found it to be substantively adequate.
 Furthermore, the NASD has represented that the Series 42 was developed by the same industry participants responsible
for the development and maintenance of the Series 4 ROP examination and that these individuals are ROPs at general
securities firms which are members of all the options exchanges. In addition, the NASD has a written agreement with
the NYSE pursuant to which selected questions from the Series 7 exam are reviewed for use in its limited product examinations
and questions from NASD's limited product exam question banks are sent to the NYSE for possible inclusion in the Series
7.
 The Commission believes that the sharing of this information ensures the comparability of the general and limited
examination programs and the Commission expects this sharing agreement to continue for the NASD's Series 42 examination.
Finally, by requiring successful completion of the Series 62 as a prerequisite for the Series 42, the Commission finds
that the NASD has provided an examination structure which will adequately test a candidate's knowledge of the instrument
that underlie options.
 The requirement that the Series 42 be taken in conjunction with the Series 62 adequately addresses the derivative
nature of the options markets. Successful completion of the Series 62 ensures that a representative will be knowledgeable
about equity securities and their regulation. The knowledge required by the Series 62 exam, combined with the knowledge
required by the Series 42, together would be sufficient to ensure that representatives understand the relationship
between options and the markets that underlie most options transactions.








The Commission does not believe that the options exchanges' failure to recognize the Series 42 will impair the examination's
usefulness to NASD member firms. To the Commission's knowledge, the U.S. securities exchanges do not recognize completion
of the Series 62 as being an adequate demonstration of requisite knowledge for purposes of testing the knowledge and
competence of their members or the registered representatives of their member firms. Exchange members, however,
are permitted, and do, provide clearing and execution services for non-exchange NASD member firms even though some
of the registered representatives at these firms have only completed the Series 62. Implementation of the Series
42 should not alter this situation even if the exchanges do not recognize the Series 42. Additionally, the Series 42
should provide benefits to the NASD, and by extension, NASD members. NASD-only members are currently tested and qualified
to trade options through use of the Put & Call Questionnaire which is administered in-house by member firms. Therefore,
even if the exchanges do not recognize the Series 42, the Commission believes that by replacing the in-house Put &
Call Questionnaire with an options specific exam administered under established testing procedures, the NASD will
be better able to ensure that its members have the requisite knowledge to engage in options transitions. This may also
benefit NASD-only members because the Series 42 may be viewed as being a more accurate and therefore more credible
reflection of a member's knowledge of options products than the Put & Call Questionnaire.


C. Investor Confusion


The Commission does not believe that implementation of the Series 42 will result in investor confusion. Since the
introduction of the Series 62, the NASD has not received inquiries which suggest that investors are confused by the
limited registration categories.
 Further, the Commission notes that the routine examination of NASD member firms by the NASD surveillance staff has
not uncovered any particular problems in supervising or controlling marketing staffs with limited registrations,
even within general securities firms. Accordingly, separate qualification standards for a limited product stockbroker
should not confuse investors or result in the knowledge and capabilities of the broker being less sound than those
of a stockbroker who has qualified for all products in the securities markets. For these reasons, the Commission believes
that there is no factual basis at this time for supporting a requirement that limited product representatives disclose
in writing that their registration is limited.




With respect to the possibility of a limited representative dissuading an investor from certain investment products
because the representative was not qualified to trade those products, such conduct could violate the representative's
fiduciary obligations to his or her customer.
 Further, the NASD's member firm compliance examinations will check for any abuses which could occur as a result of
the NASD's limited registration program. In addition, customers are free to change brokers. If a customer wants to
trade a product that the representative is not qualified to handle, and tries to steer the client from, the customer
can switch to a different representative. Sufficient client demand for uncovered products should force a representative
to broaden his or her qualifications to cover a wider product base.

D. Regulatory Confusion



The Commission does not believe that implementation of the Series 42 will result in regulatory confusion. As a preliminary
matter, neither the Act nor the NASD Rules require the NASD to develop jointly an options examination with the options
exchanges. Although uniformity of tests across self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') would be the most efficient
means of ensuring industry competency, an SRO is still capable of developing an exam to cover its particular membership.
In this regard, the Act permits the NASD to develop an examination that tests the qualifications of individuals associated
with NASD members to trade options.






The Commission also disagrees with the assertion that regulatory concerns are raised by the fact that the options
exchanges may not recognize the validity of the Series 42. The Commission believes that implementing the Series 42
is not inconsistent with the options exchanges retaining the Series 7 as their basic qualification requirement for
exchange member firms.
 Use of the Series 42 by the NASD to test the qualifications of its members to trade options does not diminish the options
exchanges' authority to determine the qualifications of their own members to trade options. The exchanges can continue
to require exchange members to take and pass the Series 7 examination.





The Commission further disagrees with the assertion that individuals registered with NASD member organizations
could recommend listed options transactions trading on an exchange without the exchange knowing that such individuals
have the requisite knowledge to do so. As discussed above, the Commission believes that the Series 42 is adequate to
test the training, experience, and competence of representatives regarding all types of options transactions.

Finally, the Commission does not believe that there will be increased legal liability on options exchange members
because they accepted orders from representatives of NASD-only members who, although not Series 7 qualified, had
passed the Series 42 exam. Implementation of the Series 42 will not alter the 

status quo 

as far as these options exchange members are concerned. These services are currently provided to NASD-only members
who have completed only the Series 62 and the Put & Call Questionnaire. The Commission has not been aware of any
case in which an exchange member has incurred liability based solely on the fact that the exchange member provided
clearing and execution services to a non-Series 7 registered NASD member broker-dealer. The Commission, therefore,
does not believe that replacing the Put & Call Questionnaire with the Series 42 will increase the potential for
exchange member liability in this regard.



E. Limited Access to Options Markets



The Commission disagrees with the assertion that implementation of the Series 42 would result in limiting investor
access to the options markets by erecting artificial barriers that could impede or deny access by customers to closely
inter-related products because their representatives had not been qualified to trade them. The Commission believes
that the Series 42 increases investor access to the options markets because it provides representatives that are
only Series 62 qualified with a procedure for becoming qualified to affect transactions in options without having
to take the Series 7 exam. Further, the Commission believes that the Series 42 provides better testing for qualified
representatives than the current Put & Call Questionnaire administered by firms.

In summary, the Commission believes that the Series 42 exam is an appropriate exercise of the NASD's statutory authority
to ensure qualification of its members. The exam itself is sound and tests options knowledge in depth. Despite the
objections of the options exchanges, the Commission does not believe there is a regulatory reason to disapprove the
Series 42 exam as proposed.

For the reasons set forth above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule changes is consistent with the requirements
of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a registered securities association, and, in particular
the requirements of section 15A,
 and the rules and regulations thereunder.







It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-NASD-89-16) is approved contingent upon the NASD's updating of the exam as necessary
to reflect the changes that have occurred in the options markets since the time that the Series 42 was originally proposed
(

e.g., 

new products) and the Commission's review of the revised examination.
