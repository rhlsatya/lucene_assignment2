National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine, Food and Nutrition Board, Committee on Scientific Evaluation
of WIC Nutrition Risk Criteria; Opportunity To Provide Written Comments, Public Meeting


<AGENCY>

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that the National Academy of Sciences' (NAS) Institute of Medicine (IOM), through its Food
and Nutrition Board (FNB), will conduct the first of two public meetings to obtain additional perspectives about
the scientific base for the nutrition risk crtieria used in the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants,
and Children (WIC). Eligibility for WIC is based in part on nutrition risk. Through a grant from the U.S. Department
of Agriculture's (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), the NAS is reviewing the scientific base for nutrition
risk criteria used in WIC. At the end of the 30-month study, NAS will publish a report and provide copies to FNS containing
its conclusions.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The NAS, through IOM's FNB, formed the Committee on Scientific Evaluation of WIC Nutrition Risk Criteria (committee)
in October 1993 to examine the scientific base for determining nutrition risk criteria used in the WIC program. The
WIC program operates through a preventive approach to health care by providing supplemental foods and nutrition
assessment and education to improve nutritional status and thus to improve pregnancy outcome and growth and development
of infants and children (through 5 years of age). The program links food assistance and health programs by its goal
of improving nutritional status through food delivery and by serving as a gateway to the public health system principally
through Medicaid-delivered health services for pregnant and lactating women, for infants, and for children. Eligibility
for the WIC program is based on income (185 percent of poverty level); status as a pregnant or lactating woman, an infant,
or a child; and nutritional risk.


Nutrition risk criteria include biochemical and anthropometric measurements, nutritionally related medical
conditions, dietary deficiencies that impair or endanger health, and conditions that predispose persons to inadequate
nutrition patterns or nutritionally related medical conditions. The appropriateness of nutrition risk criteria
is an issue of major interest to the WIC community and of great significance to the future direction of the program.
The committee deliberations will address these issues, thereby providing a basis for establishing approriate guidance
for nutrition risk criteria used to establish program eligibility.
The committee will review all WIC nutrition risk factors currently covered by the program. The committee's deliberations
will begin with those risk criteria for which there is substantial scientific literature and move to those for which
there is little or no scientific literature, that are most difficult to quantify, or that are not likely to be affected
by the supplemental food package delivered through the program. NAS plans to identify gaps in scientific knowledge,
to examine specific segments of the WIC population identified to be at risk for each criterion, and if applicable,
to report its findings regarding how to determine who is at risk for each criterion, including numerical values.
Public meetings will solicit information from WIC program administrators, staff, and participants as well as from
researchers in the fields related to the nutrition risk criteria under study. Two public meetings will be conducted
during the course of the committee's work, both in 1994. This first public meeting will be held in Washington, DC. A
second public meeting will be schedule at an upcoming meeting of the committee in 1994 at the NAS west-coast meeting
facility, the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center, Irvine, California. A report of the committee's findings and recommendations
will be published by the end of the study in April 1996.

On March 30, 1994, under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated January 17, 1994, between the Governments
of the United States and the People's Republic of China, the United States Government requested consultations with
the Government of the People's Republic of China with respect to woven pile fabric in Category 224-V.

The U.S. Government has decided to implement a limit for the prorated period beginning on March 30, 1994 and extending
through December 31, 1994.

A summary market statement concerning Category 224-V follows this notice.

Anyone wishing to comment or provide data or information regarding the treatment of Category 224-V, under the
agreement with the the Government of the People's Republic of China, or to comment on domestic production or availability
of products included in Category 224-V, is invited to submit 10 copies of such comments or information to Rita
D. Hayes, Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington,
DC 20230; ATTN: Helen L. LeGrande. The comments received will be considered in the context of the consultations with
the Government of the People's Republic of China.

Comments or information submitted in response to this notice will be available for public inspection in the Office
of Textiles and Apparel, room H3100, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington,
DC.

Further comments may be invited regarding particular comments or information received from the public which the
Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements considers appropriate for further consideration.

The solicitation of comments regarding any aspect of the agreement or the implementation thereof is not a waiver in
any respect of the exemption contained in 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1) relating to matters which constitute ``a foreign affairs
function of the United States.''

The United States remains committed to finding a solution concerning Category 224-V. Should such a solution
be reached in consultations with the Government of the People's Republic of China, further notice will be published
in the 

Federal Register

.

A description of the textile and apparel categories in terms of HTS numbers is available in the CORRELATION: Textile
and Apparel Categories with the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (see

Import Situation and Conclusion
 


U.S. imports of cotton and manmade fiber woven pile fabrics, Category 224-Part, from China surged to 3,004,237
square meters in 1993, double the 1,433,201 square meters imported in 1992. China is the second largest supplier of
cotton and manmade fiber woven pile fabrics, Category 224-part, to the U.S. market, accounting for 21 percent
of total imports in 1993. In 1992, China ranked third among the major suppliers, accounting for 12 percent of total
imports. 
 
The sharp and substantial increase of Category 224-Part imports from China is causing a real risk of disruption
in the U.S. market for cotton and manmade fiber woven pile fabrics.

<SIGNJOB>
U.S. Production, Import Penetration, and Market Share



U.S. production of cotton and manmade fiber woven pile fabrics, Category 224-Part, declined from 52,134,000
square meters in 1989 to 44,243,000 square meters in 1992, a decline of 15 percent. Production continued to decline
in 1993, falling to 32,867,000 square meters during January-September 1993, 4 percent below the January-September
1992 level. In contrast, U.S. imports of cotton and manmade fiber woven pile fabrics, Category 224-Part, nearly
doubled, increasing from 6,063,000 square meters in 1989 to 11,638,000 square meters in 1992. Imports of cotton and
manmade fiber woven pile fabrics continued to increase in 1993, reaching 14,456,512 square meters, 25 percent above
the 1992 level.

The U.S. producers' share of the market for cotton and manmade fiber woven pile fabrics fell from 90 percent in 1989
to 73 percent during January-September 1993, a decline of 17 percentage points. The ratio of imports to domestic production
more than tripled during the same time period, increasing from 12 percent in 1989 to 37 percent during January-September
1993.



</SIGNJOB>
<SIGNJOB>
Duty-Paid Value and U.S. Producers' Price



Approximately 82 percent of Category 224-Part imports from China during 1993 entered the U.S. under HTSUSA
numbers 5801.23.00000_cut weft pile fabrics of cotton, 5801.25.0010_cut warp pile fabrics of cotton weighing over
271 grams per square meter, and 5801.25.0020_cut warp pile fabrics of cotton weighing less than 271 grams per square
meter. These fabrics entered the U.S. at landed duty-paid values below U.S. producers' prices for comparable cotton
and manmade fiber woven pile fabrics.

Commissioner of Customs,


Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229.




Dear Commissioner: This directive amends, but does not cancel, the directive issued to you on January 24, 1994, by
the Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. That directive concerns imports of certain
cotton, wool, man-made fiber, silk blend and other vegetable fiber textiles and textile products, produced or manufactured
in the People's Republic of China and exported during the period which began on January 1, 1994 and extends through
December 31, 1994.


Effective on April 21, 1994 , you are directed to amend the January 24, 1994 directive to separate Category 224 in Group
III into part Categories 224-V
 and 224-O
. 






Also effective on April 21, 1994, you are directed to establish a limit for cotton and man-made fiber woven pile fabric
in Category 224-V, produced or manufactured in China and exported during the period beginning on March 30, 1994
and extending through December 31, 1994 at a level of 2,450,923 square meters
.






Textile products in Category 224-V which have been exported to the United States prior to March 30, 1994 shall
not be subject to the limit established in this directive.

Category 224-V and Category 224-O shall remain subject to the 1994 Group III limit. 



In carrying out the above directions, the Commissioner of Customs should construe entry into the United States for
consumption to include entry for consumption into the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that this action falls within the foreign
affairs exception of the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1).

Sincerely,


</SIGNER>

 Floodplain statement of findings.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This is a Floodplain Statement of Findings for the proposed Waste Area Grouping (WAG) 5, Seep Area D, interim remedial
action at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), prepared in accordance with 10 CFR part 1022. DOE proposes to conduct
the proposed interim remedial action in the 100-year floodplain of White Oak Creek located in Roane County, Tennessee.
DOE prepared a floodplain assessment describing the effects, alternatives, and measures designed to avoid or minimize
potential harm to or within the affected floodplain. DOE will endeavor to allow 15 days of public review after publication
of the statement of findings before implementing the proposed action.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This is a Floodplain Statement of Findings for the proposed interim remedial action at WAG 5 at ORNL, prepared in accordance
with 10 CFR part 1022. A Notice of Floodplain/Wetlands Involvement was published in the 

Federal Register

 [58 FR 51624 (October 4, 1993)] and a floodplain assessment was completed; no wetlands are involved in the proprosed
action. DOE is proposing to capture and treat ground water that is emanating from Seep Area D as a means of reducing the
amount of strontium-90 (90Sr) being discharged into 
Melton Branch, which contributes between 10 and 15 percent of the total amount of 90Sr that passes over White Oak Lake
Dam and enters the Clinch River. 



The proposed action is comprised of the following three components: (1) A collection component consisting of a collection
structure; (2) in-ground treatment component using pipelines to carry ground-water discharge to and from a treatment
chamber for capture of the 90Sr in the ground-water discharge; and (3) a pumping and trucking component using a pipe
transfer line to a truck transfer station for removal of ground-water discharge that has not been effectively treated
for 90Sr removal. Proposed activities associated with the Seep Area D interim removal action would involve less than
a quarter of an acre of the 100-year floodplain of White Oak Creek. The proposed action is not expected to adversely
impact the floodplain or measurably change flood levels. Rather, the proposed action would have an overall positive
effect on the environment and human health by reducing the amount of radioactive contaminants entering the riverine
environment. 

The proposed activities associated with Seep Area D interim remedial action include extending an existing gravel
road in the floodplain by about 
150 feet to gain access to the seep area and installing a collection structure, a supply pipeline to, and discharge
pipeline from, a treatment chamber located outside of the floodplain, a pipe transfer line to a truck transfer station
also located outside of the floodplain, and a single power pole. During construction, a temporary dam, diversion
pump, and flexible pipe would be installed in the floodplain to divert stream water around the construction site.


The collection structure would consist of a gravel bed located under Melton Branch to intercept the ground-water
discharge, a concrete cover to isolate the gravel bed from Melton Branch, and pumps and piping for transferring the
discharge water to either the treatment chamber or truck transfer station. A different structure, but of similar
design, would be installed if final field monitoring data indicate that such a structure would better divert and collect
the ground-water discharge. Regardless of final design, the effects of any such structure on the floodplain would
be negligible. Ground-water discharge in the seep area would be collected in the gravel bed and pumped either to the
treatment chamber or a truck transfer station. The treatment chamber would contain an ion-exchange medium to remove
90Sr. (An ion-exchange medium is a chemical compound, such as zeolite, that selectively adsorbs 90Sr, thereby removing
this radionuclide from the 
ground-water discharge.) Upon entering the treatment chamber, the 
ground-water discharge would pass through the ion-exchange medium and then be released to Melton Branch. Pumping
to the truck transfer station would take place if the ion-exchange medium does not remove sufficient 90Sr (the criteria
for removal has been established at 90 percent as measured from water samples taken from the treatment chamber supply
and discharge pipelines). Tanker trucks would transfer the ground water from the storage tank to the ORNL Process
Waste Treatment Plant for processing. The Process Waste Treatment Plant is an existing, permitted facility. 

The proposed action has been designed to avoid or minimize impacts to the floodplain; negligible adverse impacts
to the floodplain are expected to occur as a result of taking the proposed action. Best management practices would
be strictly adhered to for all proposed activities. Sediment control measures, such as silt fences and diversion
ditches would be used. Excavated soil would be sampled to determine the level of contamination, if any. To minimize
the possibility of any contaminated soil entering the nearby creeks, contaminated soil would be disposed of according
to ORNL construction guidelines. Where possible, disturbed areas would be graded to preconstruction contours,
seeded, and allowed to return to their natural state. Construction is estimated to take between 3 and 5 months. Construction
activities would be scheduled during the dry season and would be substantially reduced and curtailed during unfavorable
weather. 

Several alternatives to the proposed action were considered, including no action, in-ground treatment without
a pipe transfer line to a truck transfer station, collection and transfer to the Process Waste Treatment Plant by tanker
truck without in-ground treatment, collection and transfer to the Process Waste Treatment Plant by pipeline without
in-ground treatment, and on-site treatment. The no-action alternative was deemed least desirable because of the
release of 

90

Sr from the seep area since continued release would not be protective of human health and the environment. The other
alternatives were excluded on the basis of efficiency, implementability, and cost. Effects upon the floodplain
would not be measurably reduced under any of the other alternatives to the proposed action. 

The proposed action has been designed to avoid or minimize impacts to the floodplain and no significant adverse impacts
to the floodplain are expected to occur. The proposed action does conform to applicable State floodplain standards.
DOE will endeavor to allow 15 days of public review after publication of the statement of findings prior to implementing
the proposed action.

<DOCTITLE>Financial Assistance Award; Intent To Award Cooperative Agreement to National Governors' Association </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 United States Department of Energy.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of non-competitive financial assistance award.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy announces that, pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(5), it is making a discretionary financial assistance
award based on the criterion set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(D) to the National Governors' Association (NGA) under
proposed Cooperative Agreement Number DE-FC01-94EW30330. The total estimated funding in the amount of $3,136,517
will be provided to NGA for this effort. NGA currently has an agreement with DOE to facilitate site treatment plan approval
by States and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by providing a forum for regulators to review and discuss
technical policy and implementation issues concerning site plans and to actively participate in the development
of these plans. Funding for the proposed agreement will allow NGA to conduct reviews of DOE conceptual and draft site
treatment plans, participate in discussions with DOE on related Federal Facility Compliance Act of 1992 (FFCAct)
issues, and review other related documents not specifically required by the legislature, but having a bearing on
the site treatment process. 



The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(D) that NGA's unique institutional
ties to the State governments included in this project are required because of the need to balance individual State
interests with national perspectives in the development of DOE's mixed waste treatment plans. 


NGA is the only organization that collectively represents all of the nation's Governors on matters of national and
State policy. This organization's ability to access and mobilize its member governments on multi-state task forces
and committees is needed to provide assessment of key issues identified in the FFCAct and facilitate issue resolution.



The NGA's Center of Policy and Research has substantial expertise in Federal and State environmental programs and
hosting forums for identifying and resolving critical policy and implementation issues. 


The period of performance is 16 months from the date of award.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance award.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7, is announcing its
intention to award a cooperative agreement to Photonic Sensor Systems, Inc. (PSS) for continuation of a project currently
being conducted under a cooperative agreement with Georgia Tech Research Corp. (GTRC), (an affiliate of the Georgia
Institute of Technology) for development of a sensor system to monitor gaseous nitrogen (in the form of ammonia).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

With assistance from DOE through Cooperative Agreement 

#

 DE-FC02-89ID12905, GTRC developed an optical sensor for real time detection of ammonia. The original
application was to monitor ammonia transfer from agricultural croplands, and thereby reduce the amount of nitrogen
fertilizer used; however, PSS has determined that the sensor can also facilitate the use of ammonia in a variety of
industrial applications such as large scale refrigeration where the use of ammonia as the refrigerant has efficiency
advantages in many applications. PSS proposes to continue development of the sensor through commercial prototype
and evaluation of this prototype in full-scale agricultural and industrial settings.



DOE has performed a review in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7 and has determined that the activity to be funded is necessary
to the satisfactory completion of, and is a continuation of, an activity presently being funded by DOE, and for which
competition for support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity and satisfactory completion of the
activity. Also, PSS the new participant, now has the exclusive domestic capability to perform the activity successfully
based on the recent acquisition of both the critical patent rights and technical expertise.

DOE funding for the proposed activity is estimated to be $451,000 and PSS's share is estimated to be $426,000 for a total
of $877,000 over a three year project period.

 Department of Energy, Albuquerque Operations Office.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Workshop for Industrial Partnering with the Multiprogram National Laboratories and the New Independent States
of the Former Soviet Union (NIS IPP).


 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Today's notice is announcing a workshop for the Industrial Partnering Program with the New Independent States (NIS)
of the Former Soviet Union. U.S. private sector entities including industry, universities, foundations and other
organizations which have a strong interest in promoting, and investing in, commercial relationships between U.S.
entities and NIS institutes are invited to attend. 



The purpose of the workshop is to describe to academia and U.S. private sector entities (1) the scope of the NIS Industrial
Partnering Program, (2) the terms of a DOE-U. S. Industry Coalition (USIC) partnership arrangement, (3) the opportunities
available to USIC members, and (4) the terms and conditions of USIC membership. Suggestions for improving the program
will also be solicited.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Foreign Operations Appropriations Act of 1994 contains a provision (section 575) designating $35,000,000 for
a ``Ukraine/Russia Stabilization Partnerships Program.'' The Secretary of Energy has been charged with the implementation
of the program, which allowed for the inclusion of the other New Independent States (NIS), and is now referred to as
the ``NIS Industrial Partnering Program.'' 



The program will have two principal components. Both are intended to assist NIS institutes with converting from defense
to commercial applications thereby reducing the potential for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
The first component is designed to engage the scientists and engineers at key technical and scientific institutes
of the NIS in non-defense activities. This component is an expansion of unclassified cooperative non-defense research
and development activities that have been conducted for some time between individual DOE National Laboratories
and individual NIS institutes. 

The second component is designed to assist in stabilizing the NIS technical and scientific infrastructure, to encourage
the commercialization of NIS technologies, and promote the development in the NIS of market-oriented economies.
A number of cost-shared international industrial partnerships will be formed, each involving at least one DOE National
Laboratory, one NIS institute, and at least one U.S. industrial entity, whose contribution to the success of the partnership
will be critical. A significant portion of the U.S. Government contribution to support the program is intended for
NIS institutes to spur follow-on trade and investment by U.S. industry. 

In July 1993, DOE sponsored a meeting, involving representatives from the National Laboratories and representatives
of U.S. private sector entities with experience in NIS-to-U.S. technology transfer and commercialization. As a
result of that, and subsequent meetings, it was concluded that a program of commercial industry-selected partnerships
to invest in NIS technologies would be facilitated if a consortium of U.S. private sector entities could be established.
The Secretary of Energy would then enter into a cooperative agreement with such a consortium, using the authority,
and under the terms set out in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, the National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act
of 1989, the Cooperative Research Act of 1984, and other applicable statutes. The consortium would be required to
give special attention to the needs of small businesses under the program. 

Accordingly, U.S. industry representatives have voluntarily formed and incorporated the U.S. Industry Coalition
(USIC) with an interim Board of Directors. 
Membership in USIC will be required for participation in cost-sharing projects that involve the section 575 funds.
Membership in USIC will be open to all U.S. entities, including universities, consortia, and corporations incorporated
in the United States. 

Program questions may be raised during the Question and Answer periods of the Workshop. Questions that would be of
interest to multiple attendees may be included in the Workshop Minutes which will be distributed to attendees after
the Workshop.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Response to citizens' petition.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On December 22, 1993, the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers
of America-UAW (UAW) petitioned EPA under section 21 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), 15 U.S.C. 2620, to
issue test rules under section 4 of TSCA to develop data to aid in the determination of whether machining fluids pose
an unreasonable risk to public health or the environment. This Notice announces EPA's response to UAW's petition.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Summary of Petition and Response 



On December 22, 1993, EPA received a petition under section 21 of TSCA from UAW. The petitioner subsequently agreed
at EPA's request to extend the statutory deadline for EPA review until April 12, 1993. The petitioner requested that
EPA issue test rules under section 4 of TSCA to evaluate whether machining fluids pose an unreasonable risk to public
health or the environment. UAW requests the testing because it believes that although the available epidemiology
data is sufficient to establish the hazards of machining fluids as mixtures, more and better toxicology data is needed
to characterize the health and environmental risks resulting from exposure to particular components or partial
mixtures of machining fluids.

The petitioner alleges that sufficient evidence exists to establish that occupational exposure to machining fluids
at currently permissible levels poses a risk of cancer and adverse effects on respiratory function. UAW says that
the information derived from the additional testing requested, including measurements of environmental release
in the occupational setting, would contribute to refining control strategies. It asserts that such information
would more clearly define the toxicity of specific components constituting machining fluids and of different combinations
of those components. The petitioner also believes that additional testing data will provide needed information
regarding workplace exposure to specific components or partial mixtures of machining fluids.

The petitioner does not identify the specific chemical substances or chemical mixtures for which testing is requested.
UAW states that the petition applies to all machining fluids, including generic categories such as straight oils,
soluble oils, and synthetic fluids, and drawing compounds for metal stamping which are similar in composition to
machining fluids. EPA estimates that the UAW petition potentially applies to hundreds of chemical substances or
mixtures of chemical substances.

The petitioner says that test rules issued in response to the petition should include, but not be limited to requiring:
mutagenicity, respiratory irritancy, and sensitization bioassays of machining fluid components, partial combinations
and in-use machining fluids; carcinogenesis bioassays for selected classes of components; chemical analysis of
bulk fluids and aerosols for nitrosamines, bacterial degradation products (including endotoxin) and higher molecular
weight polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon formation from use; and health effects studies. In addition, the petitioner
requests test rules requiring measurement of release to the environment of various machining fluid components to
gauge workplace exposure from airborne machining fluid components.

On December 9, 1993, UAW petitioned the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) to lower the current
OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) for oil mist from machining fluids. The UAW petition to OSHA includes a request
that OSHA approach EPA to determine the need for test rules for particular ingredients of metalworking fluids, using
authority under TSCA. The UAW petition to OSHA, a copy of which was filed with the TSCA section 21 petition, is accompanied
by a paper entitled ``Health Effects of Occupational Exposure to Machining Fluids,'' which contains a summary of
selected epidemiological studies of cancer and respiratory diseases among workers exposed to machining fluids.
In a statement made at the time of the filing, UAW president Owen Bieber said that additional joint union-company studies
are underway at General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, and that within a few years, study sponsors will know far more about,
among other things, what specific ingredients in machining fluids are causing health problems for workers.

EPA believes that additional testing of machining fluids may be necessary to adequately characterize the health
effects of these fluids on exposed workers. However, EPA has decided that it is not in a position at this time to conclude
that the requisite section 4 criteria have been met for the hundreds of chemical substances and mixtures to which the
petition arguably applies. Before deciding to require testing of machining fluids, EPA will work with OSHA and the
National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in a specially convened Interagency Workgroup to identify
specific components of machining fluids, the combinations in which these chemical substances are used in the workplace,
and the level of workplace exposure to these chemical substances, and then determine which chemical substances,
if any, have been adequately tested in the past or are currently undergoing testing.

In addition, before imposing testing requirements, EPA must determine which machining fluid chemicals meet the
section 4 standards for presenting potentially unreasonable risks or evidencing adequate release or exposure to
require testing under TSCA. A more detailed discussion of these standards is contained in Unit II.A. of this Notice.
EPA anticipates that it will be able to complete the phase of this process that will result in decisions on whether to
initiate section 4 test rules within 1 year.

Over the last several years, EPA has also taken a number of additional initiatives as described in Unit IV of this Notice.
These activities help to address potential adverse health effects on workers exposed to machining fluids. 



II. Background 



A. Statutory Requirements



Section 21 of TSCA provides that any person may petition EPA to initiate proceedings for the issuance of rules under
sections 4, 6, and 8 of TSCA. A section 21 petition must set forth the facts which the petitioner believes establish
the need for the rules requested. EPA is required to grant or deny the petition within 90 days. If EPA grants the petition,
the Agency must promptly commence an appropriate proceeding. If EPA denies the petition, the Agency must publish
its reasons in the 

Federal Register

. Within 60 days of denial, the petitioner may commence a civil action in a U.S. district court to compel the initiation
of the rulemaking requested in its petition. The court must, for a petition for a new rule, provide an opportunity for
the petition to be considered 

de novo

. After hearing the evidence, the court can order EPA to initiate the action requested if the petitioner has demonstrated,
by a preponderance of the evidence, support for particular conclusions described in section 21. In a challenge to
an EPA denial of a section 21 petition requesting a section 4 rule, the petitioner would have to demonstrate by a preponderance
of the evidence that information available to the Agency is insufficient to permit a reasoned evaluation of the effects
of a chemical substance or mixture, and that the chemical substance or mixture either may present an unreasonable
risk of injury or will be produced in substantial amounts and may result in significant or substantial human exposure
or substantial environmental release, and that testing is necessary to characterize the risks.

Section 21 does not provide specific direction as to how the Agency should evaluate a citizen's petition, but merely
states that EPA must grant or deny within 90 days. However, there are standards under section 4 for issuing regulations,
and in determining whether to grant or deny, EPA must consider whether the requirements for section 4 rulemaking can
be met. Under section 4 of TSCA, EPA may issue rules to require chemical manufacturers and processors to test the chemical
substances and mixtures (chemicals) that they produce. To issue a section 4 rule on a chemical, EPA must find either
that activities involving the chemical may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, or
that the chemical is or will be produced in substantial quantities and that there is or will be significant or substantial
human exposure to the chemical or that the chemical is or will be released to the environment in substantial quantities.
In addition, EPA must find that existing data are insufficient to determine or predict the effects of the chemical
and that testing is necessary to develop that data. EPA must be able to make all of the above findings to issue a test rule;
if EPA believes on the basis of the information obtained from the petition, and from its investigation during the 90-day
review period, that it cannot make all of the necessary findings, EPA will deny the section 21 petition.

One of the criteria most relevant to a section 21 petition is whether testing is necessary. Section 4 expands the concept
of sufficiency provided in the section 21 standards established for the purposes of district court review, requiring
that EPA find that testing a chemical is necessary to develop the data needed to evaluate the chemical before it may
issue a rule requiring testing of that chemical. 



B. Description of Machining Fluid Problems



Machining fluids, also called metalworking fluids, are used to lubricate and cool industrial equipment and the metal
being shaped during a variety of machining operations. These may include metal removing operations such as cutting
or drilling, metal forming such as stamping or drawing, or similar operations. In its petition to OSHA, UAW states
that NIOSH estimates that up to 10 million U.S. workers are routinely exposed to oil mists from machining fluids. Exposure
is primarily occupational; however, there are limited exposure data. There may be as many as 400 commercial products
(EPA, 1992) belonging to one of four major metalworking fluid types: straight and soluble oils and semi-synthetic
and synthetic fluids. All but the synthetic fluids contain mineral oil. There are no standard formulations of chemical
components among commercial machining fluids. The following Table 1, which is illustrative only, indicates the
diversity and use patterns of the generic types of machining fluids and components:

of the formulated products of this type, or there is no advantage to having the additive in the product.
Sources: Atmenkins, Howell, Luke, Leiter, 1994; Nachtman, 1990.




UAW attached a list of 14 epidemiology studies to its OSHA petition, along with a general description of the findings
of these studies. Eight studies have been published; the remaining six studies have not been published and presumably
have undergone peer review. These studies covered several operations including grinding operations in which inhalation
of fine particles of the material being machined became a concern, as well as exposures in machining operations that
did not involve grinding. The UAW-represented plants in the studies made a variety of products, using different processes
with different machining fluid compositions and presumably different exposure levels. Taken together, the studies
covered workers in foundry and engine plants exposed to substances characterized as straight, soluble, and insoluble
oils, synthetic water-based cutting fluids, other synthetic fluids, cutting oils, metal fumes, abrasives, dusts,
oil smoke, coolants, organic solvents, and nitrosamines. The studies found some evidence of increased risks of esophageal,
rectal, laryngeal and stomach cancer. However, information regarding the level of exposure was limited or lacking
altogether. For example, only two of the studies provided any quantitative measurement of exposure and both measures
were reflective of current rather than historical levels to which workers were exposed.

According to UAW, excess stomach cancers were found in seven of the nine studies conducted at the UAW-represented
plants. Of all 14 studies listed, however, only three studies actually found a statistically significant increased
risk of stomach cancer (Austin et al., unpublished; Park et al. 1988; Silverstein et al. 1988). UAW has commented that
it ``believe[s] that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that exposure to machining fluids poses a risk of occupational
cancer and adverse effects of respiratory health at levels permitted by the current OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit.''
The epidemiology studies are consistent with toxicology studies, which have generally shown that the respiratory
tract is sensitive to the effects of machining fluid exposure. The increased incidence of cancer and respiratory
effects in the epidemiology studies were associated with several types of machining fluid oils. 




III. EPA's Approach to Obtaining Information on Workplace Health Risks from Exposure to Machining Fluids



EPA agrees with UAW that laboratory work on machining fluids should be expanded and that additional testing may be
needed to more clearly define the toxicity of specific components of machining fluids and of different combinations
of those components. However, EPA is not at this time convinced of the necessity to initiate section 4 test rules under
TSCA for all the more than 400 components of machining fluids and the many hundreds of combinations of those components
that are in use today. EPA believes that before it issues test rules, existing laboratory data must be reviewed to determine
which machining fluid components have already been tested adequately. EPA believes that it is important for OSHA
and NIOSH to help decide, possibly with additional input from both unions and industry, which of the hundreds of untested
or inadequately tested machining fluid components or combinations are most likely to increase health risks to workers
because they appear to have the greatest potential toxicity or are found in the most widely used machining fluids.

To select machining fluid chemicals for testing in response to this petition, EPA has recently formed an Interagency
Workgroup with representatives from EPA, OSHA, and NIOSH. This group will review information regarding the composition
of currently-used machining fluids and existing health effects and exposure data on machining fluids, and will recommend
specific chemicals for testing to the OSHA/NIOSH/EPA Committee (ONE Committee).

The ONE Committee was established pursuant to a formal Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in 1988 to provide a focal
point for coordination and exchange of information on occupational issues including toxic chemical assessment
and regulatory activities of the three agencies. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) was later added
to the Committee.

Following review of the Interagency Workgroup's recommendations for testing (including monitoring) of specific
machining fluid chemical substances or mixtures, the ONE Committee will refer data needs for specific chemical substances
or mixtures to EPA for development of proposed test rules. EPA will then undertake to make the necessary findings under
section 4 and develop test rules covering the recommended substances or mixtures. The identity and number of specific
chemicals referred for testing will depend on the selections of the Interagency Workgroup, as reviewed by the ONE
Committee. EPA has received letters from OSHA and NIOSH officials expressing their approval of the Interagency Workgroup's
formation, appointing representatives to serve on the group, and indicating their understanding that the purpose
of the group is to assist in addressing UAW's concerns regarding occupational health risks associated with exposure
to machining fluids.

Prior to receiving the ONE Committee's referral of data needs the Interagency Workgroup's recommendations of substances
or mixtures for testing, and Agency review with regard to section 4 criteria, EPA is not in a position to require testing
for the hundreds of combinations of machining fluid chemical substances (or some subset thereof) which are currently
in use. Specifically, EPA needs to select the chemicals and combinations that will support the findings required
under TSCA section 4 before EPA can promulgate a test rule. In addition to evaluating the toxicity of chemicals and
mixtures found in machining fluids, EPA needs to evaluate the potential exposure that occurs during use. Moreover,
thermal and degradation products, and particulates from the metal work being machined can add to the potentially
toxic exposures. These issues may need further review.

It should also be noted that EPA probably cannot promulgate a TSCA section 4 test rule for one category of additives
mentioned in the petition. Section 3 of TSCA excludes certain types of chemicals from the definition of ``chemical
substances,'' and therefore from regulation under TSCA, including chemicals ``manufactured, processed, or distributed
in commerce, for use as pesticides.'' When biocides are added to machining fluids to act as pesticides, they would
not normally be the subject of a TSCA section 4 rule. However, they are regulated by EPA under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) 7 U.S.C. 136 

et seq.

 and EPA has authority to require health and environmental data under FIFRA.

In summary, the Agency recognizes that additional laboratory testing may be needed to determine the toxicity of inadequately
tested machining fluids. In addition, studies to better characterize worker exposure to machining fluids may be
needed. EPA agrees with UAW that exposure to toxic machining fluid components and combinations of such components
should be minimized. EPA also agrees with UAW that EPA, OSHA, and NIOSH should work together to determine the need for
TSCA section 4 rules for particular ingredients and mixtures of metalworking fluids. EPA has initiated actions that
will enable EPA, OSHA and NIOSH to navigate through the complex and extremely large universe of machining fluid components
and mixtures to select appropriate substances for testing. The agencies may also seek the assistance of unions and
industry in this effort. EPA believes that consultation with unions and industry may be particularly useful in handling
nomenclature and product definition issues that must be resolved prior to promulgating test rules under section
4. 



IV. Specific Actions to Address Workplace Exposure to Toxic Machining Fluid Components



Prior to receiving the December 22, 1993 petition, EPA had identified machining fluids as a potential source for concern.
EPA had also begun to evaluate the toxicity of these materials.

On June 28, 1990, EPA received a letter from Dr. Franklin Mirer of UAW indicating UAW's intent to submit a petition under
TSCA section 21 requesting TSCA section 4 carcinogenicity testing of cutting oil components and formulations. In
response to this letter and a TSCA section 8(e) submission, EPA initiated a review of the toxicity of machining oil
components and mixtures under its screening level risk management process (RM1). After reviewing available data
on oil-based metalworking fluids, EPA concluded on September 9, 1992, that there were insufficient data at that time
to define the agent(s) of concern for toxicity testing, and EPA presented this conclusion to the ONE Committee. As
a result of this review, EPA decided to group machining fluid additives by their use (e.g., anti-oxidants, biocides,
etc.) into use clusters for screening with respect to potential human risk, ecological risk, and pollution prevention.
To date, 11 such clusters have been identified and are under review.

In addition, the following actions were not contemplated by EPA in response to any UAW initiative. These actions have
been taken previously or are planned unilaterally by EPA to reduce, among other things, workplace exposure to certain
toxic components of machining fluids.

EPA recently completed an investigation of chlorinated paraffins and olefins (CP/Os), substances used extensively
in cutting fluids. Chlorinated paraffins (CPs) came to the attention of EPA in 1977, when the National Toxicology
Program (NTP) nominated them for testing. Earlier that year, an international group of CP manufacturers had formed
a Consortium to test their products for both health and environmental effects. EPA had discussed the planned testing
with the Consortium and had accepted the Consortium's proposal for voluntary health and environmental effects testing
of CPs. Consequently, EPA at that time did not propose a section 4(a) rule requiring such health or environmental effects
testing. Following completion of testing by industry in 1984, EPA tentatively estimated that CPs could pose potential
risks to aquatic life at concentrations at or below the concentrations that might be expected to occur frequently
in the environment. In addition, NTP, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, and the State of California
had classified short chain CPs as probable human carcinogens.

In September of 1993, EPA concluded that CP/Os do not present a general environmental risk, although a few cities with
heavy concentrations of metalworking operations were identified in which CP/O water concentrations could reach
levels of concern to some aquatic species. The investigation also concluded that CP/Os may pose cancer risks to specific
limited populations, primarily to workers using metalworking fluids and thus exposed to CP/Os in oil mists. EPA also
concluded that, to a lesser extent, CP/Os also could pose potential cancer risks to small populations of subsistence
fish-eaters in a few metropolitan areas, and possibly to anyone exposed to dioxin that might be generated during metalworking
operations or when spent fluids are incinerated. Consequently, EPA is proposing to list CP/Os on the Toxic Release
Inventory (TRI), based primarily on concerns about potential cancer risks. In addition, EPA has communicated to
OSHA the potential occupational risk to metalworkers at the current PEL.

On May 12, 1993, (58 FR 27944) EPA promulgated a Significant New Use Rule (SNUR) under TSCA for alkali metal nitrites
(AMNs), another frequent machining fluid additive. EPA has determined that the use of AMNs as ingredients in machining
fluids containing amines may result in significant exposure to 

N

-nitrosamines and pose a significant cancer risk to human health. The SNUR applies to any person that manufactures,
imports, or processes AMNs for use as an ingredient in machining fluids containing amines. Such persons must notify
EPA 90 days before undertaking the activity. This time period gives EPA an opportunity to evaluate the intended use
of the AMNs in question to ensure that workers are protected from the risks of exposure to 

N

-nitrosamines.

Finally, to address concerns over environmental releases of machining fluids and components, EPA is planning to
propose the Metal Products and Machinery Phase I Effluent Guideline by November 1994. This guideline, which is scheduled
for promulgation by May 1996, is intended to cover facilities that manufacture, rebuild or maintain metal parts,
products or machines and that discharge effluent to surface waters and indirectly to publicly owned treatment facilities.
The phase I guideline will cover the aerospace, aircraft, electronic equipment, hardware, mobile industrial equipment,
ordnance, and stationary equipment industries. The guideline will regulate discharges of several pollutants,
including some substances that are components of machining fluids or that constitute machining fluids.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) has made final findings of scientific misconduct
in the following case:




Keith A. Caruso, Cornell University. 

An inquiry conducted by Cornell University Medical College found that Dr. Caruso, while a medical student in the Department
of Psychiatry, altered, fabricated, and destroyed primary laboratory data while learning techniques for insulin
receptor binding on erythrocytes at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons; this work was supported by grants
from the National Institute of Mental Health. Dr. Caruso admitted to these acts of alteration, falsification and
destruction of primary data. ORI has accepted the university's findings, and Dr. Caruso has signed an agreement with
ORI accepting the finding of scientific misconduct and the administrative actions previously imposed by Cornell
University. This agreement was made final on April 6, 1994. ORI has determined that the university's administrative
actions were sufficient, and has not imposed any further Public Health Service actions. The fabricated data did not
appear in any scientific publications.

John C. Hiserodt, M.D., Ph.D.: An inquiry conducted by the University of Pittsburgh and an investigation conducted
by the Office of Research Integrity found that Dr. Hiserodt deliberately and knowingly falsified four figures and
one table in two research grant applications submitted to the National Institutes of Health, and deliberately and
knowingly fabricated a laboratory notebook to cover-up the falsifications in the grant applications. In reporting
research results on antigen recognition by natural killer cells, Dr. Hiserodt falsely reported that a purportedly
unique protein had a molecular weight of 48 kilodaltons by altering photographs of autoradiograms, falsely reported
that this protein had been found in human cells, falsely reported the results of a gene sequence in response to questions
raised by NIH grant reviewers about his experimental findings, and fabricated a laboratory notebook to cover-up
the falsified research when questions about it were raised by investigating officials. Dr. Hiserodt has been debarred
from receiving Federal grant or contract funds for a period of five years beginning March 9, 1994. In addition, any
institution receiving PHS research support involving Dr. Hiserodt must monitor the accuracy of his research for
an additional two-year period following the five-year debarment (for a total period of seven years) beginning March
9, 1999. He has also been prohibited from serving on PHS Advisory Committees or review groups for seven years beginning
February 25, 1994. Dr. Hiserodt is also required to request correction of the article ``The Expression and Functional
Involvement of Laminin-like Molecules in Non-MHC Restricted Cytotoxicity by Human Leu-19+/CD3-Natural Killer
Lymphocytes,'' Journal of Immunology, Vol. 141, 3318-23, 1988, to indicate that Figure 2 in the article may
not be relied upon.

The priority areas identified in this announcement are derived from legislative mandates as well as Departmental
goals and initiatives. The priorities reflect the state of current knowledge as well as emerging issues which have
come to ACYF's attention by several means including consultation with advocates, policymakers, and practitioners
in the field. 

The priorities seek to focus attention on and to encourage demonstration efforts to obtain new knowledge and improvements
in service delivery for the solution of particular problems and to promote the dissemination and utilization of the
knowledge and model practices developed under these priorities. 



A. Structure of Priority Area Descriptions 



This section presents the basic set of issues that must be addressed in the application. Typically, they relate to
project design, evaluation, and community involvement. This section also asks for specific information on the proposed
project. Inclusion and discussion of these items in the applicant's proposal is important since they will be used
by the reviewers in evaluating the proposal against the evaluation criteria. Project products, continuation of
the project effort after the Federal support ceases, and dissemination/utilization activities, if appropriate,
should also be addressed. 

Each priority area is composed of the following sections: 

 

Eligible Applicants

: This section specifies the type of organization which is eligible to apply under the particular priority area. Specific
restrictions are also noted, where applicable. 

Each priority area description contains information about the types of agencies and organizations which are eligible
to apply under that priority area. Since eligibility varies among priority areas depending on statutory provisions,
it is critical that the Eligible Applicants section under each specific priority area be read carefully. 

 

Purpose

: This section presents the basic focus and/or broad goal(s) of the priority area. 

 

Background

: This section briefly discusses the current state-of-the-art and/or current state-of practice that supports the
need for the particular priority area activity and provides relevant information on projects previously funded
by ACYF and/or other State models, where applicable. 

 

Minimum Requirements for Project Design

: This section presents the basic set of issues that must be addressed in the application. Typically, they relate to
project design, evaluation, and community involvement. This section also asks for specific information on the proposed
project. The inclusion and discussion of these items in the applicant's proposal is important since they will be used
by the reviewers in evaluating the proposal against the evaluation criteria. Project products, continuation of
the project effort after the Federal support ceases, and dissemination/utilization activities, if applicable,
should also be addressed. 

 

Project Duration

: This section specifies the maximum allowable length of time for the project period; it refers to the amount of time
for which Federal funding is available. 

 

Federal Share of Project Cost

: This section specifies the amount of Federal support for the project. 

The term budget period refers to the interval of time (usually 12 months) into which a multi-year period of assistance
(project period) is divided for budgetary and funding purposes. The term project period refers to the total time a
project is approved for support, including any extensions. 

 

Matching Requirement

: This section specifies the minimum non-Federal contribution, either through cash or in-kind match, that is required.
Applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions. Grantees must provide at
least 25 percent of the total approved cost of the project. The total approved cost of the project is the sum of the ACYF
share and the non-Federal share. Therefore, a project requesting $50,000 in Federal funds must include a match of
at least $16,666 (25 percent of the total project cost of $66,666). 
 

Anticipated Number of Projects To Be Funded

: This section specifies the number of projects that ACYF anticipates it will fund in the priority area.

States, including those currently receiving financial assistance under these programs, may apply under each priority
area described below. A separate application, however, must be submitted under each priority area. Only one application
per State may be submitted under each priority area. Applications must clearly indicate whether they are being submitted
under 1.01A, Temporary Child Care for Children with Disabilities and Chronically Ill Children, or 1.01B, Crisis
Nurseries. 


Purpose: 

To support States in their efforts to assist private and public agencies in developing two types of services: 
 In-home or out-of-home temporary non-medical child care (respite care) for children with disabilities and
children with chronic or terminal illnesses, including children with AIDS or AIDS-related conditions (priority
area 1.01A); and 
 Crisis nurseries for abused and neglected children, children at risk of abuse and neglect, or children in families
receiving protective services (priority area 1.01B). 
Special attention should be paid in both priority areas to the needs of drug-affected infants. 


42 U.S.C. Section 5117a: Temporary Child Care for Children With Disabilities and Chronically Ill Children (Priority
Area 1.01A) 




Background: 

The Act authorizes temporary child care programs for children with disabilities and requires applicants seeking
temporary child care funds to define disabilities using the definition in the Individuals with Disabilities Education
Act: 

* * * The term children with disabilities means children_(A)(i) with mental retardation, hearing
impairments including deafness, speech or language impairments, visual impairments including blindness, serious
emotional disturbance, orthopedic impairments, autism, traumatic brain injury, other health impairments, or
specific learning disabilities; and (ii) who, by reason thereof, need special education and related services. 
(B) The term children with disabilities for children aged 3 to 5, inclusive, may at a State's discretion, include children_(i)
experiencing developmental delays, as defined by the State and as measured by appropriate diagnostic instruments
and procedures, in one or more of the following areas: physical development, cognitive development, communication
development, social or emotional development, or adaptive development; and, 
(ii) who, by reason thereof; need special education and related services * * * (Public Law 102-119)

The purpose of establishing a temporary child care program (also known as respite care) for children with disabilities
or who are chronically or terminally ill is to alleviate social, economic, and financial stress among the families
of such children. Such care provides the families or primary caregivers with periods of temporary relief from the
pressures of the demanding child care routine, thus preventing severe family stress. 
The following components may be included in temporary child care or respite care projects: 
 24-hour services; 
 Access to primary medical services; 
 Referral to counseling/therapy services; 
 Staff training, including child abuse/neglect reporting responsibilities; 
 Public awareness programs; and 
 Linkages to other family support and/or family preservation services. 


42 U.S.C. Section 5117b: Crisis Nurseries (Priority Area 1.01B) 




Background: 

A crisis nursery is defined in section 42 U.S.C. Section 5117c(d) to mean a center providing temporary emergency services
and care for children. Crisis nurseries are child care facilities which protect children by providing a safe environment
at a time when the chances of neglect or abuse in the home are increased. 
The programs offer parents the option of ``time out'' as a preventive measure in reducing the incidence of child maltreatment.
They are designed to: (1) Develop a safe environment as a resource for children at risk of abuse; (2) deliver non-punitive,
non-threatening services as a resource to caregivers of at-risk children; and (3) utilize existing community-based
services to further diminish the potential for the maltreatment of children in families experiencing crisis. Services
funded under 42 U.S.C. Section 5117b must be provided without fee and may be provided for a maximum of 30 days in any year.
Crisis nurseries must also provide referral to support services.

Background

: Since 1988, the Children's Bureau in the Department of Health and Human Services has awarded 145 grants to States
to support respite care services and crisis nurseries under the Temporary Child Care for Children With Disabilities
and Crisis Nurseries Program. Through these State agency grantees, over 250 local service providers have been recipients
of the $52,106,552 awarded thus far. In addition, other projects, not utilizing Federal funds available under this
program, have been developed and implemented in local communities designed to address the needs of similar target
populations. 


In FY 1993 the Children's Bureau awarded grants to 24 States with funds earmarked for expanding respite care and crisis
nurseries services within the States. 


Respite care programs funded under the Temporary Child Care program are designed to alleviate social, economic,
and financial stress among families of all children and, particularly, children with disabilities or children who
are chronically or terminally ill through the provision of short-term, non-medical child care. Such respite care
provides families or primary care givers with periods of temporary relief from the pressures of the demanding child
care routine, thus preventing severe family stress. Respite care programs generally provide 24-hour services,
access to medical services; referral access to counseling/therapy; staff training, including child abuse/neglect
reporting responsibilities; and public awareness efforts. 


Crisis Nurseries programs are designed to protect children by providing a safe environment at a time when the chances
of neglect or physical abuse in the home are increased. These programs offer parents the option of time out as a preventive
measure to reduce the incidence of child maltreatment. In general, crisis nursery programs provide many of the same
services as respite care programs but also place greater emphasis on intervention, remediation and prevention services
including referrals for out-of-home placement, when appropriate. 


Other community programs also provide respite care as an integrated part of their services. New legislation recently
established Subpart 2 of Title IV-B of the Social Security Act, entitled the Family Preservation and Support
Services, which encourages and enables States to develop, establish or expand and operate programs for family preservation
and community-based family support services. These programs are family-centered and will focus on strengthening
the family unit. Family preservation services will assist families in crisis when the child is at imminent risk of
being placed in out-of-home care because of abuse and/or neglect. Family support services will focus on activities
aimed at increasing the strength and stability of families. 


Existing programs vary considerably in terms of quality, experience and methodology. However, the demand for services
is increasing as the number of single-parent families, families in poverty, and stress on families increases; as
fewer disabled children are institutionalized; and as substance abuse impacts greater numbers of children and families.
Additional resources are needed to assist in identifying, developing and utilizing effective program practices,
information and materials in order to meet this demand. 



Minimum Requirements for Project Design 



In order to successfully compete under this priority area, the application should:

 Provide a letter addressed to the Commissioner, Administration on Children, Youth and Families, and signed
by the Governor which certifies that the State agency applying for funding is the State agency designated to carry
out the program. 



 Demonstrate knowledge about the problems and issues involved in providing services for children with disabilities
and children at risk of abuse and neglect. 



 Provide documentation of the commitment to improving the quality of respite care and crisis nurseries program
and services. 



 Describe a plan for identifying emerging issues from the fields of child welfare (including family preservation
and family support), developmental disabilities, and child health, particularly as they relate to prenatal drug
exposure and pediatric HIV infection. 



 Describe a plan for preparing and disseminating information and policy papers to the field which address these
emerging issues. 



 Describe a plan for promoting collaboration among agencies within states and communities.

CDFA: 93.656 Temporary Child Care for Children With Disabilities and Crisis Nurseries Act of 1986, as amended,
42 U.S.C. 5117 



D. Available Funds 



The ACYF intends to award new grants and a Cooperative Agreement under this announcement during fiscal year 1994.


Applications for continuation grants funded under this program beyond the first year's budget period, but within
the total project period, will be entertained in subsequent years on a non-competitive basis, subject to the availability
of funds and a determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of the Federal government. Applicants
are advised that the Administration has proposed the consolidation of this program into the Child Care and Development
Block Grant (CCDBG) beginning in FY 1995. 

In addition, for priority areas 1.01A and 1.01B, non-competitive funding for subsequent years will be based on a program
staff review of project status and performance, and evidence that the program is part of an integrated system of services
described in an approved State plan as mandated by Title IV-B, Subpart 2, of the Social Security Act, pursuant
to the Family Preservation and Family Support program. If the Temporary Child Care for Children With Disabilities
and Crisis Nurseries program is consolidated with CCDBG, ACYF will encourage States to consider continuing those
projects funded under these priority areas. For priority area 1.02, non-competitive funding beyond year three will
be based on the project's responsiveness to customers' needs. 



Part III_Review Process 



A. Eligible Applicants 



Before applications are reviewed, each application will be screened to determine that the applicant organization
is an eligible applicant as specified under the selected priority area. Applications from organizations which do
not meet the eligibility requirements for the priority area will not be considered or reviewed in the competition,
and the applicant will be so informed. 



B. Review Process and Funding Decisions 



Timely applications from eligible applicants will be reviewed and scored competitively. Experts in the field, generally
persons from outside of the Federal government, will use the evaluation criteria listed in Section C, Evaluation
Criteria, to review and score the applications. The results of this review are a primary factor in making funding decisions.


The ACYF reserves the option of discussing applications with, or referring them to, other Federal or non-Federal
funding sources when this is determined to be in the best interest of the Federal government or the applicant. It may
also solicit comments from ACYF Regional Office staff, other Federal agencies, interested foundations, national
organizations, specialists, experts, States and the general public. These comments, along with those of the expert
reviewers, will be considered by ACYF in making funding decisions.

<DOCNO> FR940419-2-00049 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940419-2-00033 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In making decisions on awards, ACYF may give preference to applications which focus on or feature: Minority populations;
programs which are part of an integrated system of family support services and/or family preservation services;
a substantial innovative strategy with the potential to improve theory or practice in the field of human services;
a model practice or set of procedures that holds the potential for replication by organizations involved in the administration
or delivery of human services; substantial involvement of volunteers; substantial involvement (either financial
or programmatic) of the private sector; a favorable balance between Federal and non-Federal funds available for
the proposed project; the potential for high benefit for low Federal investment; a programmatic focus on those most
in need; and/or substantial involvement in the proposed project by national or community foundations. 

To the greatest extent possible, efforts will be made to ensure that funding decisions reflect an equitable distribution
of assistance among the States, and geographical regions of the country, rural and urban areas, and ethnic populations.
In making these decisions, the Assistant Secretary and HHS Senior Staff may also take into account the need to avoid
unnecessary duplication of efforts. 



C. Evaluation Criteria 



A panel of at least three reviewers (primarily experts from outside the Federal government) will review the applications.
Applicants should ensure that they address each minimum requirement in the priority area description under the appropriate
section of the Program Narrative Statement. 

Reviewers will determine the strengths and weaknesses of each proposal in terms of the evaluation criteria listed
below, provide comments and assign numerical scores. The point value following each criterion heading indicates
the maximum numerical weight that each section may be given in the review process. 

Applications under all priority areas will be evaluated against the following criteria. 

1.

(20 points). The extent to which the application pinpoints any relevant physical, economic, social, financial,
institutional or other problems requiring a solution; demonstrates the need for the assistance; states the principal
and subordinate objectives of the project; provides supporting documentation or other testimonies from concerned
interests other than the applicant; and includes and/or references relevant data. The application must identify
the precise location of the project and area to be served by the proposed project. Maps and other graphic aids may be
attached. 

2. 

Results or Benefits Expected 

(20 points). The extent to which the application identifies the results and benefits to be derived, the extent to which
they are consistent with the objectives of the proposal, and the extent to which the application indicates the anticipated
contributions to policy, practice, theory and/or research. The extent to which the proposed project costs are reasonable
in view of the expected results. 

3. 

Approach 

(35 points). The extent to which the application outlines a sound and workable plan of action pertaining to the scope
of the project, and details how the proposed work will be accomplished; cites factors which might accelerate or decelerate
the work, giving acceptable reasons for taking the proposed approach as opposed to others; describes and supports
any unusual features of the project, such as design or technological innovations, reductions in cost or time, or extraordinary
social and community involvements; provides for projections of the accomplishments to be achieved; and lists the
activities to be carried out in chronological order, showing a reasonable schedule of accomplishments and target
dates. 

The extent to which, when applicable, the application identifies the kinds of data to be collected and maintained,
and discusses the criteria to be used to evaluate the results and successes of the project. The extent to which the application
describes the evaluation methodology that will be used to determine if the needs identified and discussed are being
met and if the results and benefits identified are being achieved. The extent to which the application identifies
each organization, agency, consultant, or other key individuals or groups who will work on the project, along with
a description of the activities each will undertake and the nature of their effort or contribution. 

4. 

Staff Background and Organization's Experience 

(25 points). The extent to which the background of the project director/principal investigator and key project staff
(including name, address, training, educational background and other qualifying experience) and the experience
of the organization demonstrate the applicant's ability to effectively and efficiently administer the project.

Part IV_Instructions for the Development and Submission of Application



This Part contains information and instructions for submitting applications in response to this announcement.
Application forms are provided along with a checklist for assembling an application package. Please copy and use
these forms in submitting an application. 

Potential applicants should read this section carefully in conjunction with the information contained within the
specific priority area under which the application is to be submitted. The priority area descriptions are presented
in Part II. 



A. Required Notification of the State Single Point of Contact 



The Temporary Child Care for Children with Disabilities and Crisis Nurseries Program is covered under Executive
Order 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs, and 45 CFR Part 100, Intergovernmental Review of Department
of Health and Human Services Program and Activities. Under the Order, States may design their own processes for reviewing
and commenting on proposed Federal assistance under covered programs. 

All States and territories, except Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota,
Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, American Samoa and Palau, have elected
to participate in the Executive Order process and have established State Single Point of Contact (SPOCs). Applicants
from these 17 jurisdictions need take no action regarding E.O. 12372. Otherwise, applicants should contact their
SPOCs as soon as possible to alert them to the prospective applications and receive any necessary instructions. Applicants
must submit any required material to the SPOCs as soon as possible so that the program office can obtain and review SPOC
comments as part of the award process. It is imperative that the applicant submit all required materials, if any, to
the SPOC and indicate the date of this submittal (or the date of contact if no submittal is required) on the Standard
Form 424, item 16a. 

Under 45 CFR 100.8(a)(2), a SPOC has 60 days from the application deadline to comment on proposed new or competing continuation
awards. 

SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine endorsements as official recommendations. Additionally,
SPOCs are requested to clearly differentiate between mere advisory comments and those official State process recommendations
which may trigger the accommodate or explain rule. 

When comments are submitted directly to ACF, they should be addressed to: 
Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Division of Discretionary Grants,
370 L'Enfant Promenade, SW., 6th Floor East, OFM/DDG, Washington, DC 20447.

A list of the Single Points of Contact for each State and Territory is included as Appendix B of this announcement.

Late Applications: 

Applications which do not meet the criteria stated above are considered late applications. The granting agency shall
notify each late applicant that its application will not be considered in the current competition. 



Extension of Deadlines: 

The granting agency may extend the deadline for all applicants because of acts of God such as floods, hurricanes, etc.,
or when there is a widespread disruption of the mails. However, if the granting agency does not extend the deadline
for all applicants, it may not waive or extend the deadline for any applicants.

funds for the second budget period (months 13 through 24) under column (b) First. If a third budget period will be necessary,
enter the Federal funds needed for months 25 through 36 under (c) Second. Columns (d) and (e) are not applicable in most
instances, since ACF funding is almost always limited to a three-year maximum project period. Columns (d) and (e)
would be used in the case of a 60 month project. 

Section F_Other Budget Information. 

Direct Charges_Line 21. Not applicable. 

Indirect Charges_Line 22. Enter the type of indirect rate (provisional, predetermined, final or fixed) that will

3. Project Summary Description 



Clearly mark this separate page with the applicant name as shown in item 5 of the SF 424, the priority area number as shown
at the top of the 
SF 424, and the title of the project as shown in item 11 of the SF 424. The summary description should not exceed 300 words.
These 300 words become part of the computer database on each project. 

Care should be taken to produce a summary description which accurately and concisely reflects the proposal. It should
describe the objectives of the project, the approaches to be used and the outcomes expected. The description should
also include a list of major products that will result from the proposed project, such as software packages, materials,
management procedures, data collection instruments, training packages, or videos (please note that audiovisuals
should be closed captioned). The project summary description, together with the information on the SF 424, will constitute
the project abstract. It is the major source of information about the proposed project and is usually the first part
of the application that the reviewers read in evaluating the application. 

At the bottom of the page, following the summary description, type up to 10 key words which best describe the proposed
project, the service(s) involved and the target population(s) to be covered. These key words will be used for computerized
information retrieval for specific types of funded projects. 



4. Program Narrative Statement 



The Program Narrative Statement is a very important part of an application. It should be clear, concise, and address
the specific requirements mentioned under the priority area description in Part II. 

The narrative should provide information concerning how the application meets the evaluation criteria (see Section
C, Part III), using the following headings: 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940419-2-00057 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940419-2-00033 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(a) 

Objectives and Need for Assistance

; 
(b) 

Results and Benefits Expected

; 
(c) 

Approach

; and 
(d) 

Staff Background and Organization's Experience. 
The specific information to be included under each of these headings is described in Section C of Part III, Evaluation
Criteria. 
The narrative should be typed double-spaced on a single-side of an 81/2 x 11 plain white paper, with one inch margins
on all sides. All pages of the narrative (including charts, references/footnotes, tables, maps, exhibits, etc.)
must be sequentially numbered, beginning with Objectives and Need for Assistance as page number one. Applicants
should not submit reproductions of larger size paper, reduced to meet the size requirement. 
The length of the application, including the application forms and all attachments, should not exceed 60 pages. A
page is a single side of an 
81/2 x 11 sheet of paper. Applicants are requested not to send pamphlets, brochures or other printed material along
with their application as these pose xeroxing difficulties. These materials, if submitted, will not be included
in the review process if they exceed the 60-page limit. Each page of the application will be counted to determine the
total length. 


5. Organizational Capability Statement

Instructions for the SF-424A


General Instructions


This form is designed so that application can be made for funds from one or more grant programs. In preparing the budget,
adhere to any existing Federal grantor agency guidelines which prescribe how and whether budgeted amounts should
be separately shown for different functions or activities within the program. For some programs, grantor agencies
may require budgets to be separately shown by function or activity. For other programs, grantor agencies may require
a breakdown by function or activity. Sections A, B, C and D should include budget estimates for the whole project except
when applying for assistance which requires Federal authorization in annual or other funding period increments.
In the latter case, Sections A, B, C, and D should provide the budget for the first budget period (usually a year) and
Section E should present the need for Federal assistance in the subsequent budget periods. All applications should
contain a breakdown by the object class categories shown in Lines a-k of Section B.


Section A. Budget Summary

For applications pertaining to a single Federal grant program (Federal Domestic Assistance Catalog number) and
not requiring a functional or activity breakdown, enter on Line 1 under Column (a) the catalog program title and the
catalog number in Column (b).
For applications pertaining to a single program requiring budget amounts by multiple functions or activities, enter
the name of each activity or function on each line in Column (a), and enter the catalog number in Column (b). For applications
pertaining to multiple programs where none of the programs require a breakdown by function or activity, enter the
catalog program title on each line in Column (a) and the respective catalog number on each line in Column (b).
For applications pertaining to multiple programs where one or more programs require a breakdown by function or activity,

For new applications, leave Columns (c) and (d) blank. For each line entry in Columns (a) and (b), enter in Columns (e),
(f), and (g) the appropriate amounts of funds needed to support the project for the first funding period (usually a
year).
For continuing grant program applications, submit these forms before the end of each funding period as required by
the grantor agency. Enter in Columns (c) and (d) the estimated amounts of funds which will remain unobligated at the
end of the grant funding period only if the Federal grantor agency instructions provide for this. Otherwise, leave
these columns blank. enter in columns (e) and (f) the amounts of funds needed for the upcoming period. The amount(s)
in Column (g) should be the sum of amounts in Columns (e) and (f).
For supplemental grants and changes to existing grants, do not use Columns (c) and (d). Enter in Column (e) the amount
of the increase or decrease of Federal funds and enter in Column (f) the amount of the increase or decrease of non-Federal
funds. In Column (g) enter the new total budgeted amount (Federal and non-Federal) which includes the total previous

in Column (g) should not equal the sum of amounts in Columns (e) and (f).
Line 5_Show the totals for all columns used.


Section B. Budget Categories


In the column headings (1) through (4), enter the titles of the same programs, functions, and activities shown on Lines
1-4, Column (a), Section A. When additional sheets are prepared for Section A, provide similar column headings
on each sheet. For each program, function or activity, fill in the total requirements for funds (both Federal and non-Federal)
by object class categories.
Line 6a-i_Show the totals of Lines 6a to 6h in each column.
Line 6k_Show the amount of indirect cost.

Public Health Conference Support Grant Program 


Introduction 


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of funds in fiscal year (FY) 1995
for the Public Health Conference Support Grant Program. The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving
the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity to reduce
morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to all of Healthy People 2000
priority areas, except HIV Infection (a separate announcement for HIV entitled, ``Public Health Conference Support
Cooperative Agreement Program for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Prevention'' will be published). (For ordering
a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section ``Where To Obtain Additional Information.'') 


Authority 


This program is authorized under section 301 (42 U.S.C. 241) and section 310 (42 U.S.C. 242n) of the Public Health Service
Act. 



Smoke-Free Workplace 


The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 


Eligible Applicants 


Eligible applicants include non-profit and for-profit organizations. Thus, universities, colleges, research
institutions, hospitals, other public and private (e.g., community-based, national, and regional) organizations,
State and local health departments or their bona fide agents, federally recognized Indian tribal governments, Indian
tribes or Indian tribal organizations, and small, minority and/or women-owned businesses are eligible for these
grants. 


Availability of Funds 


Approximately $300,000 is expected to be available in FY 1995 to fund approximately 15-20 awards. The awards
range from $1,000 to $30,000 with the average award being approximately $15,000. The awards will be made for a 12-month
budget and project period. The funding estimates may vary and are subject to change, based on the availability of funds.




Use of Funds 


1. CDC funds may be used for direct cost expenditures: salaries, speaker fees, rental of necessary equipment, registration
fees, and transportation costs (not to exceed economy class fare) for non-Federal employees. 
2. CDC funds may Not be used for the purchase of equipment, payments of honoraria, alterations or renovations, organizational
dues, entertainment or personal expenses, cost of travel and payment of a Federal employee, nor per diem or expenses
other than local mileage for local participants. 
3. CDC funds may Not be used for reimbursement of indirect costs. 
4. Although the practice of handing out novelty items at meetings is often employed in the private sector to provide
participants with souvenirs, Federal funds Cannot be used for this purpose. 
5. CDC funds may be used for only those parts of the conference specifically supported by CDC as documented in the grant
award. 


Purpose 


The purpose of the conference support grants is to provide Partial support for specific non-Federal conferences
in the areas of health promotion and disease prevention information/education programs, (Except HIV Infection).
Applications are being solicited for conferences on: (1) Chronic disease prevention; (2) infectious disease prevention;
(3) control of injury or disease associated with environmental, home, and work-place hazards; (4) environmental
health; (5) occupational safety and health; (6) control of risk factors such as poor nutrition, smoking, lack of exercise,
high blood pressure, and stress; (7) health education and promotion; (8) laboratory practices; and (9) efforts that
would strengthen the public health system. Because conference support by CDC creates the appearance of CDC co-sponsorship,
there will be active participation by CDC in the development and approval of those portions of the agenda supported
by CDC funds. In addition, CDC will reserve the right to approve or reject the content of the full agenda, speaker selection,
and site selection. CDC funds will not be expended for non-approved portions of meetings. Contingency awards will
be made allowing usage of only 10% of the total amount to be awarded until a final full agenda is approved by CDC. This
will provide funds for costs associated with preparation of the agenda. The remainder of funds will be released only
upon approval of the final full agenda. CDC reserves the right to terminate co-sponsorship if it does not concur with
the final agenda. 
Because CDC's mission and programs relate to the promotion of health and the prevention of disease, disability, and
premature death, only conferences focusing on such programmatic areas will be considered. Those topics concerned
with health-care and health-service issues and areas other than prevention should be directed to other public health
agencies.

<DOCTITLE>Request for Nominations for Members on Public Advisory Committees; Food Advisory Committee</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is requesting nominations for members to serve on the Food Advisory Committee
(the committee) in FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. Nominations will be accepted for current vacancies
and vacancies that will or may occur on the committee during the next 24 months.


 FDA has special interest in ensuring that women, minority groups, and the physically handicapped are adequately
represented on advisory committees and, therefore, extends particular encouragement to nominations for appropriately
qualified female, minority, or physically handicapped candidates. Final selection from among qualified candidates
for each vacancy will be determined by the expertise required to meet specific agency needs and in a manner to ensure
appropriate balance of membership.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 FDA is requesting nominations for members to serve on the advisory committee listed below. Individuals should have
expertise in the activity of the committee.




Food Advisory Committee

: One vacancy needs to be filled immediately (nonconsumer/industry representative vacancy). Also, seven vacancies
will occur June 30, 1994, including one for a consumer representative and one for an industry representative, and
eight vacancies will occur June 30, 1995, including one for a consumer representative and one for an industry representative.
 The committee provides advice primarily to the Director, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, and as needed,
to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs and other appropriate officials, on emerging food safety, food science, and
nutrition issues that FDA considers of primary importance in the next decade. The committee also provides advice
and makes recommendations on ways of communicating to the public the potential risks associated with these issues
and recommends approaches to be considered in addressing them.




Criteria for Members


 

 Persons nominated for membership on the committee shall be knowledgeable in the fields of life sciences, food science,
risk assessment, or other relevant scientific disciplines. The committee may include technically qualified members
who are identified with consumer interests and are recommended by either a consortium of consumer-oriented organizations
or other interested persons. Representatives of industry interests will serve as liaisons to the regulated industry.
The term of office is up to 4 years. 




Nomination Procedures




 Interested persons may nominate one or more qualified persons for membership on the committee. Nominations shall
state that the nominee is willing to serve as a member of the committee and appears to have no conflict of interest that
would preclude committee membership. Additionally, the nominee's mailing address, telephone number, and curriculum
vitae must accompany the nominations. Potential candidates will be asked by FDA to provide detailed information
concerning such matters as financial holdings, employment, consultancies, and research grants and/or contracts
to permit evaluation of possible sources of conflict of interest.




Criteria for Consumer-Nominated Members




Selection of representatives of consumer interests will be conducted through procedures that include use of a consortium
of consumer organizations which has the responsibility for screening, interviewing, and recommending candidates
for the agency's selection. Candidates from this group, like all other candidates for membership on the committee,
should possess appropriate qualifications to understand and contribute to the committee's work.




Industry Representatives




Regarding nominations for members representing industry interests, a letter will be sent to each person or organization
that has made a nomination and to other organizations that have expressed an interest in participating in the selection
process together with a complete list of all such organizations and the nominees. The letter will state that it is the
responsibility of each nominator or organization that has expressed an interest in participating in the selection
process to consult with the others and to provide a consensus slate of possible members representing industry interests
within 60 days. In the event that a slate of nominees has not been provided within 60 days, the agency will select an industry
representative for each such vacancy from the entire list of industry nominees to avoid delay or disruption of the
work of the committee. The agency is particularly interested in nominees that possess the essential scientific credentials
needed to participate fully and knowledgeably in the committee's deliberations. In addition to this expertise,
the agency believes that it would be an advantage to the committee's work if the individual(s) had special insight
and direct experience into specific industry-wide issues, practices, and concerns that might not otherwise be available
to others not similarly situated. 
 This notice is issued under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. app. 2) and 21 CFR part 14, relating to advisory
committees.

<DOCTITLE>Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc.; Premarket Approval of the 0060 Series ENDOTAK

 

 Lead System</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing its approval of the application by Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc.,
St. Paul, MN, for premarket approval, under section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), of the
0060 Series ENDOTAK

 

 Lead System (the ENDOTAK

 

 Lead System). After reviewing the recommendation of the Circulatory System Devices Panel, FDA's Center for Devices
and Radiological Health (CDRH) notified the applicant, by letter of August 26, 1993, of the approval of the application.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On December 19, 1991, Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc. (CPI), St. Paul, MN 55112, submitted to CDRH an application for premarket
approval of the ENDOTAK

 

 Lead System. The ENDOTAK

 

 Lead System consists of the following: The ENDOTAK

 

 C Lead Models 0060, 0062, 0064; Lead Stylet Models 6824 and 6825; ENDOTAK

 

 SQ Patch Lead Model 0063; commercially available AICD

TM

 Y Connector Model 6836; and Model 0056 Bipolar Positive Fixation Lead and Adapter. The ENDOTAK

 

 Lead System is used with commercially available AICD

TM

 Models 1550, 1555, and 1600. The ENDOTAK

 

 Lead System is a transvenous defibrillation lead system and is intended for the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias
in patients who are at high risk of sudden cardiac death. Such patients are defined as those who have experienced one
or more of the following: (1) Survived at least one episode of cardiac arrest presumably due to hemodynamically unstable
ventricular tachyarrhythmias unassociated with acute myocardial infarction; or (2) recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias
in the absence of such previous arrest and are inducible into sustained hypotensive ventricular tachycardia or ventricular
fibrillation despite conventional antiarrhythmic drug therapy.


A major consideration in choosing the ENDOTAK

 

 Lead System is that it does not require a thoracotomy. The physician should weigh its advantages against the patient's
ability to withstand additional electrophysiological testing (arrhythmia induction and conversion testing),
and a possible thoracotomy, should the lead system prove ineffective.
Various factors, such as cardiomegaly or drug therapy, may necessitate repositioning of the defibrillating leads
or substitution of one lead system for another in order to facilitate arrhythmia conversion. In some cases, reliable
arrhythmia conversion may not be obtained with any leads at the available AICD

TM

 energy levels.
Bipolar pacemakers may be used with the ENDOTAK

 

 Lead System and AICD

TM

 pulse generator as long as the pacemaker and AICD

TM

 pulse generator do not interact causing AICD

TM

 pulse generator nondetection or false detection.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing its approval of the application by MBf USA, Inc., Boca Raton,
FL, for premarket approval, under section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), of the AWARE Test
System. The Clinical Chemistry and Toxicology Devices Panel recommendation of approval, with conditions, was made
at a November 4, 1991, panel meeting. Approval was originally sought for over-the-counter (OTC) use by the applicant.
However, FDA has decided that this panel meeting did not consider various issues, and so the panel will resume deliberating
OTC use at a second meeting. As a result of the need for a second panel meeting, the applicant revised the indications
for use to reflect a more limited use. After reviewing the recommendation of the Clinical Chemistry and Toxicology
Devices Panel, FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) notified the applicant, by letter of January
18, 1994, of the approval of the application.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>

On December 13, 1990, American Drug Screens, Inc., Oklahoma City, OK 73108, submitted to CDRH an application for premarket
approval of the AWARE Test System. The device system has since been sold to MBf USA, Inc., 5100 Town Center Circle, suite
440, Boca Raton, FL 33486. This device is indicated for use as a specimen collection container and mailing kit and for
drug analysis to determine if significant levels of marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, phencyclidine (PCP), and/or
codeine or morphine are present in a urine sample. It is restricted to use by physicians or professionals who counsel
or treat individuals in connection with drug abuse. This system is not indicated for employee drug abuse testing,

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing its approval of the application by Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis,

 Transvene

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On April 1, 1992, Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, 55432, submitted to CDRH an application for premarket approval
of the Medtronic

 

 Transvene

 

 Lead System. The device is a transvenous defibrillation lead system and is intended for single long-term use, and
each lead is designed to be used only with a compatible Medtronic, Inc., implantable tachyarrhythmia control device
along with at least one other Medtronic, Inc., defibrillator lead. The lead system has application where implantable
tachyarrhythmia cardioversion or defibrillation systems are indicated. Current medical research indicates that
such patients should: (1) Have survived at least one episode of a cardiac arrest, presumably due to a ventricular tachyarrhythmia
as evidenced by resuscitation using a transthoracic defibrillator. The ventricular tachyarrhythmia should not
have been caused by an acute myocardial infarction; or (2) in the absence of a prior cardiac arrest, have poorly tolerated
sustained ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation, which occurs spontaneously, or can be induced,
despite the best antiarrhythmic drug therapy.


The natural history of patients with hemodynamically stable sustained ventricular tachycardia is not well defined.
While this patient population was included in the Transvene

 

 lead clinical study, no conclusions were drawn from the data obtained on this specific patient group.
Prior to a Transvene

 

 implant, it is strongly recommended that patients undergo a complete cardiac evaluation, which should include extensive
electrophysiologic testing. Also, extensive electrophysiologic evaluation and testing of the safety and efficacy
of the proposed pacing, cardioversion, or defibrillation therapies are recommended during and after the implantation
of the Transvene

 

 system.
On August 2, 1993, the Circulatory System Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee, an FDA advisory
committee, reviewed and recommended approval of the application. On December 9, 1993, CDRH approved the application
by a letter to the applicant from the Acting Director of the Office of Device Evaluation, CDRH.
A summary of the safety and effectiveness data on which CDRH based its approval is on file in the Dockets Management
Branch (address above) and is available from that office upon written request. Requests should be identified with

 (polymacon) Hydrophilic Contact Lenses. In accordance with the provisions of section 515 (c)(2) of the act as amended
by the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, this PMA was not referred to the Ophthalmic Devices Panel of the Medical Devices
Advisory Committee, an FDA advisory committee, for review and recommendation because the information in the PMA
substantially duplicates information previously reviewed by this panel. On November 26, 1993, CDRH approved the
application by a letter to the applicant from the Acting Director of the Office of Device Evaluation, CDRH.


A summary of the safety and effectiveness data on which CDRH based its approval is on file in the Dockets Management
Branch (address above) and is available from that office upon written request. Requests should be identified with
the name of the device and the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document.
The labeling of the S-38

TM

 Soft (Polymacon) Contact Lens states that the lens is to be used only with certain solutions for disinfection and other
purposes. The restrictive labeling informs new users that they must avoid using certain products, such as solutions
intended for use with hard contact lenses only.


Opportunity for Administrative Review


Section 515(d)(3) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(d)(3)) authorizes any interested person to petition, under section
515(g) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(g)), for administrative review of CDRH's decision to approve this application.
A petitioner may request either a formal hearing under part 12 (21 CFR part 12) of FDA's administrative practices and
procedures regulations or a review of the application and CDRH's action by an independent advisory committee of experts.
A petition is to be in the form of a petition for reconsideration under  10.33(b) (21 CFR 10.33(b)). A petitioner
shall identify the form of review requested (hearing or independent advisory committee) and shall submit with the
petition supporting data and information showing that there is a genuine and substantial issue of material fact for
resolution through administrative review. After reviewing the petition, FDA will decide whether to grant or deny
the petition and will publish a notice of its decision in the 

Federal Register

. If FDA grants the petition, the notice will state the issue to be reviewed, the form of review to be used, the persons
who may participate in the review, the time and place where the review will occur, and other details.
Petitioners may, at any time on or before May 19, 1994, file with the Dockets Management Branch (address above) two
copies of each petition and supporting data and information, identified with the name of the device and the docket
number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received petitions may be seen in the office above between
9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
This notice is issued under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (secs. 515(d), 520(h) (21 U.S.C. 360e(d), 360j(h)))
and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.10) and redelegated to the Center for
Devices and Radiological Health (21 CFR 5.53).

NOFA for Public and Indian Housing Family Investment Centers; Amendment and Announcement of OMB Control Number 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Amendment of NOFA and announcement of OMB control number.



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice amends a NOFA that was published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 28, 1994 (59 FR 9592) to: (1) Revise the application availability and deadline dates; (2) extend the activities
eligible for funding to include acquisition and new construction; (3) decrease the amount of funds made available
for Family Investment Centers (FIC) for Public and Indian Housing; and (4) announce the OMB control number issued
for the information collection requirements.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Because of unforeseen circumstances, the availability of the application kit for the funds announced in this NOFA
has been delayed. Therefore, the Department also is extending the deadline for applications accordingly. In addition,
this amendment issues an interpretation that is the result of inquiries following the publication of the NOFA, and
publishes the control number assigned by OMB for the information collection requirements associated with this NOFA.




The Department also is announcing that it will be making available from FIC $5 million for a Youth Development Initiative
that will be announced in the 

Federal Register

 in a separate NOFA. The Youth Development Initiative will be a grant competition under FIC, as a part of ``Operation
Safe Home,'' a major Clinton Administration Initiative that addresses the larger problem of violence in America's
low-income communities. Five $1 million grants will be awarded to Public Housing Authorities for innovative strategies
for curbing crime among youth, and for youth leadership and development programs that will provide young individuals
in public housing with better access to comprehensive education, employment opportunities, and supportive services
to achieve self-sufficiency. 

Accordingly, FR Doc. 94-4413, the NOFA for Public and Indian Housing Family Investment Centers, published
at 59 FR 9592 (February 28, 19942) is amended as follows: 

1. In the Summary on page 9592, column 1, the first sentence is amended by revising the total amount of funding available
under the NOFA from ``$74 million'' to ``$69 million''. 

2. On page 9592, column 1, the paragraph following the heading ``Dates'' is revised to read as follows: 

Application kits will be available beginning April 22, 1994. The application deadline will be 4:30 p.m., local time,
on July 22, 1994. 

3. On page 9592, column 2, the text following the heading ``Paperwork Reduction Act Statement'' and preceding the
heading ``I. Purpose and Substantive Description'' is revised to read as follows: 

The information collection requirements contained in this notice have been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget, under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), and assigned
OMB control number 2577-0189. 

4. Under the heading ``Allocation Amounts'' on page 9592, in the third column, the first sentence of the second paragraph
is amended by revising the total amount of funding available under the NOFA from ``$74 million to ``$69 million'',
and two new sentences are added to the end of the second paragraph, to read as follows: 

In addition, the Department intends to make $5 million available for antiviolence programs that provide education
and employment opportunities for youth in public housing under the Administration's Operation Safe Home Initiative.
A separate NOFA announcing these funds and soliciting applications also is expected to be published soon in the 

Federal Register

. 

5. On page 9594, column 1, paragraph (c) under the paragraph heading ``(2) Eligible Activities.'' is revised to read
as follows: 

The renovation, acquisition, or construction of facilities located near the premises of one or more HA developments
to accommodate the provision of supportive services. Under this NOFA, acquisition and new construction will be treated
the same as substantial rehabilitation (renovation/conversion) activities, for such purposes as ranking and submission
requirements. 

6. On page 9598, column 3, under the paragraph beginning ``(12) A certification that:'', the word ``and'' is removed
at the end of paragraph (b); the period is removed at the end of paragraph (c) and is replaced with ``; and''; and a new
paragraph (d) is added, to read as follows:

(d) If new construction is undertaken, the HA has looked at other appropriate facilities and cannot make those usable
for FIC purposes. 



* * * * * 



7. On page 9600, column 1, before the heading ``IV. Corrections to Deficient Applications'', the word ``and'' is removed
at the end of paragraph (b); the period is removed at the end of paragraph (c) and is replaced with ``; and''; and a new
paragraph (d) is added, to read as follows:

(d) If new construction is undertaken, the HA has looked at other appropriate facilities and cannot make those usable

<DOCTITLE>All-American Canal Lining Project, Imperial County, CA</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bureau of Reclamation, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of the final environmental impact statement/final environmental impact report: INT FES-94-9.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and section 21002 of the
California Environmental Quality Act, Reclamation and the Imperial Irrigation District have issued a joint final
environmental impact statement/final environmental impact report (FEIS/FEIR) on a proposed canal lining project.
Reclamation proposes to conserve about 67,700 acre-feet of water, annually lost through seepage from the federally
owned, unlined All-American Canal, for beneficial use in southern California. The canal delivers 3.3 million acre-feet
of water annually from the Colorado River for the Imperial Valley and Coachella Valley.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The preferred alternative presented in the FEIS/FEIR is to construct a new concrete-lined canal parallel to the 23-mile
reach of the existing unlined canal from 1 mile west of Pilot Knob to Drop 3.


The project is authorized by Public Law 100-675. The Imperial Irrigation District proposes to construct the
project with funds provided by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) in accordance with Public
Law 100-675. The conserved water would be utilized by MWD and other California water agencies holding Colorado
River water delivery contracts with the Secretary of the Interior.
The environmental aspects of primary concern are the potential loss of wetlands habitat along the All-American Canal
that have been induced by canal seepage, the loss of terrestrial habitat, and the reduction in the canal fishery.
These potential losses would be mitigated by enhancing unaffected wetlands along the canal, acquiring and protecting
terrestrial habitat, and replacing canal fishery habitat.
The FEIS/FEIR presents the preferred alternative and four other alternatives, including the no Federal action alternative,
describes the existing environment and the environmental consequences of project construction, and presents the
proposed mitigation plan. It also documents the comments received during the 90-day public review of the draft environmental
impact statement/draft environmental impact report and presents Reclamation's responses to comments.

<DOCTITLE>Wheeling & Lake Erie Railway Company_Abandonment Exemption_In Stark and Wayne Counties, OH </DOCTITLE>



Wheeling & Lake Erie Railway Company (W&LE) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR Part 1152 subpart
F_Exempt Abandonments to abandon its line of railroad, known as the Dalton Branch, extending from milepost 16.4 in
Massillon, Stark County, OH to the end of track at milepost 7.0 in Dalton, Wayne County, OH, a distance of 9.4 miles.


W&LE has certified that: 

(1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; 

(2) No overhead traffic has moved or could move over the line (the stub-ended Dalton Branch is not a through route and
thus cannot be utilized for overhead traffic); 

(3) No formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity acting on
behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any
U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and 

(4) The requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental reports), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic reports), 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal
letter), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication), and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have
been met. 

As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the abandonment shall be protected under
Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately
protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. 

Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption
will be effective on May 19, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental
issues,

1

 formal expressions of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2),

2

 and trail use/rail banking requests under 49 CFR 1152.29

3

 must be filed by April 29, 1994. Petitions to reopen or requests for public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28 must
be filed by May 9, 1994, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington,
DC 20423. 







A copy of any pleading filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: Thomas J. Litwiler,
Two Prudential Plaza, 45th Floor, 180 North Stetson Ave., Chicago, IL 60601. 

If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void

 ab initio. 

W&LE has filed an environmental report which addresses the abandonment's effects, if any, on the environmental
and historic resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental assessment (EA)
by April 22, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA by writing to SEA (room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission,
Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief of SEA, at (202) 927-6248. Comments on environmental
and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA is available to the public. 

Environmental, historic preservation, public use, or trail use/rail banking conditions will be imposed, where
appropriate, in a subsequent decision. 

 


Decided: 

April 8, 1994.




By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings.

<USDEPT>NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Records Schedules; Availability and Request for Comments</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Archives and Records Administration, Office of Records Administration.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of proposed records schedules; request for comments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) publishes notice at least once monthly of certain Federal
agency requests for records disposition authority (records schedules). Records schedules identify records of
sufficient value to warrant preservation in the National Archives of the United States. Schedules also authorize
agencies after a specified period to dispose of records lacking administrative, legal, research, or other value.
Notice is published for records schedules that (1) propose the destruction of records not previously authorized
for disposal, or (2) reduce the retention period for records already authorized for disposal. NARA invites public
comments on such schedules, as required by 44 U.S.C. 3303a(a).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Each year U.S. Government agencies create billions of records on paper, film, magnetic tape, and other media. In order
to control this accumulation, agency records managers prepare records schedules specifying when the agency no longer
needs the records and what happens to the records after this period. Some schedules are comprehensive and cover all
the records of an agency or one of its major subdivisions. These comprehensive schedules provide for the eventual
transfer to the National Archives of historically valuable records and authorize the disposal of all other records.
Most schedules, however, cover records of only one office or program or a few series of records, and many are updates
of previously approved schedules. Such schedules also may include records that are designated for permanent retention.


Destruction of records requires the approval of the Archivist of the United States. This approval is granted after
a thorough study of the records that takes into account their administrative use by the agency of origin, the rights
of the Government and of private persons directly affected by the Government's activities, and historical or other
value.
This public notice identifies the Federal agencies and their subdivisions requesting disposition authority, includes
the control number assigned to each schedule, and briefly describes the records proposed for disposal. The records
schedule contains additional information about the records and their disposition. Further information about the
disposition process will be furnished to each requester.

<DOCTITLE>Receipt of Petition for Director's Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206</DOCTITLE>




Notice hereby given that by Petition dated March 7, 1994, Thomas J. Saporito, Jr. (Petitioner), has requested that
the NRC taken action with regard to the Florida Power and Light Company. Specifically, the Petitioner requests that
the NRC: (1) Submit an amicus curiae brief to the Department of Labor (DOL) regarding his complaints number 89-ERA-007
and 89-ERA-017 concerning the Petitioner's claim that the licensee retaliated against him for engaging
in protected activity during his employment at Turkey Point Nuclear Station in violation of 10 CFR 50.7; (2) institute
a show cause proceeding pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202 to modify, suspend or revoke the licensee's licenses authorizing
the operation of Turkey Point; and (3) institute a show cause proceeding pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202 and order the licensee
to provide the Petitioner with a ``make whole'' remedy, including but not limited to, immediate reinstatement to
his previous position, back wages and front pay with interest, compensatory damages for pain and suffering, and a
posting requirement to offset any ``chilling effect'' Petitioner's discharge may have had upon other employees
at the Turkey Point and St. Lucie Nuclear Stations. 

The Petitioner's stated bases for his requests can be summarized as follows: (1) Although the NRC generally defers
to the DOL process before taking action against a licensee, in this case the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) rendered
a decision, enabling the NRC to take the action Petitioner requests, particularly to offset any ``chilling effect''
which may have resulted from the licensee's action; (2) under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with DOL, there
are times NRC actions are warranted notwithstanding the ongoing DOL process because of the significance of the issues
to public health and safety; (3) the record in this case contains evidence which was ignored by the ALJ, and the NRC should
weigh the entire record in determining whether the licensee violated the Energy Reorganization Act (ERA) and 10 CFR
50.7; (4) the ALJ erred in several respects as a matter of law in reaching his decision that the Petitioner was not discriminated
against; (5) the adverse action by the licensee occurred immediately after the Petitioner was in contact with the
NRC and filed complaints under the ERA with DOL; (6) the licensee's actions against the Petitioner constitute a ``hostile
work environment'' and the NRC is mandated by Congress to ensure that a non-hostile work environment exists at NRC-licensed
facilities; (7) the NRC has a duty to ensure that licensee employers maintain a work environment which encourages
employees to raise safety issues, which is not the situation at Turkey Point because of the licensee's continuing
retaliation against employees who do so; (8) the licensee illegally interrogated Petitioner about his protected
activity; (9) if the NRC fails to act, it will contradict its own regulations that recognize the right of employees
to bypass management and report their concerns directly to the NRC; (10) the NRC has expressly defined ``protected
activities''; (11) the licensee's request that Petitioner be examined by a company doctor was unjustified; (12)
the licensee's disparate treatment of Petitioner was illegal and must be challenged by the NRC; and (13) the NRC is
required to act by virtue of its regulations at 10 CFR 50.9 which provide that the DOL process is an extension of NRC authority.


The request is being treated pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206 of the Commission's regulations. The request has been referred
to the Director, Office of Enforcement. 

A copy of the Petition is available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555.

<DOCTITLE>Tennessee Valley Authority, Watts Bar Nuclear Plant; Receipt of Petition for Director's Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206</DOCTITLE>







Notice is hereby given that by letter dated February 25, 1994 George M. Gillilan (Petitioner) has requested that the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC): (1) Immediately impose a $25,000 per day fine on the Tennessee Valley Authority
(TVA) until all reprisal, intimidation, harassment and discrimination actions involving the Petitioner are settled
to the Petitioner's satisfaction, and (2) appoint an independent arbitration board to review all past Department
of Labor suits and EEO complaints filed against TVA concerning the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant. Since this latter remedy
is beyond the scope of the Commission's authority, it has been denied.
As basis for this relief, the Petitioner asserts that due to his reporting of safety concerns to the Commission, TVA
management has subjected him to continuous intimidation, harassment, discrimination and reprisal actions, that
his name has been placed on a blackball list that has been circulated nationwide preventing him from obtaining suitable
employment outside of TVA and that this has affected his mental and physical health.

The request is being treated pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206 of the Commission's regulations. The request has been referred
to the Director, Office of Enforcement. By letter dated April 7, 1994, the portion of the Petitioner's request that
asked for immediate action has been denied. As provided by  2.206, appropriate action will be taken on this request
within a reasonable time. A copy of the Petition is available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room,
2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

<DOCTITLE>Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Birmingham, AL; Order Imposing Civil Monetary Penalty</DOCTITLE>



I



The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Birmingham, Alabama (Licensee) is the holder of Byproduct Material
License No. 01-00643-02 (License), issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission)
pursuant to 10 CFR parts 30 and 35. The Licensee is authorized to possess and use byproduct material for diagnostic
and therapeutic nuclear medicine procedures, and for research and development purposes. This is a broad scope license
and use of licensed material on humans is permitted by or under the supervision of a physician authorized by the Licensee's
Radiation Safety Committee, subject to the training and experience requirements in 10 CFR Part 35, Subpart J. The
License was most recently amended on April 10, 1992, and was due to expire on July 31, 1992. The License is currently
under timely renewal.



II



On September 13, 1991, an allegation was received by the NRC relating to possible administrations of radiopharmaceuticals
in excess of prescribed dosages and possible falsification of records to conceal the misadministration. As a result,
an investigation was conducted by the NRC Office of Investigations from October 9, 1991, through September 14, 1992.

The results of the investigation indicated that the Licensee had not conducted its activities in full compliance
with NRC requirements. A written Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty (Notice) was served
upon the Licensee by letter dated September 13, 1993. The Notice addressed the nature of the violations, the provisions
of the NRC's requirements that had been violated, and the amount of the civil penalty proposed for the violations.

The Licensee responded to the Notice by two letters dated November 9, 1993. In its response, the Licensee admitted
Violations A and C.1, denied Violations B and C.2, and requested partial mitigation of the civil penalty based on its
prior performance.



III



After consideration of the Licensee's response and the statements of fact, explanation, and argument for partial
mitigation contained therein, the NRC staff has determined, as set forth in the Appendix to this Order, that the violations
occurred as stated and that the penalty proposed for the violations designated in the Notice should be imposed.



IV



In view of the foregoing and pursuant to Section 234 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (Act), 42 U.S.C. 2282,
and 10 CFR 2.205, 

it is hereby ordered

 That: The Licensee pay a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000 within 30 days of the date of this Order, by check, draft,
money order, or electronic transfer, payable to the Treasurer of the United States and mailed to the Director, Office
of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ATTN: Document Control Desk, Washington, DC 20555.



V



The Licensee may request a hearing within 30 days of the date of this Order. A request for hearing should be clearly marked
as a ``Request for an Enforcement Hearing'' and shall be addressed to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, with a copy to the Commission's Document Control Desk, Washington,
DC, 20555. Copies also shall be sent to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement at the same address
and to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region II, 101 Marietta Street, NW., suite 2900, Atlanta, Georgia 30323.

If a hearing is requested, the Commission will issue an Order designating the time and place of the hearing. If the Licensee
fails to request a hearing within 30 days of the date of this Order, the provisions of this Order shall be effective without
further proceedings. If payment has not been made by that time, the matter may be referred to the Attorney General for
collection.

In the event the Licensee requests a hearing as provided above, the issues to be considered at such a hearing shall be:

(a) Whether the Licensee was in violation of the Commission's requirements as set forth in Violation B and Violation
C.2 of the Notice referenced in Section II above, and

Appendix_Evaluations and Conclusion



On September 13, 1993, a Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty (Notice) was issued for three
violations identified during an investigation conducted by the NRC Office of Investigations (OI) from October 9,
1991 through September 14, 1992. Department of Veterans Affairs (Licensee) responded to the Notice in two letters
dated November 9, 1993. In its responses, the Licensee admitted Violations A and C.1, denied Violations B and C.2,
and requested partial mitigation of the civil penalty based on its prior performance and lack of evidence of actual
harm to any patient or member of the public. The NRC's evaluations and conclusion regarding the Licensee's requests
are as follows:



Restatement of Violation B




10 CFR 35.53 requires, in part, that a licensee measure the activity of each radiopharmaceutical dose that contains
more than 10 microcuries of a photon-emitting radionuclide before medical use.

Contrary to the above, the technologist failed to measure three radiopharmaceutical doses that contained more than
10 microcuries of a photon-emitting radionuclide administered to patients on July 22, 1991.



Summary of Licensee Response to Violation B



The Licensee denied this violation and indicated that the evidence does not support the technologist's alleged failure
to measure the radiopharmaceutical doses on July 22, 1991. In support of its denial, the Licensee stated that the count
rates of these doses when compared with the count rates of seven doses administered within sixty days of July 22, 1991,
reflect doses within acceptable limits. Therefore, argues the Licensee, it is not credible that this could be a chance
result in the absence of measuring by the technologist.



NRC Evaluation of Licensee's Response to Violation B



The Licensee presented data to indicate that the doses administered on July 22, 1991, had count rates similar to those
previously administered. This data, however, provides no information which would indicate that the does administered
to patients on July 22, 1991, were measured in a dose calibrator at the appropriate setting for Technetium-99m.
The information is not material to Violation B in that your analyses provides information relating to the activity
of material as measured during the scans themselves, but not whether activity was measured in the dose calibrator
prior to administration.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940419-2-00116 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940419-2-00067 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

As stated in the NRC letter transmitting the Notice, the NRC's conclusion that the technologist failed to measure
the dosages was based on: (1) The setting of a different isotope channel on both dose calibrators during the time the
technologist stated he measured three patient doses, (2) the missing radioactive material, (3) the high volume of
radioactive material recorded by the technologist on the patient dose log, and (4) the technologist's past history
of committing errors and omissions in patient dose records. 

If proper measurements had occurred, the technologist would have noticed the improper radionuclide channel (i.e.,
Thallium) and reset it when measuring the doses. The technologist would not have recorded the high volumes on the patient
dose log. The technologist admitted that the volumes in the records were fabricated, indicating that he had no knowledge
of the amount of doses administered providing further evidence that he has not measured the doses. The Licensee's
response did not address any of the evidence which indicated that the dosages had not been measured prior to administration.


Moreover, the staff disagrees with the Licensee's argument that it is not credible to have the count rate of the seven
doses favorably compare with the doses administered on July 22, 1991, in the absence of measuring the dose in the dose
calibrator. An experienced technologist, knowing a prescribed radiopharmaceutical dose, may approximate with
some success the radiopharmaceutical dose by approximating the volume of the material. However, this method is not
reliable to assess the radiopharmaceutical dose and does not meet the requirement in 10 CFR 35.53(a) to measure each
radiopharmaceutical dosage in a dose calibrator. 

The preponderance of the evidence in this case indicates that the technologist failed to measure the doses. The NRC
concludes that the violation did occur as stated in the Notice. 



Restatement of Violation C.2 



10 CFR 35.21 requires, in part, that the licensee, through the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO): (1) Ensure that radiation
safety activities are being performed in accordance with approved procedures and regulatory requirements in the
daily operation of the licensee's byproduct material program; and (2) that the RSO investigate misadministrations
and other deviations from approved radiation safety practice and implement corrective actions as necessary. 

Contrary to the above, the licensee failed to conduct a prompt and adequate investigation of possible misadministrations
of radiopharmaceuticals to patients during the week of July 22 through 26, 1991. Specifically, once notified of the
allegation, the RSO failed to obtain a copy and review a letter from the acting supervisor describing the possible
misadministrations or to interview individuals who had first-hand knowledge that was material to the investigation.




Summary of Licensee's Response to Violation C.2 



The Licensee denied that Violation C.2 constituted a breach of regulations. While it admitted that the regulations
require the RSO to investigate misadministrations, the Licensee stated that the regulations provide no standard
for the performance of the investigation and do not require that the investigation be performed in a ``prompt or adequate''
manner or to the satisfaction of the NRC. The Licensee stated that it conducted an investigation concerning this matter.


The Licensee also stated that during the enforcement conference held on February 16, 1993, Mr. Ebneter, Regional
Administrator, Region II, pointed out that there was no regulation that tells the Licensee what has to be included
in an investigation. The Licensee also stated that Dr. Mallett, Deputy Director, Division of Radiation Safety and
Safeguards, Region II, indicated that he was comfortable with the Licensee's statement that it has looked at the rates
(as part of the investigation) and expressed satisfaction with the results of the Licensee's investigation. 

The Licensee denied that the investigation was not prompt or thorough, since the RSO was summoned back to duty from
vacation to look into the matter, the technologist at fault was counseled, and the NRC notified. The Licensee's investigation
concluded from statistical studies that there was no misadministration and that the errors were ones of record-keeping.
In addition, the Licensee stated that the NRC has not suggested what additional information or result could have been
obtained had the investigation been performed differently. 



NRC Evaluation of Licensee's Response to Violation C.2 



The need for the Licensee to perform investigations that are prompt and adequate is implicit in 10 CFR 35.21. One purpose
of the requirement for an investigation of a possible misadministration is to determine whether there has, in fact,
been any misadministration. Further, the Commission's regulations require the licensee to implement as necessary
and, ensure corrective actions are taken. This protects individual patients and prevents future or potential misadministrations.
An investigation that is not prompt and not adequate cannot achieve these goals nor preclude potential or recurring
violation. Accordingly, the NRC rejects the Licensee's argument. In view of the above, the issue is whether the Licensee's
investigation was in fact prompt and adequate.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940419-2-00117 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940419-2-00067 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The NRC recognizes that the RSO was summoned back from vacation and initiated an investigation within a few days of
the request for his return, that the technologist at fault was counseled, and that the NRC was notified.
However, the NRC maintains that the Licensee's investigation was not adequate as defined in the NRC regulations.
Section 35.21 of 10 CFR part 35, requires, in part, that a Licensee investigate misadministrations and other deviations
from approved radiation safety practices and ``* * * 

implement corrective actions as necessary

'' (emphasis added). The NRC does expect, and the regulations do require, that such investigations be adequate to
meet the purpose of the investigations_the implementation of effective corrective actions.
The investigation conducted by the Licensee was not adequate to determine the root cause of the problems and thus,
the Licensee's corrective actions were ineffective, as evidenced by the technologist's continual failures to record
the administered radiopharmaceutical activity and volume and the lack of supervisory oversight (see pages 75 and
76 of the transcribed enforcement conference). During the enforcement conference referenced in the Licensee's
response, the NRC pointed out that the Licensee did not perform an adequate investigation (P 75 and 76). The two specific
issues contained in the Notice, failure to review the letter that described the possible misadministration and failure
to interview individuals who had first-hand knowledge of this matter, are examples of inadequacies in the investigation
that led to the Licensee's inability to determine the root cause and take effective corrective actions.
With regard to Mr. Ebneter's statement that there was no regulation that tells the Licensee what has to be included
in investigations, it is true that the NRC regulations do not prescribe the exact methodology for conducting investigations.
As discussed above in this section and by Mr. Ebneter during the enforcement conference, however, the investigation
results are important and the regulations do prescribe that the investigation must be adequate to implement effective
corrective actions.
Concerning Dr. Mallett's statement that he was comfortable with the Licensee's review of the count rates, the NRC
notes that Dr. Mallett's statement was not intended to suggest that the NRC considered the investigation adequate;
the statement was limited to what it said_that Dr. Mallett was comfortable with that one aspect of the investigation
(i.e., the Licensee's review of the count rates). The Licensee's assertion that this meant Dr. Mallett was satisfied
with the investigation as a whole appears to have been taken out of context. Within the context of the full meeting,
it is clear the NRC did not conclude that the investigation had been adequate.
The NRC concludes that the violation did occur as stated in the Notice.


Summary of Licensee's Request for Mitigation


The Licensee stated that Violation B and Violation C.2 did not occur. The Licensee stated that there is no evidence
of harm to any patient or member of the public, even of a minor nature. The Licensee further stated that the evidence
does not demonstrate a misadministration of dosages on July 22, 1991 and that the technologist who administered the
doses denied administering excessive doses to patients on July 22, 1991.
The Licensee further contended that the errors were essentially record-keeping errors of the Severity Level IV or
V type that might be aggregated to Severity Level III or IV but are not Severity Level II violations. In addition, the
Licensee stated that its performance has improved over the past year as demonstrated by the last two NRC inspections.
Thus, the Licensee argues, in accordance with the Enforcement Policy, the NRC should not have escalated the penalty
50 percent for poor past performance because its performance is improving.


NRC Evaluation of Licensee's Request Mitigation


The arguments made by the Licensee concerning the acceptability of the doses and the lack of evidence of harm to patients
or members of the general public do not relate to the requirement to measure dosages prior to administration or to the
requirements to perform adequate investigation of possible misadministrations. Further, the Licensee's contention
that the evidence does not demonstrate misadministration of doses, or excessive or inadequate doses, is not pertinent
to the violation cited. The Licensee was not cited for administering excessive or inadequate doses, or misadministrations.
These arguments only provide information that the Licensee believes that excessive dosages were not administered.
With regard to the Licensee's request to reduce the severity level from a Severity Level II to a Severity Level III or
Severity Level IV, the NRC notes that Section IV of the Enforcement Policy (i.e., 10 CFR part 2, Appendix C) states,
in part, that ``Supplements I through VIII provide examples and serve as guidance in determining the severity level
for violations in each of the eight activity areas. However, the examples are neither exhaustive nor controlling
* * *. The NRC reviews each case being considered for enforcement action on its own merits to ensure
that the severity of the violation is characterized at the level best suited to the significance of the particular
violation. In some cases special circumstances may warrant an adjustment to the severity level characterization.''

In this case, the NRC had a very significant regulatory concern as noted in the cover letter to the Notice. There were
numerous instances where patient dosages were not measured, numerous instances where patient dosages were not accurately
recorded prior to administration, and for an extended period of time, effective corrective actions were not taken.
The severity of the violations was exacerbated by the technologist's continual failures to accurately record patient
dosages despite repeated counseling, and by the failure on the part of the Chairman of the Radiation Safety Committee
to take strong and effective corrective actions in the face of the known repeated violations on the part of the technologist.
Given these circumstances and the very significant regulatory concern surrounding this case, a Severity Level II
Problem categorization was warranted, in accordance with Section IV of the Enforcement Policy.
With reference to the Licensee's performance, the NRC recognizes that inspections of the Licensee during the period
of late 1992 and 1993 have not shown the same level of poor performance as identified in 1991 and early 1992. The Enforcement
Policy statement regarding improved performance relates to performance during the period of either the last two
years prior to the inspection at issue or the period of the last two inspections prior to the inspection at issue, whichever
is longer. Thus, any improvement in performance subsequent to the inspection at issue may not be considered as part
of any mitigation for the licensee performance factor.


NRC Conclusion


Based on its evaluation of the Licensee's responses, the NRC concludes that Violations B and C.2 did occur as stated,
that all violations delineated in the Notice were properly categorized in aggregate as a Severity Level II problem,
and that an adequate basis for mitigation of the proposed civil penalty has not been provided by the Licensee. Accordingly,
a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $10,000 should be imposed by order.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the American
Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Minimum Fractional Change for Trading in Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipts



April 12, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on April 7, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Exchange proposed to amend Rule 127, Commentary .01 to provide that the minimum fractional change applicable
to trading of Standard & Poor's (``S&P'') Depositary Receipts (``SPDRs'') shall be 1/64 of $1.00.
 The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex, and at the Commission.





II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purposes of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose



Amex Rule 127 provides parameters for the minimum fractional change for dealings in securities on the Exchange. Commentary
.01 to Rule 127 provides that for securities listed under Amex Rule 1000 

et seq., 

Portfolio Depositary Receipts (``PDRs''), the minimum fractional change shall be 1/32 of $1.00. One issuance of
PDRs, SPDRs, is currently trading on the Exchange. The Exchange now proposes to reduce the minimum fractional change
applicable to SPDRs to 1/64.

In approving trading of PDRs in 1/32's, the Commission stated that such trading would enhance market liquidity and
should promote more accurate pricing, tighter quotations and reduced price fluctuations. The Commission also noted
that such trading should allow customers to receive the best possible execution of their transactions in these securities.






The Exchange believes the benefits identified by the Commission in connection with trading PDRs in 1/32's will be
further enhanced by trading SPDRs in 1/64's. Such trading should further reduce price fluctuations based on the underlying
index for the particular issuance (i.e., S&P 500 Index). Such trading parameters should benefit retail customers,
institutions, and other market participants that invest in or trade SPDRs. In addition, a narrower quotation spread
should make such securities more useful professionals who may hedge their positions in futures or other derivative
markets.

The Exchange will issue an Information Circular to members and member organizations relating to trading SPDRs in
1/64's prior to commencement of such trading.



2. Statutory Basis



The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section
6(b)(5) in particular in that it is intended to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to facilitate transactions
in securities, and to protect investors and the public interest.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The proposed rule change will impose no burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The foregoing rule change establishes or changes a due, fee, or other charge imposed by the Exchange and therefore
has become effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder.
At any time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the
protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. Sr-Amex-94-10
and should be submitted by May 10, 1994.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change
and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Amendment No. 1 to Proposed Rule Change Relating to
Corporate Governance Issues</DOCTITLE>



April 12, 1994.



I. Introduction



On October 21, 1993, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to amend the Exchange's Charter, Constitution, and rules relating to corporate governance
issues. On March 29, 1994, the CHX submitted Amendment No. 1 to the rule filing.
 Specifically, the changes concern: (i) The limitation of Governor monetary liability under Delaware law, (ii) providing
more flexibility in setting the dates for the annual meeting and election, (iii) providing more flexibility in the
number of Governors who can serve on the Executive and Finance Committees, and (iv) granting the President full voting
powers on the Executive Committee.







The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33318 (December 10, 1993),
58 FR 66042 (December 17, 1993). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposed rule change
as amended.



II. Description of the Proposal



Liability of Governors



Delaware's General Corporation Law permits the adoption of a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation of a Delaware
corporation that limits or eliminates the potential monetary liability of directors to the corporation or its shareholders
by reason of their conduct as directors under certain circumstances. Such a provision does not apply to acts or omissions
of directors occurring prior to the approval of the provision by shareholders and the filing of the amendment to the
Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Delaware.

Because the CHX is a Delaware Corporation, the amendment to Article Eleventh of its Certificate of Incorporation
is based on section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware Corporations Code.
 Section 102(b)(7) permits corporations to include in their certificates of incorporation a provision limiting
or eliminating the personal liability of directors to the corporation and its shareholders for monetary damages
for a breach of their fiduciary duty. The statute does not permit the limitation or elimination of director's liability
under the following circumstances: (1) A breach of the director's duty of loyalty, (2) acts or omissions not in good
faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of the law, (3) unlawful payment of dividends
or unlawful stock purchases or redemptions, or (4) any transaction from which the director derives an improper personal
benefit.
 In addition, the statute does not permit the adoption of any provision that would eliminate or limit the liability
of a director for any act or omission occurring prior to the date when such provision becomes effective.








The Delaware statute does not eliminate a director's fiduciary duty, but rather prevents the imposition of monetary
damages in the event of a breach of that duty. Other legal remedies for breach of fiduciary duty, such as rescission
and injunction, remain available under the Delaware provision.

The amendment to the CHX's Certificate of Incorporation limits the liability of Governors to the fullest extent of
Delaware Law. The amendment includes the exclusions from limited liability enumerated in Delaware section 207(b)(7)
and adds an exclusion where liability arises directly or indirectly as a result of a violation of a federal securities
laws. The amendment also eliminates Governor monetary liability for acts occurring after the amendment becomes
effective to the fullest extent from time to time permitted by Delaware law, thus automatically incorporating any
future statutory revisions limiting Governor liability.

Annual Meeting and Election 


Instead of holding one annual meeting, the amendment to Article IV, section 2 of the CHX's Constitution provides for
two annual meetings to be held in April: An annual election meeting and an annual report meeting. The Board will have
the flexibility to annually determine on which business days in April to hold the meetings. The annual election meeting
will be held to vote for Governors and the Nominating Committee. The annual report meeting will be held to provide management,
the Board, and members an opportunity to discuss the previous year's results and current issues facing the Exchange.
The Board could determine to have these meetings on the same day or different days in April. 


Composition of the Executive and Finance Committees 


The amendment to Article V, Section 4 of the CHX's Constitution and Article IV, Rule 2 of its Rules provides that the
specified number of Governors who may serve on the Executive and Finance Committees are minimums. Currently the Executive
Committee is composed of 7 Board members plus the President and Chairman of the Board as ex-officio members.
 The Finance Committee is composed of 5 Board members plus the two ex-officio members. The number of Committee members
could be increased if the Vice Chairman and the Board so determine. 




Voting Powers of the President and Chairman 


Article VI, Section 4 of the CHX's Constitution provides that the President is ``a member of the Board of Governors
and an ex-officio member, without the right to vote, of all committees except the Nominating, Audit, and Compensation
Committees.'' The rule change grants the president voting power on the Exchange's Committees of which he is an ex-officio
member if so designated in the CHX's Constitution or Rules. The rule change to Article V, Section 4 of the CHS's Constitution
grants the President full voting powers on the Executive Committee. In addition, the rule change adds Judiciary Committees
and the Committee on Organization and Governance to the list of committees of which the president is not an ex-officio
member. 
Article VI, Section 2 of the CHX's Constitution provides that the Chairman of the Board of Governors is ``an ex-officio
member, without the right to vote except as otherwise designated in this Constitution, of all committees except the
Nominating Committee.'' The rule change allows to Exchange to designate the Chairman's right to vote on committees
in the Exchange's Rules as well as the Constitution. The rule change to Article IV, Rules 7 and 9 of the Exchange's Rules
grants the Chairman of the Board full voting powers on the Committee on Organization and Governance and the Compensation
Committee. In addition, the rule change to Article VI, Section 2 of the Constitution specifies that the Chairman is
not a member of any Judiciary Committee. 


Miscellaneous 


Finally, the rule change replaces the term ``Public Governor'' with ``non-member Governor'' and provides the definition
of the term in Article IV, Rule 7 of the CHX's Rules to state that ``the term non-member Governor shall mean a Governor
who is unaffiliated with the Exchange or any broker or dealer in securities, as defined in Article III, Section 2 of
the Exchange's Constitution.'' The rule change also adds the term ``non-member Governor'' to Article IV, Rule 8.

III. Discussion


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and with the requirements of Section 6(b) of
the Act.
 In particular, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with sections 6(b)(1), (3), and (5) of the
Act.
 Section 6(b)(1) requires that an exchange be organized and have the capacity to carry out the purposes of the Act and
to comply, and to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with the Act, the rules
and regulations thereunder, and the rules of the exchange. Section 6(b)(3) of the Act requires, among other things,
that the rule of an exchange assures a fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration
of its affairs. Section 6(b)(5) requires, among other things, that the rules of an exchange be designed, in general,
to protect investors and the public interest.





The Commission believes that the proposed rule change to limit Governor monetary liability to the Exchange and its
members is consistent with the requirements of the Act.
 In reaching its determination to approve this rule change, the Commission has considered the potential impact that
the proposal will have on the special role and responsibilities of the Board of Governors of a registered national
securities exchange under the Act.






The Board of Governors of a national securities exchange has a crucial role in ensuring that the exchange meets its
responsibilities as a self-regulatory organization under the Act. In view of this, the CHX proposal is limited so
that the exemption from monetary damages is not available where liability is based, directly or indirectly, on a violation
of the federal securities laws.
At the same time, the Commission recognizes that national securities exchanges, such as the CHX, are incorporated
under state law and, as such, are generally entitled to take advantage of provisions under state corporation codes
to the extent they are consistent with the federal securities laws. The proposed rule change adequately balances
the need to retain the special responsibilities of directors of national securities exchanges with the desire of
the Exchange to adopt state law provisions pertaining to its corporate structure. The rule change allows the Exchange
to take advantage of section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware Corporations Code as would any other organization incorporated
in Delaware, except where the imposition of monetary actions involves a violation of the federal securities laws.
Accordingly, Governors of the CHX will still be subject to the full panoply of damages in actions involving violations
of the federal securities laws.





The Commission believes that the CHX's proposal to split its annual meeting and provide for an annual election meeting
and an annual report meeting will allow Exchange members to better concentrate on the respective issues. The annual
election meeting will be held to vote for Governors and the Nomination Committee. The annual report meeting will be
held to provide management, the Board, and members an opportunity to discuss the previous year's results and current
issues facing the Exchange. Because each of these meetings is of extreme importance and may involve lengthy discussions,
the Commission believes holding two separate meetings is appropriate and consistent with section 6(b)(3) of the
Act which requires that the rules of the exchange assures a fair representation of its members in the selection of its
directors and administration of its affairs.

The CHX's Constitution provides that appointments to the Executive Committee are made by the Vice Chairman of the
Board with the approval of the Board of Governors.
 In December 1992, the Commission approved changes to the CHX's organization and governance,
 including changes to the Exchange's Executive Committee. Before that rule change, the Executive Committee was comprised
of six Governors and the Chairman, Vice Chairman, and President. The rule change removed the Vice Chairman from the
Executive Committee and provided instead for seven Governors. In addition, the Chairman was designated as the Committee's
Chairman with full voting powers. The President, however, remained an ex-officio member of the Committee without
the power to vote.






In approving the 1992 changes to the Exchange's Executive Committee, the Commission emphasized concerns about floor
domination of the governance of the Exchange.
 When appointing the Executive Committee members the CHX's Constitution directs the Vice Chairman to assure the geographic
diversity of the Governors appointed to that Committee.
 Consistent with this directive, the Executive Committee has traditionally consisted of two public Governors, two
``upstairs'' member Governors, and two floor member Governors.
 The Exchange represented at the time of the 1992 changes that it continued to support such diversity in the Executive
Committee and expected its future composition to be consistent with past practices.

<TEXT>
 

The rule change now under consideration provides that the Executive Committee will be comprised of

 at least

 seven floor governors. This change allows the Vice Chairman, with Board approval, to expand the number of governors
serving on the Executive Committee. While the Commission believes that the Exchange should be able to expand the number
of Governors serving on the Committee if such expansion is necessary for the efficient administration of Exchange
business, the Commission expects the Exchange to maintain the relative representation of the various geographic
groups on the Committee and would be concerned if the Committee was dominated by a particular group (

e.g.,

 floor members). The CHX has represented that it will continue to support diversity in the Executive Committee. Specifically,
the CHX has indicated that the Vice Chairman will appoint additional governors, should the number be increased from
seven, in a manner which will continue fair representation of public Governors, ``upstairs'' member Governors,
and floor member Governors as required by the CHX's Constitution.
 The Commission therefore believes that the proposal is consistent with section 6(b)(3) of the Act.





For the reasons discussed below, the Commission also is approving changes to the Exchange's Executive Committee,
Finance Committee, Committee on Organization and Governance, and Compensation Committee. The Commission notes
that although there is no provision in the CHX's Constitution specifically directing geographic diversity in the
Governors appointed to committees other than the Executive Committee,
 Section 6(b)(3) of the Act requires that the rules of an exchange assure a fair representation of its members in the
administration of its affairs. The Commission believes that the fair representation provision of Section 6(b)(3)
requires the Exchange to ensure that all of its committees have a diversity of governors (

i.e.,

 public Governors, ``upstairs'' member Governors, and floor member Governors).





Preliminarily, the Commission believes the rule change to Article VI, Sections 2 (Chairman) and 4 (President) to
provide that the Chairman and President are ex-officio members of all Executive Committees (except those specified
in the provisions) without the right to vote unless ``otherwise designated in the Constitution or the Rules'' is consistent
with the Act. The rule change allows the Exchange to indicate if the Chairman or President has the right to vote on a particular
Committee in the Section or Rule pertaining to each Committee.

The Commission believes that giving the President full voting powers on the Executive Committee is consistent with
the President's voting powers on the Board. The Commission notes that the Executive Committee has full Board authority
to act between Board meetings on most issues. In addition, because the Exchange's Constitution requires that the
president not be a member of the Exchange or affiliated in any way with a member organization during his incumbency,
 granting the President voting powers does not change the presentation on the Executive Committee of any particular
group. Therefore, this rule change is consistent with sections 6(b) (1) and (3) of the Act.





The Commission also believes that the Exchange's proposal to allow the Vice Chairman, with Board Approval, to expand
the number of Governors serving on the Finance Committee is consistent with the requirements of Section 6(b)(1) of
the Act because the rule change is designed to enhance the governance process of the Exchange. The Finance Committee
reviews annual profit plans and budgets for the Exchange and its subsidiaries, reviews the financial condition of
the Exchange and its subsidiaries, reviews the performance of Exchange investments, formulates investment policy,
and makes recommendations to the management or Board. Because this Committee has an important function involving
a wide range of financial issues, the Commission believes it is reasonable that the Exchange may decide that additional
Governors are necessary for the Committee to fulfill its duties.

Additionally, the Commission believes that the rule change to give the Chairman full voting rights as a member of the
Compensation Committee and the Committee on Organization and Governance is consistent with Sections 6(b) (1) and
(3) of the Act. The Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing the compensation of the President and
for coordinating with the President to determine a comprehensive corporate compensation and benefits policy.
 The Committee on Organization and Governance is responsible for periodically reviewing the organization and governance
structure of the Exchange and its subsidiaries, and for making recommendations to the Board of Governors with respect
thereto.
 The Chairman is appointed by the Board of Governors from among the 24 Governors, and may accordingly be an ``up-stairs''
member, a floor member, or a public governor. Granting the Chairman voting rights on the Compensation Committee and
the Committee on Organization and Governance, therefore, may change the relative representation of one of these
constituencies. The Commission expects that the Exchange will ensure fair representation on these Committees consistent
with section 6(b)(3) of the Act.

The Commission believes that the rule change providing that neither the Chairman nor the President are ex-officio
members of any Judiciary Committee also is consistent with Sections 6(b)(1) and (5) of the Act. Article IV, Rule 5 of
the Exchange's Rules states that ``the President shall appoint five disinterested members of the Exchange and/or
general partners or officers of member organizations as a Judiciary Committee'' whenever a disciplinary matter
is to be reviewed in accordance with the Rules. The rule change specifies that the Chairman and President are not ex-officio
members of any Judiciary Committee.

Finally, the Commission believes that the rule change replacing ``Public Governor'' with ``non-member Governor''
and defining the term as a ``Governor who is unaffiliated with the Exchange or any broker or dealer in securities, as
defined in Article III, Section 2 of the Exchange's Constitution,'' serves to provide consistency within the CHX's
Constitution and Rules, and has no substantive effect. The Commission notes, however, that ``non-member Governors''
are intended to be representatives of the public and that the term is synonymous with the Commission's use of the term
``public Governor'' in general, and in this order and the order approving the 1992 changes to the CHX's organization
and governance.
 This interpretation is consistent with Section 6(b)(3) of the Act, which requires that the Exchange provide that
one or more directors be representatives of issuers and investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange,
broker, or dealer.





The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the rule change prior to the thirtieth day after publication
of notice of filing thereof. Amendment No. 1 made a non-substantive change to the proposal by including in the rules
the Constitutional definition that a non-member Governor is unaffiliated with the Exchange or any broker or dealer
in securities.
 The CHX's proposed rule change was published in the 

Federal Register

 for the full statutory period and no comments were received.







IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the CHX. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-CHX-93-28
and should be submitted by May 10, 1994.



V. Conclusion





It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-CHX-93-28) is approved.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Relating to Fees on Members</DOCTITLE>


April 13, 1994.


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on April 7, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described
in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The NASD has designated this proposal as one
constituting a fee under  19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act, which renders the rule effective upon the Commission's
receipt of this filing. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from
interested persons.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The NASD is proposing a rule change to amend Schedule A to the By-Laws
 to increase the charges, as set forth in section 13 of Schedule A,
 for the review of certain advertisements and sales literature. Below is the text of the proposed rule change. Proposed
new language is in italics; proposed deletions are in brackets.





Schedule A to the By-Laws


* * * * *


Section 13. Service Charge for Advertisement, Sales Literature, and Other Such Material Filed or Submitted


There shall be a service charge for each and every item of advertisement, sales literature, and other material, whether
in printed, video or other form, filed with or submitted to the Association, except for items that are filed or submitted
in response to a written request from the Association's Advertising 

Regulation

 Department issued pursuant to the spot check procedures set forth in the Association's Rules of Fair Practice and
Government Securities Rules, as follows: (1) For printed material reviewed, 

$50.00

 [$25.00] plus 

$10.00

Regulation

 Department. The Advertising 

Regulation

 Department may, in its sole discretion, refuse requests for expedited review.


* * * * *


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The NASD's Advertising Regulation Department began offering an expedited review process in February, 1991 for those
members who desired review and comment of advertising and sales literature that was faster than the normal review
and comment process, which is ten business days. The expedited process is completed within three business days. Over
the past three years, use of the expedited process has increased far beyond the NASD's expectation. The expedited
filing process has become standard operating procedure for many of the program's most frequent users and many items
filed are frequently more difficult to review because they contain new concepts and approaches requiring greater
time for research and analysis. The increase in the number of expedited filings has led to a significant increase in
the amount of administrative processing and has made it more difficult to provide service within the ten-day turnaround
time for normal filings.


The NASD is proposing an amendment to Section 13 of Schedule A to the NASD By-Laws which establishes a fee structure
that will give members the ability to choose the level of service that best fits their needs, taking into consideration
the costs related to that level. Each of the specific fees would be increased, including the service charge for expedited
service. However, the service charge for expedited service would no longer be imposed in addition to the base service
charge and the number of pages or minutes of video that triggers an additional fee would be increased, 

i.e., 

from 5 to 10 pages and from 5 to 10 minutes. The text of the amendment identifies each of the changes to the fees. The NASD
is requesting that the amendment be implemented on May 1, 1994.

The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(5) of the Act,
 which require that the rules of the Association provide for the equitable allocation of dues, fees and other charges
among members in that the proposed rule equitably adjusts the fees assessed for the review of advertising and sales
literature to accurately reflect the time spent and level of analysis performed per item submitted for review.





(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended.




(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



Written comments were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The foregoing rule change has become effective upon filing pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act and subparagraph
(e) of rule 19b-4 thereunder in that it constitutes a due, fee or other charge. The rule will be implemented on
May 1, 1994.

At any time within 60 days of the filing of a rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act, the Commission may
summarily abrogate the rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in
the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the NASD. All submissions should refer to file number SR-NASD-94-21 and should be submitted by
May 10, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Relating to the Administration of the Association</DOCTITLE>


April 13, 1994.


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on April 8, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described
in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The NASD has designated this proposal as one
constituting an administrative matter under Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act, which renders the rule effective
upon the Commission's receipt of this filing. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the
proposed rule change from interested persons.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The NASD is proposing a rule change to amend Schedule B to the NASD By-Laws
 to assign all U.S. Pacific territories and possessions to NASD District 2. Below is the text of the proposed rule change.
Proposed new language is italicized.




Schedule B to the By-Laws


The number and territorial boundaries of the several districts established as provided in section 1 of Article VIII
and the number of Governors elected from the several districts established as provided in Section 4(b) of Article
VII of the By-Laws of the Corporation are as follows:


* * * * *


District No. 2 In the State of California, that part of the State South or East of the Counties of Monterey, San
Benito, Fresno and Inyo[;]

,

 and, in the State of Nevada, that part of the State South or East of the Counties of Esmeralda and Nye, 

and, all Pacific possessions and territories of the United States

.
One Governor shall be elected from and by the members of the Corporation eligible to vote in District 2.


* * * * *


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


Under the Act, the NASD is obligated to ensure fair representation, of its members.
 Article VII, section 4(b) to the NASD By-Laws authorizes the Board to consider the fairness of the representation
of members by the current administrative district structure
 and, whenever the Board finds unfairness in such representation, to change the number and boundaries of the administrative
districts. Changes are necessary to the existing administrative district structure from time to time to address
significant demographic shifts in the NASD's membership and to ensure fair and effective district representation
on the Board. The Board noted that whereas the representation of District 7 currently includes United States territorial
possessions in the Caribbean, the Canal Zone and the Virgin Islands, no comparable representation exists for U.S.
Pacific territories and possessions. The proposed rule change thus remedies this lack of representation by amending
Schedule B to the By-Laws to assign all U.S. Pacific territories and possessions to NASD District 2.





The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(4) of the Act,
 which require that the rules of the Association provide for the fair representation of its members in the selection
of its directors and administration of its affairs in that the proposed rule change ensures the fair representation
of members in the district structure.




(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others


Written comments were neither solicited nor received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


The foregoing rule change has become effective upon filing pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act and subparagraph
(e) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder in that it constitutes solely an administrative matter of the Association.
At any time within 60 days of the filing of a rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act, the Commission may
summarily abrogate the rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in
the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the NASD. All submissions should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by May 10, 1994.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard announces the availability of the application for recertification of the Cook Inlet Regional Citizens'
Advisory Council (CIRCAC) for the period from June 1, 1994 through May 31, 1994. The Coast Guard seeks comments on the
application from interested groups. The Coast Guard will publish a later notice in the 

Federal Register

 to notify the public of its decision regarding the recertification request.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under the Oil Terminal and Oil Tanker Environmental Oversight and Monitoring Act of 1990 (33 U.S.C. 2732) (the Act),
the Coast Guard may certify, on an annual basis, an alternative voluntary advisory group (advisory group) in lieu
of Regional Citizens' Advisory councils for Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound Alaska. The Coast Guard published
guidelines on December 31, 1992, to assist groups seeking recertification under the Act (57 FR 62600). The Coast Guard
issued a policy statement on July 7, 1993 (58 FR 36505), to clarify the factors that the Coast Guard would be considering
in making its determination as to whether advisory groups should be certified in accordance with the Act; and the procedures
which the Coast Guard would follow in meeting its certification responsibilities under the Act.




The Coast Guard has received an application for recertification of CIRCAC, the currently certified advisory group
for the Cook Inlet region. In accordance with the review and certification process contained in the policy statement,
the Coast Guard now solicits comments from interested groups including oil terminal facility owners and operators,
owners and operators of crude oil tankers calling at the terminal facilities, and fishing, aquacultural, recreational
and environmental citizens groups, concerning the recertification application of CIRCAC. At the conclusion of
the comment period, the Coast Guard will review all application materials and comments received and will take one
of the following actions:

(a) Recertify the advisory group under 33 U.S.C. 2732(o).

(b) Issue a conditional recertification for a period of 90 days, with a statement of any discrepancies which must be
corrected to qualify for recertification for the remainder of the year.

(c) Deny recertification of the advisory group if the Coast Guard finds that the group is not broadly representative
of the interests and communities in the area or is not adequately fostering the goals and purposes of the Act.

The Coast Guard will notify CIRCAC by letter of the action taken on its application. A notice will be published in the


Federal Register

 to advise the public of the Coast Guard's determination.

States That Receive a Match Reduction Under the HOME Investment Partnerships Program Because of Fiscal Distress
or Severe Fiscal Distress 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, HUD.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of match reduction under the HOME program.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Starting with Fiscal Year 1993 funds, participating jurisdictions must provide a 25 percent matching contribution
for HOME funds drawn from the participating jurisdiction's Treasury accounts for rental assistance, housing rehabilitation
and acquisition of standard housing, and a 30 percent matching contribution for HOME funds drawn for new construction,
unless the participating jurisdiction has received a reduction in the match requirement. This notice provides information
on the level of fiscal distress for each State and indicates those States that receive a reduction in the match requirement
for Fiscal Year 1994 because they are in fiscal distress or severe fiscal distress.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Match Reduction for States


A HOME interim rule is published elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register

. Section 92.222(a) of this interim rule sets out the criteria for determining fiscal distress and severe fiscal distress
for participating jurisdictions that are States. This notice is published to announce the States that receive a match
reduction for Fiscal Year 1994 under these distress criteria. 
This notice lists all States (as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia which are, by statute, defined as States
for the HOME Program), the average per capita income (PCI) for each, how the State's PCI relates to the national average
PCI (which was $14,277 for 1989, the latest data available), the percent of each State's families in poverty and how
that relates to the national average (which was 10.58 percent in 1990), the average personal income growth rate in
the State over the most recent four quarters, and how that relates to the national personal income growth rate during
that period (which was 5.4 percent from the end of the third quarter of 1992 to the end of the third quarter of 1993). 
Thus, to qualify under the PCI criterion, the PCI for the State must be less than $10,708. To qualify under the poverty
criterion, the State's percent of families in poverty must be 13.23 percent or higher, and to qualify under the personal
income growth rate, the State's rate must be 4.0 percent or less. 
As the interim rule indicates, States that satisfy one of the criteria are considered in fiscal distress and receive
a 50 percent match reduction for the term specified at 24 CFR 92.222(a)(4). States that satisfy at least two of the three
distress criteria are considered in severe fiscal distress and receive a 100 percent match reduction for the period
specified at 24 CFR 92.222(a)(3). The list of States follows as appendix A to this notice.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Purpose and Substantive Description



(a) Authority



Sec. 14, United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 14371); sec. 7(d) Department of Housing and Urban Development
Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(d)). An interim rule revising the CIAP regulation, 24 CFR part 968, subparts A and B, for PHAs and
24 CFR part 905, subpart I, for IHAs, and streamlining the program was published on March 15, 1993. A final rule will
be published shortly. 



(b) Major Changes 



In FY 1993, the CIAP was streamlined to make it easier for smaller HAs to participate in the program and to give smaller
HAs the same flexibility as CGP agencies. The CIAP Application was simplified, the processing groups were reduced
to two (Group 1 and Group 2), and the modernization types were reduced to two (Emergency and Other). Under the modernization
type of ``Other'', the HA may apply for, and HUD may fund, a variety of needs, ranging from a single physical or management
work item to complete rehabilitation. 



(c) Program Highlights



(1) Departmental Priority 



Improving Public and Indian Housing is one of the Department's major priorities. Accordingly, a review is being made
of the entire Public and Indian Housing Program. Specifically, the Department is very concerned about several aspects
of the Modernization Program. 

(i) 

Design.

 When identifying physical improvement needs to meet the modernization standards, HAs are encouraged to consider
design which supports the integration of public housing into the broader community. Although high priority needs,
such as those related to health and safety, vacant/substandard units, structural or system integrity, and compliance
with statutory, regulatory or court-ordered deadlines, will receive funding priority, HAs should plan their modernization
in a way which promotes good design, but maintains the modest nature of public housing. The HA should pay particular
attention to design and be receptive to creative, but cost-effective approaches suggested by architects, residents,
HA staff, and other local entities. Such approaches can complement the planning for basic rehabilitation needs.
It should be noted that there will be no increase in operating subsidy due to items added (for example, additional landscaping)
to promote the blend of public housing into the surrounding neighborhood. 

(ii) 

Expediting the program.

 HAs are reminded that they are expected to obligate all funds within two years and to expend all funds within three years
of program approval (Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) Amendment execution) unless a longer project implementation
schedule is approved by the Field Office. If the HA does not obligate approved funds in a timely manner, the Department
will recapture the funds unless there are clear, valid reasons for not meeting the obligation deadline; i.e., delays
which are outside of the HA's control. 

(iii) 

Resident involvement and economic uplift. 

HAs are encouraged to explore and implement through all feasible means the involvement of residents in all aspects
of the CIAP, from planning through implementation. In addition, HAs are encouraged to seek ways to employ residents
in all aspects of the CIAP's operation and/or to develop means to promote contracting opportunities for resident-owned
businesses. PHAs should use Section 3 provisions to the maximum feasible extent. 

(iv) 

Elimination of vacant units. 

Although the Department has a vacancy reduction effort specifically aimed at reducing vacancies, HAs are encouraged
to apply for CIAP funds to address eligible vacancy problems (i.e., those which do not involve routine maintenance)
to the extent such problems have not been funded through other sources. 



(2) Relationship to Technical Review Factors 



The Departmental goal of improving Public and Indian Housing is reflected in the technical review factors, set forth
in section IV(c)(5), on which the Field Office scores each HA's CIAP Application. Based on the HA's total score, the
Field Office then ranks each HA to determine selection for Joint Review. The technical review factors include the
following Departmental initiatives to improve Public and Indian Housing: 

(i) Restoration of vacant units to occupancy; 

(ii) Resident capacity-building, including opportunities for resident management; 

(iii) Economic development, job training and employment opportunities for residents; 

(iv) Drug elimination initiatives; and 

(v) Partnership with local government.

II. Allocation Amounts


(a) Total Available 


The FY 1994 HUD Appropriations Act Public Law 103-124, enacted October 28, 1993, made available $3,230,000,000
of budget authority for the Modernization Program in the Annual Contributions Account. An emergency Supplemental
Appropriations Act Public Law 103-211 made available an additional $25,000,000 for modernization of existing
public housing projects damaged in the January 1994 earthquake in Southern California. In addition, there is a reduction
of $1,170, which is the Modernization Program's share of the Department's estimated 1993 carry-over of the Annual
Contributions Account. The following chart shows the total amount of funds available in FY 1994, which are the appropriations,
plus the carry-overs from FY 1993, minus the reduction and set-asides: 






(b) Explanation of Carry-Overs 


The $247,057,902 in carry-overs from FY 1993 are: 
(1) $98,376,318 from the set-aside for the Vacancy Reduction Program; 
(2) $57,093,709 from the national reserve for emergencies and natural and other disasters under the CGP; 
(3) $50,000,000 from the set-aside for Choice-in-Management; 
(4) $15,477,270 from the set-aside for implementing Section 6J activities, which pertain to the Public Housing Management
Assessment Program, of Section 113 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. Section 6J activities include
independent assessments of Troubled and Mod Troubled PHAs, technical assistance for Troubled and Mod Troubled PHAs,
and provision for alternative management; 
(5) $11,956,923 from the Lead-Based Paint (LBP) risk assessment set-aside, established in FY 1992; 
(6) $7,101,573 from the set-aside for inspection of modernization work and technical assistance for Troubled PHAs
and for IHAs; 
(7) $6,063,827 from the CGP allocation due to seven HAs not applying and one HA not being approved; 
(8) $971,983 from the set-aside for the indemnification of three PHAs (Albany, New York; Cambridge, Massachusetts;
and Omaha, Nebraska) that are participating in the LBP Abatement Demonstration. The FY 1991 Appropriations Act extended
the availability of these funds appropriated in FY 1990 from October 1, 1991 to October 1, 1998; and

(9) $16,299 from the CIAP allocation. 


(c) Allocation Between CGP and CIAP


The $2,995,892,539 balance is allocated as follows:

 




(1) The $2,995,892,539 balance is allocated between CIAP and CGP agencies based on the relative shares of backlog
needs (weighted at 50%) and accrual needs (weighted at 50%), as determined by the field inspections conducted for
the HUD-funded ABT study of modernization needs. This allocation results in CIAP agencies receiving 10.58% or $316,863,505
(plus the $16,299 carryover for a total of $316,879,804) and CGP agencies receiving 89.42% or $2,679,029,034 (plus
the $6,063,827 carryover for a total of $2,685,092,861) of the funds available. 
(i) 

Backlog needs

 are needed repairs and replacements of existing physical systems, items that must be added to meet the HUD modernization
and energy conservation standards and State or local/tribal codes, and items that are necessary for the long-term
viability of a specific housing development. 
(ii) 

Accrual needs

 are needs that arise over time and include needed repairs and replacements of existing physical systems and items
that must be added to meet the HUD modernization and energy conservation standards and State or local/tribal codes.

<TEXT>
 

(2) The $316,879,804 available to CIAP agencies (which includes the $16,299 carryover) is allocated between Public
Housing at 92.1249% or $291,925,067, and Indian Housing at 7.8751% or $24,954,737. This allocation also is based
on the relative shares of backlog needs (weighted at 50%) and accrual needs (weighted at 50%). 



(d) Subassignment of Funds to Non-Indian Field Offices 



Headquarters has determined the distribution of Public Housing CIAP funds for each HUD Region based on the relative
shares of backlog and accrual needs for CIAP agencies. In assigning funds to each Region, Headquarters will designate
an amount to be subassigned to each non-Indian Field Office, based on each Office's FY 1993 subassignment and adjusted
as necessary. The FY 1993 subassignments reflected both relative shares of modernization needs within the Region
and PHA capability to administer the modernization. 

(1) The Field Office Public Housing Division Director shall have authority to make Joint Review selections and CIAP
funding decisions. 

(2) If additional funds for Public Housing CIAP become available, as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section,
Headquarters will allocate the funds to one or more Field Offices based on their relative shares of modernization
need, approvable applications, and PHA capability to carry out the modernization. 

(3) If a Field Office does not receive sufficient fundable applications to use its allocation, Headquarters will
reallocate the remaining funds to one or more Field Offices based on approvable applications and PHA capability to
carry out the modernization. 

Of the $291,925,067 available for Public Housing, 1% or $2,919,251 has been set aside to carry out goals related to
pending civil rights litigation (e.g., Young v. Cisneros), which is subject to judicial oversight. The following
table shows the distribution of CIAP funds for PHAs, excluding IHAs, assigned by Headquarters to each Region for subassignment
to the Field Offices as percentages of the $289,005,816 balance available for Public Housing:

(e) Subassignment of Funds to Offices of Native American Programs (ONAP)



In assigning funds to the appropriate Region, Headquarters will designate an amount to be subassigned to each ONAP,
covering Indian Housing and any Public Housing owned and operated by IHAs. 

(1) The ONAP Administrator shall have authority to make Joint Review selections and CIAP funding decisions. 

(2) If additional funds for Indian Housing CIAP become available, as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section,
Headquarters will allocate the funds to one or more ONAPs based on their relative shares of modernization need, approvable
applications, and IHA capability to carry out the modernization. 

(3) If an ONAP does not receive sufficient fundable applications to use its allocation, Headquarters will reallocate
the remaining funds to one or more ONAPs based on approvable applications and IHA capability to carry out the modernization.


The following table shows the distribution of CIAP funds for IHAs, assigned by Headquarters to each appropriate Region
for subassignment to the ONAPs as percentages of the total $24,954,737 available for Indian Housing: 






III. Application Preparation and Submission by HA 



(a) Planning 




In preparing its CIAP Application, the HA is encouraged to assess all its physical and management improvement needs.
Physical improvement needs should be reviewed against the modernization standards, as set forth in HUD Handbook
7485.2, as revised, and any cost-effective energy conservation measures, identified in updated energy audits.
The modernization standards include development specific work to ensure the long-term viability of the developments,
such as amenities and design changes to promote the integration of low-income housing into the broader community.
See section I(c)(1)(i). In addition, the HA is strongly encouraged to contact the Field Office to discuss its modernization
needs and obtain information. The term ``Field Office'' includes the ONAP.

(b) Resident Involvement/Local Official Consultation Requirements 



(1) Residents/Homebuyers 



The CIAP regulations at   968.220 or 905.624 require the HA to establish a Partnership Process for rental
developments which ensures full resident participation in the planning, implementation and monitoring of the modernization
program, as follows: 

(i) Before submission of the CIAP Application, consultation with residents, resident organization, and resident
management corporation (herein referred to as residents) of the development(s) being proposed for modernization

(ii) Reasonable opportunity for residents to present their views on the proposed modernization and alternatives
to it, and full and serious consideration of resident recommendations; 

(iii) Written response to residents, indicating acceptance or rejection of resident recommendations, consistent
with HUD requirements and the HA's own determination of efficiency, economy and need, with a copy to the Field Office
at Joint Review; 

(iv) After HUD funding decisions, notification to residents of the approval or disapproval and, where requested,
provision to residents of a copy of the HUD-approved CIAP budget; and 

(v) During implementation, periodic notification to residents of work status and progress and maximum feasible

of any deficiencies or any inconsistencies. The missing information is to be submitted within a specified period
of time from the date of HUD's written notification. This is not additional time to substantially revise the application.
Deficiencies which may be corrected at this time are inadvertently omitted documents or clarifications of previously
submitted material and other changes which are not of such a nature as to improve the competitive position of the application.
The HA must acceptably correct deficiencies (including furnishing missing certifications) within 21 calendar
days of notification from the Field Office. 
(i) If Form HUD-52822, CIAP Application, is missing, the HA's application will be considered substantially
incomplete and, therefore, ineligible for further processing. 
(ii) If Form HUD-50071, Certification for Contracts, Grants, Loans, and Cooperative Agreements, SF-LLL,
Disclosure of Lobbying Activities, or Form HUD-2880, Applicant/Recipient Update/Disclosure Form, is required,
but missing or there is a technical mistake, such as no signature on a submitted form, the HA will be given an opportunity
to correct the deficiency. 


(b) Eligibility Review 


HAs with fewer than 250 units are eligible to participate in the CIAP. After the HA's CIAP Application is determined
to be complete and accepted for review, the Field Office eligibility review shall determine if the application meets
the basic eligibility requirements and, therefore, is eligible for processing. 


(1) Eligibility for Processing 


To be eligible for processing: 
(i) 

Development eligibility

. The development is either a public housing development, including a conveyed Lanham Act or Public Works Administration
development, or a Section 23 Leased Housing Bond-Financed project (BFP). 
(ii) 

Date of full availability (DOFA)

. Each eligible development for which work is proposed has reached DOFA at the time of CIAP Application submission.



(2) Eligibility for Processing on Reduced Scope 


Where certain conditions exist, the HA will be eligible for processing on a reduced scope as follows: 
(i) 

Funds owed the department

. Where the HA owes funds to the Department as a result of excess development, modernization or operating funds previously
provided and the HA has not repaid the funds, or has not entered into a repayment agreement, or is not meeting its obligations
under a repayment agreement, the HA is eligible for processing only for Emergency Modernization. 
(ii) 

FHEO Compliance

. Where the HA has not complied with Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) requirements as evidenced by an action,
finding or determination as described below, unless the HA is implementing a voluntary compliance agreement or settlement
agreement designed to correct the area(s) of noncompliance, the HA is eligible for processing only for Emergency
Modernization or physical work needed to remedy civil rights deficiencies. 
(A) A pending proceeding against the HA based upon a Charge of Discrimination issued under the Fair Housing Act. A Charge
of Discrimination is a charge under section 810(g)(2) of the Fair Housing Act, issued by the Department's General
Counsel or legally authorized designee; 
(B) A pending civil rights suit against the HA, referred by the Department's General Counsel and instituted by the
Department of Justice;

<TEXT>
 

(C) Outstanding HUD findings of HA noncompliance with civil rights statutes and executive orders under  968.110(a)
or  905.115, or implementing regulations, as a result of formal administrative proceedings, unless the HA
is implementing a HUD-approved resident selection and assignment plan or compliance agreement designed to correct
the area(s) of noncompliance; 
(D) A deferral of the processing of applications from the HA imposed by HUD under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
the Attorney General's Guidelines (28 CFR 50.3) and the HUD Title VI regulations (24 CFR 1.8) and procedures (HUD Handbook
8040.1), or under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and HUD implementing regulations (24 CFR 8.57); or


(E) An adjudication of a violation under any of the authorities under  968.110(a) or  905.115 in a civil
action filed against the HA by a private individual, unless the HA is implementing a HUD-approved resident selection
and assignment plan or compliance agreement designed to correct the area(s) of noncompliance. 

(iii) 

Section 504 Compliance

. Where the Section 504 needs assessment identified a need for accessible units, the HA was required to make structural
changes to meet that need by July 11, 1992. Where the HA has not completed all required structural changes or obtained
an extension from HUD, the HA is eligible for processing only for Emergency Modernization or physical work needed
to complete the structural changes. Refer to PIH Notice 92-65 (PHA), dated December 14, 1992. 
(iv) 

LBP Testing Compliance.

 Where the HA will not comply with the statutory requirement to complete LBP testing on all pre-1978 family units by
December 6, 1994, the HA is eligible for processing only for Emergency Modernization or work needed to complete LBP
testing. 
(c) 

Selection Criteria and Ranking Factors

. After all CIAP Applications are reviewed for eligibility, the Field Office shall categorize the eligible HAs and
their developments into two processing groups, as defined in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph: Group 1 for Emergency
Modernization; and Group 2 for Other Modernization. HA developments may be included in both groups and the same development
may be in each group. However, the HA is only required to submit one CIAP Application, which the Field Office will process
under either Group 1 or Group 2. 


(1) Grouping Modernization Types


(i) 

Group 1, emergency modernization

. Developments having physical conditions of an emergency nature, posing an immediate threat to the health or safety
of residents or related to fire safety, and which must be corrected within one year of CIAP funding approval. Funding
is limited to physical work items and may not be used for management improvements. Emergency Modernization includes
all LBP testing and abatement of units housing children under seven years old with elevated blood lead levels (EBLs)
and all LBP testing and abatement of HA-owned day care facilities used by children under seven years old with EBLs.
Group 1 developments are not subject to the technical review rating and ranking in subparagraphs (5) and (6) of this
paragraph or the long-term viability and reasonable cost determination in section V(e). 
(ii) 

Group 2, other modernization

. Developments not having physical conditions of an emergency nature and located in HAs which have demonstrated a
capability of carrying out the proposed modernization activities. Other Modernization includes: one or more physical
work items, where the Field Office determines that the physical improvements are necessary and sufficient to extend
the useful life of the development; and/or one or more development specific or HA-wide management work items (including
planning costs); and/or testing, professional risk assessments, interim containment, and abatement of LBP. Therefore,
eligibility of work under Other Modernization ranges from a single work item to the complete rehabilitation of a development.
Refer to section I(c)(1)(i) regarding modest amenities and improved design. Group 2 developments are subject to
the technical review rating and ranking in subparagraphs (5) and (6) of this paragraph and the long-term viability
and reasonable cost determination in section V(e).

(2) Assessment of HA's Management Capability 


As part of its technical review of the CIAP Application, the Field Office shall evaluate the HA's management capability.
Particular attention shall be given to the adequacy of the HA's maintenance in determining the HA's management capability.
This assessment shall be based on the compliance aspects of on-site monitoring, such as audits, reviews or surveys
which are currently available within the Field Office, 

and 

on the performance review under the Public Housing Management Assessment Program (PHMAP) for PHAs or the Administrative
Capability Assessment for IHAs, and other information sources, as follows: 
(i) 

Public housing

. A PHA has management capability if it is (A) not designated as Troubled under Part 901, PHMAP, or (B) designated as
Troubled, but has a reasonable prospect of acquiring management capability which may include through CIAP-funded
management improvements. A Troubled PHA may be considered for funding of non-emergency physical improvements where
it is making reasonable progress toward meeting the performance targets established in its memorandum of agreement
under  901.140. 
(ii) 

Indian housing

. An IHA has management capability if it is (A) not designated as High Risk under  905.135 or (B) designated as
High Risk, but has a reasonable prospect of acquiring management capability which may include through CIAP funded
management improvements. A High Risk IHA may be considered for funding of non-emergency physical improvements where
it is making reasonable progress toward meeting the goals established in its management improvement plan under  905.135.



(3) Assessment of HA's Modernization Capability 


As part of its technical review of the CIAP Application, the Field Office shall evaluate the HA's modernization capability,
including the progress of previously approved modernization and the status of any outstanding findings from CIAP
monitoring visits, as follows: 
(i) 

Public housing

. A PHA has modernization capability if it is (A) not designated as Modernization Troubled under Part 901, PHMAP, or
(B) designated as Modernization Troubled, but has a reasonable prospect of acquiring modernization capability
which may include through CIAP-funded management improvements and administrative support, such as hiring staff
or contracting for assistance. A Modernization Troubled PHA may be considered for funding of non-emergency physical
improvements where it is making reasonable progress toward meeting the performance targets established in its memorandum
of agreement under  901.140. Where a PHA does not have a funded modernization program in progress, the Field
Office shall determine whether the PHA has a reasonable prospect of acquiring modernization capability through
hiring staff or contracting for assistance. 
(ii) 

Indian housing

. An IHA has modernization capability if it is capable of effectively carrying out the proposed modernization improvements.
Where an IHA does not have a funded modernization program in progress, the ONAP shall determine whether the IHA has
a reasonable prospect of acquiring modernization capability through hiring staff or contracting for assistance.



(4) Technical processing


After the Field Office has categorized the eligible HAs and their developments into Group 1 and Group 2, the Field Office
shall rate all Group 2 HAs on each of the technical review factors in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph. With the exception
of the technical review factor of ``extent and urgency of need'', a Group 2 HA is rated on its overall HA application
and not on each development. For the technical review factor of ``extent and urgency of need,'' each development for
which funding is requested by a Group 2 HA is scored; the development with the highest priority needs is scored the highest
number of points, which is then used for the overall HA score on that factor. 

High priority needs

 are non-emergency needs, but related to: Health or safety; vacant, substandard units; structural or system integrity;
or compliance with statutory, regulatory or court-ordered deadlines. 


(5) Technical Review Factors


The technical review factors for assistance are:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940419-2-00155 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940419-2-00086 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



(6) Rating and Ranking



After rating all Group 2 HAs on each of the technical review factors set forth in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph,
the Field Office shall rank each Group 2 HA based on its total score, list Group 2 HAs in descending order and identify
other Group 2 HAs with lower ranking applications, but with high priority needs. 



(d) Joint Review



The purpose of the Joint Review is for the Field Office to discuss with the HA the proposed modernization program, as
set forth in the CIAP Application, and determine the size of the grant, if any, to be awarded. 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940419-2-00156 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940419-2-00086 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) The Field Office shall select HAs, including all 
Group 1 HAs, for Joint Review so that the total dollar value of all proposed modernization recommended for funding
exceeds the subassignment amount by at least 15%. This will preserve the Field Office's ability to adjust cost estimates
and work items as a result of Joint Review. 
(2) The Field Office shall notify in writing each HA whose application has been selected for further processing as
to whether the Joint Review will be conducted on-site or off-site (e.g., by telephone or in-office meeting). An HA
will not be selected for Joint Review if other funding is available (refer to section V(g)). The Field Office shall
notify in writing each HA not selected for Joint Review and provide the reasons for non-selection. 
(3) Where the HA has not included some of its developments in the CIAP Application, the Field Office may not, as a result
of Joint Review, consider funding any non-emergency work at excluded developments or subsequently approve use of
leftover funds at excluded developments. Therefore, to provide maximum flexibility, the HA may wish to include all
of its developments in the CIAP Application, even though there are no current needs. 
(4) The HA shall prepare for the Joint Review by preparing a draft CIAP budget, and reviewing the other items to be covered
during the Joint Review, such as the need for professional services, method of accomplishment of physical work (contract
or force account labor), HA compliance with various Federal statutes and regulations, etc. If conducted on-site,
the Joint Review may include an inspection of the proposed physical work. 


(e) HUD Awards


After all Joint Reviews are completed, the Field Office shall adjust the HAs, developments, and work items to be funded
and the amounts to be awarded, on the basis of information obtained from Joint Reviews, environmental reviews, and
FHEO review. Such adjustments are necessary where Joint Review determines that actual Group 1 emergencies and Group
2 high priority needs, HA priorities, or cost estimates vary from the HA's application. Such adjustments may preclude
the Field Office from funding all of the higher ranked HA applications. However, where the information obtained from
Joint Reviews, environmental reviews, and FHEO review does not substantially alter the information used to establish
the rankings before Joint Review, the Field Office shall make funding decisions in accordance with its rankings.
The Field Office shall then announce the HAs selected for CIAP grants, subject to their submission of an approvable
CIAP budget and other required documents. 


(f) HA Submission of Additional Documents



After Field Office funding decisions, the Field Office shall provide written notification to the HA of funding approval,
subject to HA submission of the following documents within the time frame prescribed by the Field Office: 
(1) 

Form HUD-52825, CIAP Budget/Progress Report

, which includes the implementation schedule(s), in an original and two copies. 
(2) 

Form HUD-50070, Certification for a Drug-Free Workplace

, in an original only. 
(3) 

Form HUD-52820, HA Board Resolution Approving CIAP Budget

, in an original only. 
(4) 

For each Turnkey III development approved

 for modernization, the number of units to be included in the modernization program and, where applicable, the estimated
cost attributed to each home, in an original only. 
(5) 

On a voluntary basis, an estimate of goals

 under Section 3 of the HUD Act of 1968 for the FY 1994 CIAP funds. 


(g) ACC Amendment


After HUD approval of the CIAP budget, HUD and the HA shall enter into an ACC amendment in order for the HA to requisition
modernization funds. The ACC amendment shall require low-income use of the housing for not less than 20 years from
the date of the ACC amendment (subject to sale of homeownership units in accordance with the terms of the ACC). HUD has
the authority to condition an ACC amendment (e.g., to require an HA to hire a modernization coordinator or contract
administrator to administer its modernization program). 


(h) Declaration of Trust


Where requested by the Field Office, the HA shall execute and file for record a Declaration of Trust as provided under
the ACC to protect the rights and interests of HUD throughout the 20-year period during which the HA is obligated to
operate its developments in accordance with the ACC, the Act, and HUD regulations and requirements. HUD has determined
that its interest in Mutual Help Program units is sufficiently protected without the further requirement of a Declaration
of Trust; therefore, a Declaration of Trust is not required for Mutual Help units. 


(i) ``Fast Tracking'' Applications


Emergency applications do not have to be processed within the normal processing time allowed for other applications.
Where an immediate hazard must be addressed, HA applications may be submitted and processed at any time during the
year when funds are available. The Field Office shall ``fast track'' the processing of these emergency applications
so that fund reservation may occur as soon as possible.

V. Other Program Items 


(a) Turnkey III Developments 


(1) General 


Eligible physical improvement costs for existing Turnkey III developments are limited to work items under Emergency
Modernization or Other Modernization which are not the responsibility of the homebuyer families 

and 

which are related to health and safety, correction of development deficiencies, physical accessibility, energy
audits and cost-effective energy conservation measures, or LBP testing, interim containment, professional risk
assessment and abatement. In addition, eligible costs include management improvements under the modernization
type of Other Modernization. Work on any units which have been paid off, even though not conveyed by the time the CIAP
Application is submitted, is ineligible. The cost of non-emergency health and safety work items shall increase the
purchase price and amortization period for homebuyer families; other eligible costs shall not increase the purchase
price and amortization period.



(2) Ineligible Costs 


Nonroutine maintenance or replacements, dwelling additions, and items that are the responsibility of the homebuyer
families are ineligible costs.



(3) Exception for Vacant or Non-Homebuyer-occupied Turnkey III Units



(i) Notwithstanding the requirements of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, an HA may carry out Other Modernization
in a Turnkey III development, whenever a Turnkey III unit becomes vacant or is occupied by a non-homebuyer family.
An HA that intends to use funds under this paragraph must identify in its CIAP Application, the estimated number of
units proposed for Other Modernization and subsequent sale. In addition, an HA must certify that: the proposed modernization
under this paragraph would result in bringing the identified units into full compliance with the homeownership objectives
under the Turnkey III Program; and the HA has homebuyers who both are eligible for homeownership, in accordance with
the regulatory requirements, and have demonstrated their intent to be placed into each of the Turnkey III units proposed
for Other Modernization.

(ii) Before an HA may be approved for Other Modernization of a unit under this paragraph, it must first deplete any Earned
Home Payments Account (EHPA) or Non-Routine Maintenance Reserve (NRMR) pertaining to the unit, and request the maximum
operating subsidy. Any increase in the value of a unit caused by its Other Modernization under this paragraph shall
be reflected solely by its subsequent appraised value, and not by an automatic increase in its purchase price.



(b) Mutual Help Developments 


Mutual Help developments are eligible for the same physical and management improvement costs as are rental developments.
Work on any Mutual Help units which have been paid off, even though not conveyed, by the time the CIAP Application is
submitted is ineligible.



(c) Professional Risk Assessment for LBP


An additional $11,956,923 set-aside will be made available for Professional Risk Assessments under a separate NOFA
and Processing Notice. HAs with pre-1980 family developments are strongly encouraged to apply for these funds to
conduct professional risk assessments.



(d) In-Place Management (Interim Containment of LBP) 


Where the results of the professional risk assessment recommend that the HA undertake in-place management measures,
the HA is strongly encouraged to apply for CIAP funds to carry out such measures. However, if the HA is not successful
in obtaining CIAP funds for in-place management measures, the HA may request a budget revision of previously approved,
but unobligated CIAP funds to accomplish such measures. Where the HA had a CIAP budget revision approved for this purpose
in FY 1993, the HA may request FY 1994 CIAP funds to complete the items which were eliminated as a result of the budget
revision.

<TEXT>
 

(e) Long-Term Viability and Reasonable Cost 


On Form HUD-52822, CIAP Application, the HA shall indicate whether the developments proposed for modernization
have long-term viability, including prospects for full occupancy. During Joint Review, the Field Office shall determine
whether the estimated costs are reasonable for the proposed work items and, if not, adjust the costs. The Field Office
shall review estimated costs against national indices, adjusted to reflect local conditions, such as R.S. Means
Index, the Dodge Report or Marshall and Swift, as well as using actual, local experience. The Field Office is no longer
required to compare estimated modernization costs against computed Total Development Cost (TDC) limits. Where
the HA or Field Office believes that a particular development may not have long-term viability, the Field Office shall
make a final viability determination, using the following criteria: 
(1) Any special or unusual conditions have been adequately explained, all work has been justified as necessary to
meet the modernization and energy conservation standards, including development specific work necessary to blend
the development in with the design and architecture of the neighborhood; and 
(2) Reasonable cost estimates have been provided, and every effort has been made to reduce costs; and 
(3) Rehabilitation of the existing development is more cost-effective in the long-term than construction or acquisition
of replacement housing; or 
(4) There are no practical alternatives for replacement housing. 


(f) Use of Dwelling Units for Economic Self-Sufficiency Services and/or Drug Elimination Activities



On August 24, 1990, the Department issued HUD Notice PIH 90-39 (PHA), concerning the eligibility for funding
under the Performance Funding System of dwelling units used to promote economic self-sufficiency services for residents
and anti-drug programs. CIAP funds may be used to convert units for these purposes. Also refer to the Family Self-Sufficiency
Program Guidelines (56 FR 49592, September 30, 1991). 


(g) Availability of Funding



(1) Where available, authorized residual receipts or debt forgiveness replacement reserve funds shall be used in
lieu of CIAP funds. Residual receipts may be retained for only two years. 
(2) The HA shall not receive duplicate funding for the same work item or activity under any circumstance and shall establish
controls to assure that an activity, program, or project that is funded under any other HUD program, shall not be funded
by CIAP. 
(3) A building which is assisted with Major Reconstruction of Obsolete Projects (MROP) funding after FY 1988 which
has not yet reached Date of Full Availability (DOFA) is not eligible for CIAP funding. A building which was assisted
with MROP funding during FYs 1986-1988 which has not yet expended all MROP funds is not eligible for CIAP funding.



VI. Application Deadline Date and Summary of FY 1994 CIAP Processing Steps 


See section III(d) for the deadline date for submission of the FY 1994 CIAP application. Dates for other processing
steps will be established by each Field Office to reflect local workload issues. The Field Office shall notify HAs
of its processing schedule before the application deadline date. 


Summary of Processing Steps 


1. HA submits CIAP Application. 
2. Field Office conducts completeness review and requests corrections to deficient applications. 
3. HA submits corrections to deficient applications within 21 calendar days of notification from Field Office.

VII. Other Matters 



(a) Environmental Impact 



A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR part 50 implementing section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332).
The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection and copying between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m.
weekdays at the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, 451 Seventh Street SW., room 10276, Washington, DC 20410. 



(b) Federalism Impact 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies and procedures contained in this NOFA will not have substantial direct effects on States or their
political subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and the States, or on the distribution
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the NOFA is not subject to review
under the Order. 



(c) Impact on the Family 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official for Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this NOFA
will likely have a beneficial impact on family formation, maintenance and general well-being. Accordingly, since
the impact on the family is beneficial, no further review is considered necessary. 



(d) Accountability in the Provision of HUD Assistance 



The Department has promulgated a final rule to implement section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development
Reform Act of 1989 (HUD Reform Act). The final rule is codified at 24 CFR part 12. Section 102 contains a number of provisions
that are designed to ensure greater accountability and integrity in the provision of certain types of assistance
administered by the Department. On January 16, 1992, the Department published at 57 FR 1942, additional information
that gave the public (including applicants for, and recipients of, HUD assistance) further information on the implementation,
public access, and disclosure requirements of section 102. The documentation, public access, and disclosure requirements
of section 102 are applicable to assistance awarded under this NOFA as follows: 



(1) Documentation and Public Access 



The Department will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant
to this NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including
any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than
30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD include the recipients of
assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly 

Federal Register

 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the
notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.)

<PARENT> FR940419-2-00086 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) HUD Responsibilities_Disclosures



The Department will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (Form HUD-2880)
submitted in connection with this NOFA. Update reports (also Form HUD-2880) will be made available along with
the applicant disclosure reports, but in no case for a period less than three years. All reports, both applicant disclosures
and updates, will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing
regulations at 24 CFR part 15. (See 24 CFR part 12, subpart C, and the notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these disclosure requirements.) 



(e) Prohibition Against Advance Information on Funding Decisions 



HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the HUD Reform Act, codified as 24 CFR part 4, applies to the funding competition
announced today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply until the announcement of the selection of successful
applicants. Also refer to a final rule amending part 4 published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 19, 1993 (58 FR 61016), regarding the regulation of certain conduct by HUD employees and by applicants
for HUD assistance during the selection process for the award of financial assistance by HUD. 

HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are limited by part 4 from
providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding decisions,
or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance in this
competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR Part 4. 

Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics at (202) 708-3815 (voice), (202) 708-1112
(TDD). These are not toll-free numbers. The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees,
as well. However, a HUD employee who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can
be discussed with persons outside the Department, should contact his or her Field Office Counsel or Headquarters
Counsel for the program to which the question pertains. 



(f) Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel 



Section 112 of the HUD Reform Act added a new section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C.
3531 

et seq.

) . Section 13 contains two provisions dealing with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial
assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those
who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action by the Department and those
who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the
award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance
received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. 

HUD regulations implementing section 13 are at 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the
Department in these ways, they are urged to read the regulation, particularly the examples contained in appendix
A of the rule. 

A final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on 
September 7, 1993, amended the definition of ``person'' to exclude from coverage a State or local government, or the
officer or employee of a State or local government or housing finance agency thereof who is engaged in the official
business of the State or local government.

(g) Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities



The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) and the
HUD implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of federal contracts, grants
or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the Federal Government
in connection with a specific contract, grant or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding of contracts, grants,
cooperative agreements or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification regarding lobbying.
Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000 must certify that
no federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance. 

IHAs established by an Indian tribe as a result of the exercise of the tribe's sovereign power are excluded from coverage
of the Byrd Amendment, but IHAs established under State law are not excluded from the statute's coverage. 

If the amount applied for is greater than $100,000, the certification is required at the time application for funds
is made that federally appropriated funds are not being or have been used in violation of the Byrd Amendment. If the
amount applied for is greater than $100,000 and the HA has made or has agreed to make any payment using nonappropriated
funds for lobbying activity, as described in 24 CFR Part 87 (Byrd Amendment), the submission also must include the
SF-LLL, Disclosure of Lobbying Activities. The HA determines if the submission of the SF-LLL is applicable.





(h) Paperwork Reduction Act Statement



The information collection requirements contained in this NOFA have been approved by the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1989 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520) and have been
assigned OMB control number 2577-0044.

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final policy.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has issued a national policy statement entitled ``Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Control Policy.'' This policy
establishes a consistent national approach for controlling discharges from CSOs to the Nation's waters through
the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The main purposes of the CSO Control Policy are to elaborate on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) National
CSO Control Strategy published on September 8, 1989, at 54 FR 37370, and to expedite compliance with the requirements
of the Clean Water Act (CWA). While implementation of the 1989 Strategy has resulted in progress toward controlling
CSOs, significant public health and water quality risks remain.



This Policy provides guidance to permittees with CSOs, NPDES authorities and State water quality standards authorities
on coordinating the planning, selection, and implementation of CSO controls that meet the requirements of the CWA
and allow for public involvement during the decision-making process.

Contained in the Policy are provisions for developing appropriate, site-specific NPDES permit requirements for
all combined sewer systems (CSS) that overflow as a result of wet weather events. For example, the Policy lays out two
alternative approaches_the ``demonstration'' and the ``presumption'' approaches_that provide communities
with targets for CSO controls that achieve compliance with the Act, particularly protection of water quality and
designated uses. The Policy also includes enforcement initiatives to require the immediate elimination of overflows
that occur during dry weather and to ensure that the remaining CWA requirements are complied with as soon as practicable.

The permitting provisions of the Policy were developed as a result of extensive input received from key stakeholders
during a negotiated policy dialogue. The CSO stakeholders included representatives from States, environmental
groups, municipal organizations and others. The negotiated dialogue was conducted during the Summer of 1992 by the
Office of Water and the Office of Water's Management Advisory Group. The enforcement initiatives, including one
which is underway to address CSOs during dry weather, were developed by EPA's Office of Water and Office of Enforcement.

EPA issued a Notice of Availability on the draft CSO Control Policy on January 19, 1993, (58 FR 4994) and requested comments
on the draft Policy by March 22, 1993. Approximately forty-one sets of written comments were submitted by a variety
of interest groups including cities and municipal groups, environmental groups, States, professional organizations
and others. All comments were considered as EPA prepared the Final Policy. The public comments were largely supportive
of the draft Policy. EPA received broad endorsement of and support for the key principles and provisions from most
commenters. Thus, this final Policy does not include significant changes to the major provisions of the draft Policy,
but rather, it includes clarification and better explanation of the elements of the Policy to address several of the
questions that were raised in the comments. Persons wishing to obtain copies of the public comments or EPA's summary
analysis of the comments may write or call the EPA contact person.

The CSO Policy represents a comprehensive national strategy to ensure that municipalities, permitting authorities,
water quality standards authorities and the public engage in a comprehensive and coordinated planning effort to
achieve cost effective CSO controls that ultimately meet appropriate health and environmental objectives. The
Policy recognizes the site-specific nature of CSOs and their impacts and provides the necessary flexibility to tailor
controls to local situations. Major elements of the Policy ensure that CSO controls are cost effective and meet the
objectives and requirements of the CWA.

The major provisions of the Policy are as follows.

CSO permittees should immediately undertake a process to accurately characterize their CSS and CSO discharges,
demonstrate implementation of minimum technology-based controls identified in the Policy, and develop long-term
CSO control plans which evaluate alternatives for attaining compliance with the CWA, including compliance with
water quality standards and protection of designated uses. Once the long-term CSO control plans are completed, permittees
will be responsible to implement the plans' recommendations as soon as practicable.

State water quality standards authorities will be involved in the long-term CSO control planning effort as well.
The water quality standards authorities will help ensure that development of the CSO permittees' long-term CSO control
plans are coordinated with the review and possible revision of water quality standards on CSO-impacted waters.

NPDES authorities will issue/reissue or modify permits, as appropriate, to require compliance with the technology-based
and water quality-based requirements of the CWA. After completion of the long-term CSO control plan, NPDES permits
will be reissued or modified to incorporate the additional requirements specified in the Policy, such as performance
standards for the selected controls based on average design conditions, a post-construction water quality assessment
program, monitoring for compliance with water quality standards, and a reopener clause authorizing the NPDES authority
to reopen and modify the permit if it is determined that the CSO controls fail to meet water quality standards or protect
designated uses. NPDES authorities should commence enforcement actions against permittees that have CWA violations
due to CSO discharges during dry weather. In addition, NPDES authorities should ensure the implementation of the
minimum technology-based controls and incorporate a schedule into an appropriate enforceable mechanism, with
appropriate milestone dates, to implement the required long-term CSO control plan. Schedules for implementation
of the long-term CSO control plan may be phased based on the relative importance of adverse impacts upon water quality
standards and designated uses, and on a permittee's financial capability.

EPA is developing extensive guidance to support the Policy and will announce the availability of the guidances and
other outreach efforts through various means, as they become available. For example, EPA is preparing guidance on
the nine minimum controls, characterization and monitoring of CSOs, development of long-term CSO control plans,
and financial capability.

Permittees will be expected to comply with any existing CSO-related requirements in NPDES permits, consent decrees
or court orders unless revised to be consistent with this Policy.

Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Control Policy 


I. Introduction 


A. Purpose and Principles 


The main purposes of this Policy are to elaborate on EPA's National Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Control Strategy
published on September 8, 1989 at 54 FR 37370 (1989 Strategy) and to expedite compliance with the requirements of the
Clean Water Act (CWA). While implementation of the 1989 Strategy has resulted in progress toward controlling CSOs,
significant water quality risks remain. 
A combined sewer system (CSS) is a wastewater collection system owned by a State or municipality (as defined by section
502(4) of the CWA) which conveys sanitary wastewaters (domestic, commercial and industrial wastewaters) and storm
water through a single-pipe system to a Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) Treatment Plant (as defined in 40 CFR
403.3(p)). A CSO is the discharge from a CSS at a point prior to the POTW Treatment Plant. CSOs are point sources subject
to NPDES permit requirements including both technology-based and water quality-based requirements of the CWA.
CSOs are not subject to secondary treatment requirements applicable to POTWs. 
CSOs consist of mixtures of domestic sewage, industrial and commercial wastewaters, and storm water runoff. CSOs
often contain high levels of suspended solids, pathogenic microorganisms, toxic pollutants, floatables, nutrients,
oxygen-demanding organic compounds, oil and grease, and other pollutants. CSOs can cause exceedances of water quality
standards (WQS). Such exceedances may pose risks to human health, threaten aquatic life and its habitat, and impair
the use and enjoyment of the Nation's waterways. 
This Policy is intended to provide guidance to permittees with CSOs, National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permitting authorities, State water quality standards authorities and enforcement authorities. The purpose
of the Policy is to coordinate the planning, selection, design and implementation of CSO management practices and
controls to meet the requirements of the CWA and to involve the public fully during the decision making process. 
This Policy reiterates the objectives of the 1989 Strategy: 



1. To ensure that if CSOs occur, they are only as a result of wet weather; 
2. To bring all wet weather CSO discharge points into compliance with the technology-based and water quality-based
requirements of the CWA; and 
3. To minimize water quality, aquatic biota, and human health impacts from CSOs.

 

This CSO Control Policy represents a comprehensive national strategy to ensure that municipalities, permitting
authorities, water quality standards authorities and the public engage in a comprehensive and coordinated planning
effort to achieve cost-effective CSO controls that ultimately meet appropriate health and environmental objectives
and requirements. The Policy recognizes the site-specific nature of CSOs and their impacts and provides the necessary
flexibility to tailor controls to local situations. Four key principles of the Policy ensure that CSO controls are
cost-effective and meet the objectives of the CWA. The key principles are: 




1. Providing clear levels of control that would be presumed to meet appropriate health and environmental objectives;

2. Providing sufficient flexibility to municipalities, especially financially disadvantaged communities, to
consider the site-specific nature of CSOs and to determine the most cost-effective means of reducing pollutants
and meeting CWA objectives and requirements;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940419-2-00166 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940419-2-00087 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

3. Allowing a phased approach to implementation of CSO controls considering a community's financial capability;
and 

4. Review and revision, as appropriate, of water quality standards and their implementation procedures when developing
CSO control plans to reflect the site-specific wet weather impacts of CSOs.




This Policy is being issued in support of EPA's regulations and policy initiatives. This Policy is Agency guidance
only and does not establish or affect legal rights or obligations. It does not establish a binding norm and is not finally
determinative of the issues addressed. Agency decisions in any particular case will be made by applying the law and
regulations on the basis of specific facts when permits are issued. The Administration has recommended that the 1994
amendments to the CWA endorse this final Policy. 



B. Application of Policy 



The permitting provisions of this Policy apply to all CSSs that overflow as a result of storm water flow, including
snow melt runoff (40 CFR 122.26(b)(13)). Discharges from CSSs during dry weather are prohibited by the CWA. Accordingly,
the permitting provisions of this Policy do not apply to CSOs during dry weather. Dry weather flow is the flow in a combined
sewer that results from domestic sewage, groundwater infiltration, commercial and industrial wastewaters, and
any other non-precipitation related flows (e.g., tidal infiltration). In addition to the permitting provisions,
the Enforcement and Compliance section of this Policy describes an enforcement initiative being developed for overflows
that occur during dry weather. 

Consistent with the 1989 Strategy, 30 States that submitted CSO permitting strategies have received EPA approval
or, in the case of one State, conditional approval of its strategy. States and EPA Regional Offices should review these
strategies and negotiate appropriate revisions to them to implement this Policy. Permitting authorities are encouraged
to evaluate water pollution control needs on a watershed management basis and coordinate CSO control efforts with
other point and nonpoint source control activities. 



C. Effect on Current CSO Control Efforts 



EPA recognizes that extensive work has been done by many Regions, States, and municipalities to abate CSOs. As such,
portions of this Policy may already have been addressed by permittees' previous efforts to control CSOs. Therefore,
portions of this Policy may not apply, as determined by the permitting authority on a case-by-case basis, under the
following circumstances: 

1. Any permittee that, on the date of publication of this final Policy, has completed or substantially completed construction
of CSO control facilities that are designed to meet WQS and protect designated uses, and where it has been determined
that WQS are being or will be attained, is not covered by the initial planning and construction provisions in this Policy;
however, the operational plan and post-construction monitoring provisions continue to apply. If, after monitoring,
it is determined that WQS are not being attained, the permittee should be required to submit a revised CSO control plan
that, once implemented, will attain WQS. 

2. Any permittee that, on the date of publication of this final Policy, has substantially developed or is implementing
a CSO control program pursuant to an existing permit or enforcement order, and such program is considered by the NPDES
permitting authority to be adequate to meet WQS and protect designated uses and is reasonably equivalent to the treatment
objectives of this Policy, should complete those facilities without further planning activities otherwise expected
by this Policy. Such programs, however, should be reviewed and modified to be consistent with the sensitive area,
financial capability, and post-construction monitoring provisions of this Policy. 

3. Any permittee that has previously constructed CSO control facilities in an effort to comply with WQS but has failed
to meet such applicable standards or to protect designated uses due to remaining CSOs may receive consideration for
such efforts in future permits or enforceable orders for long-term CSO control planning, design and implementation.


In the case of any ongoing or substantially completed CSO control effort, the NPDES permit or other enforceable mechanism,
as appropriate, should be revised to include all appropriate permit requirements consistent with Section IV.B.
of this Policy.

D. Small System Considerations



The scope of the long-term CSO control plan, including the 
characterization, monitoring and modeling, and evaluation of alternatives portions of this Policy may be difficult
for some small CSSs. At the discretion of the NPDES Authority, jurisdictions with populations under 75,000 may not
need to complete each of the formal steps outlined in Section II.C. of this Policy, but should be required through their
permits or other enforceable mechanisms to comply with the nine minimum controls (II.B), public participation (II.C.2),
and sensitive areas (II.C.3) portions of this Policy. In addition, the permittee may propose to implement any of the
criteria contained in this Policy for evaluation of alternatives described in II.C.4. Following approval of the
proposed plan, such jurisdictions should construct the control projects and propose a monitoring program sufficient
to determine whether WQS are attained and designated uses are protected. 

In developing long-term CSO control plans based on the small system considerations discussed in the preceding paragraph,
permittees are encouraged to discuss the scope of their long-term CSO control plan with the WQS authority and the NPDES
authority. These discussions will ensure that the plan includes sufficient information to enable the permitting
authority to identify the appropriate CSO controls. 



E. Implementation Responsibilities 



NPDES authorities (authorized States or EPA Regional Offices, as appropriate) are responsible for implementing
this Policy. It is their responsibility to assure that CSO permittees develop long-term CSO control plans and that
NPDES permits meet the requirements of the CWA. Further, they are responsible for coordinating the review of the long-term
CSO control plan and the development of the permit with the WQS authority to determine if revisions to the WQS are appropriate.
In addition, they should determine the appropriate vehicle (i.e., permit reissuance, information request under
CWA section 308 or State equivalent or enforcement action) to ensure that compliance with the CWA is achieved as soon
as practicable. 

Permittees are responsible for documenting the implementation of the nine minimum controls and developing and implementing
a long-term CSO control plan, as described in this Policy. EPA recognizes that financial considerations are a major
factor affecting the implementation of CSO controls. For that reason, this Policy allows consideration of a permittee's
financial capability in connection with the long-term CSO control planning effort, WQS review, and negotiation
of enforceable schedules. However, each permittee is ultimately responsible for aggressively pursuing financial
arrangements for the implementation of its long-term CSO control plan. As part of this effort, communities should
apply to their State Revolving Fund program, or other assistance programs as appropriate, for financial assistance.


EPA and the States will undertake action to assure that all permittees with CSSs are subject to a consistent review
in the permit development process, have permit requirements that achieve compliance with the CWA, and are subject
to enforceable schedules that require the earliest practicable compliance date considering physical and financial
feasibility. 



F. Policy Development 



This Policy devotes a separate section to each step involved in developing and implementing CSO controls. This is
not to imply that each function occurs separately. Rather, the entire process surrounding CSO controls, community
planning, WQS and permit development/revision, enforcement/compliance actions and public participation must
be coordinated to control CSOs 
effectively. Permittees and permitting authorities are encouraged to consider innovative and alternative approaches
and technologies that achieve the objectives of this Policy and the CWA. 

In developing this Policy, EPA has included information on what responsible parties are expected to accomplish.
Subsequent documents will provide additional guidance on how the objectives of this Policy should be met. These documents
will provide further guidance on: CSO permit writing, the nine minimum controls, long-term CSO control plans, financial
capability, sewer system characterization and receiving water monitoring and modeling, and application of WQS
to CSO-impacted waters. For most CSO control efforts however, sufficient detail has been included in this Policy
to begin immediate implementation of its provisions.

II. EPA Objectives for Permittees 


A. Overview 


Permittees with CSSs that have CSOs should immediately undertake a process to accurately characterize their sewer
systems, to demonstrate implementation of the nine minimum controls, and to develop a long-term CSO control plan.



B. Implementation of the Nine Minimum Controls 


Permittees with CSOs should submit appropriate documentation demonstrating implementation of the nine minimum
controls, including any proposed schedules for completing minor construction activities. The nine minimum controls
are: 



1. Proper operation and regular maintenance programs for the sewer system and the CSOs; 
2. Maximum use of the collection system for storage; 
3. Review and modification of pretreatment requirements to assure CSO impacts are minimized; 
4. Maximization of flow to the POTW for treatment; 
5. Prohibition of CSOs during dry weather; 
6. Control of solid and floatable materials in CSOs; 
7. Pollution prevention; 
8. Public notification to ensure that the public receives 
adequate notification of CSO occurrences and CSO impacts; and 
9. Monitoring to effectively characterize CSO impacts and the efficacy of CSO controls. 



Selection and implementation of actual control measures should be based on site-specific considerations including
the specific CSS's characteristics discussed under the sewer system characterization and monitoring portions
of this Policy. Documentation of the nine minimum controls may include operation and maintenance plans, revised
sewer use ordinances for industrial users, sewer system inspection reports, infiltration/inflow studies, pollution
prevention programs, public notification plans, and facility plans for maximizing the capacities of the existing
collection, storage and treatment systems, as well as contracts and schedules for minor construction programs for
improving the existing system's operation. The permittee should also submit any information or data on the degree
to which the nine minimum controls achieve compliance with water quality standards. These data and information should
include results made available through monitoring and modeling activities done in conjunction with the development
of the long-term CSO control plan described in this Policy. 
This documentation should be submitted as soon as practicable, but no later than two years after the requirement to
submit such documentation is included in an NPDES permit or other enforceable mechanism. Implementation of the nine
minimum controls with appropriate documentation should be completed as soon as practicable but no later than January
1, 1997. These dates should be included in an appropriate enforceable mechanism. 

Because the CWA requires immediate compliance with technology-based controls (section 301(b)), which on a Best
Professional Judgment basis should include the nine minimum controls, a compliance schedule for implementing the
nine minimum controls, if necessary, should be included in an appropriate enforceable mechanism. 


C. Long-Term CSO Control Plan 


Permittees with CSOs are responsible for developing and implementing long-term CSO control plans that will ultimately
result in compliance with the requirements of the CWA. The long-term plans should consider the site-specific nature
of CSOs and evaluate the cost effectiveness of a range of control options/strategies. The development of the long-term
CSO control plan and its subsequent implementation should also be coordinated with the NPDES authority and the State
authority responsible for reviewing and revising the State's WQS. The selected controls should be designed to allow
cost effective expansion or cost effective retrofitting if additional controls are subsequently determined to
be necessary to meet WQS, including existing and designated uses.

This policy identifies EPA's major objectives for the long-term CSO control plan. Permittees should develop and
submit this long-term CSO control plan as soon as practicable, but generally within two years after the date of the
NPDES permit provision, Section 308 information request, or enforcement action requiring the permittee to develop
the plan. NPDES authorities may establish a longer timetable for completion of the long-term CSO control plan on a
case-by-case basis to account for site-specific factors which may influence the complexity of the planning process.
Once agreed upon, these dates should be included in an appropriate enforceable mechanism. 
EPA expects each long-term CSO control plan to utilize appropriate information to address the following minimum
elements. The Plan should also include both fixed-date project implementation schedules (which may be phased) and
a financing plan to design and construct the project as soon as practicable. The minimum elements of the long-term
CSO control plan are described below. 


1. Characterization, Monitoring, and Modeling of the Combined Sewer System 


In order to design a CSO control plan adequate to meet the requirements of the CWA, a permittee should have a thorough
understanding of its sewer system, the response of the system to various precipitation events, the characteristics
of the overflows, and the water quality impacts that result from CSOs. The permittee should adequately characterize
through monitoring, modeling, and other means as appropriate, for a range of storm events, the response of its sewer
system to wet weather events including the number, location and frequency of CSOs, volume, concentration and mass
of pollutants discharged and the impacts of the CSOs on the receiving waters and their designated uses. The permittee
may need to consider information on the contribution and importance of other pollution sources in order to develop
a final plan designed to meet water quality standards. The purpose of the system characterization, monitoring and
modeling program initially is to assist the permittee in developing appropriate measures to implement the nine minimum
controls and, if necessary, to support development of the long-term CSO control plan. The monitoring and modeling
data also will be used to evaluate the expected effectiveness of both the nine minimum controls and, if necessary,
the long-term CSO controls, to meet WQS. 
The major elements of a sewer system characterization are described below. 
a. Rainfall Records_The permittee should examine the complete rainfall record for the geographic area of its existing
CSS using sound statistical procedures and best available data. The permittee should evaluate flow variations in
the receiving water body to correlate between CSOs and receiving water conditions. 
b. Combined Sewer System Characterization_The permittee should evaluate the nature and extent of its sewer system
through evaluation of available sewer system records, field inspections and other activities necessary to understand
the number, location and frequency of overflows and their location relative to sensitive areas and to pollution sources
in the collection system, such as indirect significant industrial users.

<PARENT> FR940419-2-00087 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

c. CSO Monitoring_The permittee should develop a comprehensive, representative monitoring program that measures
the frequency, duration, flow rate, volume and pollutant concentration of CSO discharges and assesses the impact
of the CSOs on the receiving waters. The monitoring program should include necessary CSO effluent and ambient in-stream
monitoring and, where appropriate, other monitoring protocols such as biological assessment, toxicity testing
and sediment sampling. Monitoring parameters should include, for example, oxygen demanding pollutants, nutrients,
toxic pollutants, sediment contaminants, pathogens, bacteriological indicators (e.g., Enterococcus, E. Coli),
and toxicity. A representative sample of overflow points can be selected that is sufficient to allow characterization
of CSO discharges and their water quality impacts and to facilitate evaluation of control plan alternatives. 
d. Modeling_Modeling of a sewer system is recognized as a valuable tool for predicting sewer system response to various
wet weather events and assessing water quality impacts when evaluating different control strategies and alternatives.
EPA supports the proper and effective use of models, where appropriate, in the evaluation of the nine minimum controls
and the development of the long-term CSO control plan. It is also recognized that there are many models which may be
used to do this. These models range from simple to complex. Having decided to use a model, the permittee should base
its choice of a model on the characteristics of its sewer system, the number and location of overflow points, and the
sensitivity of the receiving water body to the CSO discharges. Use of models should include appropriate calibration
and verification with field measurements. The sophistication of the model should relate to the complexity of the
system to be modeled and to the information needs associated with evaluation of CSO control options and water quality
impacts. EPA believes that continuous simulation models, using historical rainfall data, may be the best way to model
sewer systems, CSOs, and their impacts. Because of the iterative nature of modeling sewer systems, CSOs, and their
impacts, monitoring and modeling efforts are complementary and should be coordinated. 


2. Public Participation 


In developing its long-term CSO control plan, the permittee will employ a public participation process that actively
involves the affected public in the decision-making to select the long-term CSO controls. The affected public includes
rate payers, industrial users of the sewer system, persons who reside downstream from the CSOs, persons who use and
enjoy these downstream waters, and any other interested persons. 


3. Consideration of Sensitive Areas 


EPA expects a permittee's long-term CSO control plan to give the highest priority to controlling overflows to sensitive
areas. Sensitive areas, as determined by the NPDES authority in coordination with State and Federal agencies, as
appropriate, include designated Outstanding National Resource Waters, National Marine Sanctuaries, waters with
threatened or endangered species and their habitat, waters with primary contact recreation, public drinking water
intakes or their designated protection areas, and shellfish beds. For such areas, the long-term CSO control plan
should: 
a. Prohibit new or significantly increased overflows; 
b. i. Eliminate or relocate overflows that discharge to sensitive areas wherever physically possible and economically
achievable, except where elimination or relocation would provide less environmental protection than additional
treatment; or 
ii. Where elimination or relocation is not physically possible and economically achievable, or would provide less
environmental protection than additional treatment, provide the level of treatment for remaining overflows deemed
necessary to meet WQS for full protection of existing and designated uses. In any event, the level of control should
not be less than those described in Evaluation of Alternatives below; and

c. Where elimination or relocation has been proven not to be physically possible and economically achievable, permitting
authorities should require, for each subsequent permit term, a reassessment based on new or improved techniques
to eliminate or relocate, or on changed circumstances that influence economic achievability. 


4. Evaluation of Alternatives 


EPA expects the long-term CSO control plan to consider a reasonable range of alternatives. The plan should, for example,
evaluate controls that would be necessary to achieve zero overflow events per year, an average of one to three, four
to seven, and eight to twelve overflow events per year. Alternatively, the long-term plan could evaluate controls
that achieve 100% capture, 90% capture, 85% capture, 80% capture, and 75% capture for treatment. The long-term control
plan should also consider expansion of POTW secondary and primary capacity in the CSO abatement alternative analysis.
The analysis of alternatives should be sufficient to make a reasonable assessment of cost and performance as described
in Section II.C.5. Because the final long-term CSO control plan will become the basis for NPDES permit limits and requirements,
the selected controls should be sufficient to meet CWA requirements. 
In addition to considering sensitive areas, the long-term CSO control plan should adopt one of the following approaches:



a. ``Presumption'' Approach 


A program that meets any of the criteria listed below would be presumed to provide an adequate level of control to meet
the water quality-based requirements of the CWA, provided the permitting authority determines that such presumption
is reasonable in light of the data and analysis conducted in the characterization, monitoring, and modeling of the
system and the consideration of sensitive areas described above. These criteria are provided because data and modeling
of wet weather events often do not give a clear picture of the level of CSO controls necessary to protect WQS. 
i. No more than an average of four overflow events per year, provided that the permitting authority may allow up to two
additional overflow events per year. For the purpose of this criterion, an overflow event is one or more overflows
from a CSS as the result of a precipitation event that does not receive the minimum treatment specified below; or 
ii. The elimination or the capture for treatment of no less than 85% by volume of the combined sewage collected in the
CSS during precipitation events on a system-wide annual average basis; or 
iii. The elimination or removal of no less than the mass of the pollutants, identified as causing water quality impairment
through the sewer system characterization, monitoring, and modeling effort, for the volumes that would be eliminated
or captured for treatment under paragraph ii. above.

 

Combined sewer flows remaining after implementation of the nine minimum controls and within the criteria specified
at II.C.4.a.i or ii, should receive a minimum of: 


 Primary clarification (Removal of floatables and settleable solids may be achieved by any combination of
treatment technologies or methods that are shown to be equivalent to primary clarification.); 
 Solids and floatables disposal; and 
 Disinfection of effluent, if necessary, to meet WQS, protect designated uses and protect human health, including
removal of harmful disinfection chemical residuals, where necessary. 


b. ``Demonstration'' Approach 


A permittee may demonstrate that a selected control program, though not meeting the criteria specified in II.C.4.a.
above is adequate to meet the water quality-based requirements of the CWA. To be a successful demonstration, the permittee
should demonstrate each of the following: 
i. The planned control program is adequate to meet WQS and protect designated uses, unless WQS or uses cannot be met
as a result of natural background conditions or pollution sources other than CSOs; 
ii. The CSO discharges remaining after implementation of the planned control program will not preclude the attainment
of WQS or the receiving waters' designated uses or contribute to their impairment. Where WQS and designated uses are
not met in part because of natural background conditions or pollution sources other than CSOs, a total maximum daily
load, including a wasteload allocation and a load allocation, or other means should be used to apportion pollutant
loads; 
iii. The planned control program will provide the maximum pollution reduction benefits reasonably attainable;
and

<TEXT>
 

iv. The planned control program is designed to allow cost effective expansion or cost effective retrofitting if additional
controls are subsequently determined to be necessary to meet WQS or designated uses.



5. Cost/Performance Considerations



The permittee should develop appropriate cost/performance curves to demonstrate the relationships among a comprehensive
set of reasonable control alternatives that correspond to the different ranges specified in Section II.C.4. This
should include an analysis to determine where the increment of pollution reduction achieved in the receiving water
diminishes compared to the increased costs. This analysis, often known as knee of the curve, should be among the considerations
used to help guide selection of controls.



6. Operational Plan



After agreement between the permittee and NPDES authority on the necessary CSO controls to be implemented under the
long-term CSO control plan, the permittee should revise the operation and maintenance program developed as part
of the nine minimum controls to include the agreed-upon long-term CSO controls. The revised operation and maintenance
program should maximize the removal of pollutants during and after each precipitation event using all available
facilities within the collection and treatment system. For any flows in excess of the criteria specified at II.C.4.a.i.,
ii. or iii and not receiving the treatment specified in II.C.4.a, the operational plan should ensure that such flows
receive treatment to the greatest extent practicable.



7. Maximizing Treatment at the Existing POTW Treatment Plant



In some communities, POTW treatment plants may have primary treatment capacity in excess of their secondary treatment
capacity. One effective strategy to abate pollution resulting from CSOs is to maximize the delivery of flows during
wet weather to the POTW treatment plant for treatment. Delivering these flows can have two significant water quality
benefits: First, increased flows during wet weather to the POTW treatment plant may enable the permittee to eliminate
or minimize overflows to sensitive areas; second, this would maximize the use of available POTW facilities for wet
weather flows and would ensure that combined sewer flows receive at least primary treatment prior to discharge.

Under EPA regulations, the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a treatment facility, including
secondary treatment, is a bypass. EPA bypass regulations at 40 CFR 122.41(m) allow for a facility to bypass some or
all the flow from its treatment process under specified limited circumstances. Under the regulation, the permittee
must show that the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage, that
there was no feasible alternative to the bypass and that the permittee submitted the required notices. In addition,
the regulation provides that a bypass may be approved only after consideration of adverse effects.

Normally, it is the responsibility of the permittee to document, on a case-by-base basis, compliance with 40 CFR 122.41(m)
in order to bypass flows legally. For some CSO-related permits, the study of feasible alternatives in the control
plan may provide sufficient support for the permit record and for approval of a CSO-related bypass in the permit itself,
and to define the specific parameters under which a bypass can legally occur. For approval of a CSO-related bypass,
the long-term CSO control plan, at a minimum, should provide justification for the cut-off point at which the flow
will be diverted from the secondary treatment portion of the treatment plant, and provide a benefit-cost analysis
demonstrating that conveyance of wet weather flow to the POTW for primary treatment is more beneficial than other
CSO abatement alternatives such as storage and pump back for secondary treatment, sewer separation, or satellite
treatment. Such a permit must define under what specific wet weather conditions a CSO-related bypass is allowed and
also specify what treatment or what monitoring, and effluent limitations and requirements apply to the bypass flow.
The permit should also provide that approval for the CSO-related bypass will be reviewed and may be modified or terminated
if there is a substantial increase in the volume or character of pollutants being introduced to the POTW. The CSO-related
bypass provision in the permit should also make it clear that all wet weather flows passing the headworks of the POTW
treatment plant will receive at least primary clarification and solids and floatables removal and disposal, and
disinfection, where necessary, and any other treatment that can reasonably be provided.

Under this approach, EPA would allow a permit to authorize a CSO-related bypass of the secondary treatment portion
of the POTW treatment plant for combined sewer flows in certain identified circumstances. This provision would apply
only to those situations where the POTW would ordinarily meet the requirements of 40 CFR 122.41(m) as evaluated on
a case-by-case basis. Therefore, there must be sufficient data in the administrative record (reflected in the permit
fact sheet or statement of basis) supporting all the requirements in 40 CFR 122.41(m)(4) for approval of an anticipated
bypass.

For the purposes of applying this regulation to CSO permittees, ``severe property damage'' could include situations
where flows above a certain level wash out the POTW's secondary treatment system. EPA further believes that the feasible
alternatives requirement of the regulation can be met if the record shows that the secondary treatment system is properly
operated and maintained, that the system has been designed to meet secondary limits for flows greater than the peak
dry weather flow, plus an appropriate quantity of wet weather flow, and that it is either technically or financially
infeasible to provide secondary treatment at the existing facilities for greater amounts of wet weather flow. The
feasible alternative analysis should include, for example, consideration of enhanced primary treatment (e.g.,
chemical addition) and non-biological secondary treatment. Other bases supporting a finding of no feasible alternative
may also be available on a case-by-case basis. As part of its consideration of possible adverse effects resulting
from the bypass, the permitting authority should also ensure that the bypass will not cause exceedances of WQS.

This Policy does not address the appropriateness of approving anticipated bypasses through NPDES permits in advance
outside the CSO context. 


8. Implementation Schedule 


The permittee should include all pertinent information in the long term control plan necessary to develop the construction
and financing schedule for implementation of CSO controls. Schedules for implementation of the CSO controls may
be phased based on the relative importance of adverse impacts upon WQS and designated uses, priority projects identified
in the long-term plan, and on a permittee's financial capability. 
Construction phasing should consider: 
a. Eliminating overflows that discharge to sensitive areas as the highest priority; 
b. Use impairment; 
c. The permittee's financial capability including consideration of such factors as: 
i. Median household income; 
ii. Total annual wastewater and CSO control costs per household as a percent of median household income; 
iii. Overall net debt as a percent of full market property value; 
iv. Property tax revenues as a percent of full market property value; 
v. Property tax collection rate; 
vi. Unemployment; and 
vii. Bond rating; 
d. Grant and loan availability; 
e. Previous and current residential, commercial and industrial sewer user fees and rate structures; and 
f. Other viable funding mechanisms and sources of financing. 


9. Post-Construction Compliance Monitoring Program 


The selected CSO controls should include a post-construction water quality monitoring program adequate to verify
compliance with water quality standards and protection of designated uses as well as to ascertain the effectiveness
of CSO controls. This water quality compliance monitoring program should include a plan to be approved by the NPDES
authority that details the monitoring protocols to be followed, including the necessary effluent and ambient monitoring
and, where appropriate, other monitoring protocols such as biological assessments, whole effluent toxicity testing,
and sediment sampling. 


III. Coordination With State Water Quality Standards 


A. Overview 


WQS are State adopted, or Federally promulgated rules which serve as the goals for the water body and the legal basis
for the water quality-based NPDES permit requirements under the CWA. WQS consist of uses which States designate for
their water bodies, criteria to protect the uses, an anti-degradation policy to protect the water quality improvements
gained and other policies affecting the implementation of the standards. A primary objective of the long-term CSO
control plan is to meet WQS, including the designated uses through reducing risks to human health and the environment
by eliminating, relocating or controlling CSOs to the affected waters.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940419-2-00175 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940419-2-00087 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

State WQS authorities, NPDES authorities, EPA regional offices, permittees, and the public should meet early and
frequently throughout the long-term CSO control planning process. Development of the long-term plan should be coordinated
with the review and appropriate revision of WQS and implementation procedures on CSO-impacted waters to ensure that
the long-term controls will be sufficient to meet water quality standards. As part of these meetings, participants
should agree on the data, information and analyses needed to support the development of the long-term CSO control
plan and the review of applicable WQS, and implementation procedures, if appropriate. Agreements should be reached
on the monitoring protocols and models that will be used to evaluate the water quality impacts of the overflows, to
analyze the attainability of the WQS and to determine the water quality-based requirements for the permit. Many opportunities
exist for permittees and States to share information as control programs are developed and as WQS are reviewed. Such
information should assist States in determining the need for revisions to WQS and implementation procedures to better
reflect the site-specific wet weather impacts of CSOs. Coordinating the development of the long-term CSO control
plan and the review of the WQS and implementation procedures provides greater assurance that the long-term control
plan selected and the limits and requirements included in the NPDES permit will be sufficient to meet WQS and to comply
with sections 301(b)(1)(C) and 402(a)(2) of the CWA. 
EPA encourages States and permittees jointly to sponsor workshops for the affected public in the development of the
long-term CSO control plan and during the development of appropriate revisions to WQS for CSO-impacted waters. Workshops
provide a forum for including the public in discussions of the implications of the proposed long-term CSO control
plan on the water quality and uses for the receiving water. 


B. Water Quality Standards Reviews 


The CWA requires States to periodically, but at least once every three years, hold public hearings for the purpose
of reviewing applicable water quality standards and, as appropriate, modifying and adopting standards. States
must provide the public an opportunity to comment on any proposed revision to water quality standards and all revisions
must be submitted to EPA for review and approval. 
EPA regulations and guidance provide States with the flexibility to adapt their WQS, and implementation procedures
to reflect site-specific conditions including those related to CSOs. For example, a State may adopt site-specific
criteria for a particular pollutant if the State determines that the site-specific criteria fully protects the designated
use (40 CFR 131.11). In addition, the regulations at 40 CFR 131.10(g), (h), and (j) specify when and how a designated
use may be modified. A State may remove a designated use from its water quality standards only if the designated use
is not an existing use. An existing use is a use actually attained in the water body on or after November 28, 1975. Furthermore,
a State may not remove a designated use that will be attained by implementing the technology-based effluent limits
required under sections 301(b) and 306 of the CWA and by implementing cost-effective and reasonable best management
practices for nonpoint source controls. Thus, if a State has a reasonable basis to determine that the current designated
use could be attained after implementation of the technology-based controls of the CWA, then the use could not be removed.

In determining whether a use is attainable and prior to removing a designated use, States must conduct and submit to
EPA a use attainability analysis. A use attainability analysis is a structured scientific assessment of the factors
affecting the use, including the physical, chemical, biological, and economic factors described in 40 CFR 131.10(g).
As part of the analysis, States should evaluate whether the designated use could be attained if CSO controls were implemented.
For example, States should examine if sediment loadings from CSOs could be reduced so as not to bury spawning beds,
or if biochemical oxygen demanding material in the effluent or the toxicity of the effluent could be corrected so as
to reduce the acute or chronic physiological stress on or bioaccumulation potential of aquatic organisms. 
In reviewing the attainability of their WQS and the applicability of their implementation procedures to CSO-impacted

waters, States are encouraged to define more explicitly their recreational and aquatic life uses and then, if appropriate,
modify the criteria accordingly to protect the designated uses.

</DOC>

<PARENT> FR940419-2-00087 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Another option is for States to adopt partial uses by defining when primary contact recreation such as swimming does
not exist, such as during certain seasons of the year in northern climates or during a particular type of storm event.
In making such adjustments to their uses, States must ensure that downstream uses are protected, and that during other
seasons or after the storm event has passed, the use is fully protected. 
In addition to defining recreational uses with greater specificity, States are also encouraged to define the aquatic
uses more precisely. Rather than ``aquatic life use protection,'' States should consider defining the type of fishery
to be protected such as a cold water fishery (e.g., trout or salmon) or a warm weather fishery (e.g., bluegill or large
mouth bass). Explicitly defining the type of fishery to be protected may assist the permittee in enlisting the support
of citizens for a CSO control plan. 
A water quality standard variance may be appropriate, in limited circumstances on CSO-impacted waters, where the
State is uncertain as to whether a standard can be attained and time is needed for the State to conduct additional analyses
on the attainability of the standard. Variances are short-term modifications in water quality standards. Subject
to EPA approval, States, with their own statutory authority, may grant a variance to a specific discharger for a specific
pollutant. The justification for a variance is similar to that required for a permanent change in the standard, although
the showings needed are less rigorous. Variances are also subject to public participation requirements of the water
quality standards and permits programs and are reviewable generally every three years. A variance allows the CSO
permit to be written to meet the ``modified'' water quality standard as analyses are conducted and as progress is made
to improve water quality. 
Justifications for variances are the same as those identified in 40 CFR 131.10(g) for modifications in uses. States
must provide an opportunity for public review and comment on all variances. If States use the permit as the vehicle
to grant the variance, notice of the permit must clearly state that the variance modifies the State's water quality
standards. If the variance is approved, the State appends the variance to the State's standards and reviews the variance
every three years. 



IV. Expectations for Permitting Authorities 



A. Overview 



CSOs are point sources subject to NPDES permit requirements including both technology-based and water quality-based
requirements of the CWA. CSOs are not subject to secondary treatment regulations applicable to publicly owned treatment
works (

Montgomery Environmental Coalition 

vs. 

Costle, 

646 F.2d 568 (D.C. Cir. 1980)). 

All permits for CSOs should require the nine minimum controls as a minimum best available technology economically
achievable and best conventional technology (BAT/BCT) established on a best professional judgment (BPJ) basis
by the permitting authority (40 CFR 125.3). Water quality-based requirements are to be established based on applicable
water quality standards. 


This policy establishes a uniform, nationally consistent approach to developing and issuing NPDES permits to permittees
with CSOs. Permits for CSOs should be developed and issued expeditiously. A single, system-wide permit generally
should be issued for all discharges, including CSOs, from a CSS operated by a single authority. When different parts
of a single CSS are operated by more than one authority, permits issued to each authority should generally require
joint preparation and implementation of the elements of this Policy and should specifically define the responsibilities
and duties of each authority. Permittees should be required to coordinate system-wide implementation of the nine
minimum controls and the development and implementation of the long-term CSO control plan. 

The individual authorities are responsible for their own discharges and should cooperate with the permittee for
the POTW receiving the flows from the CSS. When a CSO is permitted separately from the POTW, both permits should be cross-referenced
for informational purposes. 

EPA Regions and States should review the CSO permitting priorities established in the State CSO Permitting Strategies
developed in response to the 1989 Strategy. Regions and States may elect to revise these previous priorities. In setting
permitting priorities, Regions and States should not just focus on those permittees that have initiated monitoring
programs. When setting priorities, Regions and States should consider, for example, the known or potential impact
of CSOs on sensitive areas, and the extent of upstream industrial user discharges to the CSS.

<TEXT>
 

During the permittee's development of the long-term CSO control plan, the permit writer should promote coordination
between the permittee and State WQS authority in connection with possible WQS revisions. Once the permittee has completed
development of the long-term CSO control plan and has coordinated with the permitting authority the selection of
the controls necessary to meet the requirements of the CWA, the permitting authority should include in an appropriate
enforceable mechanism, requirements for implementation of the long-term CSO control plan, including conditions
for water quality monitoring and operation and maintenance. 


B. NPDES Permit Requirements 


Following are the major elements of NPDES permits to implement this Policy and ensure protection of water quality.



1. Phase I Permits_Requirements for Demonstration of Implementation of the Nine Minimum Controls and Development
of the Long-Term CSO Control Plan


In the Phase I permit issued/modified to reflect this 
Policy, the NPDES authority should at least require permittees to: 
a. Immediately implement BAT/BCT, which at a minimum includes the nine minimum controls, as determined on a BPJ basis
by the permitting authority; 
b. Develop and submit a report documenting the implementation of the nine minimum controls within two years of permit
issuance/modification; 
c. Comply with applicable WQS, no later than the date allowed under the State's WQS, expressed in the form of a narrative
limitation; and

<PARENT> FR940419-2-00087 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

d. develop and submit, consistent with this Policy and based on a schedule in an appropriate enforceable mechanism,
a long-term CSO control plan as soon as practicable, but generally within two years after the effective date of the
permit issuance/ modification. However, permitting authorities may establish a longer timetable for completion
of the long-term CSO control plan on a case-by-case basis to account for site-specific factors that may influence
the complexity of the planning process.

The NPDES authority should include compliance dates on the fastest practicable schedule for each of the nine minimum
controls in an appropriate enforceable mechanism issued in conjunction with the Phase I permit. The use of enforceable
orders is necessary unless Congress amends the CWA. All orders should require compliance with the nine minimum controls
no later than January 1, 1997.



2. Phase II Permits_Requirements
