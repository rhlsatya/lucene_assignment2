Change in Disease Status of Germany Because of Rinderpest and Foot-and-Mouth Disease


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are declaring Germany free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease. Rinderpest has not existed in Germany since
1870 and there have been no outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease since January 1988. This revision will remove the
prohibition on the importation from Germany into the United States of ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat
from ruminants, and will relieve restrictions on the importation from Germany of milk and milk products from ruminants.
This final rule does not relieve restrictions on the importation from Germany of swine and fresh, chilled, and frozen
meat from swine, because Germany has not been declared free of hog cholera and swine vesicular disease.


We are also adding Germany to the list of countries that, although declared free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth
disease, are subject to restrictions on the importation of their meat and other animal products into the United States.
Finally, we are also adding Germany to the list of countries from which the importation into the United States of llamas
and alpacas is restricted.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


The regulations in 9 CFR part 94 (referred to below as ``the regulations'') govern the importation into the United
States of specified animals and animal products to prevent the introduction into the United States of various diseases,
including rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy, African swine fever,
hog cholera, and swine vesicular disease (SVD). These are dangerous and destructive communicable diseases of ruminants
and swine.
Section 94.1(a)(1) of the regulations provides that rinderpest or FMD exists in all countries of the world except
those listed in  94.1(a)(2), which are declared to be free of both diseases.
On January 20, 1994, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 3029-3031, Docket No. 93-159-1) a proposal to add Germany to the list in 
 94.1(a)(2) of countries declared to be free of rinderpest and FMD.
We also proposed to add Germany to the list in  94.11(a) of countries declared free of rinderpest and FMD that
are subject to special restrictions on the importation of their meat and other animal products into the United States.
Additionally, we proposed to add Germany to the list in  94.1(d)(1) of countries in which rinderpest or FMD has
been known to exist and that were declared free of rinderpest and FMD on or after September 28, 1990. All countries in
which rinderpest or FMD has been known to exist and that were declared free of rinderpest and FMD on or after September
28, 1990, must be added to the list. Adding Germany to this list would prohibit the importation or entry of llamas and
alpacas from Germany into the United States, unless in accordance with 9 CFR 92.435.
We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 60-day comment period ending March 21, 1994. We did not receive
any comments. The facts presented in the proposed rule still provide the basis for this final rule.
Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as
a final rule.


Effective Date


This is a substantive rule that relieves restrictions and, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, may be made effective
less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. This rule removes the prohibition on the importation into the United States, from Germany, of ruminants and fresh,
chilled, and frozen meat from ruminants and relieves restrictions on the importation from Germany of milk and milk
products from ruminants. We have determined that approximately 2 weeks are needed to ensure that Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service personnel at ports of entry receive official notice of this change in the regulations.
Therefore, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this rule should
be made effective 15 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

.

Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act


This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866.
For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866.
This rule adds Germany to the list in part 94 of countries declared to be free of rinderpest and FMD. This action removes
the prohibition on the importation into the United States from Germany of ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen
meat from ruminants, and relieves restrictions on the importation from Germany of milk and milk products from ruminants.
This action does not relieve restrictions on the importation of live swine and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat of swine
from Germany because Germany is still considered to be affected with hog cholera and SVD.
Based on available information, the Department does not anticipate a major increase in exports of ruminants and fresh,
chilled, or frozen meat of ruminants from Germany into the United States as a result of this rule.
The value of total U.S. imports of cattle in 1992 was $1.24 billion; U.S. imports of sheep in 1992 totalled about $2 million.
The United States did not import any cattle or sheep from Germany during 1992. In fact, no cattle or sheep were imported
into the United States from any country in Western Europe during 1992 (USDA, National Agricultural Statistical Service
[NASS], Agricultural Statistics Board [ASB] ``Agricultural Statistics, 1992''). Western Europe is not a source
of ruminants for the United States and we anticipate that any increase in the importation of ruminants from Germany
as a result of this rule would have a negligible impact on existing trade patterns.
Currently, due to APHIS restrictions, the United States does not import uncooked meat or meat products from Germany.
In 1991, total meat production in the United States (excluding pork) was just under 10.7 million metric tons, while
total meat production in Germany (excluding pork) was 2.2 million metric tons, about 20 percent of United States production.
It is improbable that Germany would begin to export any significant portion of its meat products to the United States
as a result of this rule. Therefore, we estimate that the effect of this rule on domestic meat prices or supplies would
be insignificant.
Similarily, we do not anticipate a major increase in exports of milk and milk products from Germany into the United
States as a result of this rule. Importation into the United States of all dairy products, except for casein and other
caseinates, is restricted by quotas. Furthermore, while the United States imports more than half of the casein produced
in the world and the regulations allow casein and other caseinates to be imported from countries where rinderpest
or FMD exists (if the importer has applied for and obtained written permission from the Administrator), Germany currently
exports only a small amount of casein to the United States. For example, in 1992, the United States imported 95,000
metric tons of casein worldwide, but only about 2,400 metric tons (2.53 percent of worldwide imports) from Germany.
Consequently, we believe that declaring Germany free of rinderpest and FMD will have no significant effect on the
amount of casein imported into the United States.
The effect of declaring Germany free of rinderpest and FMD on the trade in bovine embryos and semen would also be minimal.
The United States is a net exporter of bovine embryos and semen; in 1991, the value of bovine embryo and semen exports
totalled to $46.5 million and 10.2 million, respectively, while imports amounted to only $2.7 million and $89,159,
respectively. Though similar trade data was not available for Germany, we believe that due to the relatively small
size of the German market, any increase in the export of bovine embryos and semen from Germany would have a minimal impact
on the United States market.
It is not likely that many United States importers, all of whom are considered small entities by Small Business Administration
standards (defined as having fewer than 100 employees), will be interested in importing bovine embryos and semen
from Germany. APHIS expects that the value of any imports will be minimal in comparison to the domestic production
of these entities.
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the regulations for the Standard Requirement for Pasteurella Multocida Vaccine, Avian Isolate,
by increasing from 14 to 16 the minimum number of vaccinated birds out of 20 that must survive infection with virulent


Pasteurella multocida 

for an adequate demonstration of vaccine efficacy. This amendment is necessary to provide greater assurance that
a licensed Pasteurella Multocida Vaccine, Avian Isolate, meets the efficacy standard consumers have come to expect
for this type of product.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


In accordance with the regulations contained in 9 CFR part 113, Standard Requirements are prescribed for the preparation
of veterinary biological products. The Standard Requirement for Pasteurella Multocida Vaccine, Avian Isolate,
in  113.70 states that a minimum of 14 of 20 vaccinates must survive exposure to live bacteria for a successful
demonstration of efficacy. 
On July 13, 1993, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 37670-37671, Docket No. 92-153-1) a proposal to amend the regulations by revising  113.70
to indicate that the minimum number of vaccinated birds out of 20 that must survive exposure to live bacteria for a successful
demonstration of vaccine efficacy is 16. This action was taken to provide greater assurance that a licensed Pasteurella
Multocida Vaccine meets the efficacy standard consumers have come to expect for this type of product. 
We solicited comments on our proposal for a 60-day period ending September 13, 1993. We received one comment by that
date. The comment fully supported the proposed action. Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed
rule, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as a final rule without change. 


Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Department is issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12886. 
This amendment should not have a significant economic impact on manufacturers since the revised efficacy standard
is one that has been readily achieved by all such vaccine licensed in recent years. The change from 14 of 20 to 16 of 20
vaccinated birds surviving exposure to live organisms in order to demonstrate satisfactory protection against
disease will help ensure that consumers receive a highly efficacious vaccine without adding undue cost to the manufacturer.
The revised efficacy standard assures that fewer birds will experience disease when vaccinated with a product that
can still be manufactured at a reasonable cost to the producer. 
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Executive Order 12778 


This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. There are no administrative proceedings which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge
to the regulations under the rule. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


This rule contains no new information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). 


Executive Order 12372 


This program/activity is listed in the category of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to
Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR
part 3015, subpart V.) 


List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 113 


Animal biologics, Exports, Imports, and Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.


 

Accordingly, we are amending 9 CFR part 113 as follows: 


PART 113_STANDARD REQUIREMENTS 


1. The authority citation for part 113 continues to read as follows:

 



Authority:

 21 U.S.C. 151-159; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.51, and 371.2(d).

Alteration of Jet Route J-50 



<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action alters Jet Route

that segment as a direct route. This action will save fuel.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

History 



On December 22, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations 
(14 CFR part 71) to alter Jet Route J-50 located in the vicinity of Lufkin, TX (58 FR 67728). Interested parties
were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA.
No comments objecting to the proposal were received. Except for editorial changes, this amendment is the same as that
proposed in the notice. Jet routes are published in paragraph 2004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298, July 6, 1993). The jet route listed
in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.



The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations alters Jet Route J-50 located in the vicinity of
Lufkin, TX. Currently, there is a small bend in the route between Lufkin, TX, and Alexandria, LA, and this action realigns
Jet Route J-50 as a direct route between these two points. This action will save fuel. 

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains a correction to the final rule published on February 18, 1994, which removed a segment of Jet
Route J-142 between San Simon, AZ, and Socorro, NM. Inadvertently, the segment between Socorro, NM, to Anton
Chico, NM, was removed. This action corrects Jet Route J-142, reflecting the FAA's original intent to remove
only the segment from San Simon to Socorro.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On February 18, 1994, the FAA published a final rule that removed a segment of Jet Route J-142 (59 FR 8131) between
San Simon, AZ, and Socorro, NM. However, that action inadvertently removed the jet route segment from Socorro, NM,
to Anton Chico, NM. This action corrects that mistake by restoring that segment of the route between Socorro, NM, and
Anton Chico, NM, as part of the airspace designation for Jet Route J-142.

Revision to Restricted Area R-2302; Flagstaff, AZ 


<AGENCY>

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action amends Restricted Area R-2302, Flagstaff, AZ, by lowering the designated altitude ceiling 1,000
feet to accommodate an airway between Flagstaff and Peach Springs, AZ. In addition, a controlling agency is added
and an editorial change is made to the using agency.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
History 


On May 1, 1992, the FAA proposed to amend part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 73) by amending the
altitudes and time of designation of R-2302, Flagstaff, AZ, and by adding a controlling agency (57 FR 20066).
Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No negative comments objecting to the proposal were received. Comments were received from
the Arizona Pilots Association supporting the proposal. The notice of proposed rulemaking proposed to amend the
time of designation from ``0800 to 2400 local time, Monday to Saturday'' to ``0700 to 1700 local time, Monday to Saturday;
other times by NOTAM.'' Subsequently, the Department of the Army requested that this amendment be deleted from the
final rule and the original time be retained. Section 73.23 of part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished
in FAA Order 7400.8A dated March 3, 1993. 


The Rule 


This amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends the designated altitudes of R-2302, Flagstaff,
AZ, from ``Surface to 11,000 feet MSL'' to ``Surface to 10,000 feet MSL'' to accommodate an airway between Flagstaff
and Peach Springs, AZ. This action also adds a controlling agency, ``FAA, Albuquerque ARTCC,'' and makes an editorial
change to the using agency from ``Commanding Officer, Navajo Ordnance Depot, Flagstaff, AZ'' to ``U.S. Army, Commander,
Navajo Ordnance Depot, Flagstaff, AZ.'' 
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 


Environmental Review 


In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and the regulations of the Council on Environmental
Quality, the Department of the Army conducted an environmental review of military activities at the Navajo Depot
Activity (NADA), Arizona, associated with the revised restricted area adopted in this rulemaking proceeding. 
After careful and thorough consideration of the facts contained therein, the FAA finds that the airspace action adopted
in these amendments is consistent with existing national environmental policies and objectives as set forth in NEPA
and that it will have no significant impact on the environment.

This amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations reduces the designated altitudes for R-2511 Fort
Ord, CA, from the ``Surface to 5,000 feet MSL'' to the ``Surface to 2,000 feet MSL.'' This amendment also reduces the
time of designation from ``0600-2300 local time Monday-Friday; other times by NOTAM at least 12 hours
in advance'' to ``0700-1900 local time Monday-Friday; other times by NOTAM at least 12 hours in advance.''
As a result of the base closure of Fort Ord, CA, the Department of the Army has determined that there is no longer a military
training requirement to retain R-2511 as currently designated. However, in order to conduct unexploded ordnance
clearing operations at Fort Ord, restricted airspace to 2,000 feet MSL is required. Because this action is a minor
technical amendment in which the public is not particularly interested, I find that notice and public procedure under
5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary. Section 73.25 of part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished in FAA
Order 7400.8A dated March 3, 1993. 
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 


Environmental Review 


This action reduces the designated altitudes of the restricted area and also reduces the time of designation. Accordingly,
this action is not subject to environmental assessments and procedures as set forth in FAA Order 1050.1D, ``Policies
and Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts.''

Revocation of Restricted Area R-2904B Starke, FL 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action revokes Restricted Area R-2904B Starke, FL, and returns the airspace to the National Airspace System.
An FAA Special Use Airspace review determined that this restricted area has not been utilized for hazardous military
activities for an extended period of time. As a result of that review, the U.S. Army has determined that a requirement
no longer exists for retention of the restricted area. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
The Rule 


This amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations revokes Restricted Area R-2904B Starke, FL, because
the area has not been activated for several reporting periods, and the U.S. Army has determined that it no longer has
a requirement for the airspace. This action returns restricted area airspace to the National Airspace System, thereby
increasing the amount of airspace available for use by the flying public. Therefore, I find that notice and public
procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary because this action is a minor technical amendment in which the public
would not be particularly interested. Section 73.29 of part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished
in FAA Order 7400.8A dated March 3, 1993. 
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Change of Time of Designation to Restricted Areas R-6302C and D, Fort Hood, TX 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action amends the time of designation for Restricted Areas R-6302C and R-6302D, Fort Hood, TX, to
more accurately reflect current user requirements for the airspace. This action is taken to provide more efficient
management of the airspace by accurately reflecting the actual times utilized. This action is a result of a Special
Use Airspace Review conducted by the FAA in May 1993. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
History 


On October 22, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 73) by amending
the time of designation of Restricted Areas R-6302C and R-6302D at Fort Hood, TX (58 FR 54531). Interested
parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal
to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. Except for editorial changes, this amendment is the
same as that proposed in the notice. Section 73.63 of part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished in
FAA Order 7400.8A dated March 3, 1993. 


The Rule 


This amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations reduces the time of designation for Restricted Areas
R-6302C and R-6302D, Fort Hood, TX. The FAA conducted a special use airspace review of the Fort Hood Army
Air Field in May 1993. During this review, it was determined that the published time of designation should be amended
to more accurately reflect current user requirements for the airspace. This action reduces the time of designation
of: 1. R-6302C from ``2 hours in advance by NOTAM'' to ``0700-1900 local time, Monday-Friday; other
times by NOTAM;'' and 2. R-6302D from ``0600-2100 local time, daily; other times by NOTAM'' to ``0700-1900
local time, Monday-Friday; other times by NOTAM.'' 
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.


Environmental Review 


This amendment reduces the time of designation of Restricted Areas R-6302C and D. This amendment does not change
either the dimensions or activities currently conducted within the established areas. Accordingly, this action
is not subject to environmental assessments and procedures as set forth in FAA Order 1050.1D, ``Policies and Procedures
for Considering Environmental Impacts.'' 


List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 73

 Affirmation of interim rule as final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are adopting as final rules, without change, interim rules that amend part 206 and subpart G of part 207 of the Commission's
rules to conform its rules of practice and procedure with the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation
Act (``NAFTA Implementation Act''). Final rules under part 206 implement Title III of the NAFTA Implementation Act,
which provides for special safeguard investigations and determinations with respect to Canadian and Mexican articles
during the transition period for tariff elimination under the North American Free Trade Agreement (``NAFTA''),
provide for certain findings with respect to Canadian and Mexican articles in the course of an investigation under
section 202 of the Trade Act of 1974, make certain conforming changes to section 202 of the Trade Act of 1974 with respect
to treatment of confidential business information, and direct the Commission to ``adopt such procedures and rules
and regulations as are necessary to bring its procedures into conformity with chapter 8 of the Agreement.'' Final
rules under subpart G of part 207 implement Title IV of the NAFTA Implementation Act, which provides for issuance of
administrative protective orders for information required to be released in review by a binational panel of United
States antidumping and countervailing duty final 
determinations involving products from Canada or Mexico.

Implantation or Injectable Dosage Form New Animal Drugs; Zeranol


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of a supplemental
new animal drug application (NADA) filed by Pitman-Moore, Inc. The supplemental NADA provides for deletion of the
caution statement in the labeling against the use of a zeranol implant in heifer (suckling beef) calves intended for
reproduction.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pitman-Moore, Inc., 421 East Hawley St., Mundelein, IL 60060, filed a supplemental NADA 038-233 which provides
for deletion of the caution statement in the labeling against the use of a zeranol implant in heifer (suckling beef)
calves intended for reproduction, and to approve its use with stated limitations. The supplemental NADA is approved
as of March 30, 1994, and the regulations are amended by revising  522.2680 (21 CFR 522.2680) to reflect the approval.
The basis for approval is discussed in the freedom of information summary.


In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and  514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21
CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval
of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm.
1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), this
approval for use in food-producing animals qualifies for 3 years of marketing exclusivity beginning March 30, 1994,
because the supplemental NADA contains a report of a new clinical investigation (other than a bioequivalence or residue
study) essential to the approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant. The 3 years of marketing exclusivity
applies only to the change in the labeling for which the supplemental NADA was approved (deletion of the caution statement
in the labeling against the use of zeranol in heifer (suckling beef) calves intended for reproduction).
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an






environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. 


List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 522


Animal drugs.
Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food
and Drugs and redelegated to the Center for Veterinary Medicine, 21 CFR part 522 is amended as follows:

Pesticide Tolerances for Clopyralid




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document reestablishes the time-limited tolerances for residues of the herbicide clopyralid (3,6-dichloro-2-pyridinecarboxylic
acid) in or on the raw agricultural commodities (RACs) field corn, grain at 1.0 part per million (ppm); field corn,
fodder at 10.0 ppm; and field corn, forage at 3.0 ppm; and in or on the processed agricultural commodities (PACs) field
corn, milling fractions at 1.5 ppm. DowElanco requested these time-limited tolerances. The time-limited tolerances
expire on December 31, 1996. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of March 11, 1994 (59 FR 11573), pursuant to petitions from DowElanco, EPA proposed to establish time-limited tolerances
under sections 408 and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346a and 348) for residues of the herbicide
clopyralid (3,6-dichloro-2-pyridinecarboxylic acid) in or on the raw agricultural commodities (RACs) field corn,
fodder at 10.0 ppm; field corn, forage at 3.0 ppm; field corn, grain at 1.0 ppm; and on the processed agricultural commodity
(PAC) field corn, milling fractions at 1.5 ppm. 


There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

The data submitted relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerances will protect the public
health. Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by these regulations may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulations deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's

Redevelopment of Spectrum To Encourage Innovation in the Use of New Telecommunications Technologies



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

By this Memorandum Opinion and Order (MO&O) the Commission refines and clarifies the rules and policies adopted
to make spectrum available for emerging telecommunications technologies. The 

MO&O

 adopts rules to complete a regulatory framework for relocating fixed microwave operations where necessary to implement
services using emerging technologies in the 2 GHz bands. This action is necessary to provide 2 GHz spectrum for future
wireless communications services while preventing disruption to incumbent 2 GHz fixed microwave licensees. This
action facilitates future authorizations of a broad range of new wireless communications services that employ emerging
technologies.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a summary of the Commission's Memorandum Opinion and Order adopted March 8, 1994, and released March 31, 1994.
A summary of the Second Report and Order (Second R&O) and Third Report and Order (Third (R&O) that were reconsidered
in the MO&O may be found at 58 FR 49220 (September 22, 1993) and 58 FR 46547 (September 2, 1993), respectively. This
action will not add to or decrease the public reporting burden. The full text of this Commission decision is available
for inspection and copying during regular business hours in the FCC Reference Center (room 239), 1919 M Street NW.,
Washington, DC. The complete text of this decision also may be purchased from the Commission's duplication contractor,
International Transcription Service, (202) 857-3800, 2100 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20037.



Summary of Memorandum Opinion and Order





1. The MO&O effects changes to the rules to further the Commission's goals of providing for the fair and equitable
sharing of 2 GHz spectrum by new services and the existing fixed microwave services that currently use these frequencies,
and for the relocation of existing 2 GHz facilities to other spectrum where necessary. The rules provide licensees
of services using emerging technologies with access to 2 GHz frequencies in a reasonable timeframe, while at the same
time preventing disruption to existing 2 GHz operations and minimizing the economic impact on the existing licensees.






2. The MO&O responds to twelve petitions for reconsideration or clarification that address a variety of issues
related to Commission decisions in the Second R&O and Third R&O. The modifications and clarifications adopted
conclude the Commission's actions to allocate spectrum that can be used for emerging technologies. Such new technologies
are expected to contribute to the development of the national information infrastructure and serve the need for ubiquitous
wireless access to voice and data communications, thus providing new services to the public, creating new jobs, and
fostering effective competition in the global market.




3. In the Second R&O, the Commission adopted minimum digital data rates for each channel bandwidth of the higher
fixed microwave bands made available for relocation of incumbents to ensure efficient use of these bands. The Commission
adopted a 3.5-year transition period ending June 1, 1997, after which all new equipment for these bands must meet the
specified date rates. Further, to minimize the use of equipment that does not meet the new efficiency standards, the
Commission prohibited the manufacture or importation of such equipment after July 15, 1994.



4. In the MO&O the Commission states that it is persuaded by the petitions for reconsideration that the July 15,
1994 deadline may unduly burden those manufacturers that recently have developed products that comply with the old
rules, particularly if the manufacturer maintains a low or ``zero'' inventory. Therefore, the Commission concludes
that the deadline should be extended two years, to July 15, 1996. Changing the deadline will provide manufacturers
flexibility in discontinuing product lines that do not meet the new standard but will maintain the Commission's goal
to change to more spectrum-efficient equipment within a reasonable time period. The Commission leaves the 3.5-year
transition period unchanged because it believes that this period is reasonable. Therefore, the Commission will
continue to require that all equipment applied for, authorized, and placed in service after June 1, 1997, meet the
efficiency requirements adopted in the Second R&O.

5. In the Second R&O, the Commission reallocated five bands above 3 GHz to the private operational and common carrier
fixed microwave services on a co-primary basis and adopted specific channelization plans for each band. The Commission
also adopted changes in parts 21 and 94 of its rules that allowed variances to the channeling plans. Specifically,
the Commission stated that ``Fixed systems licensed, in operation, or applied for in the 6525-6875 and 10,550-10,680
MHz bands prior to July 15, 1993 are permitted to use channel plans in effect prior to that date, including adding channels
under those plans.''

6. The Commission believes that using the adopted frequency pairings will facilitate efficient use of the spectrum.
However, the Commission recognizes that there will be locations, especially in congested areas, where new links
cannot be coordinated if the new frequency pairings are used but which could be coordinated if a frequency pair inconsistent
with the new rules could be used. Therefore, the Commission will consider on a case-by-case basis authorizing frequency
pairings inconsistent with the rules upon a significant showing that the adopted frequency pairing plan would preclude
the requested link. Additionally, the Commission has included language in  21.701(m) similar to  94.15(d)
to provide for these unique situations. Further, as already provided in the rules, systems existing in the subject
bands prior to July 15, 1993 may modify existing links and add new links under the old frequency pairing plans. However,
the Commission encourages use of the new frequency plan wherever possible because its use generally will provide
for the most efficient use of the spectrum.

7. In the Second R&O, the Commission concluded that the existing 20 MHz channeling plan for the 3.7-4.2 GHz
band should not be modified. This decision was made to protect existing satellite operations that share this band
with the point-to-point fixed microwave service. The Commission authorized private fixed microwave licensees
in addition to common carrier licensees to use the band under the existing channeling plan. However, the channeling
plan published in the Second R&O inadvertently reflected a 280 MHz separation between transmit and receive frequencies.
In the MO&O, therefore, the Commission is correcting the channeling plan to reflect the original 20 MHz separation
between transmit and receive frequencies.

8. The Second R&O did not designate the 6425-6525 MHz band, currently allocated to the fixed service and
used for common carrier Local Television Transmission Service (LTTS), for point-to-point fixed service to accommodate
incumbent 2 GHz fixed microwave users that would be required to relocate. In its petition, Western Tele-Communications,
Inc. (WTCI) requested that the Commission issue a Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making to allocate the 6425-6525
MHz band for general common carrier use.

9. The Commission believes that the LTTS provides a useful service and that sharing this band with fixed microwave
operations would significantly restrict the usefulness of this band for LTTS operations. Further, the Commission
believes that the five bands it has provided in this proceeding will accommodate both incumbent fixed microwave operations
that must be relocated from the 2 GHz bands and future fixed microwave growth. Consequently, the Commission will not
initiate a Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making proposing to reallocate this band for general common carrier use.

10. In its petition for reconsideration, Comsearch requested the Commission to reconsider the maximum power authorized
in the 4, 10, and 11 GHz bands and the antenna standards for the 6 GHz band. WTCI requested that the Commission reconsider
the ATPC rules and allow for up to a 10 decibel (dB) increase in power, instead of the 3 dB adopted.

11. The Commission agrees with the petitioners that the technical rules governing fixed microwave operations in
these bands should be reviewed and updated to reflect advances in technology as well as recent changes in our regulatory
structure. However, it believes these issues are best addressed in a proceeding dedicated to that purpose rather
than being addressed in piecemeal fashion in this and other proceedings. Therefore, the Commission is deferring
consideration of technical issues regarding maximum authorized power, antenna standards, and ATPC to a future proceeding.

12. In the First R&O, the Commission exempted licensees of incumbent public safety facilities from involuntary
relocation. In the Third R&O, it clarified the definition of public safety. The Commission's purpose in each
decision was to ensure that essential safety of life and property communications services are not disrupted or otherwise
disadvantaged.

13. The Commission concludes on its own motion that it would be in the public interest to subject all incumbent facilities,
including public safety, to mandatory relocation if an emerging technology provider requires the spectrum. Of particular
concern is providing adequate spectrum for operation of new licensed PCS services in major urban areas where there
are a large number of incumbent public safety fixed microwave facilities and operation of unlicensed PCS devices.
It has been recognized by incumbent fixed microwave and PCS interests alike that it will not be possible for PCS and
fixed microwave to operate in the same geographic area on the same frequency without interfering with each other.
Upon review, and after considering these additional comments, the Commission is now convinced that PCS service may
be precluded or severely limited in some areas unless public safety licensees relocate. Allowing all public safety
facilities to remain in the band indefinitely would defeat the Commission's primary goal of providing usable spectrum
for the implementation of emerging technologies.

14. The Commission believes that certain public safety entities warrant special consideration because previously
they have been excluded from involuntary relocation and because of the sensitive nature of their communications.
Therefore, it is adopting for the public safety entities previously exempted from mandatory relocation a relocation
plan consisting of a four year voluntary negotiation period followed by a one-year mandatory negotiation period.
This policy, summarized below, will not disadvantage incumbent public safety operations required to relocate.


_All relocation costs will be paid entirely by the emerging technology licensee. These costs included all engineering,
equipment, and site costs and FCC fees, as well as any reasonable additional costs.
_Relocation facilities must be fully comparable to those being replaced.
_All activities necessary for placing the new facilities into operation including engineering and frequency coordination
must be completed before relocation, including engineering and frequency coordination.
_The new communications system must be fully built and tested before the relocation itself commences.
_Should the new facilities in practice prove not to be equivalent in every respect, within one year the public safety
operation may relocate back to its original facilities and stay there until complete equivalency (or better) is attained.




15. In the Third R&O, the Commission clarified the definition of public safety licensees operating 2 GHz facilities
that would receive special treatment in the relocation process. The facilities within this exception were defined
as those part 94 facilities licensed on a primary basis under  90.19 Police Radio Service;  90.21 Fire
Radio Service;  90.27 Emergency Medical Radio Service; and subpart C of part 90, Special Emergency Radio Services;
and on which a majority of communications are used for police, fire, or emergency medical services operations involving
safety of life and property. Additionally, licensees of other part 94 facilities licensed on a primary basis under
the eligibility requirements of part 90, subparts B and C, may request similar special treatment upon demonstrating
that the majority of the communications carried on those facilities are used for operations involving safety of life
and property. The Commission's purpose in providing special treatment in the relocation process to some licensees
was to ensure that essential safety of life and property communications services are not disrupted.

16. The Commission continues to believe that special treatment in the relocation process should be reserved for only
those facilities as defined above. Special treatment in the relocation process for facilities that provide only
limited communications for safety of life and property would negatively impact implementation of services employing
new technologies. Accordingly, the Commission will maintain its definition of public safety facilities subject
to the extended relocation period addressed above.

17. In the Third R&O, the Commission authorized the grant of tax certificates for any sale or exchange of property
made in connection with voluntary agreements to relocate fixed microwave facilities during the designated two-year
period for voluntary negotiations between incumbents and emerging technology providers. This policy was authorized
to further the Commission's policy of encouraging voluntary agreements to relocate fixed microwave facilities
during the initial two-year period. However, the Commission agrees with commenters that tax certificates should
be used to facilitate incumbent relocation from the band designated for unlicensed PCS devices and in geographic
areas that are not developed by emerging technologies within the two-year voluntary negotiation period. Accordingly,
the Commission is modifying its policy to authorize the grant of tax certificates to incumbent fixed microwave operators
that negotiate voluntary agreements during either the voluntary or mandatory negotiation period. The Commission
will not grant tax certificates to incumbents forced to relocate or that reach agreements after the mandatory negotiation
period.

18. In the Third R&O, the Commission adopted a policy of generally not permitting incumbent microwave operations
to relocate within the 2 GHz band. While such relocation could be accomplished in many cases by making modifications
to the incumbents' existing equipment, such as retuning it to another nearby frequency, the Commission concluded
that allowing relocation within the band for other fixed microwave facilities would not be in the public interest
because in most cases the incumbent licensee eventually would be required to move to another band. Any such intervening
relocation would increase the overall cost of relocating the incumbent fixed microwave facilities; increase the
cost to licensed emerging technology providers by increasing the number of fixed microwave facilities that they
may have to pay to relocate; and burden incumbents with two relocations instead of one. However, recognizing the need
of public safety licensees not to disrupt essential safety of life and property communication services, the Commission
authorized relocation within the 2 GHz band for incumbent public safety facilities upon an adequate showing that
such a relocation would not adversely affect the operations of the public safety incumbent, or any other fixed microwave
incumbent or emerging technology/PCS licensee.

19. The Commission's primary goals in this proceeding are to provide usable spectrum for emerging technologies in
a timely manner and to provide for recommodation of incumbent operations when necessary with a minimum of disruption
to those operations. The Commission believes that it is possible for some degree of sharing to exist between emerging
technologies and fixed microwave operations in these bands, particularly as emerging technologies are developing.
However, the Commission believe that in the long term these bands will be required primarily for emerging technologies,
particularly in urban areas. Therefore, it is inconsistent with the Commission's goals, as a general policy, to encourage
new or relocated fixed microwave use of these bands. Specifically, the Commission believes that returning in general
will be detrimental to its goals, because most retuned fixed microwave facilities ultimately would be required to
move to another band. Further, in cases where the current equipment is incapable of being retuned, it would be necessary
to purchase new equipment, which would result in little saving of time or money in the relocation process.

20. The Commission now believes, however, that some retuning may be practical, particularly in rural areas where
all of the spectrum allocated for emerging technologies may not be needed. It believes that allowing such retuning
would facilitate the clearing of spectrum in these cases and that such clearing may lead to quicker implementation
of PCS services in these bands. Therefore, the Commission will allow relocation within the 2 GHz band where all interested
parties agree to the retuning of the incumbent's facilities. ``All interested parties'' includes the incumbent
licensee, the emerging technology provider or representative requesting and paying for the relocation, and any
emerging technology licensee of the spectrum to which the incumbent's facilities are to be retuned.

21. The Commission is prohibiting any retuning to emerging technology spectrum that is not yet allocated to a specific
new service, specifically, the 1970-1990, 2110-2130, and 2160-2180 MHz bands. It is also not adopting
a specific date for the relocation of all incumbent facilities from the band designated for unlicensed PCS devices,
as requested by Apple Computer. The Commission believes that the relocation framework adopted in this proceeding
is sufficient to allow for a timely relocation of the incumbent facilities from the unlicensed band. However, if it
becomes apparent that additional measures are required by the Commission to facilitate the implementation of unlicensed
PCS, this decision may be reconsidered at that time.

22. In the Third R&O, the Commission stated that a fixed two-year period for voluntary negotiations will commence
with its acceptance of applications for emerging technology services, and a one-year mandatory negotiation period
for unlicensed spectrum will commence when an unlicensed equipment supplier or representative initiates a written
request for negotiation with a specific licensee. The transition framework adopted in this proceeding attempts
to balance the need to provide usable spectrum for emerging technologies as quickly as possible against causing disruption
to the incumbent operations. We believe the two-tier negotiation process provides incumbents with adequate protection
in the relocation process, even in rural areas where spectrum may not be required immediately for emerging technologies.
Therefore, the Commission continues to believe that in order to facilitate the implementation of PCS in a timely manner,
the two-year voluntary negotiation period should begin in all areas upon the receipt of applications for the emerging
technology service. However, to avoid ambiguity as to the exact date on which the voluntary negotiation period will
begin, the Commission will issue a public notice specifying this date. The Commission also notes that this period
is for voluntary negotiations; and, therefore, that incumbents are not required to negotiate until licensees have
been designated, if they so choose.

23. With regard to Apple's request to clarify which negotiation period is applicable when it is necessary for a PCS
licensee or representative of the unlicensed devices to negotiate with a fixed microwave licensee whose operations
are in spectrum adjacent to that of the PCS provider, the Commission concludes that the transition schedule of the
entity requesting the move will apply. For example, if a representative for unlicensed devices needs to relocate
a fixed facility that is operating in spectrum allocated for licensed PCS, the transition schedule for spectrum allocated
for unlicensed devices (one-year mandatory) will apply.

24. In the Third R&O, the Commission stated that its staff is working with the National Telecommunications and
Information Administration (NTIA) to establish procedures to accommodate in the adjacent government fixed service
band at 1710-1850 MHz those non-government 2 GHz fixed microwave facilities that technically cannot be accommodated
in higher bands. The Commission noted that NTIA has agreed to provided limited, condition access to government spectrum
on a case-by-case basis.

25. The Commission's staff is continuing to work with NTIA to make government spectrum available for relocation of
existing 2 GHz operations. Further, the Commission believes NTIA will make a good faith effort to accommodate as many
as possible of the links recommended for relocation by the Commission. The Commission will request that special consideration
be given to reaccommodating links that are technically difficult to accommodate elsewhere, including those that
operate in bands allocated for unlicensed services, those of public safety services, and those that require long
paths.

26. AMSC Subsidiary Corporation (AMSC) requested that the relocation rules adopted in this proceeding not apply
to the 1970-1990 and 2160-2180 MHz bands. AMSC stated that these bands were allocated internationally
at the 1992 World Administrative Radio Conference to the mobile satellite service (MSS) and plans to petition to have
them allocated to MSS domestically in the near future. AMSC argued that the relocation rules adopted in this proceeding
were developed for local markets and terrestrial technologies and that they may not be feasible for MSS, which operates
nationwide or, in some cases, worldwide.

27. This proceeding establishes relocation rules for the emerging technologies bands and does not address what types
of services should be authorized in these bands. Other rule making proceedings, such as 2 GHz PCS, address specific
services. Thus, AMSC's request is beyond the scope of this proceeding and therefore is not being adopted, but may be
considered in a later proceeding that addresses MSS.

 21.50 

Transition of the 2.11-2.13 and 2.16-2.18 GHz bands from Domestic Public Fixed Radio Services to emerging
technologies.



(a) Licensees proposing to implement services using emerging technologies (ET Licensees) may negotiate with Domestic
Public Fixed Radio Service licensees (Existing Licensees) in these bands for the purpose of agreeing to terms under
which the Existing Licensees would relocate their operations to other fixed microwave bands or to other media, or
alternatively, would accept a sharing arrangement with the ET Licensee that may result in an otherwise impermissible
level of interference to the existing licensee's operations. ET Licensees may also negotiate agreements for relocation
of the Existing Licensees' facilities within the 2 GHz band in which all interested parties agree to the relocation
of the Existing Licensee's facilities elsewhere within these bands. ``All interested parties'' includes the incumbent
licensee, the emerging technology provider or representative requesting and paying for the relocation, and any
emerging technology licensee of the spectrum to which the incumbent's facilities are to be relocated.

(b) Domestic Public Fixed Radio licensees in bands allocated for licensed emerging technology services will maintain
primary status in these bands until two years after the Commission commences acceptance of applications for an emerging
technology services, and until one year after an emerging technology service licensee initiates negotiations for
relocation of the fixed microwave licensee's operations or, in bands allocated for unlicensed emerging technology
services, until one year after an emerging technology unlicensed equipment supplier or representative initiates

provider or representative of unlicensed device manufacturers to negotiate with a fixed microwave licensee with
operations in spectrum adjacent to that of the emerging technology provider, the transition schedule of the entity
requesting the move will apply.

Elimination or Revision of Certain Reporting Requirements for Communication Common Carriers and Certain Affiliates



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission has adopted a Report and Order (``Order'') eliminating the requirement that common carriers file
pension and benefits documents. The Order also revises the revenue threshold for certain affiliates to file the Securities
and Exchange Commission Annual Form 10-K reports with the FCC. The FCC issued this Order to fulfill its obligation
to review reporting requirements as they meet current regulatory needs. The change will result in savings to the public
by reducing industry reporting burdens and to the Commission by reducing the cost of processing these filings and
maintaining them in storage.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This is a summary of the Commission's Report and Order, CC Docket No. 93-5, adopted April 7, 1994, and released
April, 1994. The full text of this Commission's decision is available to inspect and copy during normal business hours
in the FCC Dockets Branch (room 231), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC. The full text of this decision may also be purchased
from the Commission's copy contractor, ITS, Inc. 2100 M Street NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857-3800.



In the Order, the Commission eliminates Section 43.42, Reports on pensions and benefits that communications common
carriers with annual revenues of $100 million or more file with this Commission. Because the laws that provide for
the oversight of pension plans and the generally accepted accounting principles applicable to pension have brought
about a greater degree of uniformity in the process of estimating and accounting for pension and benefit costs, the
Commission has concluded that there is no need to require carriers to file the underlying details of their pension
and benefits plans. The Commission can use the pension data currently being reported by the carriers in the Commission's
Automated Reporting and Management Information System.

In the Order the Commission revises Section 43.21(c) to require a communication common carrier that directly or indirectly
controls any communication common carrier that has annual operating revenues in excess of $100 million to file the
Securities and Exchange Commission Annual Report Form 10-K. The Commission concluded that there is no need
to receive financial reports from a controlling company when the controlled communication common carrier does not
have annual operating revenues in excess of $100 million. This revision raises the reporting threshold from $2.5
million to $100 million and makes the reporting threshold  43.21(c) consistent with other part 43 reporting
requirements.

Public reporting burden for the collection of information is estimated to average one hour per response, including
the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,
and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any
other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Federal Communications
Commission, Records Management Division, Paperwork Reduction Project (3060-0514), Washington, DC 20554
and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (3060-0514), Washington, DC 20503.

Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Fuel System Integrity of Compressed Natural Gas Vehicles


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Department of Transportation (DOT).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule establishes a new Federal motor vehicle safety standard, Standard No. 303, 

Fuel System Integrity of Compressed Natural Gas Vehicles, 

that specifies vehicle performance requirements for the fuel system of vehicles fueled by compressed natural gas
(CNG). The Standard enhances the fuel system integrity of CNG vehicles by subjecting the vehicles to crash testing
and placing a limit on the post-crash pressure drop in the fuel system. The Standard specifies frontal, rear, and lateral
barrier crash tests for light vehicles and a moving contoured barrier crash test for school buses with a GVWR over 10,000
pounds. The purpose of this new standard is to reduce deaths and injuries caused by fires resulting from fuel leakage
during and after crashes involving vehicles fueled by CNG.


This is the first final rule in the agency's comprehensive effort to regulate alternative fueled vehicles. In addition
to this final rule, NHTSA anticipates issuing another final rule that will specify performance requirements addressing
the strength, durability, and venting of CNG fuel containers. In addition, as a result of public comments on the CNG
notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), the agency anticipates issuing a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking
(SNPRM) proposing performance requirements that would evaluate a CNG fuel container's internal corrosion, brittle
fracture under low temperatures, external damage, and fragmentation.

I. Background


A. General Information


At standard temperature and pressure, natural gas is a gas that is lighter than air.
 When used as a vehicle fuel, natural gas is typically stored on-board a vehicle in cylindrical containers at a pressure
of approximately 20,684 kPa pressure (3,000 psi). Natural gas is kept in this compressed state to increase the amount
that can be stored on-board the vehicle. This serves, in turn, to increase the vehicle's driving range. Since natural
gas is flammable and is stored under high pressure when used as a vehicle fuel, it poses a potential risk to motor vehicle
safety.




Alternative fuel vehicles powered by CNG have not been numerous to date. The number of CNG vehicles in the United States
has more than doubled from 10,300 in 1990 to 23,800 at the end of 1992. The number of CNG vehicles is projected to again
double to an estimated 50,800 vehicles in 1994.
However, Federal legislation, as well as the need to meet environmental and energy security goals, will lead to increased
production and use of these vehicles. Among the items of Federal legislation encouraging the use of alternative fuels
in general are: (1) The Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988, (2) the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and (3) the Energy
Policy Act of 1992. The Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 directs the Department of Energy to conduct demonstration
programs to encourage the use of alternative motor fuels, including natural gas. As a further encouragement, this
Act also specifies that new passenger automobiles will have their fuel economy calculated according to a special
mileage enhancing procedure. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 establish the clean fuel requirements that treat
fuel type and content, along with vehicle technology, as a potential source of emission reductions. These Amendments
call for programs that will substantially increase the number of low-polluting vehicle/fuel combinations in use.
The Energy Policy Act of 1992 directs the Department of Transportation to issue safety standards applicable to vehicle
conversions.
Executive branch initiatives will also encourage the increased use of alternative fueled vehicles. Executive Order
12844 increased by 50 percent the number of alternative fueled vehicles to be acquired by the Federal Government from
1993 through 1995. (April 21, 1993) In addition, in 1993, the President established the Federal Fleet Conversion
Task Force to accelerate the commercialization and market acceptance of alternative fueled vehicles throughout
the country.


B. Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking


On October 12, 1990, NHTSA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to explore whether the agency
should issue Federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSSs) to promote the fuel system integrity of motor vehicles
using CNG or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as a motor fuel. (55 FR 41561) The ANPRM sought comment about the crash integrity
of vehicle fuel systems, the integrity of fuel storage containers, and pressure relief for such containers.

C. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 



On January 21, 1993, NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in which the agency proposed to establish
a new FMVSS specifying performance requirements for vehicles fueled by CNG (58 FR 5323). The proposal was based on
comments received in response to the ANPRM and other available information. The NPRM was divided into two segments:
(1) Vehicle requirements that addressed the integrity of the entire fuel system, and (2) equipment requirements
that addressed the safety of the fuel containers themselves. 

NHTSA decided to model the proposed requirements for CNG fueled motor vehicles on Standard No. 301, 

Fuel System Integrity.

 Standard No. 301 specifies performance requirements for vehicles that use fuel with a boiling point above 32 
 F (i.e., liquid fuels under standard temperature and pressure). Both gasoline and diesel fuel have a boiling
point above that temperature. Since CNG has a boiling point below 32 
 F, vehicles manufactured to use only CNG are not subject to Standard No. 301. Standard No. 301 limits the amount
of fuel spillage from ``light vehicles''
 during and after frontal, rear, and lateral barrier crash tests and a static rollover test. The Standard also limits
fuel spillage from school buses with a GVWR over 10,000 pounds after being impacted by a moving contoured barrier at
any point and any angle. By adopting a CNG rule based on Standard No. 301, the agency would afford passengers of CNG vehicles
a level of safety comparable to that provided passengers of vehicles fueled by gasoline or diesel fuel. 





NHTSA proposed that the fuel system integrity requirements for CNG vehicles would include frontal, rear, and lateral
barrier crash tests for light vehicles, and a moving contoured barrier crash test for large school buses. The agency
proposed that fuel system integrity would be assessed by measuring the fuel system's post-crash pressure drop, instead
of fuel spillage as under Standard No. 301, since CNG is a gas. The allowable pressure drop for CNG fueled vehicles would
be equivalent, as measured by the energy content of fuel, to the allowable spillage of fuel during Standard No. 301
compliance testing. 

With respect to the ``equipment'' requirements applicable to CNG containers, NHTSA proposed a definition for ``CNG
fuel tank'' and performance requirements for such fuel containers manufactured for motor vehicles, including aftermarket
containers.
 The Agency proposed that the CNG containers would be subject to a pressure cycling test to evaluate durability and
a pressure burst test to evaluate strength. In addition, the NPRM proposed equipment requirements to regulate how
the container may ``vent'' its contents under specified conditions of elevated temperature and pressure. 





II. Comments on the Proposal 



NHTSA received a large number of comments addressing the CNG proposal. The commenters included manufacturers of
CNG containers, vehicle manufacturers, trade associations, other CNG-oriented businesses, research organizations,
State and local governments, the United States Department of Energy, and energy companies. In addition, NHTSA met
with the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) and the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition (NGVC) and had telephone conversations
and meetings with some of the commenters. A record of each of these contacts may be reviewed in the public docket. 

The commenters generally believed that a Federal safety standard regulating the integrity of CNG fuel systems and
fuel containers was necessary and appropriate. In fact, some commenters, including the CGA, the NGVC, and CNG container
manufacturers stated that NHTSA needs to issue a Federal standard as soon as possible to facilitate the safe and expeditious
introduction of CNG fueled vehicles. The commenters generally agreed with most of the vehicle-oriented proposals
including those related to the standard's applicability, the formula used to determine the allowable amount of CNG
leakage, and the barrier crash tests. Nevertheless, commenters were concerned with the inability of commercially
available measuring devices to measure what they viewed as the extremely small pressure drops allowed by the proposal.




III. Agency's Decision 



A. Overview 



In today's final rule, NHTSA is issuing a new Federal motor vehicle safety standard, Standard No. 303, 

Fuel System Integrity of Compressed Natural Gas Vehicles.

 It specifies vehicle performance requirements applicable to the fuel system of a CNG fueled vehicle. As explained
in the NPRM, and summarized above, the fuel system integrity requirements are comparable to those requirements in
Standard No. 301. Like those requirements, the CNG requirements specify frontal, rear, and lateral barrier crash
tests for light vehicles and a moving contoured barrier crash test for school buses with a GVWR over 10,000 pounds.

<TEXT>
 

There are, however, some differences between Standard No. 301 and Standard No. 303. For instance, as noted above,
CNG fuel leakage is determined by the post-crash pressure drop in the fuel system instead of by fuel spillage. The amount
of allowable pressure drop is to be based on the volume of the CNG leakage that either (1) is equivalent in energy content
to the amount of gasoline leakage permitted by Standard No. 301, as calculated by the pressure drop formula
 or (2) 1062 kPa (154 psi), whichever volume is greater. Another difference with Standard No. 301 is that a static rollover
provision has not been included in the CNG Standard because while such a procedure can affect the leakage of a liquid
fuel, it has no affect on the leakage of a lighter-than-air gaseous fuel. 





Each specific issue about the fuel system integrity requirements for CNG vehicles will be discussed later in this
notice. These issues include the applicability of the vehicle requirements, the practicability of measuring small
pressure drops, the test time, the test temperature, leakage from components in the fuel system, evaluating vehicles
that have more than one fuel system, and the test conditions including the test pressure and test gas. The notice also
discusses the agency's decision not to adopt requirements regarding certain matters, including static rollover,
refueling connections, fuel storage retention, venting, leakage detection, and warning devices. 

This rule assures crash integrity of the vehicle which is comparable to that required in Standard No. 301. In addition,
NHTSA recognizes that additional safety precautions may be required because of the unique concerns with high pressure
fuel containers and the failure modes to which they may be subject. Thus, in addition to this final rule, NHTSA has issued
a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) addressing the burst test for CNG containers (58 FR 68846, December
29, 1993). Based on comments to that notice and comments to the January 1993 NPRM, the agency anticipates issuing another
final rule in the near future that will specify requirements regulating a CNG container's strength, durability,
and venting. Moreover, based on comments to the NPRM and other available information, the agency anticipates issuing
a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) that would propose performance requirements addressing a
CNG fuel container's internal corrosion, brittle fracture under low temperature conditions, external damage,
and fragmentation. 



B. Applicability of the Vehicle Requirements 



1. Gross Vehicle Weight Ratings 



NHTSA proposed to apply the CNG Standard to passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, and buses with
a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less, and to school buses, regardless of their GVWR. This applicability is identical to the
applicability of Standard No. 301. In the NPRM, the agency tentatively stated that it would be inappropriate to apply
the fuel leakage limits to CNG vehicles that have a GVWR greater than 10,000 pounds other than school buses, because
barrier crash tests are not currently required for liquid-powered vehicles that have a GVWR over 10,000 pounds other
than school buses. 

Navistar, Amoco, Transportation Manufacturing Corporation (TMC), Chrysler, Thomas Built, and Flxible agreed
with the agency's proposal to apply the CNG vehicle requirements to light vehicles and school buses. Washington State
and Blue Bird commented that non-school buses should be treated the same as school buses and thus be subject to the new
CNG Standard. 

After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has decided to apply Standard No. 303 to light vehicles and to all school buses.
The agency's objective in regulating the fuel system integrity of CNG vehicles is to provide the same level of safety
as that provided by Standard No. 301 for liquid fueled vehicles. Accordingly, the agency has decided to specify the
same applicability for CNG vehicles as Standard No. 301 specifies for gasoline and diesel vehicles. The agency disagrees
with comments favoring the application of the CNG standard to non-school buses with a GVWR over 10,000 pounds. As explained
in the NPRM, NHTSA does not currently include any vehicle over 10,000 pounds, other than school buses, in its crash
test requirements. NHTSA further notes that because the anticipated requirements for CNG fuel containers will apply
to containers equipped on all vehicles regardless of GVWR, CNG-fueled heavy vehicles will be equipped with fuel containers
that have been certified to comply with that equipment standard.

2. Terminology 



NHTSA proposed that the vehicle requirements be 
applicable to vehicles manufactured to operate on CNG-only 
(``dedicated'') vehicles and to vehicles manufactured to operate 
on two fuels, CNG and either gasoline or diesel fuel. The 
agency referred in the NPRM to this latter type of vehicle as 
a ``dual fuel'' CNG vehicle. 

The American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), 
Blue Bird, Oklahoma Gas, and the NGVC commented that the 
agency used the term ``dual fuel vehicle'' incorrectly. These 
commenters explained that the industry's generally understood 
meaning of ``dual fuel vehicle'' is a vehicle that uses a 
mixture of two fuels simultaneously, in this case CNG and 
another fuel such as gasoline or diesel. A vehicle that is 
capable of operating either on CNG and another fuel such as 
gasoline or diesel, but not a mixture of both, is referred to 
as a ``bi-fuel'' vehicle. A vehicle equipped with one fuel 
system and designed to operate on CNG is referred to as a 
``dedicated CNG vehicle.'' 

NHTSA has decided to adopt the generally accepted 
terminology used in the alternative fuel industry for vehicles 
that operate on more than one fuel. Accordingly, the final 
rule includes definitions for ``Bi-fuel CNG vehicle,'' 
``Dedicated CNG vehicle,'' and ``Dual-fuel CNG vehicle.'' The 
agency notes that these definitions are generally consistent 
with the statutory terms in the Energy Policy Act. Section 
403 of that Act amended certain provisions in Title V of the 
Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act, including 
definitions for ``dedicated vehicle'' and ``dual fueled 
vehicles.'' The definitions of these terms in this notice are 
consistent with the statutory provisions. The one difference 
between the agency's definitions and the statutory definitions 
is that the agency's definition of ``bi-fuel'' vehicle also 
falls under the Act's definition of ``dual fueled automobile'' 
(i.e., ``an automobile which is capable of operating on an 
alternative fuel [such as CNG] and on gasoline or diesel)''. 
Nevertheless, the agency believes that it is necessary that 
its definition of ``bi-fuel'' vehicle include the greater 
specificity provided by the industry's definition of this 
term. 



C. Performance Requirements 



1. Allowable Pressure Drop 



a. 

Regulatory background.

 In the ANPRM, NHTSA discussed the possibility of proposing a prohibition against any fuel leakage during the 
crash test and for up to 30 minutes after the vehicle's motion 
had ceased. A number of commenters to the ANPRM objected to a 
no-leakage requirement, claiming that any pressurized gaseous 
fuel system will produce a minimal amount of leakage from 
fittings and valves. Along with their concerns about 
practicability, commenters further stated that a no-leakage 
requirement would be overly restrictive in comparison to 
Standard No. 301. That standard permits a minimal amount of 
leakage. 

After considering the comments on the ANPRM, NHTSA 
decided that instead of proposing a no-leakage requirement, it 
would propose allowing not more than a minimal level of 
leakage for a specified time period. The allowable leakage 
provision was patterned after Standard No. 301 and was 
intended to avoid the practicability problems associated with 
a no-leakage requirement. The agency believed that the 
allowable amount of leakage is equivalent in energy content to 
the leakage allowed for gasoline in Standard No. 301. 

Under the proposal, CNG leakage from the vehicle's entire 
fuel system would have been measured for a 15-minute period 
following a barrier crash test. The proposal discussed two 
alternatives related to measuring the allowable leakage: (1) 
Leakage would be measured through incremental measurements 
from the time of impact until the vehicle ceased motion, for 
the subsequent five-minute period, and every minute in the 
next 10-minute period, or (2) the cumulative leakage would be 
measured only once, at the end of the 15-minute test period. 
With either measurement, the total gas permitted to leak at 
the end of the test period would have been the same. The 
agency requested comment on the feasibility and practicability 
of specifying gaseous leakage measurements at specific time 
intervals and about devices that are capable of measuring 
incremental pressure changes.

NHTSA received many comments about the proposal to 
evaluate a CNG vehicle's fuel system integrity through an 
allowable pressure drop requirement. Among the issues 
addressed by commenters were (1) practicability problems with 
measuring small levels of pressure drop, (2) the appropriate 
length of time necessary to evaluate pressure drop, (3) the 
effect of temperature variations on pressure drop, (4) leakage 
from fuel system components, (5) and evaluating bi-fuel and 
dual fuel vehicles. Each of these issues will be addressed 
below, along with the agency's response to the comments. 

b. 

Problems with measuring small pressure drops.

 
AAMA, Thomas, Navistar, TMC, NGVC, Minnesota Gas, and 
Flxible stated that the proposal about allowable pressure drop 
would result in manufacturers trying to measure amounts of gas 
leakage too small to be measured by existing technology. They 
stated that presently manufactured measuring devices known as 
pressure transducers do not have the capability to measure the 
proposed amounts of pressure drop, even if only one cumulative 
measurement is taken after 15 minutes. AAMA stated that a 
state-of-the-art capacitance type pressure transducer has an 
accuracy of 0.11 percent. Therefore, it believed that if this 
pressure transducer has a range of measurement of 0 to 20,685 
kPa (0 to 3000 psi), the error associated with any measurement 
would be 

#22.8

 kPa (

#

3.3 psi). AAMA further stated that a 
variation in 5.6
  Celsius (10
  Fahrenheit) could result in 
errors of 

#

41.4 kPa and 

#

31.0 kPa (

#

6.0 and 

#

4.5 psi) from 
thermal zero shift and thermal coefficient sensitivity, 
respectively. Finally, AAMA stated that the conversion of 
analog data to digital form would introduce an error of 0.056 
percent or 

#

11.0 kPa (

#

1.6 psi). Aggregating all these 
alleged measurement errors would result in a potential error 
of 

#

106.1 kPa (

#

15.4 psi). AAMA further stated that it is 
contrary to accepted engineering measurement practice to 
accurately measure data that are of the same order of 
magnitude as known transducer data system errors. Thus, it 
stated that the total measurement error should not exceed 10 
percent of the value being measured and that given the above 
mentioned errors, pressure drops under 1062 kPa (154 psi) 
should not be measured with a capacitance type transducer. 
AAMA evaluated the error estimates for a less accurate type of 
pressure transducer than the capacitance transducer (the 
strain gage transducer) and obtained a maximum error of 

#


328.2 kPa (

#

47.6 psi). 

Based on these comments about the accuracy and 
practicability of using measurement transducers, NHTSA has 
independently determined that current pressure transducers are 
not able to measure the relatively small pressure drops that 
would have been allowed to occur after 15 minutes for a 
container with a 3000 psi service pressure. The agency found 
that most pressure transducers have an accuracy of 
approximately 0.1 percent, and now concludes that it would 
have been impracticable to measure the proposed pressure drop 
levels. 

In view of the problems in measuring small pressure 
drops, NHTSA has modified the allowable pressure drop 
requirement so that the pressure drop of a CNG vehicle must 
not exceed the amount calculated by the pressure drop formula 
or a pressure drop level of 1062 kPa (154 psi), whichever is 
greater. As noted above, 1062 kPa (154 psi) is the cumulative 
potential error (

#

106.1 kPa (

#

15.4 psi)) of a capacitance type 
transducer, multiplied by 10 (i.e., 

#

22.8 kPa (

#

3.3 psi) 
associated with measurement error, 

#

72.4 (

#

10.5 psi) 
associated with temperature variation, and 

#

11.0 kPa (

#

1.6 
psi) associated with data conversion). Both a 22.8 kPa (3.3 
psi) and a 72.4 kPa (10.5 psi) range would result in a 
significant percentage of the allowable amount of leakage 
during a 15-minute period, particularly for vehicles with 
large fuel systems. The agency believes that by modifying the 
requirement to specify a floor under the amount of permissible 
pressure drop determined using the pressure drop formula, the 
agency will be able to regulate pressure loss from CNG 
vehicles to the extent permitted by existing pressure drop 
measurement technology. 

NHTSA notes that establishing a floor under the amount of 
permissible pressure drop is especially important for vehicles 
with large fuel systems, such as school buses, because they 
will experience extremely small pressure drops. This is so 
because in the formula for calculating the allowable pressure 
drop, pressure drop equals the ambient temperature divided by 
the volume of the fuel system. Since the fuel system volume 
is the denominator, the allowable pressure drop decreases as 
the vehicle's fuel system volume increases. Without the 
floor, the formula would yield pressure drops potentially too 
small to be measured.

In response to Blue Bird's recommendation that the regulation allow a five percent drop after the barrier crash test,
NHTSA is concerned that this approach would allow varying amounts of fuel leakage from different vehicles depending
on the fuel system's size. Therefore, the agency has decided to reject Blue Bird's recommendation. 

c. 

Test time.

 NHTSA received nine comments addressing the appropriate test time for the pressure drop requirement. Of the nine
commenters, Washington, NGV Systems, Navistar, and NGVC stated that a cumulative measurement should be taken after
15 minutes because the amount of gas leaking each minute would be too small to measure accurately. They believed that
taking incremental measurements within the 15 minute period would not be acceptable. Other commenters, including
AAMA, Thomas, TMC, and Blue Bird stated that even the cumulative leakage over 15 minutes would be too small to measure
in some cases. Blue Bird stated that the proposed leakage limit was ``totally unacceptable'' because it would be necessary
to detect a pressure drop of 0.6 psi in a 3000 psi fuel system. AAMA stated that measurement of the pressure drop 60 minutes
after impact would be reasonable and should be adopted by the agency based on the limitations of available measurement
equipment, since the proposed leakage rate would result in a total pressure drop of 211 psi for a 3000 psi, 170 liter
(45 gallon) fuel system. 

Given the problems with measuring the proposed levels of allowable pressure drop, NHTSA has decided to change the
pressure drop requirement to make it more measurable while keeping it as close to a no-leakage requirement as practicable.
The agency considered two alternative changes to the proposal to ensure that the level of pressure drop was practicable
to measure: (1) Increase the amount of CNG leakage allowed during the proposed 15 minute test period or (2) increase
the test time period. The agency has decided to reject the option of increasing the level of allowable leakage to the
point that even marginal violations of the leakage limit could be reliably measured at the end of a 15 minute period.
Such an increase might be unsafe and would be inconsistent with the agency's goal of establishing a minimum leakage
requirement that is as close to a no-leakage requirement as possible while still being readily measurable. 

Instead, to accomplish its goal of establishing a safe and practicable requirement, NHTSA has decided to increase
the test time from 15 minutes to 60 minutes. The agency has determined that it is necessary to lengthen the test period
to permit measurement of safe levels of leakage. To illustrate, a container with a service pressure of 3000 psi and
an allowable pressure drop of approximately 50 psi after 15 minutes, would have an allowable pressure drop of 200 psi
after 60 minutes. Since the agency has determined that it is not possible to reliably measure a pressure drop of less
than 154 psi within a 10 
 F temperature variation, then the agency's original goal of prohibiting a pressure drop of more than 50 psi in
15 minutes would not be practicable. Accordingly, the agency determined that it is necessary to lengthen the test
period or else the only detectable violations would be gross violations of the pressure drop limit. Small violations
of the limit would not be detectable. Moreover, while a pressure drop of 50 psi in 15 minutes could not be reliably measured,
a pressure drop of 200 psi (4 x 50 psi=200 psi in 60 minutes (4 x 15 minutes=60 minutes) is readily measurable.
While those two pressure drops are equally stringent since the leakage rate is essentially constant for a marginal
violation, only the 60 minute period would permit measurable results. 

By increasing the test time to 60 minutes, the agency believes that the requirement will allow only readily measurable
and safe amounts of leakage. The agency believes that increasing the test time from 15 minutes to 60 minutes will not
result in an increase in leakage rate. As explained above, if the limit and the time are proportionately increased
the same extent, the stringency is maintained. Increasing the test time will not increase the safety risk since the
rate of CNG leakage is still equivalent, in terms of energy content, to that allowed of liquid fuels in Standard No.
301. In addition, the leakage rate is more critical than the total level of leakage over an extended period of time,
since CNG dissipates rapidly because it is lighter than air.

d. 

Test temperature.

 In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed a formula in which the volume of allowable CNG leakage would translate into certain allowable
pressure drops in units of kPa for CNG fuel systems, as follows: 


 



where 



T=Temperature of the test gas in degrees Kelvin, stabilized to ambient temperature prior to testing. 

V

FS

=The internal volume in liters of the fuel system from which CNG is leaked.

 



In the NPRM, NHTSA also considered but decided not to propose specifying an ambient temperature. The agency believed
that not specifying an ambient temperature would not affect a vehicle's compliance with the standard and would facilitate
the combining of tests for various standards. The agency requested comments about its tentative decision not to specify
an ambient temperature. 


Several commenters, including AAMA, NGVC, Navistar, Blue Bird, Minnesota Gas, Flxible, and Thomas, addressed the
issue of ambient temperature variability. NGVC, Minnesota Gas, Thomas, and Blue Bird agreed with the agency that
no ambient temperature should be specified. Nevertheless, all the commenters, except for Thomas, stated that temperature
variations should be compensated for when conducting the crash test. AAMA stated that temperature variations that
occur over the course of the testing would change the pressure of the test gas. It stated that a 5.6 
 C (10 
 F) variance in the test temperature would result in a 413.7 kPa (60 psi) change in the pressure of the test gas in
a 170 liter (45 gallon) fuel container. AAMA stated that a pressure change due to a temperature change could mask or
intensify the actual pressure drop measurement. However, AAMA did not suggest any method to correct for the temperature.



After reviewing the comments, NHTSA continues to believe that no ambient temperature should be specified for the
reasons set forth in the NPRM. However, the agency also believes that the test procedure and formula should control
for temperature variations. Without such control, a large change in temperature could artificially affect the test
results. NHTSA has decided to specify that the maximum ambient temperature variation over the 60-minute test period
cannot exceed 


5.6 
 C (10 
 F). A temperature variation exceeding this amount will invalidate the test results. The agency believes that
this test condition will minimize changes in test gas temperature and instrumentation accuracy during the 60-minute
period, without placing an unreasonable burden on those performing the test. 




In addition, NHTSA has decided to include in the pressure drop formula a provision to calculate the average ambient
temperature by measuring the ambient temperature at the test's start and then every 15 minutes until 60 minutes has
elapsed. The sum of these temperatures is then divided by five (the number of measurements taken) to yield the average
ambient temperature. This calculation will be used for the term, ``T,'' in the agency's pressure drop formula. NHTSA
believes that including a calculation for the average ambient temperature in the formula will directly control for
fluctuations in pressure due to temperature variations, because pressure and temperature are linearly related
in the formula (i.e., pressure equals temperature multiplied by a constant, where the constant includes the volume
of the system and the compressibility factor).

AAMA recommended that testing be conducted between 60
  and 70 
 F. Blue Bird commented that the test conditions specify a permissible temperature range of between 0 
 C and 32 
 C (32
  to 90 
 F) to eliminate testing at unusually low or high temperatures. It believed that controlling such 
temperature extremes could reduce variables that affect vehicle and fuel system reactions to crash tests. 

After reviewing the comments and other available information, NHTSA has decided that prohibiting ambient temperature
variation by more than 10 
 F during the 60-minute period after testing will be sufficient to minimize pressure drop variability due to
temperature change. However, the agency has decided not to specify a minimum or maximum temperature for the 60-minute
period after testing. This will facilitate the combining of tests for various standards. In addition, specifying
a range like the one recommended by AAMA 
would be inappropriate for those vehicle manufacturers that conduct their compliance crash testing outdoors throughout
the year. 

e. 

Leakage from fuel system components.

 In the NPRM, NHTSA discussed two alternatives regarding measurement of CNG leakage after a barrier crash test. Under
the first alternative, the allowable CNG leakage level would 
apply to the vehicle's entire fuel system, instead of the fuel storage containers only. The agency proposed that the
term ``fuel system'' be defined as ``all components used to store or supply CNG to the vehicle's engine.'' This approach
would have required a manufacturer to measure the internal volume of the vehicle's entire fuel system, including
the lines, components, 
and fuel storage containers as the basis for evaluating allowable leakage. Under the second alternative, the allowable
CNG leakage would only apply to the CNG fuel container or containers. This approach would have required a 
manufacturer to measure the volume of the fuel storage containers only. The agency tentatively preferred the first
alternative, believing that it would more closely reflect a real world crash. The agency was concerned that the second
alternative would permit unlimited leakage from the vehicle's plumbing system including fuel lines and other components
downstream from the fuel containers during a crash test. 

Nine commenters addressed the issue of what components of a fuel system should be evaluated for leakage. Navistar,
NGV Systems, Flxible, CNG Pittsburgh, Washington, and Amoco supported measuring leakage from the entire fuel system.
AAMA, Thomas, and Minnesota Gas stated that leakage should be 
measured from the fuel containers to the first pressure regulator, an area which is known as the high pressure side
of the fuel system. Minnesota Gas stated that, while the fuel lines, connections, and valves may be the most vulnerable
part of a fuel system, the volume of gas in these parts is small 
when compared to the gas volume stored in the fuel containers. Thomas stated that the volume of the gas in the fuel lines
and valves between the containers and engine is negligible. AAMA stated that adding pressure transducers to points
in the fuel lines solely for purposes of conducting the test would produce points of potential leakage that would not
exist on a non-test vehicle. This would make the test vehicles potentially unrepresentative of the vehicle population.
AAMA recommended that to minimize the potential leakage points, one pressure check point be used immediately upstream
from the high 
pressure regulator, or at a location specified by the manufacturer. 

After reviewing the comments and other information, NHTSA has decided to measure leakage only from the high pressure
portion of the fuel system. By ``high pressure portion'' of a CNG fuel system, the agency means all the components from
and including the CNG fuel container or containers up to, but not including, the first pressure regulator. The agency
notes that as CNG flows from the vehicle fuel containers to the engine, it passes through one or two pressure regulators
that reduce the pressure of the gas before it enters the engine. On a carbureted type vehicle, there may be one or two
pressure 
regulators. For systems with two pressure regulators, the first pressure regulator typically reduces service fuel
line pressure from 3000 psi to approximately 300 psi, while the second regulator reduces pressure from this level
to approximately ambient pressure. 

When the agency proposed to regulate leakage from the entire fuel system, it was not aware of the significant difficulty
involved in accurately measuring small amounts of leakage. In addition, the volume of gas in the fuel lines and valves
is very small when compared to the volume of the fuel 
containers. For instance, Thomas stated that a school bus with six CNG fuel containers has 822 liters of CNG (137 liters
per container x 6). By comparison, the volume of that bus' plumbing system (e.g., fuel lines, valves, etc.) is 0.62
liters. Thus, the volume of CNG in the plumbing system is 
approximately 0.075 percent of the entire fuel system. Therefore, possible leakage from the plumbing system would
be minimal and therefore not a significant safety concern. Thus, contrary to the agency's belief in the NPRM, measuring
the entire fuel system would not be much more representative of 
real world crashes than measuring the fuel system's high pressure portion. Another reason that the agency decided
not to measure leakage from the entire fuel system is that using additional transducers would have resulted in the
test vehicles having more points of potential leakage than non-test vehicles, as pointed out by AAMA.

f. 

Bi-fuel and dual fuel applicability

. In the ANPRM, NHTSA discussed whether dual-fuel vehicles should be treated differently than dedicated CNG vehicles.
Some commenters recommended that dual-fuel vehicles have separate fuel system integrity tests based on each of the
fuels used in the particular vehicle. Under this approach, dual-fuel vehicles would be tested twice: once under current
Standard No. 301 as though they operated only on gasoline or diesel fuel and a second time under the proposed CNG standard
as though they operated only on CNG. 

In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that the energy equivalency of the allowable fuel leakage from dual-fuel vehicles be the
same as that for dedicated vehicles. The agency disagreed with commenters to the ANPRM that recommended running two
separate tests. The agency believed that approach would result in an allowable level of total fuel leakage for dual-fuel
vehicles that is twice what is currently permitted under Standard No. 301 or what the agency proposed to establish
for CNG vehicles. In the NPRM, the agency explained that since a 
real world crash could cause both fuel systems to leak, safety concerns associated with dual-fuel vehicles would
be best addressed by establishing a single, overall fuel leakage limit applicable to the combined energy equivalency
of the amount of both types of fuel leaked in a single crash test. 

Six commenters addressed the most appropriate way to regulate the safety of dual-fuel and bi-fuel vehicles. While
NFPA, CNG Pittsburgh, and NYCFD agreed with the proposal to require that dual-fuel vehicles comply with a single overall
fuel leakage limit based on the combined energy level of both 
fuel types, AAMA, Blue Bird, and Brunswick disagreed. AAMA, Blue Bird, and Brunswick theoretically agreed with the
concept of establishing a combined energy level. However, they stated that because the allowable leakage would be
cut in half if the agency adopted the proposal, applying this criterion would 
make both CNG and liquid fuel leakage unmeasurable. 

After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has decided to require only one test on dual-fuel and bi-fuel vehicles that permits
the amount of gaseous leakage specified in the CNG standard 

plus

 the amount of liquid leakage specified in Standard No. 301. Ideally, the agency would have preferred to adopt the proposed
approach that would have kept the combined energy equivalency at an amount consistent with dedicated vehicles. However,
as discussed in an earlier section, the practicability problems with measuring low levels of CNG leakage using current
technology makes that approach 
impracticable. Along with being practicable, the requirement, as adopted, will reduce the test costs incurred by
manufacturers since only one test will have to be run. In addition, NHTSA notes that the allowable leakage levels for

liquid fuels under Standard No. 301 and CNG each approximate a ``no leakage'' condition. 



D. Test Conditions 



1. Test Pressure 



In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that CNG fuel storage containers be tested at 100 percent of service pressure. The agency
believed that this test condition would be consistent with Transport Canada's fuel system integrity standard for
CNG vehicles. In addition, this is the pressure at which the container is designed to operate when filled with the gaseous
fuel at 20 
 C (68 
 F). 

The proposal to specify 100 percent of service pressure level departed from the requirement in Standard No. 301 specifying
that gasoline fueled vehicles be tested at a level of between 90 to 95 percent of capacity. In the proposal, the agency
noted that unlike gaseous fuels, gravity and vehicle 
attitude play important roles in determining the amount of leakage experienced by a liquid fuel. The fuel fill level
is not as critical a test condition for liquid fuels. In contrast, while leakage of gaseous fuels is influenced by the

level of pressure inside a ruptured fuel system, it is not influenced by the vehicle's attitude or gravity. Based on
these considerations, NHTSA decided to propose that the containers be tested at the maximum fill level (i.e., 100

percent of service pressure) to simulate a worst case accident situation for CNG vehicles. 

Six commenters addressed the appropriate service pressure at which the CNG containers would be tested. Minnesota
Gas, CNG Pittsburgh, and Washington agreed with the agency's proposal to test at 100 percent of service pressure.

Minnesota Gas agreed with the proposal because it would be consistent with Transport Canada. AAMA, Navistar, and
Thomas stated that some tolerance should be allowed, given practicability concerns. Thomas recommended that a tolerance

range of about three percent should be allowed (i.e., 

#

90 psi on a container with a 3000 psi service pressure.) AAMA recommended a range for fill level between 95 percent to
100 percent, because it believed that temperature in a CNG container may rise significantly as it is filled and that
some time would be required for pressure and temperature to stabilize.

NHTSA has decided to specify the fill level to be at 100 percent of the service pressure. After reviewing the comments,
the agency considered allowing a fill level of between 95 percent to 100 percent of service pressure. However, allowing
a fill level of 95 percent of the service pressure (i.e., 2850 psi for a 3000 psi container) would result in a less stringent
condition before the crash test. Thus, the agency would no longer be testing a worst case situation. The agency acknowledges
that a container will need additional time to stabilize when achieving a 100 percent fill condition. However, the
agency believes that it is necessary to allow for this additional time since including a testing tolerance would affect
the requirement's stringency. The agency further notes that including a 100 percent fill condition is consistent
with Transport Canada's standard for fuel system integrity.



2. Test Gas



In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed to specify nitrogen (N

2

) as the test gas. In determining the appropriate test gas, NHTSA sought one that adequately represents CNG, is safe
during crash tests and provides a common baseline from which to derive all leakage measurements. The agency decided
to propose using nitrogen as the test gas because both nitrogen and CNG are lighter than air and thus would disperse
upward into the air through any rupture in the fuel system instead of pooling in cavities of the fuel system or falling
to the ground. The agency believed that a volume of nitrogen that is leaked as a test gas would be equal to the same volume
of CNG that leaks. In addition, nitrogen is readily available and is safer than CNG for crash tests because it is neither
flammable nor toxic.

Seven commenters addressed the issue of test gas. Of those commenters, six agreed with the agency's proposal to specify
nitrogen as a test gas. Thomas Built requested that dry air be used as a test gas but offered no rationale. NGV Systems
stated that the vehicles should be tested with the fuel with which it will operate.

After reviewing the comments and other available information, NHTSA has decided to specify that nitrogen be the test
gas during crash tests of CNG vehicles. Notwithstanding Thomas Built's request to allow dry air, the agency has decided
not to specify dry air as an alternative test gas, even though it has properties similar to nitrogen. The agency believes
that the test results will be more consistent and enforcement will be facilitated by permitting only one test gas.
As indicated by the majority of commenters addressing this issue, NHTSA believes that nitrogen is stable and readily
available and therefore should be specified in the Standard. This decision is consistent with Standard No. 301 which
specifies the use of Stoddard Solvent as the single test liquid, and Transport Canada's standard for CNG fuel system
integrity which specifies the use of nitrogen as a test gas.

The type of test gas is relevant to calculating the allowable pressure drop, since the compressibility factor, ``Z,''
is included in the formula. In the NPRM, NHTSA estimated that the compressibility of nitrogen is 1.00. However, AAMA
commented that a compressibility of 1.05 is more accurate for the conditions the test gas will be under when tested
in the fuel containers (approximately 20,685 kPa (3,000 psi) and 21.1
 C (70
 F)). Upon further review, NHTSA agrees with AAMA that the appropriate compressibility factor is 1.05.



3. Electric Shutoff Valves



In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that ``if the vehicle has an electrically driven fuel pump that normally runs when the vehicle's
electrical system is activated, it is operated at the time of the barrier crash.'' The agency also proposed that ``Any
shutoff valve at the fuel tank is in the open position.'' In this latter statement, the agency was referring to manual
shutoff valves, and not those which may be electrically operated.

AAMA commented that requiring the crash test to be conducted with shutoff valves held open would be incompatible with
the vehicle's normal operation during a crash sequence and with the intent of the standard. AAMA stated that vehicles
equipped with manual shutoff valves at each fuel tank should have these valves in the fully open position during vehicle
testing. However, electric shutoff valves should be handled in a manner consistent with other electrical devices
such as an electric fuel pump.

After reviewing the comment, NHTSA concurs and believes that if the vehicle has electrically operated shutoff valves
that are normally open when the electrical system is activated, then they must be open at the time of the crash test.
The agency believes that the vehicle test conditions should simulate, to the extent practicable, the conditions
present in a real world crash. This is the same rationale used in having electrically activated fuel pumps in operation,
before the crash test in Standard No. 301.



E. Requirements Not Adopted



1. Static Rollover



In the NPRM, NHTSA decided not to propose a static vehicle rollover test for dedicated CNG vehicles. The agency explained
that a rollover requirement is only needed for liquid fuel vehicles (including dual-fuel and bi-fuel vehicles) because
leakage is a function of gravity and the location of the rupture relative to the fuel. Without a rollover test, a rupture
in the fuel system above the level of the liquid fuel would not be detected. In contrast, CNG is pressurized and would
quickly escape upon rupture of the fuel system. Thus, for a CNG fuel system, any leakage would be unaffected by vehicle
attitude or gravity.

NHTSA received three comments addressing whether to include a static vehicle rollover requirement. Navistar and
Washington State agreed with the agency's proposal that such a test was not needed. The New York City Fire Department
(NYFD) believed that a rollover requirement was necessary since some CNG containers may be mounted on the vehicle's
roof.

NHTSA continues to believe that a static rollover test is not needed for the reasons set forth in the NPRM. The agency
notes that NYFD may have misinterpreted the rollover requirement that was under consideration. The agency was considering
a static rollover requirement like the one in Standard No. 301 in which after crash testing, the vehicle is rotated
on its axis to determine leakage. The agency was not considering a dynamic rollover test in the context of the CNG rulemaking.



2. Refueling Connections



In the NPRM, NHTSA decided not to propose requirements regarding the standardization of refueling connections,
notwithstanding comments to the ANPRM advocating such an approach. These commenters believed that specifying certain
connector sizes would prevent over-pressurization during refueling. NHTSA believed that it was not necessary to
regulate this area because the potential safety risks associated with over-pressurization of the fuel storage containers
are addressed through the proposed container venting requirements (bonfire test) discussed above. NHTSA further
believed that voluntary actions by industry will address most, if not all, of the problems raised by commenters. The
agency also believed that the issues raised by commenters to the ANPRM, with the exception of overfilling the fuel
storage containers, did not present significant safety concerns.

NHTSA received 12 comments addressing the need to standardize the refueling connections. EDO, Flxible, and Tecogen
agreed with the agency's rationale for not including requirements for refueling connections. Nine commenters believed
that NHTSA should adopt a requirement for refueling connections. AAMA, NGVC, and several natural gas companies believed
that NHTSA should adopt NGV-1. NGV-1 is a voluntary standard being developed by the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI)/Canadian Gas Association Standard for Compressed Natural Gas Vehicle Fueling Connection
Devices. Ontario recommended that the agency should specify the universal use of a single maximum filling pressure
of 20,685 kPa (3000 psi). It believed that such standardization would reduce the safety risk and promote international
harmonization.

After reviewing the comments, NHTSA continues to believe that Federal regulation is not needed with respect to the
refueling connection devices. As explained in the NPRM, the agency continues to believe that problems associated
with filling fuel containers do not present significant safety concerns. Moreover, the agency continues to believe
that the proposed bonfire test, which the agency is considering for CNG containers, addresses potential safety risks
associated with over-pressurization. In addition, the agency believes that refueling connections present an issue
that is peripheral to the agency's focus of fuel system integrity as determined by crashes. Notwithstanding this
decision, the agency will continue to monitor the safety of refueling connections to determine if future agency action
is needed.



3. Venting



In the ANPRM, the agency discussed requiring that all pressure relief mechanisms be vented to the outside of the vehicle,
away from the passenger, luggage, or other compartments that could expose vehicle occupants to the gaseous fuel.
However, after considering comments to the ANPRM, NHTSA decided not to propose a venting requirement. The agency
believed that such a requirement would be unnecessarily design restrictive in view of the wide variations among vehicle
designs and models. In addition, the agency noted that CNG used in motor fuel applications would have an odor that would
warn vehicle occupants of the presence of escaping gas.

NHTSA received comments from the California Highway Patrol (CHP) and Washington State about venting requirements.
CHP stated that venting is necessary to ensure safety, but did not elaborate. Washington State stated that gaseous
fuels could accumulate when a school bus is parked or when air circulation is inadequate. While it believed that such
accumulation could be explosive, the commenter provided no data to indicate the extent of the alleged safety problem.

After reviewing the comments, NHTSA continues to believe that it is not necessary or appropriate to specify venting
requirements in the CNG vehicle standard. The agency notes that there are no data to verify that gases accumulate under
vehicles or otherwise pose a safety problem that could be alleviated if a venting requirement were adopted. In addition,
the agency believes that exposure to an ignition source would be unlikely for a parked vehicle. 



4. Leak Detection 



In the NPRM, NHTSA requested comments about whether to require a sensing device to detect unacceptable levels of gaseous
leakage from the fuel system and to provide a warning to vehicle occupants. The notice posed questions about the need
for and types of warning devices, the amount of fuel in the air that would activate a warning device, and the availability,
cost, and reliability of such a device. 

NHTSA received 11 comments about warning or leakage detection devices. EDO, CNG Pittsburgh, Oklahoma Gas, Minnesota
Gas, Navistar, Thomas, Brooklyn Union Gas, Flxible, and NGVC stated that no requirement was necessary. Several commenters
stated that a detection device was not needed because CNG is odorized and thus readily detected by the human nose. Therefore,
according to these commenters, a vehicle's occupants or bystanders would be able to detect any CNG leakage. Two commenters,
Washington State and the Metropolitan Suburban Bus Authority (MSBA), favored a requirement for the detection and
warning of fuel leakage. However, neither commenter elaborated about the need for such a requirement. 

After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has determined that a requirement applicable to detecting or warning about fuel
leakage is not necessary. The agency agrees with those commenters who noted that CNG is odorized and thus is readily
detectable. 



5. Retention of Fuel Storage Containers




In the NPRM, NHTSA decided not to propose a specific requirement for container retention. This decision was based
on the agency's belief that manufacturers would need to design container retention characteristics in order for
their CNG vehicles to meet the allowable leakage limits specified for the crash tests. 

Nine commenters addressed whether the agency should specify a container retention requirement. Of the commenters,
AAMA, Navistar, and NGV Systems agreed with the agency's decision not to include a container retention requirement.
Manchester commented that such a requirement would pose problems. Five commenters, the General Services Commission
(GSC), the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), Flxible, NGVC, and CNG Pittsburgh, disagreed with the agency's
decision not to include a container retention requirement. GSC stated that CNG fuel containers should be surrounded
by a strong metal cage to prevent the container from breaking loose. Alternatively, GSC recommended that the agency
require an internal excess-flow shutoff valve that would prevent loss of fuel if the external valving ruptured. Several
commenters stated that container detachment was important and could be prevented by adopting NFPA 52.
 NFPA further stated that fuel container breakaway could occur without fuel leakage if an excess flow valve or an automatic
shutoff valve were actuated during a crash. The container could then cause injury to the occupants or damage the vehicle.






After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has decided not to adopt a requirement regulating the retention of fuel storage
containers. The agency believes that fuel container retention does not pose a safety problem, as long as a manufacturer
produces its vehicles to comply with the standard's leakage requirements. If a CNG fuel container did break away from
the vehicle, NHTSA believes that it is highly likely there would be a fuel leak which would not be able to comply with
the barrier crash test's leakage requirement. 



F. Other Considerations 



1. Vehicles Manufactured In More Than One Stage 



In the NPRM, NHTSA tentatively concluded that it would be practicable for final stage manufacturers of multi-stage
vehicles to comply with this proposed rule. The agency reasoned that because the vehicle requirements in the proposed
rule only involve those vehicles currently covered under Standard No. 301, final stage manufacturers are already
subject to similar dynamic crash test requirements. NHTSA requested comment on the agency's tentative conclusion
that final stage manufacturers could comply with the proposed requirements and provide the requisite level of safety.
NHTSA requested comments about the effect of this rule on final stage manufacturers. 

Twelve commenters addressed the issue of how this rule would affect vehicles manufactured in more than one stage.
Blue Bird, Thomas, Navistar, Washington State, CNG Pittsburgh, CHP, and Chrysler stated it would be appropriate
for the proposed requirements to apply to multi-stage vehicles. In contrast, four commenters_the National Truck
Equipment Association (NTEA), NGV Systems, Ontario, and Niagara Mohawk Power Company_believed that the new standard
should not apply to vehicles manufactured in more than one stage. These commenters were most concerned about how a
final stage manufacturer could certify compliance to the Standard without performing crash tests.

<TEXT>
 

NHTSA is aware of the concerns of final stage and intermediate stage manufacturers about crash testing their vehicles.
The agency notes that its regulations already provide that certification of an incomplete vehicle can pass through
to the final stage manufacturer, provided that the final stage manufacturers take the necessary precautions to ensure
they do not invalidate the certification. More specifically, the final stage manufacturers must ensure that they
complete the vehicle without exceeding the GAWRs, altering any fuel system component, moving the center of gravity
of the completed vehicle with the body installed outside the envelope of specifications provided by the chassis manufacturer,
or otherwise violating that envelope. If the final stage manufacturer takes care to comply with all of the chassis
manufacturer's specifications, the final stage manufacturer will not have to recertify the vehicle. 

If the final stage manufacturer decides not to comply with the specifications to the extent that the vehicle, in its
final form, differed significantly from what was anticipated by the chassis manufacturer in specifying the envelope,
and the basis for the incomplete vehicle manufacturer's certification was thus no longer valid, then the final stage
manufacturer will have to accept the responsibility for certification. 

Pass-through certification is also not available for vehicles built on chassis lacking sufficient components to
be certified as an incomplete vehicle. Some of the manufacturers that build these vehicles may be small businesses
that may be unable to conduct their own crash tests. 

NHTSA notes that while manufacturers must certify that their vehicles meet all applicable safety standards, this
does not necessarily mean that a manufacturer must conduct the specific tests set forth in an applicable standard.
Certifications may be based on, among other things, engineering analyses, actual testing, and computer simulations.


Moreover, a manufacturer need not conduct these operations itself. Manufacturers can utilize the services of independent
engineers and testing laboratories. They can also join together through trade associations to sponsor testing or
analysis. Finally, they can rely on testing and analysis performed by other parties, including the CNG container
manufacturers. The container manufacturers typically perform extensive analyses and tests of their products and,
in order to sell those products, will have a strong incentive to provide their customers, the vehicle manufacturers,
with information that can be used to certify the vehicle to the applicable standard. Based on the above discussion,
NHTSA does not believe that the requirements pose any significant certification burdens for the final stage manufacturers
or other small manufacturers. 



2. Benefits 



In the NPRM, NHTSA estimated the benefits from a CNG vehicle standard by comparing them to the benefits from Standard
No. 301. The proposal referred to a NHTSA technical report on Standard No. 301's effect on motor vehicle fires in traffic
crashes. That report estimated that Standard No. 301 has reduced fires in all passenger car crashes by 14 percent.
(``Motor Vehicle Fires in Traffic Crashes and the Effects of Fuel System Integrity Standard,'' DOT HS 807 675, November
1990.) The NPRM also discussed information submitted by NFPA about 1984-1988 annual average automobile fire
rates to the docket (Docket No. 73-20-N15-027). These data contain information on the number of
fires in passenger cars by type of material first ignited (gasoline, LP-gas, or natural gas). However, the agency
stated that there were limitations with using these data, and thus they could not be used to enable the agency to determine
the fire rate of CNG and LPG vehicles in comparison to gasoline fueled vehicles. 

Notwithstanding these limitations, NHTSA estimated in the NPRM the number of fires in CNG vehicles, assuming they
have the same fire rate as gasoline powered vehicles. Based on Standard No. 301 fire rates and on one Department of Energy
scenario of projected on-road alternative fuel vehicles, by fuel type, the agency estimated that there could be 1,690
fires in CNG vehicles in the year 2010.

<TEXT>
 

NHTSA received only two specific comments about the 
benefits of the proposed rulemaking to establish requirements 
for CNG vehicles. Both Atlantic Research Corporation and NGVC 
commented that the agency's assumption about estimating future 
CNG vehicle fires is flawed because it assumes that CNG 
vehicles will have the same fire rate as gasoline powered 
vehicles. Both commenters stated that the fuel systems and 
the fuel flammability characteristics are completely different 
and thus would result in much lower fire rates for CNG 
vehicles. 
NHTSA acknowledges the favorable flammability 
characteristics of CNG relative to gasoline. CNG is lighter 
than air, and therefore should quickly dissipate upward. At 
the same time, however, CNG is under high pressure onboard the 
vehicle in contrast to conventional fuels. This high pressure 
could make a crash situation more volatile. However, without 
real-world crash data on CNG vehicles, no conclusions can be 
drawn. In assuming that CNG vehicles had the same fire rate 
as gasoline vehicles, the agency wished to provide some 
estimate of benefits, given the lack of real world accidents 
because of the relatively few CNG vehicles on the road. 
NHTSA analyzed data submitted by the American Gas 
Association (AGA) on 8,000 natural gas fleet vehicles. Based 
on vehicle miles travelled (VMT) during a three-year period, 
the fire rate for CNG vehicles is 2.52 per 100 million VMT, 
compared with a gasoline vehicle fire rate of 1.87, or 35 
percent higher. However, the agency notes that the small 
sample does not allow a reliable analysis of the crash fire 
potential in CNG vehicles. With seven fires, the standard 
errors or the fire rates for these CNG vehicles are too big to 
make meaningful comparisons between CNG-equipped vehicles and 
their gasoline counterparts. While the agency does not have 
the data to determine comparable fire rates between gasoline 
and CNG vehicles, the benefits of this final rule are obtained 
by ensuring at least equivalent safety with gasoline vehicles. 


3. Costs 


In the NPRM, NHTSA estimated that testing associated with 
the proposed vehicle requirements would cost approximately 
$58,530-$63,080 per CNG body style. The agency estimated 
that the cost to perform a frontal, lateral or rear impact 
test would be $5,000 (with a total cost of $15,000 for three 
tests). The cost of the vehicle, which is destroyed during 
the test, is approximately $13,160 ($39,480 for the three 
vehicles to be used in the three tests). Thus, the total 
vehicle testing costs would be approximately $54,480. The 
agency requested comments about the costs of complying with 
the proposed requirements. 
NHTSA received two comments that addressed the cost of 
implementing fuel system integrity requirements for CNG 
vehicles. Navistar and Blue Bird stated that the agency 
underestimated the costs associated with testing school buses 
to the new CNG standard. Each stated that the cost associated 
with purchasing and testing school buses was substantially 
higher than the NPRM's estimate. Navistar estimated that for 
a six fuel tank design school bus, the costs would be as 
follows: chassis_$35,000, six fuel containers at $1,200 
each_$7,200; six fuel container cages at $150 each_$900; 
associated valves, tubes, fittings, etc. $1,000; crash testing 
at $12,000 per test ($36,000 for three tests). Navistar 
stated that a minimum of two school buses and six crash tests 
would be needed for a total of at least $160,000. Blue Bird 
estimated that vehicle costs are in the range of $75,000 to 
$85,000 and each test costs approximately $15,000. It further 
stated that test costs could be several hundred thousand 
dollars per vehicle configuration given that multiple impact 
tests are often necessary to document conformance to a 
standard that requires impacts at any point and angle. If 
Blue Bird performed six tests on two school buses, the total 
cost would range from $240,000 to $260,000. 
After reviewing the comments, NHTSA believes that the 
cost estimates provided by Navistar and Blue Bird are 
reasonable. Thus, the total cost of testing school buses 
would be $160,000 per chassis and $260,000 for a school bus. 
NHTSA continues to believe that its estimate of $54,480 for 
light vehicles is still appropriate. 


4. Leadtime 


In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed to make the vehicle 
requirements effective on September 1, 1994. The agency 
believed that this would provide a reasonable time period for 
manufacturers to make any vehicle modifications required by 
the rulemaking. Nevertheless, the agency stated that the 
proposed dynamic vehicle crash test requirements could make it 
necessary for vehicle manufacturers to make significant design 
modifications in order to comply with the proposal, especially 
since most CNG vehicles are currently manufactured in 
accordance with NFPA Standard 52. That standard specifies 
design-oriented requirements and does not specify a barrier 
crash test. The agency requested comment on the feasibility 
of this effective date.

<TEXT>
 

NHTSA received nine comments about the proposed effective 
date. Blue Bird, Flxible, and Navistar agreed with the 
proposed effective date of September 1, 1994. Flxible's 
agreement with the agency's proposed effective date was 
contingent upon the agency adopting its recommendations in the 
final rule. Navistar believed that the effective date should 
be earlier if possible. 
AAMA, the United States Department of Energy, NGV 
Systems, Volvo GM, and CNG Pittsburgh did not agree with the 
effective date proposed by the agency. NGV Systems, Volvo GM, 
and CNG Pittsburgh stated that the proposed effective date 
would be difficult to meet but did not recommend a specific 
date. AAMA and the U.S. Department of Energy recommended an 
effective date of September 1, 1995. However, AAMA's 
recommendation was contingent upon its recommendations being 
incorporated in the final rule. AAMA further stated that an 
earlier effective date would not be reasonable or practicable. 
In contrast, the NGVC, the CGA, and CNG container 
manufacturers have informed the agency that they want a CNG 
fuel integrity standard to be effective as quickly as 
possible. In addition, they favor having an opportunity to 
``voluntarily certify compliance'' to the standard once the 
final rule is published. The CNG industry groups believe that 
it is necessary for a Federal standard to be in place as soon 
as possible given the expected increased demand for CNG 
vehicles in light of Federal and State fleet programs for 
clean fuel vehicles. They also favor quick adoption of a 
Federal standard to preempt state regulations that otherwise 
may be promulgated and to ensure that substandard CNG vehicles 
are not marketed. 
After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has decided to 
set an effective date of September 1, 1995. NHTSA is fully 
aware that the NGVC and CGA, which represent the natural gas 
industry, favor what amounts to an immediate effective date. 
Nevertheless, the agency believes that a leadtime of at least 
one year is necessary given that vehicle manufacturers will be 
required to certify compliance to an entirely new set of 
dynamic crash requirements. In the meantime, prior to the 
standard's effective date, the industry is free to market 
vehicles as meeting the CNG vehicle standard that takes effect 
in 1995. Manufacturers have taken this approach with respect 
to the agency's side impact requirements and air bag 
requirements. Therefore, to the extent feasible, the agency 
encourages manufacturers to manufacture their CNG vehicles to 
meet these new requirements before the date the standard takes 
effect. 




V. Rulemaking Analyses 


A. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940425-0-00042 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940425-0-00018 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action 
under Equal Opportunity 12866 and the Department of Transportation's 
regulatory policies and procedures. This rulemaking document 
was reviewed under Equal Opportunity 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and 
Review.'' This action has been determined to be ``significant'' 
under the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies 
and procedures because of the significant public and 
Congressional interest in the rulemaking. NHTSA has estimated 
the costs of the amendments in a Final Regulatory Evaluation 
(FRE) which is included in the docket for this rulemaking. As 
discussed in that document, NHTSA estimates that testing 
associated with the vehicle requirements will cost 
approximately $54,480 for light vehicles. More generally, the 
agency believes that the cost of the final rule is mostly 
testing costs and the benefits are derived by ensuring an 
equivalent level of safety with gasoline vehicles. 


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


NHTSA has also considered the effects of this rulemaking 
action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Based upon the 
agency's evaluation, I certify that this rule will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. Information available to the agency indicates that 
currently there are very few businesses manufacturing 
passenger cars or light trucks for CNG use. The agency 
further believes that as the market expands for CNG vehicles, 
original vehicle manufacturers will begin to produce CNG 
vehicles because they will be able to do so at less expense 
than final stage manufacturers and alterers. Few, if any, 
original vehicle manufacturers which manufacture CNG vehicles 
are small businesses. 


C. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism) 


NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action in accordance 
with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 
12612. NHTSA has determined that the rule will not have 
sufficient Federalism implications to warrant the preparation 
of a Federalism Assessment. Nevertheless, the agency wishes 
to elaborate about its preemptive authority with respect to 
Federal motor vehicle safety standards given comments on the 
NPRM about potentially inconsistent State law. 
The AAMA and the NGVC/AGA stated that a Federal standard 
was necessary to preempt possible State and local regulations 
addressing CNG vehicles. AAMA stated that_



Because the U.S. Energy Policy Act will require that 
both Federal and state governments become mandated 
``fleet customers'' of alternative fuel vehicles, AAMA 
is apprehensive about the potential promulgation of 
a plethora of state alternate fueled vehicle 
regulations, each slightly different from one 
another, with an imposed standard or an alleged 
higher standard than the finalized applicable 
federal safety standard. In such a circumstance, 
there would appear to be no federal preemption 
protection for the vehicle manufacturer. It is, 
therefore, conceivable that to market these mandated 
alternate fuel vehicles, numerous vehicle versions 
would have to be designed, manufactured, and 
certified.

 

Similarly, NGV/AGA expressed concern that State authorities 
may initiate different or more stringent standards for CNG 
systems. It was particularly concerned that NHTSA cannot 
preempt separate regulation of vehicles procured by State 
governmental agencies. 
As both commenters are aware, section 103(d) of the 
National Traffic and Motor Safety Act sets forth NHTSA's 
preemptive authority as follows: 
Whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard 
established under this title is in effect, no State 
or political subdivision of a State shall have any 
authority either to establish, or to continue in 
effect, with respect to any motor vehicle or item of 
motor vehicle equipment any safety standard 
applicable to the same aspect of performance of such 
vehicle or item of equipment which is not identical 
to the Federal standard. Nothing in this section 
shall be construed as preventing any State from 
enforcing any safety standard which is identical to 
a Federal safety standard. Nothing in this section 
shall be construed to prevent the Federal Government 
or the government of any State or political 
subdivision thereof from establishing a safety 
requirement applicable to motor vehicles or motor 
vehicle equipment procured for its own use if such 
requirement imposes a higher standard of performance 
than that required to comply with the otherwise 
applicable Federal standard. 
Pursuant to this statutory provision, once Standard No. 
303 takes effect, no State or local government can have a 
standard in effect addressing the fuel integrity of CNG 
vehicles unless that standard is identical to Standard No. 
303. Nevertheless, the statute permits a State to issue 
higher performance standards for CNG vehicles procured for the 
State's own use, notwithstanding AAMA's desire for the Federal 
government to preempt States from doing so. In other words, 
NHTSA has no authority to prevent States from issuing more 
stringent standards for vehicles procured
