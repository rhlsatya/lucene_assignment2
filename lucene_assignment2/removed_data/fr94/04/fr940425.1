Federal Crop Insurance Corporation





Nursery Crop Regulations



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) proposes to amend the Nursery Crop Insurance regulations, effective
for the 1995 and succeeding crop years, by making a change in the policy to clarify the method of determining loss.



The Nursery policy contains the term ``said damaged crop'' which has been interpreted, in some forums, to refer to
the specific damaged portion of the crop instead of the unit as was the intent.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This action has been reviewed under USDA procedures established by Departmental Regulation 1512-1. This action
does not constitute a review as to the need, currency, clarity, and effectiveness of the regulations affected by this
rule under those procedures. The sunset review date established for these regulations is October 1, 1997.




In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.), the information collection or record-keeping requirements included in this interim rule can be found in 7 CFR
part 400, subpart H.

It has been determined under Executive Order 12612, Federalism, that the policies and procedures contained in this
rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions, or on the distribution of
power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.

This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.450.

This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation
with State and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115, June 24,
1983.

Kenneth D. Ackerman, Manager, FCIC, has certified to the OMB that these regulations meet the applicable standards
provided in subsections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.

This rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this rule will preempt state
and local laws to the extent such state and local laws are inconsistent herewith. The administrative appeal provisions
located at 7 CFR part 400, subpart J must be exhausted before judicial action may be brought.

This action is not expected to have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment, health, and safety.
Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed.

This proposed rule is not subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601) because it is not likely to have a
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The effect of this rule is to clarify procedures
already in use by reinsured companies and crop insurance agents.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Rural Electrification Administration proposes to amend its regulation on REA Telecommunications Standards
and Specifications for Material, Equipment and Construction by codifying the REA bulletin concerning REA Performance
Specification for Line Concentrators, REA form 397g. This specification has been incorporated by reference and
will be rescinded after the effective date of the final rule. The specification proposes to update the end product
performance requirements brought about through technology advancements since this specification was last issued
on July 29, 1985.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:






Executive Order 12866



This proposed rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866.



Executive Order 12778



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If adopted, this proposed
rule:

(1) Will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict
with this rule;

(2) Will not have any retroactive effect; and

(3) Will not require administrative proceedings before any parties may file suit challenging the provisions of this
rule.



Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification



The Administrator of REA has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) the REA programs provide and finance grants and loans to REA borrowers at interest rates and terms that are more favorable
than those generally available from the private sector. REA borrowers, as a result of obtaining Federal financing,
receive economic benefits which ultimately offset any direct economic costs associated with complying with REA
regulations and requirements.



Information Collection and Recordkeeping Requirements



In compliance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations (5 CFR Part 1320) which implements the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

) and section 3504 of that Act, information collection and recordkeeping requirements contained in this proposed
rule have been approved by OMB under control number 0572-0077. Comments concerning these requirements should
be directed to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for USDA, Room 3201,
NEOB, Washington, DC 20503.



National Environmental Policy Act Certification



The Administrator of REA has determined that this proposed rule will not significantly affect the quality of the human
environment as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

). Therefore, this action does not require an environmental impact statement or assessment.



Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance



The program described by this proposed rule is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs under
number 10.851, Rural Telephone Loans and Loan Guarantees. This catalog is available on a subscription basis from
the Superintendent of Documents, the United States Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.



Executive Order 12372



This proposed rule is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Consultation. A Notice
of Final Rule entitled Department Programs and Activities Excluded from Executive Order 12372 (50 FR 47034) exempts
REA and RTB loans and loan guarantees, and RTB bank loans, to governmental and nongovernmental entities from coverage
under this Order;



Background



REA makes loans and loan guarantees to telephone system to provide and improve telecommunications service in rural
areas, as authorized by the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended, 7 U.S.C. 901 

et seq.

, (RE Act). REA maintains a system of construction standards and specifications for materials and equipment. In accordance
with the REA loan contract, these standards and specifications apply to facilities constructed by REA telephone
borrowers.

Presently, REA Bulletin 345-185, REA Performance Specification for Line Concentrators REA Form 397g, dated
July 29, 1985, is incorporated by reference at 7 CFR 1755.97. Because of the many improvements in technology since
the specification was last issued, REA believes that by updating and codifying the revised specification, borrowers
will be provided with an opportunity to improve and increase subscriber services through enhanced system designs
brought about through the technological advancements in an economical and efficient manner.

specified in this section are available and in compliance with this section.

(5) Certain requirements are included in this section for features which may not be needed for every application.
Such features are identifiable by the inclusion in the requirements of some such phrase as ``when specified by the
owner'' or ``as specified by the owner.'' In some cases where an optional feature will not be required by an owner, either
now or in the future, a system which does not provide this feature shall be considered to be in compliance with the specification
for the specific installation under consideration, but not in compliance with the entire specification.

(6) The owner may properly request bids from any supplier of an REA accepted LC whose system provides all the features
which will be required for a specific installation.

(7) When required by the owner, the supplier shall state compliance to the Carrier Serving Area (CSA) requirements,
as stated in Bell Communications Research (Bellcore) Standard TR-TSY-000057, Functional Criteria for Digital
Loop Carrier Systems.

in all system terminals during the first 3 months after cutover, and shall not exceed an average of 1.0 percent per month
of all equipped cards in all system terminals during the second 3-month period. The failure rate for the equipment
shall be less than 0.5 percent per month of all equipped cards in all system terminals after 6 months. A failure is considered
to be the failure of a component on the PC board which requires it to be repaired or replaced.

(2) The line concentrator terminal units shall be designed such that there will be no more than 4 hours of total outages
in 20 years.

(d) 

System type acceptance tests. 

General test results will be required on each system type. Any system provided in accordance with this section shall
be capable of meeting any requirement in this section on a spot-check basis.

(e) 

Features required. 

(1) The network control equipment and peripheral equipment shall be comprised of solid-state and integrated circuitry
components as far as practical and in keeping with the state-of-the-art and economics of the subject system.

(2) When subscriber loops that exceed the resistance and voice frequency gain range of the line concentrator equipment
are required, external loop extenders and loop extender/voice frequency repeater (LE/VFR) combinations must be
of a type accepted by REA.

(3) When specified by the owner, party line service shall be supplied. The number of parties per line shall be no more
than four.

(f) 

Subscriber lines

_(1) 

General. 

(i) The remote LC units shall operate satisfactorily with subscriber lines which meet all of the conditions under
the bidder's specifications and all the requirements of this section. This section recognizes that the loop limit
of the line concentrator is dependent upon the transmission facility between the LC central office termination and
the LC remote unit. When voice frequency (physical) circuits are used, the loop limit from the COE to the subscriber
shall be 1900 ohms (including the telephone set). When electronically derived circuits (carrier, lightwave, etc.)
are used, the loop limits of the electronic system will control. The bidder shall identify the loop limits of the equipment
to be supplied.

(ii) The LC system shall be capable of allowing subscribers on the same party line to call each other in systems providing
party line service when connected to central office equipment arranged to provide reverting party line service.

(iii) There should be provisions for such types of lines as ground start, loop start, regular subscriber, pay stations,
etc.

(2) 

Dialing. 

(i) The line concentrator remote and central office terminal equipment shall satisfactorily transmit dialing information
when used with subscriber dials having a speed of operation between 8 and 12 dial pulses per second and a break period
of 55 to 65 % of the total signaling period.

(ii) 

Subscriber dial interdigital time. 

The remote and central office LC equipment shall permit satisfactory telecommunications operation when used with
subscriber rotary dial interdigital times of 200 milliseconds minimum, and pushbutton dialing with 50 milliseconds
minimum.

(iii) 

Subscriber line pushbutton dialing frequencies. 

The frequency pairs assigned for pushbutton dialing when provided by the central office shall be as listed in this
paragraph (f)(2)(iii), with an allowable variation of 

#

1.5 percent:






(3) 

Ringing. 

(i) When LC ringing is generated at the remote end, it shall be automatic and intermittent and shall be cut off from the
called line upon removal of the handset at the called station during either the ringing or silent period.

(ii) When ringing generators are provided in the LC on an ancillary basis, they shall be selected from REA Bulletin
1755I-100 ``List of Materials Acceptable for Use on Telephone Systems of REA Borrowers.''

(iii) Where ringing is generated at the remote end, the ringing system shall provide sufficient ringing on a bridged
basis over the voltage and temperature limits of this specification and over subscriber loops within the limits stated
by the manufacturer. The manufacturer shall state the minimum number (not less than two) of main station ringers that
can be used for each ringing option available.

(g) 

Traffic. 

(1)(i) The minimum grade of service for traffic in the line concentrator shall be B=.005 using the Traffic Table, based
on the Erlang Lost-Calls-Cleared Formula. Required grade of service, traffic assumptions and calculations for
the particular application being implemented shall be supplied by the bidder.

(ii) Service to customers served by a traffic sensitive LC should not be noticeably different than the service to customers
served by the dedicated physical pairs from the central office so that uniform grade of service will be provided to
all customers in any class of service. Reference document  1755.522 (p)(1)(i), REA General Specification
for Digital Stored Program Controlled Central Office Equipment.

(2) 

Traffic and Plant Registers. 

Traffic measurements consist of three types_peg count, usage, and congestion. A peg count register scores one count
per call attempt per circuit group such as trunks, digit receivers, senders, etc. Usage counters measure the traffic
density in networks, trunks and other circuit groups. Congestion registers score the number of calls which fail to
find an idle circuit in a trunk group or to find an idle path through the switching network when attempting to connect
two given end points. These conditions constitute ``network blocking.''

(3) When required, traffic data will be stored in electronic storage registers or a block of memory consisting of one
or more traffic counters for each item to be measured. The bidder shall indicate what registers are to be supplied,
their purpose and the means for displaying the information locally (or at a remote location when available).

(h) 

Transmission requirements

_(1) 

General. 

Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in paragraphs (h)(2) through (20) of this section are specified in terms
of analog measurements made from Main Distributing Frame (MDF) terminals to MDF terminals excluding cabling loss.

(2) 

Telephone transmitter battery supply. 

A minimum of 20 milliamperes, dc, shall be provided for the transmitter of the telephone set at the subscriber station
under all loop conditions specified by the bidder. The telephone set is assumed to have a resistance of 200 ohms.

(3)

For the purpose of this section, the input impedance of all subscriber loops served by the equipment is arbitrarily
considered to be 900 ohms in series with 2.16 microfarad capacitor at voice frequencies.

(4) 

Battery noise. 

Noise across the remote terminal battery at power panel distribution bus terminals shall not exceed 35 dBrnC during
the specified busy hour.

(5) 

Stability. 

The long-term allowable variation in loss through the line concentrator system shall be 

#

 0.5 dB from the loss specified by the bidder.

(6) 

Return loss. 

The specified return loss values are determined by the service and type of port at the measuring end. Two-wire ports
are measured at 900 ohms in series with 2.16 microfarads, and 4-wire ports are measured at 600 ohms resistive. When
other balance networks are supplied, test equipment arranged for operation with the supplied network(s) may be used.
The requirement given shall meet the following cited values on each balance network available in the system:








Line-to-Line or Line-to-Trunk (2-Wire)
Echo Return Loss (ERL)_18 dB, Minimum
Singing Return Loss (SRL)_Low_15 dB, Minimum
Singing Return Loss (SRL)_High_18 dB, Minimum







(7) 

Longitudinal balance. 

The minimum longitudinal balance, with dc loop currents between 20 to 70 mA, shall be 60 dB at all frequencies between
60 and 2000 Hz, 55 dB at 2700 Hz and 50 dB at 3400 Hz. The method of measurement shall be as specified in the IEEE standard
#455, ``Standard Testing Procedure for Measuring Longitudinal Balance of Telephone Equipment Operating in the

two paths through the system by connecting a 0 dBm0 level tone to the disturbing pair.

(12) 

Digital error rate. 

The digital line concentrator shall not introduce more than one error in 108 bits averaged over a 5-minute period,
excluding the least significant bit.

(13) 

Quantizing distortion. 

(i) The system shall meet the following requirements:






(ii) Due to possible loss of the least significant bit on direct digital connections, a signal to distortion degradation
of up to 2 dB may be allowed where adequately justified by the bidder.

(14)

equipment, shall not exceed 1000 microseconds analog-to-analog measured at 1800 Hz.


(19) 

Insertion loss. 

The insertion loss in both directions of transmission at 1004 Hz shall be included in the insertion loss requirements
for the connected COE switch and shall not increase the overall losses through the combined equipment beyond the values
for the COE alone, when operated through a direct digital interface. Systems operated with a (VF) line circuit interface
may introduce up to 3 dB insertion loss. Reference  1755.522(e)(3).

(20) 

Detailed requirements for direct digital connections. 

(i) This paragraph (h)(20) covers the detailed requirements for the provision of interface units which will permit
direct digital connection between the host central office and line concentrator subscriber terminals over digital
facilities. The digital transmission system shall be compatible with T1 type span lines using a DS1 interface and
other digital interfaces that may be specified by the owner. The REA specification for the T1 span line equipment is
PE-60. Other span line techniques may also be used. Diverse span line routing may be used when specified by the owner.

(ii) The output of a digital-to-digital port shall be Pulse Code Modulation (PCM), encoded in eight-bit words using
the mu-255 encoding law and D3 encoding format, and arranged to interface with a T1 span line.

(iii) Signaling shall be by means of Multifrequency (MF) or Dual Pulsing (DP) and the system which is inherent in the
A and B bits of the D3 format. In the case where A and B bits are not used for signaling or system control, these bits shall
only be used for normal voice and data transmission.

(iv) When a direct digital interface between the span line and the host central office equipment is to be implemented,
the following requirements shall be met:


(A) The span line shall be terminated in a central office repeater and the DS1 bit stream shall be connected to a digital
interface port on the central office equipment;

(B) The digital central office equipment shall be programmed to support the operation of the digital port with the
line concentrator subscriber terminal;

(C) The line concentrator subscriber terminal used with a direct digital interface shall be interchangeable with
the subscriber terminal used with a central office terminal.

(i) 

Alarms. 

The system shall send alarms for such conditions as blown fuses, blocked controls, power failure in the remote terminal,
etc., along with its own status indication and status of dry relay contact closures or solid-state equivalent to the
associated central office alarm circuits. Sufficient system alarm points shall be provided from the remote terminal
to report conditions to the central office alarm system. The alarms shall be transmitted from the remote terminal
to the central office terminal as long as any part of the connecting link is available for this transmission. Fuses
shall be of the alarm and indicator type, and their rating designated by numerals or color code on fuse positions.


(j) 

Electrical protection

_(1) 

Surge protection. 

(i) Adequate electrical protection of line concentrator equipment shall be included in the design of the system.
The characteristics and application of protection devices must be such that they enable the line concentrator equipment
to withstand, without damage or excessive protector maintenance, the dielectric stresses and currents that are
produced in line-to-ground and tip-to-ring circuits through the equipment as a result of induced or conducted lightning
or power system fault-related surges. All wire terminals connected to outside plant wire or cable pairs shall be protected
from voltage and current surges.

(ii) Equipment must pass laboratory tests, simulating the hostile electrical environment, before being placed
in the field for the purpose of obtaining field experience. There are five basic types of laboratory tests which must
be applied to exposed terminals in an effort to determine if the equipment will survive. Figure 2 of this section, Summary
of Electrical Requirements and Tests, identifies the tests and their application.

















(iii) Electrical protection requirements for line concentrator equipment can be summarized briefly as follows:

(A) Current surge tests simulate the stress to which a relatively low impedance path may be subjected before main frame
protectors break down. Paths with a 100 Hz impedance of 50 ohms or less shall be subjected to current surges, employing
a 10  x  1000 microsecond waveshape as defined in Figure 3 of this section, Surge Waveshape. For the purpose of
determining this impedance, arresters which are mounted within the equipment are to be considered zero impedance.
The crest current shall not exceed 500A; however, depending on the impedance of the test specimen this value of current
may be lower. The crest current through the sample, multiplied by the sample's 100 Hz impedance, shall not exceed 1000
V. Where sample impedance is less than 2 ohms, peak current shall be limited to 500A as shown in Figure 4 of this section,
Current Surge Tests;

(B) Sixty Hertz (60 Hz) current carrying tests shall be applied to simulate an ac power fault which is conducted to the
unit over the cable pairs. The test shall be limited to 10 amperes Root Mean Square (RMS) of 60 Hz ac for a period of 11 cycles

while reducing testing to the minimum, voltage surge tests shall be conducted at a 1000 volts with primary arresters
removed for devices protected by carbon blocks, or the +3 sigma dc breakdown voltage of other primary arresters. Surge
waveshape should be 10  x  1000 microseconds; and

breakdown of gap type arresters when subjected to rapidly rising voltages. Arresters shall be removed for these tests,
the peak surge voltage shall be the +3 sigma breakdown voltage of the arrester in question on a voltage rising at 100
V per microsecond, and the time for the surge to decay to half voltage shall equal at least the delay time of the tube as

 Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of inquiry and of public meeting.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Through this Notice of Inquiry (Notice) the Department of Energy (Department) desires to elicit the views of members
of the general public on the process of evaluation of the suitability of Yucca Mountain, Nevada, as a permanent repository
for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. In addition, the Department invites comments on opportunities
for and types of public involvement in the process of site suitability evaluation. The Department invites interested
parties to provide written comments during the term specified in this Notice.



The Department will conduct a public meeting on May 21, 1994, in Las Vegas, Nevada, for the purpose of providing interested
parties with an opportunity to present their views on these and other issues. The public meeting will also provide
a forum to discuss the subject of stakeholder involvement generally, as a follow-up to a previous stakeholder meeting
held in August 1993. An update on Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program developments will be provided to
meeting attendees. Additional information on the public meeting may be obtained from the individuals noted below.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Background



The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended (Act), 42 U.S.C. 10101 

et seq.

, provides a comprehensive framework for the development of repositories for the disposal of high-level radioactive
waste and spent nuclear fuel. Section 112(a) of the Act directed the Department of Energy (the Department) to do the
following: (1) Issue general guidelines for the recommendation of sites for repositories; and (2) use such guidelines
in considering candidate sites for recommendation. Section 112(a) further provides that the Secretary of Energy
may revise such guidelines from time to time. Section 112(a) of the Act provides that the guidelines developed pursuant
to Section 112(a) have to be concurred in by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and submitted to the Governor or legislature
of the State of Nevada for their review and comment.

Section 113(b) of the Act, which concerns site characterization, in effect, directs the Department to develop guidelines
to be used to determine the suitability of a candidate site for the location of a repository, developed pursuant to
section 112(a) of the Act.

In accordance with sections 112(a) and 113(b)(1), the Department promulgated, as a regulation, General Guidelines
for the Recommendation of Sites for Nuclear Waste Repositories (10 CFR part 960).

In accordance with Section 113 of the Act, the Department is conducting site characterization activities at the Yucca
Mountain site to provide data required for evaluation of the suitability of the site for construction and operation
of a repository for disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste in accordance with the Act and
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

).

In view of the importance of the site suitability evaluation, the Department is seeking the views of interested parties
regarding an evaluation process which can earn public trust and confidence in the suitability of the Yucca Mountain
Site.

The Department will use the information obtained in response to this Notice as it proceeds with the development of
the site suitability evaluation process.

II. Site Suitability Evaluation


A. Public Involvement



The Department seeks comments of interested parties on mechanisms and timing for providing input to the Department
on the evaluation of site suitability. The Department seeks comments on the type of information the public needs in
order to understand the site suitability evaluation, the public's preferences regarding involvement methods such
as workshops and public meetings, and any other considerations.



B. Adequacy of Guidelines



The guidelines referenced above (10 CFR part 960) provide that the Department may consider revision if necessary.
The Department periodically reviews the guidelines for that purpose. The Department seeks the views of interested
parties regarding the guidelines, and in particular their role in the evaluation of site suitability. The options
on which the Department seeks comments include using the guidelines as they stand and conducting a rulemaking to amend
the guidelines. DOE also requests comment on the desirability of removing portions of 10 CFR part 960 which have been
made obsolete by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act Amendments of 1987 (Title V of Pub. L. 100-203) and which may cause
confusion because they continue to appear in the Code of Federal Regulations.



C. Peer Review of Scientific and Technical Information



Site Suitability Evaluations will include the review of scientific and technical information by experts who are
recognized as such by their peers in their fields of knowledge. The Department seeks comments on the appropriate use
of peer reviews in site suitability evaluations, how to select peer reviewers, the roles of existing expert groups
such as the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board and the National Academy of Sciences, and other considerations.



D. Other Considerations



In addition to the topics mentioned above, the Department seeks other comments regarding the evaluation of site suitability.



E. Public Meeting



The Department will hold a public meeting at the Mirage Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada, on Saturday, May 21, 1994. The purposes
of this meeting are to provide: (1) A follow-up to the stakeholder meeting held last August; (2) an update on Yucca Mountain
site characterization activities; and (3) an opportunity for continued dialogue among interested parties. In addition,
the afternoon session will give attendees an opportunity to discuss the evaluation of site suitability.

Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Model A320 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking; reopening of comment period. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document revises an earlier proposed airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Airbus Model A320
series airplanes, that would have required revising the Limitations Section of the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM)
to prohibit the airplane from extended overwater operations. That proposal was prompted by a report that, during
an emergency evacuation demonstration, the lanyard connecting the survival kit to the slide/raft became entangled
on the girt bar indicator mechanism, and subsequently prevented an exit door from opening fully to a locked position.
This action revises the proposed rule by deleting the previously proposed AFM limitation; and requiring either the
removal of the girt bar visual indicator brackets on passenger exit doors or modification of the lanyard. The actions
specified by this proposed AD are intended to prevent the lanyard from becoming entangled and interfering with proper
opening of the exit door, a situation which could impede the successful evacuation of passengers through the door
during an overwater operation where ditching is required. 



</SUMMARY>

Availability of NPRMs 



Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM-103,
Attention: Rules Docket No. 93-NM-63-AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055-4056.




Discussion 



A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to add an airworthiness directive (AD), applicable
to all Airbus Model A320 series airplanes, was published as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the 

Federal Register

 on July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40077). That NPRM would have required revising the Limitations Section of the FAA-approved
Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to prohibit the airplane from extended overwater operations. That action also would
have provided for an optional terminating action of modification of the lanyard that attaches the overwater survival
kit to the slide/raft; once accomplished, the AFM limitation could be removed.

NPRM was prompted by a report that, during an emergency evacuation demonstration, the subject lanyard became entangled
on the girt bar indicator mechanism, and subsequently prevented an exit door from opening fully to a locked position.
That condition, if not corrected, could impede the successful evacuation of passengers through the door during an
overwater operation where ditching is required. 


Since the issuance of that NPRM, the FAA has reconsidered its position on certain of the proposed requirements, based
on the comments received in response to the notice. 


One commenter, Airbus Industrie (Airbus), questions the justification for the proposed rule, and requests that
the FAA withdraw it . Airbus contends that, according to the international bilateral airworthiness agreements,
the responsibility to determine the existence and extent of an unsafe condition with respect to any reported incident
lies within the jurisdiction of the primary authority, in this case, the Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation
Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France. Airbus states that the DGAC made a decision not to
issue a French airworthiness directive to mandate a modification of the airplane design because (1) the slide was
correctly deployed during the incident upon which this proposed rule is based; and (2) although the door did not go
to the fully-open position during that incident, it did not interfere with the passenger flow during evacuation.
Airbus also states that the door will remain in the not-fully-open position until it is pushed to the fully-open position
by the assisting cylinder, which is maintained pressurized until the door reaches the fully-open and locked position.
During the incident, the door did not initially go to the fully-open position because the overwater survival kit lanyard
was caught by the visual indicator bracket and became entangled between the door and the fuselage. When the crew untangled
the lanyard, the door went into the fully-opened and locked position. 


The FAA does not concur with the commenter's suggestion to withdraw the proposal. While the United States and France
observe the provisions of the bilateral airworthiness agreement, it remains the responsibility of the FAA to monitor
and maintain the continuing airworthiness of U.S.-type certificated and -registered airplanes. The bilateral
airworthiness agreements do not restrict the FAA from issuing AD's based upon its own finding of an unsafe condition,
regardless of the decision made by another airworthiness authority relative to the same subject. The FAA has examined
the analyses of the evacuation demonstration, has reviewed all other available data, and has determined that an unsafe
condition exists with regard to problem of the lanyard becoming entangled on the girt bar indicator mechanism and
preventing the exit door from opening fully to a locked position. Therefore, the FAA has determined that AD action
is necessary for airplanes of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 


One commenter requests that the applicability of the proposed rule be limited to only those Model A320 series airplanes
that are equipped with slide/raft evacuation systems eligible for overwater operations. The commenter contends
that the scenario for the occurrence of the addressed unsafe condition would not apply to those airplanes without
the slide/raft evacuation systems; therefore, they should be exempt from the proposed rule. The FAA concurs and has
revised the applicability of this supplemental NPRM accordingly. 


Two commenters request that the proposal be revised to include the installation of Modification 23605, described
in Airbus Service Bulletin A320-25-1109, dated April 20, 1993, as an acceptable modification that would
permit the removal of the proposed limitation in the AFM (prohibiting extended overwater operations). This modification
entails replacing the existing girt bar indicator bracket with a red arrow placard on the slide/raft decorative covers.
The FAA does not concur totally with the commenters' request. The FAA has evaluated the referenced modification and
has found that, while removal of the brackets will prevent possible interference between the overwater survival
kit lanyard and the slide/raft decorative cover, the placards do not provide for an acceptable means of girt bar position
indication. 


The FAA has reviewed the current design of the visual girt bar position indicator brackets (plates) and finds that,
as designed and installed, these brackets contribute to the problem of lanyard entanglement that leads to the unsafe
condition addressed by this AD. In light of this, the FAA has revised this proposed rule to require that, in lieu of modifying
the lanyard, operators may remove the girt bar visual indicator brackets from all doors that are equipped with them.
(The girt bar position/arming indicator in the cockpit, however, would be unaffected by this action; it would remain
as a source to obtain positive indication of the position of the girt bar.) The FAA considers that this proposed action
will be as effective 
in addressing the unsafe condition and as timely to accomplish 
as the modificatin of the lanyard. Additionally, since removal of the brackets or modificaiton of the lanyard will
eliminate the problem of entanglement of the lanyard and the subsequent problems of opening the exit door properly,
the FAA has deleted the previously proposed requirement that would have prohibited extended overwater operation
of the affected airplanes.


This is considered interim action. Airbus Industrie has advised the FAA that it is developing an alternative method
of girt bar position indication that will not entail a design feature that would contribute to the addressed problem
of lanyard entanglement. Once this modification is developed, approved, and available, the FAA may consider further
rulemaking. 


Since the change described above expands the scope of the originally proposed rule, the FAA has determined that it
is necessary to reopen the comment period to provide additional opportunity for public comment. 


The FAA estimates that 59 Model A320 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD.

Accomplishment of the removal of the girt bar visual indicator brackets would take approximately 1 work hour per airplane,
at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this proposed removal
action on U.S. operators who elect to accomplish it is estimated to be $55 per airplane.


The time necessary to accomplish the modification of the lanyard may vary from operator to operator, depending upon
the design submitted for approval by the FAA. However, the FAA estimates that a typical modification would require
an average of 2 work hours to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of this proposed modification action on U.S. operators who elect to accomplish it is estimated to be $110
per airplane.

Based on the figures discussed above, the total cost impact of this proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be
between $3,245 and $6,490. This total cost impact figure is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished
any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future
if this AD were not adopted. 


The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 


For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Lockheed
Model L-1011-385 series airplanes. This proposal would require an initial servicing or overhaul of the
ram air turbine (RAT), and incorporating repetitive overhaul actions into the FAA-approved maintenance program.
This proposal is prompted by reports that, during routine maintenance of the RAT, the turbine blade assembly separated
during spin tests. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent separation of the turbine blade
assembly, which could damage the airplane structure and systems, and, under certain circumstances, could lead to
reduced controllability of the airplane.

Discussion


Recently, operators of certain Lockheed Model L-1011-385 series airplanes have reported that, during
routine maintenance of the ram air turbine (RAT), the turbine blade assembly separated during functional (spin)
tests. Normal maintenance procedures call for operators periodically to check the RAT functionally by using airplane
hydraulic pressure, pumped through the RAT, to spin the turbine. In the recently reported incidents, the turbine
blade separations occurred from 1.5 to 2 minutes into the functional test. Investigation into the cause of the failures
revealed that inadequately lubricated turbine bearings on the RAT's led to the separation of the turbine blade assembly.
Historically, there have been no mandatory replacement or refurbishment times for the RAT's installed on Model L-1011-385
series airplanes. Under normal maintenance procedures, the RAT's are functionally tested, on the an average, every
48 months or 4,000 flights (at a ``D'' check). The RAT is replaced, refurbished, or repaired ``on condition'' only;
that is, only if the RAT fails the functional test. In the reported incidents, the RAT's had not been serviced, nor had
functional testing indicated that they needed servicing, since new. It is likely that RAT's have been on many other
affected airplanes since delivery, with no servicing that would ensure adequate lubrication of the turbine bearing.
Although all of the incidents of failure occurred while the airplane was on the ground undergoing routine functional
testing of the RAT, the likelihood exists for these failures also to occur during flight, if the RAT were deployed during
an emergency. The RAT is used during flight only in the event of failure of hydraulic power in all four hydraulic systems
of the airplane; this would most likely occur in an ``all engines out'' situation. Separation of the turbine blade
assembly on the RAT could result in damage to the RAT, the airplane structure, or systems, and could damage property
or injure persons on the ground. Failure of the RAT during an ``all engines out'' emergency situation could result
in complete loss of hydraulic power on the airplane.
The FAA has reviewed and approved Lockheed TriStar L-1011 Service Bulletin 093-29-098, dated December
6, 1993, that describes procedures for removing, disassembling, inspecting, testing, and servicing of the RAT.
This service bulletin references Dowty Aerospace Hydraulics_Cheltenham Service Bulletin RAT16C10-29-168,
dated December 1, 1993, as an additional source of service information for inspecting, testing, and servicing the
RAT's. (Dowty is the manufacturer of the subject RAT's.) It also references Dowty Aerospace Hydraulics_Cheltenham
Service Bulletin RAT16C10-29-154, Revision 1, dated September 15, 1993, which recommends overhauling
the RAT every 8 years.
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require that operators initially either service the RAT (which entails removal, disassembly,
inspection, and testing) in accordance with the Lockheed service bulletin described previously; or completely
overhaul the RAT in accordance with the RAT Overhaul Manual. This proposal would also require revising the FAA-approved
maintenance program to incorporate procedures to overhaul the RAT at 8-year intervals.
There are approximately 236 Lockheed Model L-1011-385 series airplanes of the affected design in the
worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 117 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD.
For operators electing initially to service the RAT, it would take approximately 48 work hours per airplane to accomplish
those actions, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
servicing actions on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,640 per RAT.
For operators electing initially to overhaul the RAT, it would take approximately 170 work hours per RAT to accomplish
those actions, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
overhaul actions on U.S. operators is estimated to be $9,350 per RAT.
The number of work hours that would be required to perform either the servicing or overhaul of the RAT, as indicated
above, is presented as if those actions were to be accomplished as ``stand alone'' actions. However, in actual practice,
these actions for the most part would be accomplished coincidentally or in combination with normally scheduled airplane
inspections and other maintenance program tasks. Therefore, the actual number of any necessary additional work
hours would be minimal in many instances. Additionally, any costs associated with special airplane scheduling would
be minimal.
Incorporation of the proposed requirements of this AD into the FAA-approved maintenance program would require approximately
40 work hours per operator to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of incorporation of the proposed maintenance program change on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,200
per operator.
The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive.
Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would
not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft
in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those costs solely to the issuance of this AD
is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, most prudent operators would accomplish the
required actions even if they were not required to do so by the AD.
A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this proposed AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy,
an aircraft must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only
after the FAA makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting
and maintaining those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety
that is cost-beneficial. When the FAA, as in this proposed AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that
this cost-beneficial level of safety is no longer being achieved and that the proposed actions are necessary to restore
that level of safety. Because this level of safety has already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit
analysis for this proposed AD would be redundant and unnecessary.
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

Consumer Information Regulations Uniform Tire Quality Grading Standards 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Department of Transportation (DOT). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Request for comments. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Uniform Tire Quality Grading Standards (UTQGS) 
require tire manufacturers to grade their tires for treadwear, 
traction, and temperature resistance to assist consumers in 
making informed decisions when purchasing passenger car tires. 
NHTSA is soliciting comments on ways in which the agency might 
propose amending the UTQGS to make the quality ratings more 
meaningful to the tire-buying public. 



In addition, the Administration's Climate Change Action 
Plan calls for DOT, through NHTSA, to establish tire labels 
measuring the tires' impact on fuel economy due to rolling 
resistance and an information program to encourage consumers to 
purchase aftermarket tires with lower rolling resistance. 
Accordingly, NHTSA requests comments on whether to propose 
amending the UTQGS by adding a rolling resistance grade, either 
while retaining the temperature resistance grade or by 
substituting the rolling resistance for the temperature 
resistance grade. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 203 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, 15 U.S.C. 1381, 

et seq. 

(Safety Act), 
requires the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe a uniform 
quality grading system for motor vehicle tires. The purpose of 
the system is to assist consumers in making informed decisions 
when purchasing tires. NHTSA implemented that statutory 
mandate by issuing the UTQGS (49 CFR 575.104). Those 
standards, applicable to passenger car tires, require motor 
vehicle and tire manufacturers and tire brand name owners to 
provide consumers with information about their tires' relative 
performance regarding treadwear, traction, and temperature 
resistance. Excluded from the standards are deep tread, 
winter-type snow tires, space-saver or temporary use spare 
tires, tires with nominal rim diameters of 10 to 12 inches, and 
limited production tires. 



The treadwear, traction, and temperature resistance 
characteristics were chosen by NHTSA for rating under the UTQGS 
after careful study, testing, and consideration of public 
comments. Those characteristics were selected because they 
provide the best balance of tire properties for meaningful 
evaluation by consumers. Those characteristics interact with 
each other so that improvement of one of them could detract 
from the rating of another. For example, treadwear life can be 
increased by varying the construction compounds to produce a 
``harder'' tire. To do so, however, would have a negative effect 
on traction performance. Treadwear life could also be 
increased by adding more rubber to the tread. Increased tread 
depth, however, would increase rolling resistance because of 
the additional friction. That would cause the tire to run 
hotter, thus detracting from its temperature resistance, and 
increase the possibility of tire failure. 

Various problems have been encountered in implementing the 
UTQGS to make them as technically accurate, yet as meaningful 
and understandable to consumers as possible. Many of those 
problems have been resolved by changes in test procedures as 
the program has evolved. Certain problems remain, however, as 
discussed below. 



I. Treadwear 



Treadwear has been one of the graded tire characteristics 
from the inception of the quality grading program (see 33 FR 
7261, May 16, 1968). NHTSA concluded, from consideration of 
public comments early in the program, that consumers were most 
interested in evaluations of tire tread life, traction, and 
high speed performance. Since that time, NHTSA has found that 
treadwear is understood by the average tire buyer, making it 
one of the more meaningful of the UTQGS ratings. 

In its compliance testing, NHTSA measures treadwear by 
running the tires being tested, called candidate tires, over a 
400-mile course of public roads near San Angelo, Texas. 
Candidate tires are first ``broken-in'' by running them over two 
circuits of the test course. Treadwear measurements are taken 
after that initial break-in and after each 800-mile segment 
thereafter or, optionally, only at the beginning and at the end 
of the complete 6,400 mile test. The test vehicles' wheels are 
aligned to manufacturers' specifications, correct tire pressure 
is maintained throughout the test, and tire loading is 
maintained at 85 percent of the tires' maximum load ratings. 
The test cars travel in convoys, at posted speed limits, with 
regular changes of drivers and with changes in the positions of 
the cars and tires.

<PARENT> FR940425-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Upon completion of the 6,400-mile test, the adjusted wear 
rate for a candidate tire is extrapolated to the point of 
wearout, which is 1/16th inch of tread remaining, and the 
treadwear grade established. A grade of 100 represents a tire 
capable of achieving approximately 30,000 miles to the wearout 
point, as measured on the San Angelo course. A tire graded at 
150 should achieve approximately 50 percent more mileage than 
the one graded at 100, assuming both are run on the same course 
and under the same conditions. It should be noted, however, 
that tire treadwear grades are not intended to be indicative of 
a tire's actual expected mileage. The tire quality grades are 
intended as indicators of relative, not absolute, performance. 
The actual mileage a tire achieves will depend on many factors, 
such as geographic location, individual driving habits, 
maintenance of proper tire pressure, load, type of road 
surfaces, climatic conditions, and road configurations. 

NHTSA has noted significant changes in treadwear ratings 
since the UTQGS became fully effective in 1980. Early in the 
UTQGS program, the treadwear grading criteria specified in 
 575.104(d)(2) produced consistent results. As the years 
progressed, however, treadwear ratings have drifted steadily 
upward in both manufacturers' and NHTSA's testing results to 
the point that many of the ratings appear to be questionable. 
For example, one brand of tires (brand A) recently tested on 
the San Angelo course resulted in a test grade of 832 which, 
when rounded off to the next lower 20-point increment as 
required by 49 CFR 575.104(e)(2)(ix)(F), would be labeled with 
a treadwear grade of 820. That figure suggests a degree of 
relative superiority in treadwear of brand A tires over lower 
tested brands that appears significantly disproportionate to 
the differences in the likely actual mileage of those tires. 
NHTSA understands that tires are of higher quality, perform 
better and last longer than tires produced even a few years 
ago. Such improvements result from industry developments such 
as improvements in rubber compounds, cord materials, tire 
designs, and tread configurations. The agency does not 
believe, however, that tires have improved to the point 
suggested by the test results for brand A, which suggests that, 
on the San Angelo course, the tire would last over 240,000 
miles. This situation suggests either that the characteristics 
of the course itself are changing or that other factors as yet 
unidentified are responsible, or both. 



Course Monitoring Tires 



As noted above, the wear rates of tires can change on a 
daily basis because of such conditions as road surface, 
temperature, humidity, and precipitation. To compensate for 
those changes in conditions when conducting agency compliance 
testing, candidate tires are tested concurrently with course 
monitoring tires (CMT). Before 1991, CMTs were built to strict 
NHTSA specifications. Since that time, NHTSA has required that 
CMTs be built to the specifications of the American Society for 
Testing Materials (ASTM) standard E1136. CMTs are specially 
designed to have narrow limits of variability and, in fact, are 
assumed to be invariant among tires of a given batch, or lot. 

CMTs are procured by NHTSA in lots of 500-1500. 
Whenever a new lot is procured, a new base course wear rate 
(BCWR) is established for that lot. This is accomplished by 
treating the new CMT as a candidate tire and determining its 
adjusted wear rate in the same manner prescribed in 
 575.104 for candidate tires. The new CMT is tested in a convoy 
along with the old CMTs. A course severity adjustment factor 
(CSAF) is determined by dividing the BCWR for the old CMTs by 
the wear rate of the old CMTs in the test. The wear rate of 
the new CMT in the convoy is then multiplied by the CSAF to 
obtain the adjusted wear rate of the new CMT which then becomes 
the BCWR for the new CMTs. 

Once the BCWR for a new lot of CMTs is established, those 
new CMTs can then be used to grade candidate tires. Upon 
completion of the 6,400-mile test, the BCWR is divided by the 
average wear rate of the 4 new CMTs in the test convoy to 
determine the course severity adjustment factor. That factor 
is then applied to the wear rates of the candidate tires being 
graded in the same convoy. The adjusted wear rate of the 
candidate tire is then extrapolated to the point of wearout 
(1/16th inch tread remaining) which is then converted to the 
treadwear rating for that tire. 

NHTSA has noted over the years that significant changes 
have occurred in the BCWRs. Although the actual measured 
treadwear rates of CMTs have varied from 3.27 to 6.96 mils per 
1,000 miles since 1975, the adjusted BCWRs have steadily 
decreased from 4.44 in 1975 to 1.56 in 1992, as shown in 
Table 1, as follows:

</DOC>

<PARENT> FR940425-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


 


The BCWR and the actual wear rate theoretically should correlate reasonably well. Any differences may be due to climatic
variations, changes in course severity, non-uniformity of wear rates between individual tires within the same lot,
effects of aging and storage on the wear rates of the CMTs, errors in the calculation for adjusting BCWRs, or perhaps
some combination of those factors. 

The test course is well maintained by the State of Texas and does not appear to have changed appreciably since testing
first started there in 1975. That suggests that a significant part of the change in BCWRs may be attributed to the CMTs
instead of course variability. NHTSA has noted that in every case in which one lot of CMTs is replaced by another, the
new lot invariably shows a lower BCWR than the former. 

The first batch of CMTs were procured from Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in 1975 and had a wear rate of 4.44. Tires
from that same lot were tested again in 1979 and showed a wear rate of 4.08. A new CMT batch was purchased in 1979 which
showed a wear rate of 3.82. By 1980, however, tires tested from that batch showed an increased wear rate of 5.29. In each
batch, the wear rate varied when tested at a later date, from one to four years after purchase. 

A possible explanation for those changes in wear rate among tires in the same lot could be attributed to aging and/or
environmental degradation of the tires. To minimize those factors, the agency now purchases a one-year supply of
CMTs at a time and stores them in the basement area of a warehouse which is typically 20 degrees cooler than ambient summer
temperature. 

In addition to the aging/environmental degradation of CMTs affecting the BCWR, the agency believes that the method
of calculating the BCWR may be in error. As stated above, the purpose of using a CMT is to provide a common baseline for
all candidate tires. However, it appears that the practice of relating all new CMTs to all prior CMTs by the procedure
described above has somehow distorted the treadwear grading procedure to the point that treadwear grades of candidate
tires are now highly suspect. 

If, instead of utilizing the BCWR to establish treadwear grades, the wear rates of the CMTs were compared directly
to those of the candidate tires to determine the projected mileage of the candidate tires, much lower and perhaps more
realistic grades would result. In the case of the previous example, the average wear rate for these candidate tires
was 4.90 mils per 1,000 miles when tested. For the CMTs that accompanied these tires, with the same convoy, the average
wear rate was 6.49 mils per 1,000 miles. The actual wearout rate for radial CMTs tested in 1975 was 67,000 miles, which
is equivalent to a grade of 223. By assuming that the wearout for the CMTs remains the same, the calculated wearout for
the tires in question would be 88,700 miles (6.49/4.90 x 67,000). This would be equivalent to a grade of 295 or 280 when
rounded off to the nearest lower 20-point increment. 

The direct comparison of wear rates between CMTs and candidate tires may produce lower and more realistic grades for
tires. It would, however, change the original intent of the CMT, which was to provide a common baseline for comparison,
regardless of when a candidate tire is tested. Further, it would present a problem for the marketing of tires that are
already graded and still in production. Nevertheless, improvement in the treadwear grading procedure appears to
be needed in order to provide treadwear grades that are realistic, consistent, and meaningful to consumers. 



II. Traction 



Traction grades are established on test pads also located at San Angelo, Texas. Two surfaces are used in the test: wet
asphalt and wet concrete. A test trailer is equipped with ASTM E501 standard tires utilized in the tests as control
tires. Two standard tires are inflated to 24 pounds per square inch (psi), statically balanced, allowed to cool to
ambient temperature (with inflation pressure readjusted as necessary), and mounted on the test trailer. Each tire
is then loaded to 1,085 pounds. The trailer is towed by a light truck over the wet asphalt surface at a speed of 40 miles
per hour (mph). One wheel is locked, and the locked-wheel traction coefficient is recorded for that wheel for a period
of 0.5 to 1.5 seconds after lockup. The test is then repeated on the wet concrete surface, locking the same wheel. Those
procedures are repeated 10 times on each surface for each wheel. The 20 measurements taken on each surface are averaged
to find the standard traction coefficient for each surface. Those standard traction coefficients are then utilized
to determine the adjusted traction coefficients of the candidate tires.

Two candidate tires of the same construction type, 
manufacturer, line, and size designation are prepared and 
tested utilizing the same test procedures described above for 
the standard tires, except that the candidate tires are loaded 
to 85 percent of the test loads specified in  575.104(h). The 
adjusted traction coefficients of the candidate tires are 
determined in accordance with  575.104(f)(2) (ix) and (x). 
Once tested, candidate tires are assigned grades ``A'', ``B'', 
or ``C''. A tire that achieved a high level of performance on 
both asphalt (above 0.47 u ) and concrete (above 0.35 u ) is graded 
``A''. A tire achieving at least medium performance on both 
surfaces is graded ``B'' (above 0.38 u  on asphalt and above 0.26 u  
on concrete). A tire achieving relatively low performance on 
either or both surfaces (below 0.38 u  on asphalt or below 0.26 u  
on concrete) is graded ``C''. From examining traction test data, 
NHTSA has observed that while nearly all tires achieve high 
traction values on the wet asphalt surface, very few achieve 
high values on the wet concrete surface. 
NHTSA conducted a statistical analysis of the traction 
test data since 1989 to determine the frequency distribution of 
the traction coefficients of tires tested on both surfaces. 
The analysis showed that the arithmetic mean of the traction 
coefficients of tires on the wet asphalt surface was 0.51 u , and 
the standard deviation was 

#

0.03 u . Assuming a normal 
distribution (in a normal or bell-shaped distribution, one 
standard deviation on both sides of the arithmetic mean 
represents 68.27% of the values included within the limits 
indicated (see ``Statistical Methods,'' by Arkin and Colton, 4th 
Ed. (Rev.), 1958, pages 37 and 38)), it follows that 
approximately 68 percent of the tires tested on the asphalt 
surface would have a traction coefficient greater than 0.48 u , 
but less than 0.54 u . The arithmetic mean of traction 
coefficients of tires tested on the wet concrete surface was 
0.38 u , 

#

0.03 u , indicating that approximately 68 percent of the 
tires tested on the wet concrete surface would have a traction 
coefficient greater than 0.35 u , but less than 0.41 u . 
That analysis suggests that tire traction has improved to 
the point that it may be appropriate to upgrade the standard by 
raising the minimum traction values for each category. For 
example, an ``A'' rating could call for a traction coefficient 
above 0.54 u  on asphalt and above 0.41 u  on concrete; a ``B'' 
rating could be above 0.48 u  on asphalt and above 0.35 u  on 
concrete; and for ``C'', below 0.48 u  on asphalt and below 0.35 u  
on concrete. Alternatively, a new category ``AA'' could be 
created, the lower limit of which could be 0.54 u  for asphalt 
and 0.41 u  for concrete, with the ``A'', ``B'', and ``C'' categories 
remaining as they are. Either of these alternatives would 
result in a more balanced distribution of tires among grades 
``A'', ``B'', and ``C''. 
Another area of increasing concern in traction testing is 
the possible use of a peak tire traction category for testing 
rather than the sliding traction presently measured. 
Contemporary vehicles are increasingly utilizing anti-lock 
brakes where sliding traction is not the primary traction force 
in panic braking. Those vehicles rely on peak tire traction, 
that is, maximum braking action is obtained when the tire is 
still rolling. Although peak tire traction may be desirable 
information for consumers with vehicles equipped with anti-lock 
brakes, high peak traction may compromise other tire 
characteristics such as degradation of traction when cornering. 
If peak traction performance of tires differs substantially 
from sliding traction, an alternative traction grading 
procedure may be necessary. NHTSA needs additional data on the 
measurement of peak traction coefficients and on the 
correlation of peak traction coefficients with stopping 
distance, which may be available from commenters. The agency 
is soliciting any such data. 


III. Temperature Resistance 


The temperature resistance grade is intended to indicate 
the extent to which heat is generated and/or dissipated by a 
given tire, and the capability of the tire to withstand the 
resulting temperature without failure. The heat that is 
generated depends on the amount of energy absorbed by the tire 
in the flexing of the rubber and its reinforcing materials. 
That energy is wasted and appears in the tire as heat. The 
more energy wasted, the greater the amount of heat that is 
generated and, if the tire is not capable of dissipating that 
greater amount of heat and/or if the tire is not able to resist 
the effects of the higher operating temperature that results 
from that greater amount of heat, the lower the temperature 
resistance grade.

Heat buildup in tires is generally caused by vehicle 
overloading, high speed operation, and/or tire underinflation. 
Sustained high temperature can cause structural degeneration of 
the material of the tire and result in reduced tire life or 
potential catastrophic tire failure. A tire's resistance to 
temperature buildup is graded under the UTQGS as ``A'', ``B'', or 
``C'', with ``A'' being the best and ``C'' being the minimum standard 
of performance. Tires of high quality, as a result of superior 
design and construction, can be expected to last longer without 
failure when subjected to sustained high speed operation. 
NHTSA tests tires for temperature resistance using the 
same laboratory test wheel utilized in testing a tire's high 
speed performance under Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 
(FMVSS) No. 109, 

New Pneumatic Tires.

 The high speed 
performance test under FMVSS 109 is run at speeds of up to 85 
mph. The temperature resistance test under the UTQGS, however, 
is run at speeds of up to 115 mph. A tire graded ``A'' has 
successfully completed the test procedure at a sustained speed 
of 115 mph on the test wheel. A grade of ``B'' means that the 
tire has successfully completed the test procedure at speeds 
between 100 mph and 115 mph; and a ``C'' grade indicates 
satisfactory completion of the test at speeds exceeding 85 mph 
but at or below 100 mph. Of the 2,100 tires graded in 1993, 30 
percent were graded ``C'', 50 percent were graded ``B'', and 20 
percent were graded ``A''. 
NHTSA considers temperature resistance a valid safety 
concern and is unaware of any problems with the ratings. While important from a motor vehicle safety standpoint, 
however, the significance of temperature resistance is not so 
widely understood by consumers as the treadwear and traction 
ratings. 
In light of this fact, and recent interest in a rolling 
resistance grade, the agency is considering whether a rolling 
resistance grade could provide equivalent safety information to 
the temperature resistance grade and thereby negate the need 
for temperature resistance grading. The issue of a rolling 
resistance grade arose at the White House Conference on Global 
Climate Change on June 10 and 11, 1993. 
At the White House Conference, a number of measures to 
reduce greenhouse gasses were discussed. One of the many 
measures related to vehicle fuel economy was the increased use 
of low rolling resistance tires in the aftermarket. Michelin 
presented a paper on that issue at a meeting of the Auto and 
Light Truck Workshop of the Transportation Working Group of the 
White House Conference on Global Climate Change on July 1, 
1993. Michelin asserted that the average rolling resistance 
for all-season radial original equipment manufacturer (OEM) 
tires was 22.6 percent less than that for all-season radial 
replacement tires. Further, if replacement tires had the same 
rolling resistance as OEM tires, a 4 percent overall 
improvement in fuel economy could be realized. Finally, 
Michelin announced a manufacturing process by which low rolling 
resistance tires could be produced with no increase in 
inflation pressures. 
As a result of the conference, the Administration issued a 
report on a series of initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions, entitled The Climate Change Action Plan, on October 
19, 1993. Among other things, the Plan calls for reduction of 
U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. 
The Plan contains nearly 50 initiatives to accomplish that 
goal. One of those initiatives calls for DOT, through NHTSA, 
to issue new rules and test procedures requiring tire 
manufacturers to test and label tires relative to their rolling 
resistance. 
This request for comments is part of NHTSA's commitment to 
The Climate Change Action Plan. Because the UTQGS are not 
applicable to truck tires, NHTSA's Office of Research and 
Development will, in a separate but related action, work with 
truck tire manufacturers and truck fleet and owner 
organizations to promote a voluntary truck tire rolling 
resistance program.
