<DOCTITLE>Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange: Proposed Amendment Relating to Delivery Points for the Coffee ``C'' Futures
Contract </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed contract rule change.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange (``CSCE'') has submitted a proposed amendment to its coffee ``C'' futures
contract that would add Miami, Florida as a delivery point, with futures deliveries at that location being subject
to a discount of one and one-quarter cents per pound. In accordance with section 5a(a)(12) of the Commodity Exchange
Act and acting pursuant to the authority delegated by Commission Regulation 140.96, the Acting Director of the Division
of Economic Analysis (``Division'') of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'') has determined,
on behalf of the Commission, that the proposed amendment is of major economic significance. On behalf of the Commission,
the Division is requesting comment on this proposal.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The coffee ``C'' futures contract currently provides for delivery of coffee in CSCE-licensed warehouses located
in the Ports of New York, New Orleans and San Francisco. Under the contract's existing terms, coffee is deliverable
at par in the Port of New York, at a discount of three-quarters of one cent (75 points) in the Port of San Francisco, and
at a discount of one and one-quarter cents per pound in the Port of New Orleans. 



The proposed amendment would establish the Port of Miami, Florida as an additional coffee ``C'' futures delivery
point, with futures deliveries at Miami being subject to a discount of one and one-quarter cents per pound. Under the
proposed amendments, the Port of Miami is defined to include both the Port of Miami and Port Everglades.
 The CSCE proposes to apply the amendment to all currently listed contract months following the last contract month
in which there is an open position on the date that the amendment is made effective and to newly listed contract months.






The CSCE indicates that the proposal to add Miami as a delivery point is justified by the amount of trading activity
in the cash market at that location and that the proposal will be beneficial to those CSCE members and others who use
the contract for hedging. In this respect, information submitted by the CSCE indicates that, during 1992 and 1993,
the Customs District of Miami was the fifth-ranked port of entry in terms of the quantity of coffee imported into the
United States and accounted for eight percent of all coffee entering the United States in 1993. The CSCE also indicates
that there are adequate delivery warehouse facilities in the Port of Miami. 

With respect to the proposed one and one-quarter cents per pound discount for futures deliveries at Miami, the CSCE
also indicated that the proposed discount falls within the range of prevailing differences between the total costs
of shipping coffee to warehouses in Miami and New York from major coffee producing countries in Central and South America.
The CSCE indicated that the total costs of shipping the same growths of coffee to warehouses in Miami and New Orleans
from the producing countries are essentially the same. The CSCE also indicated that information provided to the Exchange
by members of the coffee cash market regarding cash market pricing relationships between Miami and the futures contract's
existing delivery points confirms that the proposed discount is appropriate. 

The Commission is requesting comments specifically in regard to the extent to which the proposed discount of one and
one-quarter cents per pound for futures deliveries in Miami reflects cash marketing pricing relationships between
Miami and the coffee ``C'' futures contract's existing delivery points. 

Copies of the proposed amendment will be available for inspection at the Office of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, 2033 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20581. Copies of the amended terms and conditions can be obtained
through the Office of the Secretariat by mail at the above address or by telephone at (202) 254-6314. 

The materials submitted by the CSCE in support of the proposed amendment may be available upon request pursuant to
the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and the Commission's regulations thereunder (17 CFR part 145 (1987)).
Requests for copies of such materials should be made to the FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Act Compliance Staff of the Office
of the Secretariat at the Commission's headquarters in accordance with CFR 145.7 and 145.8. 

Any person interested in submitting written data, views or arguments on the proposed amendment should send such comments
to Jean A. Webb, Secretary, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20581 by the specified
date.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed contract market rule change. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Citrus Associates of the New York Cotton Exchange (CANYCE) has submitted proposed amendments to its frozen concentrated
orange juice (FCOJ) futures contract. The proposed amendments will reduce the contract's existing discount for
futures delivery at the California delivery points and eliminate the discount applicable to futures delivery at
the contract's Northeastern U.S. delivery points. 



In accordance with section 5a(a)(12) of the Commodity Exchange Act and acting pursuant to the authority delegated
by Commission Regulation 140.96, the Acting Director of the Division of Economic Analysis (Division) of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (Commission) has determined, on behalf of the Commission, that the proposed amendments
are of major economic significance. On behalf of the Commission, the Division is requesting comment on this proposal.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The FCOJ futures contract currently calls for the delivery of frozen concentrated orange juice for manufacturing
meeting the standards for U.S. Grade A, with a Brix value of not less than 62.5 degrees.
 The contract unit currently is 15,000 pounds of orange solids. The contract's existing terms also specify that delivery
of FCOJ may be made either by the transfer of a warehouse receipt representing FCOJ stored in 55-gallon steel drums
in an CANYCE-licensed warehouse, or by the transfer of a shipping certificate representing FCOJ stored in an CANYCE-licensed
tank storage facility. 





The futures contract's existing terms provide that delivery may be made at par at any CANYCE-approved delivery facility
located in specified counties of the state of Florida. In addition, the contract currently provides that delivery
may be made at CANYCE-approved delivery facilities located in Wilmington, Delaware; Port Elizabeth, New Jersey;
and Newark, New Jersey at a discount of three cents per pound of orange solids, and in specified counties in the state
of California at a discount of thirteen cents per pound of orange solids.

 





The proposed amendments will modify the locational price differentials for delivery at the above-noted nonpar delivery
locations. Under the proposed amendments, the existing discount of three cents per pound for delivery at Wilmington,
Delaware; Port Elizabeth, New Jersey; and Newark, New Jersey will be eliminated, with FCOJ at these locations henceforth
being deliverable at par. The proposed amendments also will reduce to 10 cents from 13 cents per pound the discount
for delivery in the specified counties of the state of California. 

The CANYCE intends to apply the proposed amendments to all currently listed futures contract months beginning with
the May 1995 contract month and to all newly listed contract months following its receipt of notice of Commission approval.
In this respect, the CANYCE, prior to listing the May 1995 and July 1995 contract months on April 18, 1994, issued a notice
to all members and member firms of the CANYCE advising these entities that the proposed amendments will be applicable
to the May and July 1995 contract months and to all subsequently listed contract months, subject to Commission approval
of the proposed amendments. 

In support of the proposed amendments, the CANYCE stated that ``[t]he reasons for making the changes in the locational
[price differentials] are: 

(1) The normal differential of basis trades for the northeast ranges from ^5 to +10 putting a differential of zero within
the normal range; and 

(2) The cash market differential between California and Florida ranges from ^33 to +16.5 putting a differential of
^10 within the normal range.'' 

The Commission is requesting comments specifically with respect to the extent to which the proposed locational price
differentials fall within the range of commonly observed commercial price differences between the contract's delivery
points for FCOJ for manufacturing of the same quality. 

Copies of the proposed amendments will be available for inspection at the Office of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, at the above address. Copies of the amended terms and conditions can be obtained through the Office
of the Secretariat by mail at the same address or by telephone at (202) 254-6314. 

The materials submitted by the CANYCE in support of the proposed amendments may be available upon request pursuant
to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and the Commission's regulations thereunder (17 CFR part 145 (1987)).
Requests for copies of such materials should be made to the FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Act Compliance Staff of the Office
of the Secretariat at the above address in accordance with CFR 145.7 and 145.8. 

Any person interested in submitting written data, views, or arguments on the proposed amendments should send such
comments to Jean A. Webb, Secretary, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, at the above address by the specified
date.

<DOCTITLE>Finding of No Significant Impact for the Use of Military Surplus Armored Tanks for Artificial Reef Construction</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and the U.S. Army Materiel Command (AMC), Department of Defense (DoD).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

An environmental assessment on the use of Military Surplus Armored Tanks for Artificial Reef Construction was prepared
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 (

et seq

) and the Council on Environmental Quality Guidelines (40 CFR parts 1500-1508). The environmental assessment
concluded that there will be no significant impact on the environment and that preparation of an Environmental Impact
Statement will not be necessary. Interested parties may submit comments to the address listed below for a 30-day period
from the date of this notice.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

DLA is responsible for overseeing the disposal of excess military assets. The normal disposal protocols for military
tanks involve the selling of demilitarized tanks to salvage companies. However, the size of the current surplus inventory
and the likely growth due to DoD downsizing motivated consideration of other methods of disposition. An environmental
assessment has been prepared to address the proposed use of surplus tanks for reef construction material, possible
alternative approaches, environmental consequences of the proposed action, and measures recommended to mitigate
potentially adverse effects. This environmental assessment has been prepared jointly by the DLA and AMC in accordance
with Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations and DLA implementing regulation DLAR 1000.22, Environmental
Consideration in DLA Actions in the United States.


The proposed action involves the use of as many as 200 surplus military armored tanks for placement in coastal waters
for artificial reef construction. These surplus tanks are located at the Anniston Army Dept (ANAD), Anniston Al.
The Artificial Reef Program is administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) pursuant to 33 USC Section 2104.
Under this program, the COE designates specific areas to be used as artificial reef sites and issues permits to ensure
that only suitable materials are placed in the artificial reef. There has been considerable interest by various coastal
states in using surplus armored tanks as artificial reef material. It is believed that the heavy gauge steel construction
of the tanks will extend the useful life of the artificial reef. Properly designed, constructed, and located, artificial
reefs can enhance recreational and commercial fishing opportunities, increase the production of fishery products,
increase the energy efficiency of recreational and commercial fisheries, and contribute to coastal economies.
DLA and AMC will institute measures which will mitigate potential adverse effects. Tank cleanup and preparation
procedures have been developed to ensure that tanks are cleaned of environmentally harmful materials and that they
meet applicable environmental criteria. These procedures include draining all fluids, removal of the tank engine,
transmission and hydraulic systems, and steam cleaning exterior and interior surfaces. Tank preparation, transportation
and deployment will be in accordance with military operational and safety plans with comprehensive transportation
and deployment plans if performed by nonmilitary activities.
The use of surplus military armored tanks for artificial reef construction materials is not considered a major action
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment or requiring the preparation of an Environmental Impact
Statement. A public comment period regarding the environmental assessment will begin at the time of publication
of this notice and will conclude 30 days following. Copies of the environmental assessment are available for inspection
at the address listed above. Interested parties may also contact the DLA Public Affairs Office at commercial telephone
(703) 274-6135.

<DOCTITLE>Finding of No Significant Impact_Short-Term Storage of Naval Spent Fuel; Final Determination</DOCTITLE>



<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program has prepared an Environmental Assessment of short-term storage of Naval spent
nuclear fuel at shipyards. The preferred alternative is the ``No Action'' alternative. Under this alternative,
Naval spent fuel removed from nuclear powered ships would be retained in specially designed shipping containers
at five shipyards: Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine; Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia;
Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News, Virginia; Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington; and Pearl
Harbor Naval Shipyard in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Naval spent fuel also would remain in the Surface Support Barge at Newport
News Shipbuilding. The Department of Energy (DOE), with the Navy as a cooperating agency, is preparing an Environmental
Impact Statement on longer-term storage of all DOE spent fuel, including Naval spent fuel. The time period evaluated
in the short-term storage Environmental Assessment is the period through implementation of the Record of Decision
for the DOE Environmental Impact Statement. 



The Environmental Assessment discusses alternatives to the preferred alternative and evaluates the environmental
impacts of both the preferred and other alternatives. The Environmental Assessment concludes that the environmental
impact of any of the alternatives would be very small. Therefore, there is no basis for determining that any of these
alternatives would be environmentally preferable to others. The No Action alternative, which is the preferred alternative,
would allow all shipyard work, including refueling and defueling of nuclear powered ships, to continue unimpeded
by the short-term accumulation of Naval spent fuel.

The Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program provided a draft of this Environmental Assessment to officials of Virginia,
Maine, New Hampshire, Washington, and Hawaii for review and comment. Letters were received from Congressman Norm
Dicks of Washington and Mr. T.R. Strong of the State of Washington Department of Health, both of whom agreed that the
No Action alternative is appropriate, and Mr. Brian Choy of the State of Hawaii Office of Environmental Quality Control,
who had no comment.

Based on the analysis in the Environmental Assessment, the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program concluded that the preferred
alternative was not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, within
the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and issued a Finding of No Significant
Impact. In accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality regulations which allow agencies to determine circumstances
under which public review of Finding of No Significant Impact are appropriate, the Program made this Finding available
for public comment for a period of 30 days.

Sixty-eight comment letters were received. The comments contained in these letters and the Naval Nuclear Propulsion
Program responses are presented in a new Appendix 5 to the Environmental Assessment. The Appendix has been placed
in libraries near the shipyards or mailed directly to commenters not located near a shipyard. A summary of the comments
and the responses have been included at the end of this notice.




FINAL DETERMINATION:

 After reviewing and analyzing the comments received, the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program has concluded that the
Finding of No Significant Impact remains valid and the proposed action is not a major Federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment, within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
of 1969, (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). Therefore, the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program has determined that preparation
of an Environmental Impact Statement is not required.

Summary of Public Comments on the Environmental Assessment and Proposed Finding of No Significant Impact and Naval
Nuclear Propulsion Program



All of the comment letters and the responses to the comments are contained in Appendix 5 to the Environmental Assessment.
The most frequent comments and the response to them are summarized below:



Comment: 

The shipyards should not be considered for storage of Naval spent fuel due to proximity to population centers, or proximity
to the ocean or bodies of water.



Response: 

Under the National Environmental Policy Act, the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program is required to consider the full
range of reasonable alternatives, including the alternative of taking no action. The analysis in the Environmental
Assessment demonstrated that the environmental impact of any of the alternatives would be very small. This analysis
took into consideration population data and nearby bodies of water. Therefore, the Program did not eliminate shipyard
locations from consideration based on these characteristics.



Comment: 

Other locations should be considered.



Response: 

For short term storage, the shipyards provide both the physical requirements for storage such as a rail siding or a
storage pad, as well as the administrative and support functions needed to safely store spent fuel. These administrative
and support functions include physical security, radiological monitoring, and emergency response capability.
It would not be practical to provide these administrative and support functions at other sites in the brief time frame
in question. Thus, such alternatives were not ``reasonable'' within the meaning of the Council on Environmental
Quality regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act.



Comment: 

The Program should conduct an Environmental Impact Statement of nationwide scope on spent fuel issues.



Response: 

As discussed in the Environmental Assessment, the Navy is a cooperating agency pursuant to the National Environmental
Policy Act in the DOE's comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement on spent nuclear fuel management, including
Naval spent fuel.



Comment: 

Temporary storage can last longer than planned. The Environmental Assessment should evaluate the impact if another
alternative is not available in June 1995. The DOE Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision are unlikely
to be completed by June 1995. Litigation over the sufficiency of this Environmental Impact Statement could delay
implementation. An alternative allowing removal from the shipyards might not be selected. Some of the alternatives
to be evaluated in the DOE Environmental Impact Statement would require further site specific National Environmental
Policy Act reviews, which would prevent prompt implementation.

Response: 

As discussed in the Environmental Assessment, the Navy is cooperating with the DOE in a comprehensive Environmental
Impact Statement on spent nuclear fuel management, including Naval spent fuel. This Environmental Impact Statement
will evaluate alternatives for spent nuclear fuel management until a permanent repository is available. The Idaho
Federal District Court Order, as modified by the Court acceptance of the agreement among the Navy, DOE, and Idaho,
requires the DOE Environmental Impact Statement to be complete and a Record of Decision issued by June 1995. Some of
the alternatives which are being evaluated in the DOE Environmental Impact Statement will allow routine Naval spent
fuel shipments to be resumed promptly. Therefore, it is by no means certain that storage at shipyards will be extended.
The environmental impact of all of the alternatives being considered in the DOE Environmental Impact Statement will
include any transitional impacts. Thus, the scope of this Environmental Assessment properly is limited to evaluation
of alternatives for short term storage while the DOE's Environmental Impact Statement is being prepared. It would
be inappropriate for the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program to speculate about the outcome of the DOE Environmental
Impact Statement or what action the Federal Government might take.


Comment:

 Department of Energy sites should be considered for short term storage.


Response: 

Section 2.4 of the Environmental Assessment discussed why the Department of Energy sites could not be made available
within the short term and thus are not ``reasonable'' alternatives. Several Department of Energy sites are being
evaluated for long term storage of Naval spent fuel in the Department of Energy Environmental Impact Statement on
spent nuclear fuel management.


Comment:

 The Environmental Assessment does not adequately assess whether containers designed for shipping would be suitable
for the different conditions of storage.


Response: 

As described in the Environmental Assessment, the extremely rugged shipping containers were designed to withstand
severe transportation accidents such as collisions, falls of bridges, fires, and immersion in water. Comparatively
speaking, storage is much less taxing on the structural integrity of the containers. Nevertheless, the EA thoroughly
evaluated the risks of potential accidents which could happen during storage. The shipping containers, in fact,
are overdesigned for storage. Containers designed for transportation provide protection for severe accidents
in excess of what could be reasonably expected to occur during storage.


Comment:

 The Environmental Assessment should consider earthquakes.


Response: 

The physical forces that an earthquake could subject a shipping container to are much less than those involved with
the transportation accidents that the containers were designed to withstand. For example, one of the severe accidents
which shipping containers are designed to withstand is a fall of 30 feet onto an unyielding surface (equivalent to
a fall of 60 feet onto a reinforced concrete surface). Such a fall would subject a container to shock over 100 times greater
than that of a severe earthquake. In practical terms, steel structures far less strong than the massive shipping containers
fare well in actual earthquakes. Therefore, there is no need to evaluate the potential for an earthquake to damage
a shipping container.


Comment:

 The Environmental Assessment underestimated the impacts of severe accidents.


Response: 

The Environmental Assessment evaluated a range of hypothetical accidents which could occur during storage. The
most severe accident evaluated in the Environmental Assessment was an aircraft crash with the potential for breach
of the shipping containers. While extremely unlikely, this is the accident with the greatest potential to damage
the shipping containers during storage. The accident analyses were based on realistic evaluation of what could happen
to Naval spent fuel in shipping containers during the hypothetical accidents. Naval spent fuel is rugged, metallic,
nondispersible material, and it would be unreasonable to conclude that any significant fraction of it could be released
to the atmosphere by any of the accidents considered. Even if the shipping container were to be breached by a large part
from an airplane (which is unlikely given the massive nature of the shipping containers), the Naval spent fuel would
remain in or near the container. There is no mechanism for grinding up the fuel and injecting it into the air. The long
term application of very high heat, such as might be generated by a confined fire with a gasoline truck, would be necessary
to drive some fission products off from exposed Naval spent fuel. Such a fire is not credible in the shipyard environment.
The shipyard fire department is readily available to extinguish any fire quickly. Thus, the accident analyses in
the Environmental Assessment are conservative.

National Assessment Governing Board, Education.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of partially closed meeting.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice sets forth the schedule and proposed agenda of a forthcoming meeting, partially closed, of the National
Assessment Governing Board. This notice also describes the functions of the Board. Notice of this meeting is required
under section 10(a)(2) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. This document is intended to notify the general public
of their opportunity to attend the open portions of the meeting.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The National Assessment Governing Board is established under section 406(i) of the General Education Provisions
Act (GEPA) as amended by section 3403 of the National Assessment of Educational Progress Improvement Act (NAEP Improvement
Act), Title III-C of the Augustus F. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement
Amendments of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-297), (20 U.S.C. 1221e-1).





The Board is established to formulate policy guidelines for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).
The Board is responsible for selecting subject areas to be assessed, developing assessment objectives, identifying
appropriate achievement goals for each grade and subject tested, and establishing standards and procedures for
interstate and national comparisons.

On May 12, two committees will be in open session from 4 p.m. until 6 p.m. The Subject Area Committee 

#

2 will be briefed on the test development work for the NAEP arts education assessment; hear about a national survey
of arts instruction; and review the cognitive item review schedule.


The Committee will also be provided information on the International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). The
Achievement Levels Committee will examine the issues involved in selecting exemplary items for the achievement
levels, and be briefed on the progress of the 1994 level setting activities in geography and history. The committee
will also be briefed on the plans for ``reinvesting'' the 1992 reading achievement levels to be used to report NAEP
results in 1994 at the 4, 8, and 12 grade national levels and state grade 4 level.


On May 13, the Executive Committee will meet in open session from 7 a.m. until 8:30 a.m. The proposed agenda includes
review and discussion of the principles governing the NAEP subject area assessment scheduling, and briefing on the
status of NAEP reauthorization.



Also on May 13, the full Board will convene in open session at 8:45 a.m. The morning session of the full Board meeting,
to 10 a.m., includes approval of the meeting agenda, and a panel presentation on NAEP equity/inclusion issues. Panelists
will be the Department of Education's Assistant Secretaries for the Offices of Civil Rights, Special Education and
Rehabilitative Services, and Educational Research and Improvement. Three committees will be in session from 10
a.m. until 12 Noon. Two of the three committees will meet in open session: the Reporting and Dissemination Committee,
and the Design and Analysis Committee. The Reporting and Dissemination Committee will consider plans for the release
of future NAEP reports. The Design and Analysis Committee will hear a presentation on feasibility studies for reporting
NAEP data below the state level; and discuss score scaling issues.

One committee will meet in partially closed session: Subject Area Committee 

#

1. From 10 a.m. to 11 a.m., the Committee will meet in closed session to hear and discuss the plans for the NAEP U.S. History
Special Study. This meeting must be closed to the public because the Committee will discuss information about NAEP
cognitive items. Premature disclosure of information presented for review might significantly frustrate a proposed
agency action. Such matters are protected by exemption 9(B) of Section 552b(c) of Title 5 U.S.C. The Committee will
meet in open session from 11 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. to discuss the NAEP Civics procurement and the national standards project
timelines.

Beginning at 11:30 a.m. the Subject Area Committee 

#

1 and the Design and Analysis Committee will meet jointly to hear a presentation from Educational Testing Service
on assessment accommodations for individualized educational program (IEP) and limited English proficient (LEP)
students.

The full Board will reconvene in closed session from 12 Noon to 1:15 p.m. During this portion of the meeting a report,


Effective Schools and Instruction in Mathematics, 

will be presented for discussion by staff of the NAEP contractor, Educational Testing Service. The discussion will
include references to specific items from the assessment, the disclosure of which might significantly frustrate
implementation of NAEP. This session must be closed to the public because reference may be made to data which may be
misinterpreted, incorrect, or incomplete. Premature disclosure of this data might significantly frustrate implementation
of a proposed agency action. Such matters are protected by exemption 9(B) of section 552b(c) of Title 5 U.S.C.

The full Board meeting will reopen to the public at 1:15 p.m. and continue until 4:45 p.m. This session of the meeting
will be primarily devoted to a panel presentation by the State Testing Program Directors for California, Connecticut,
Kentucky, Maryland, and North Carolina. The panelists will discuss the processes utilized, in their respective
states, for setting performance standards. The session will conclude with an update on NAEP activities presented
by the Department of Education's Commissioner of the National Center for Educational Statistics.

On May 14, the full Board will be in open session from 9 a.m. until approximately 12 Noon. The agenda for this session
includes a continuation of the presentation on NAEP equity/inclusion issues, followd by Board committee reports.
Records are kept of all Board proceedings and are available for public inspection at the U.S. Department of Education,
National Assessment Governing Board, Suite 825, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., Washington, D.C., from 8:30 a.m.
to 5 p.m.

Railroad Commission of Texas; Tight Formation Determination_Texas-158, Spraberry (Trend Area) Formation
FERC No. JD94-03253T; Preliminary Finding
 


April 19, 1994.
 


The Railroad Commission of Texas (Texas) determined that the Spraberry (Trend Area) Formation (Spraberry Formation),
underlying all of the Aldwell Unit and part of the Merchant Unit in Reagan County, Texas, qualifies as a tight formation
under section 107(c)(5) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA). 

For the reasons discussed below, the Commission issues this Notice of Preliminary Finding that the determination
is not supported by substantial evidence. 



Background 



1. Commission Regulations 



To qualify a formation as a tight formation,  271.703(c)(2)(i)(A) of the Commission's regulations requires
the jurisdictional agency to determine that the expected 

in situ

 (matrix and natural fracture) gas permeability throughout the pay section is 0.1 millidarcy (md) or less.
 Section 271.703(c)(2)(i)(B) requires the jurisdictional agency to show that the expected pre-stimulation stabilized
natural gas flow rate, against atmospheric pressure, for wells completed for production in the formation is not expected
to exceed the depth-dependent maximum flow rate specified in the table in that section (217 Mcf per day in this case).
 Finally,  271.703(c)(2)(i)(C) requires the jurisdictional agency to show that wells completed for production
in the formation are not expected to produce more than five barrels of crude oil per day, prior to stimulation.
 







2. Texas' Determination 



On March 7, 1994, the Commission received Texas' notice determining that the Spraberry Formation underlying all
of the Aldwell Unit and part of the Merchant Unit in Reagan County, Texas, qualifies as a tight formation. Hardy Oil
& Gas U.S.A., Inc. is the applicant before Texas. The recommended area, which is approximately 24,136 acres in
size, is within the same 150-mile long Spraberry Trend Field as the acreage involved with two prior proceedings involving
the Spraberry Formation (Texas-81 and Texas-156). 

The record shows that the Spraberry Formation in the recommended area consists of four intervals_the Upper Spraberry,
Lower Spraberry, JoMill, and Dean_that have been producing oil and/or gas for at least 30 years. The record also shows
that natural fractures are present throughout the formation and that approximately 233 wells have penetrated the
Spraberry Formation within the recommended area.
 





Texas' conclusion that the Spraberry Formation meets the Commission's permeability guideline is based on: 

(1) 1992 pre-stimulation pressure buildup (PBU) test data from the SAU Well No. 25-2 (

#

25-2 well), which is within the recommended area; 

(2) Type curve data from two stimulated Spraberry wells within the recommended area and thirty-two stimulated Spraberry
wells outside the recommended area; 

(3) 1992 PBU test data from four wells located from 12.5 to 54 miles away from the recommended area;
 and 





(4) A table from the ``Atlas of Major Texas Oil Reservoirs'' (1983) showing that the average permeability to oil in
the Spraberry (Trend Area) formation is zero.

Texas' finding that the formation meets the Commission's oil and gas flow rate guidelines is based on pre-stimulation
flow rates from the 

#

25-2 well and test results from the four PBU wells mentioned in (3) above. 



Discussion
 


Our review shows that Texas' determination is based on permeability and flow rate data from wells that began producing
from the Spraberry Formation between 1984 to 1992 although the Spraberry Formation has been produced for more than
30 years. Moreover, the five 1992 PBU data wells represent the initial capabilities of the least permeable lenses
that ``remain to be produced'' in the Spraberry Formation. In addition, the ``near original'' initial pressures
in two of these PBU wells show that the low permeabilities and flow rates are not the result of pressure depletion. However,
Commission records show that reservoir pressures in the Merchant, Aldwell, and Texas-81 Midkiff Units had
declined from between 2,000 and 2,200 psi to only 231 psi, 1,000 psi, and 1,050 psi, respectively, when unitized water
injection commenced in the 1960's for the purpose of increasing pressure. Therefore, we find that the permeability
and flow rate data in the record do not demonstrate that the formation meets the Commission's permeability and flow
rate guidelines. 

In a previous tight formation proceeding, we found that the characteristics of a formation before the onset of sustained
production from that formation should be evaluated to determine whether that formation meets the tight formation
guidelines.

6

 We have also held that current-day gas permeability and flow rate characteristics which are the result of years of
sustained production do not demonstrate that a formation is a tight formation.

7

 Accordingly, we find that the record lacks evidence showing that ``near original'' pressures are found throughout
the recommended area and that the 1992 PBU tests do not sufficiently represent initial conditions found throughout
the Spraberry Formation. 






We also note that in Order No. 99, we clarified that the objective of the tight formation rule was to ``provide incentives
to develop tight formations, not to provide incentives to develop all formations with low pre-stimulation production
rates.''

8

 Accordingly, we did not intend to qualify large, densely drilled areas based on what ``remains to be produced.'' 





Moreover, we have defined a tight formation as ``a sedimentary layer of rock cemented together in a manner that greatly
hinders the flow of gas through the rock.''

9

 We note, however, that the Spraberry Formation originally was a crude oil reservoir with a solution gas drive. Therefore,
even though the Spraberry may have exhibited little or no effective permeability to gas and no gas flow prior to the
onset of sustained oil production (i.e., at initial conditions), our review shows that this is due to the fact that
the pore spaces within Spraberry reservoirs were filled with oil and water.

10

 Thus, we find that the record does not show that the Spraberry meets the Commission's definition of a tight formation
(i.e., that the Spraberry is cemented together in a manner that greatly hinders the flow of gas through the rock).

11

 







In addition to concerns that the Spraberry appears to be the type of formation that does not meet the intent of the tight
formation regulations, our review also shows that the record does not reflect the natural fracture permeability
in the formation.

12

 The Commission's records show that the original permeability of the formation (prior to sustained production and
pressure depletion) substantially exceeded 0.1 md due to the existence of interconnected, well-developed natural
fractures that extend throughout the Spraberry Formation. The Commission's records also show that wells located
parallel to the trend of the fractures have better reservoir permeability than those located perpendicular to the
trend, but that natural fracture permeability is adversely effected by loss of reservoir pressure with sustained
production. Although the PBU tests in the 

#

25-2 well show a total permeability (matrix and fracture) of less than 0.1 md within the well's drainage area,
the tested intervals produced high volumes of water during the tests, the reservoir pressure measured during the
tests was at least 400-600 psi lower than original pressures found in the formation, and the record contains
no evidence that any of the tested intervals was actually completed for production.

13

 Therefore, it appears that the 

#

25-2 well's low permeability is the result of its location in an area of lower reservoir quality, and that the
record does not contain sufficient evidence that the well's permeability reflects the formation's original permeability
throughout the recommended area. We also find that oil and gas flow rate data from one well (the 

#

25-2) does not provide sufficient evidence to show that the formation meets the oil and gas flow rate guidelines.

In addition, we find that the record does not contain substantial evidence supporting the use of oil production type
curve analysis as a method to calculate effective gas permeability. First, all 34 type curve wells were analyzed with
equations where current gas-oil ratios were used, as well as a single current reservoir pressure of 1,000 psia and
the corresponding fluid properties at that pressure.
 Second, the oil permeabilities used in the calculations were derived by the analysis of the historical oil production
from the 34 wells. It is not clear how the oil permeabilities thus calculated can be used to calculate gas permeability
before sustained production.




Moreover, the record does not show which of the four productive intervals was represented in each type curve well.
Our review of the record further shows that in seven instances, the gas-oil ratios and historical oil production from
more than one well were combined to arrive at a single permeability value. This method is not supported, however, because
the record does not explain why these values properly reflect the proportion of the permeability and flow rates attributable
to individual wells. Finally, although the record shows that all 34 type curve wells were selected based on the criteria
that daily oil production rates were available, the only two type curve wells within the recommended area were analyzed
using monthly oil production rates. In addition, Texas approved prior Spraberry proceedings in which the applicants
indicated that daily production was used because monthly production did not result in enough definition in the type
curve for a precise determination of permeability. Therefore, Texas should provide additional support showing
the basis for its acceptance of the two type curve wells within the recommended area as useable permeability data wells.


Under  275.202(a) of the regulations, the Commission may make a preliminary finding, before any determination
becomes final, that the determination is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Based on the foregoing
facts and discussion, the Commission hereby makes a preliminary finding that Texas' determination is not supported
by substantial evidence in the record upon which it was made. Texas or the applicant may, within 30 days from the date
of this preliminary finding, submit written comments and request an informal conference with the Commission pursuant
to  275.202(f) of the regulations. A final Commission order will be issued within 120 days after the issuance
of this preliminary finding.

 


By direction of the Commission.

April 19, 1994.



Take notice that on April 1, 1994, Acacia Natural Gas Corporation (Acacia) filed pursuant to  284.123(b)(2)
of the Commission's regulations, a petition for rate approval requesting that the Commission approve as fair and
equitable a rate of $0.145 per MMBtu for transportation services performed under section 311(a)(2) of the Natural
Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA).

Acacia states that it is an intrastate pipeline within the meaning of section 2(16) of the NGPA and it owns and operates
an intrastate pipeline system in the State of Oklahoma. Acacia proposes an effective date of April 1, 1994.

Pursuant to  284.123(b)(2)(ii), if the Commission does not act within 150 days of the filing date, the rate will
be deemed to be fair and equitable and not in excess of an amount which interstate pipelines would be permitted to charge
for similar transportation service. The Commission may, prior to the expiration of the 150-day period, extend the
time for action or institute a proceeding to afford parties an opportunity for written comments and for the oral presentation
of views, data, and arguments.

Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products: Granting of the Application for Interim Waiver and Publishing
of the Petition for Waiver of DOE Furnace Test Procedures From Bard Manufacturing Company
 






<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Department of Energy.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Today's notice publishes a letter granting an Interim Waiver to Bard Manufacturing Company (Bard) from the existing
Department of Energy (DOE) test procedure regarding blower time delay for the company's DCC and DCL series central
furnaces.






Today's notice also publishes a ``Petition for Waiver'' from Bard. Bard's Petition for Waiver requests DOE to grant
relief from the DOE furnace test procedure relating to the blower time delay specification. Bard seeks to test using
a blower delay time of 60 seconds for its DCC and DCL series central furnaces instead of the specified 1.5 minute delay
between burner on-time and blower on-time. The Department is soliciting comments, data, and information respecting
the Petition for Waiver.










</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Public Law 94-163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy
Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Public Law 95-619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation
Act of 1987 (NAECA), Public Law 100-12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA
1988), Public Law 100-357, and the Energy policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), Public Law 102-486, 106 Stat. 2776,
which requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer
products, including furnaces. The intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption
that will assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR part 430, Subpart
B.





The Department amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 on September 26, 1980, creating the
waiver process. 45 FR 64108. Thereafter, DOE further amended the appliance test procedure waiver process to allow
the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver
from test procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures.
51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986.



The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to waive temporarily, test procedures for a particular basic model
when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing according
to the prescribed test procedures, or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner
so unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers
generally remain in effect until final test procedures amendments become effective, resolving the problem that
is the subject of the waiver.

The Interim Waiver provisions added by the 1986 amendment allow the Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver when it is
determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver is denied,
if it appears likely that Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines that it would
be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition for Waiver.
An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the Petition for
Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary.


On March 8, 1994, Bard filed an Application for Interim Waiver regarding blower time delay. Bard's Application seeks
an Interim Waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute time delay between the ignition of the burner
and starting of the circulating air blower. Instead, Bard requests the allowance to test using a 60-second blower
time delay when testing its DCC and DCL series central furnaces. Bard states that the 60-second delay is indicative
of how these furnaces actually operate. Such a delay results in an increase in AFUE of 0.6 to 1.0 percent points. Since
current DOE test procedures do not address this variable blower time delay, Bard asks that the Interim Waiver be granted.

The Department has published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on August 23, 1993, (58 FR 44583) to amend the furnace
test procedure, which addresses the above issue.

Previous waivers for this type of time blower delay control have been granted by DOE to Coleman Company, 50 FR 2710,
January 18, 1985; Magic Chef Company, 50 FR 41553, October 11, 1985; Rheem Manufacturing Company, 53 FR 48574, December
1, 1988, 56 FR 2920, January 25, 1991, 57 FR 10166, March 24, 1992, and 57 FR 34560, August 5, 1992; Trane Company, 54 FR

9, 1991; Goodman Manufacturing Corporation, 56 FR 51713, October 15, 1991, and 57 FR 27970, June 23, 1992; The Ducane
Company Inc., 56 FR 63943, December 6, 1991, 57 FR 10163, March 24, 1992, and 58 FR 68134, December 23, 1993; Armstrong
Air Conditioning, Inc., 57 FR 899, January 9, 1992, 57 FR 10160, March 24, 1992, 57 FR 10161, March 24, 1992, 57 FR 39193,
August 28, 1992, and 57 FR 54230, November 17, 1992; Thermo Products, Inc., 57 FR 903, January 9, 1992; Consolidated
Industries Corporation, 57 FR 22220, May 27, 1992; Evcon Industries, Inc., 57 FR 47847, October 20, 1992; and Bard
Manufacturing Company, 57 FR 53733, November 12, 1992. Thus, it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be
granted for blower time delay.

In those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated based upon DOE having
granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested and rated
for energy consumption on a comparable basis.

Therefore, based on the above, DOE is granting Bard an Interim Waiver for its DCC and DCL series central furnaces. Pursuant
to paragraph (e) of  430.27 of the Code of Federal Regulations part 430, the following letter granting the Application
for Interim Waiver to Bard was issued.

Pursuant to paragraph (b) of 10 CFR 430.27, DOE is hereby publishing the ``Petition for Waiver'' in its entirety. The
petition contains no confidential information. The Department solicits comments, data, and information respecting
the petition.

Mr. Dick Hann,


Manager, Heating and Application Engineering, Bard Manufacturing Company, 1914 Randolph Drive, Bryan, OH 43506


Dear Mr. Hanna: This is in response to your March 8, 1994, Application for Interim Waiver and Petition for Waiver from
the Department of Energy (DOE) test procedure regarding blower time delay for Bard Manufacturing Company (Bard)
DCC and DCL series central furnaces.

Manufacturing Company, 57 FR 53733, November 12, 1992. Thus, it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be
granted for blower time delay.
Bard's Application for Interim Waiver does not provide sufficient information to evaluate what, if any, economic
impact or competitive disadvantage Bard will likely experience absent a favorable determination on its application.
However, in those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated, based upon
DOE having granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested
and rated for energy consumption on a comparable basis.
Therefore, Bard's Application for an Interim Waiver from the DOE test procedure for its DCC and DCL series central
furnaces regarding blower time delay is granted.
Bard shall be permitted to test its DCC and DCL series central furnaces on the basis of the test procedures specified
in 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B, Appendix N, with the modification set forth below:
(i) Section 3.0 in Appendix N is deleted and replaced with the following paragraph:
3.0 Test Procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified in Section 9 in ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82
with the exception of Sections 9.2.2, 9.3.1, and 9.3.2, and the inclusion of the following additional procedures:
(ii) Add a new paragraph 3.10 in Appendix N as follows:
3.20 Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the cool-down
test and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature, using the
thermocouple grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner start-up,
delay the blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t^) unless: (1) the furnace employs a single motor to drive the power burner
and the indoor air circulation blower, in which case the burner and blower shall be started together; or (2) the furnace
is designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case the fan control shall
be permitted to start the blower; or (3) the delay time results in the activation of a temperature safety device which
shuts off the burner, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the latter case, if the
fan control is adjustable, set it to start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control is permitted to
start the blower, measure time delay (t^) using a stop watch. Record the measured temperature. During the heat-up
test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain the draft in the flue pipe within 

#

0.01 inch of water column of the manufacturer's recommended on-period draft.
This Interim Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements and all allegations submitted by the company.
This Interim Waiver may be removed or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying the
application is incorrect.
The Interim Waiver shall remain in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE acts on the Petition for Waiver, whichever
is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180-day period, if necessary.

ACTION:

 Notice of the 1994 EPA SO

2

 Allowance Auctions Results.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to Title IV of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR part 73, the EPA is responsible for implementing a program to reduce
emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO

2

), a 
precursor of acid rain. The centerpiece of the SO

2

 control program is the allocation of transferable allowances, or authorizations to emit SO

2

, which are distributed in limited quantities to existing utility units and which eventually must be held by virtually
all utility units to cover their SO

2

 emissions. These allowances may be transferred among polluting sources and others, so that market forces may govern
their ultimate use and distribution, resulting in the most cost-effective sharing of the emissions control burden.




EPA is directed under Section 416 of the Act to conduct annual sales and 
auctions of a small portion of allowances (2.8%) withheld from the total allowances 
allocated to utilities each year. Sales and auctions are expected to stimulate and support the allowance market and
to provide a public source of allowances, particularly to new units for which no allowances are allocated. In the Fall
of 1992, EPA delegated the administration of the EPA allowance auctions and sales to the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT).
Today, the Acid Rain Division is giving notice of the results of the second 
annual SO

2

 allowance auctions that were conducted by the CBOT on March 28, 1994. 

For rules governing the conduct of the auctions and sales see 40 CFR part 73, subpart E. 



I. Offers 



A. Total Allowances Available for Auction 



In the spot auction (year 1995 allowances sold), a total of 108,001 allowances were offered for sale: 50,000 that were
withheld from the utilities and an additional 58,001 that were voluntarily contributed from utilities. In the 6-year
advance auction (year 2000 allowances sold), a total of 75,000 allowances were offered for sale: 25,000 that were
unsold from the 1993 direct sale and an additional 50,000 that were contributed from utilities. In the 7-year advance
auction (year 2001 allowances sold), a total of 147,000 allowances were offered for sale: 100,000 that were withheld
from the utilities and an additional 47,000 that were contributed. The minimum prices that utilities would accept
for their contributed allowances are listed in Table 1.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (Pub. L. 92-463), the Environmental Protection Agency gives
notice of a meeting of the Effluent Guidelines Task Force (EGTF). The EGTF is a subcommittee of the National Advisory
Council for Environmental Policy and Technology (NACEPT), the external policy advisory board to the Administrator
of EPA. 


The EGTF was established in July of 1992 to advise EPA on the Effluent Guidelines Program, which develops regulations
for dischargers of industrial wastewater pursuant to Title III of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). The
Task Force consists of members appointed by EPA from industry, citizen groups, state and local government, the academic
and scientific communities, and EPA regional offices. The Task Force was created to offer advice to the Administrator
on the long-term strategy for the effluent guidelines program, and particularly to provide recommendations on a
process for expediting the promulgation of effluent guidelines. The Task Force generally does not discuss specific
effluent guideline regulations currently under development. 
The meeting agenda will include discussions on draft recommendations regarding fostering pollution prevention
in effluent guidelines, and improving the project management and data collection processes for effluent guidelines.
There will also be discussions on the methodology for conducting preliminary industry studies. 
The meeting will be open to the public. Limited seating for the public is available on a first-come, first-served basis.
The public may submit written comments to the Task Force regarding improvements to the Effluent Guidelines program.
Comments should be sent to Eric Strassler at the above address. Comments submitted by May 3 will be considered by the

<DOCTITLE>Receipt of an Application for an Experimental Use Permit for Use of Glufosinate-Ammonium on Herbicide Tolerant Corn
Plants </DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On March 11, 1994, EPA received from Hoechst Celanese Corp., an application for an Experimental Use Permit (EUP) for
the use of Ignite Herbicide which contains the herbicide glufosinate-ammonium, on corn plants genetically modified
to be tolerant to this herbicide. Due to recent interest in the introduction of genetically modified herbicide tolerant
plants into commercial agriculture, the Agency has determined that this application may be of regional and national
significance. Therefore, in accordance with 40 CFR 172.11(a), the Agency is soliciting public comments on this application.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On March 11, 1994, an application for an EUP was received from Hoechst Celanese Corp., Route 202-206, P.O. Box
2500, Somerville, New Jersey 08876-1258 for the use of Ignite Herbicide (EPA Reg. No. 8340-42), which
contains the herbicide glufosinate-ammonium, on corn plants genetically modified to be tolerant to the herbicide.
Ignite tolerant corn has been genetically transformed by inserting a gene identified as the Bialophos Resistance
Gene (BAR) containing the information to produce the enzyme, Phosphinotricin Acetyl Transferase (PAT), which detoxifies
the herbicide during plant metabolism. The requested EUP for the use of Ignite will be conducted in concert with an
EUP for a plant pesticide (66737-EUP-1) which was granted to Ciba Seeds for the use and evaluation of a B.t.-derived
insect control protein in the corn plant. A request for extension of this EUP is currently under review. The addition
of the herbicide resistance gene in combination with the insect control protein to the corn plant provides a convenient
marker to confirm the presence of the insect control protein. Application of Ignite Herbicide provides a quality
control check for this protein and will also selectively eliminate plants that do not contain it. 


A notice of the issuance of EUP 66737-EUP-1 to Ciba Seeds for testing of transgenic corn was published in
the 

Federal Register

 of December 27, 1993 (58 FR 68409). The notice of receipt of the EUP was published on March 31, 1993 (58 FR 16827), and
an extension of the comment period was published on May 7, 1993 (58 FR 27284). A notice of receipt of the request for extension
of the EUP was published on March 11, 1994 (59 FR 11600). These notices contain information related specifically to
the genetic modification of the corn plants which will be treated with Ignite under the proposed herbicide EUP.

The purpose of the proposed EUP for the use of Ignite Herbicide as stated on the product label is for evaluation as a selective
herbicide to determine weed control and Ignite (glufosinate-ammonium) tolerance in corn. The product will be applied
as foliar sprays using ground application equipment only to transgenic corn that has been genetically modified for
crop tolerance to glufosinate-ammonium.

The objectives for the testing program are stated to be: (1) Evaluate product efficacy for use in plant breeding by
selective elimination of non-transgenic corn plants, (2) evaluate the tolerance of the transgenic plants to the
herbicide, (3) determine efficacy of transgenic plants for insect control when used in combination with, Ignite
and (4) for production of hybrid plants for use in feeding and safety studies in experimental animals.

The application for the EUP requests use of 454.7 pounds of the active ingredient on a total of 157.3 acres of corn for
the time period from approval of the permit until October 1, 1995. Testing is proposed for the states of Florida, Hawaii,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. No petition for
temporary tolerance was submitted with this application since the treated crop will be destroyed or used only for
research purposes.

Upon review of the EUP request, any comments received in response to this notice and any other relevant information,
EPA will decide whether to issue or deny the EUP. If issued, EPA will set conditions under which the experiments are
to be conducted. Any issuance of an EUP by the Agency will be announced in the 

Federal Register

.
EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs has a Public Docket Room where a copy of the EUP application deleted of all ``Confidential
Business Information'' will be available for public inspection. The Public Docket Room is located at Rm. 1128, Crystal
Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA; the hours of operation are from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through
Friday, excluding legal holidays.

<USDEPT>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Comment Sought on Requests to Waive Section 90.603(C) to Permit Wireline Common Carriers to Hold SMR Licenses



April 12, 1994.




The Commission seeks comment on six requests for waiver of  90.603(c), 47 CFR 90.603(c), of the Commission's
rules, which prohibits wireline telephone common carriers from holding Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) base station
licenses. Specifically, these requests are: (1) Southwestern Bell Corporation (SBC) Request for Permanent Waiver;
(2) Bell Atlantic Enterprises International, Inc. (Bell Atlantic) Request for Rule Waiver; (3) US West Paging, Inc.
(USWP) Request for Permanent Waiver; (4) RAM Mobile Data USA Limited (RMD) Request for Transfer of Control and Rule
Waiver; (5) Cass Cable TV, Inc. (Cass Cable) Request for Rule Waiver; and (6) American Paging, Inc. (API) Request for
Rule Waiver.

The SBC, Bell Atlantic and USWP waiver requests stem from a 1992 Order that had terminated all conditional waivers
of Section 90.603(c) that had been previously granted, but gave recipients of those waiver grants an opportunity
to rejustify their waivers. See Order in PR Docket No. 86-3, 57 FR 53293, November 9, 1992, 7 FCC Rcd 6879 (1992).
By the terms of the 1992 Order, SBC, Bell Atlantic, and USWP continue to hold SMR interests pending the resolution of
their waiver rejustification requests.

SBC, Bell Atlantic and USWP maintain that a waiver is justified because the regulatory concerns underlying the wireline
restriction are no longer justified. They further allege that a waiver is warranted because continued operation
of their SMR systems would serve the public interest. In addition, Bell Atlantic states that a waiver is justified
because its SMR systems serve markets outside of its parent's wireline areas. At a minimum, SBC requests the Commission
to continue its waiver until the wireline prohibition is reexamined.

In addition, there are three other requests filed by RMD, Cass Cable and API. RMD and API each allege that a waiver is
warranted because their innovative new service offerings would serve the public interest and are consistent with
Commission policy. API further states that a waiver is justified because it will not be operating in any area where
its parent holds wireline interests and will not be interconnecting with any parent-owned wireline. Cass Cable maintains
that the concerns which prompted the Commission to restrict wireline ownership of SMR licenses are no longer operable
or, in any case, do not apply to them. Cass Cable also agreed, if the Commission so requires, to forego SMR service in
areas where its affiliate provides wireline service.

We solicit comments on all aspects of the waiver requests filed by SMC, Bell Atlantic, USWP, RMD, Cass Cable, and API.
Comments should be filed on or before May 20, 1994. Reply comments should be filed on or before June 3, 1994. Comments
and reply comments should be addressed to: Rules Branch, Land Mobile and Microwave Division, Private Radio Bureau,
room 5202, STP 1700A1, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554. By requesting comments on the instant

<DOCTITLE>CoreStates Financial Corp.; Acquisition of Company Engaged in Nonbanking Activities</DOCTITLE>


CoreStates Financial Corp., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (Applicant), has applied pursuant to Section 4(c)(8)
of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) and  225.23 of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 22.23) to acquire
all of the voting securities of Rittenhouse Financial Services, Inc., Radnor, Pennsylvania (Company), and thereby
engage in providing investment advisory services to trusts, estates, corporations, pension and profit sharing
plans, registered investment companies, banks, thrifts, and individuals, including the exercise of investment
discretion on behalf of individuals who do not qualify as institutional investors. Such activities will be conducted
throughout the United States.
Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
that the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires
that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine
that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case
that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public
benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects.
A particular activity may be found to meet the closely related to banking test if it is demonstrated that banks have
generally provided the proposed activity; that banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally
similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity; or that banks
generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their provision
in a specialized form.

v. 

Board of Governors

, 516 F.2d 1229, 1237 (D.C. Cir. 1975). In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that
the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement
Regarding Regulation Y (49 FR 806 (1984).
Applicant asserts that the proposed investment advisory services are permissible under  225.25(b)(4)(ii) and 225.25(b)(4)(iii).
In particular, Applicant asserts that  225.25(b)(4)(iii) of the Board's Regulation Y permits the provision of discretionary
portfolio investment advisory services to customers other than institutional customers, when such services are
not provided in combination with brokerage services as described in  225.25(b)(15) of the Board's Regulation Y. See
12 CFR 225.25(b)(4)(iii). In addition, Applicant contends that previous Board orders have approved portfolio management
services to individuals on a discretionary basis. 

See Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation

, 68 Federal Reserve Bulletin 782 (1982); 

Credit Suisse

, 73 Federal Reserve Bulletin 160 (1987); 

Creditanstalt-Bankverein

, 72 Federal Reserve Bulletin 63 (1982).
In order to satisfy the proper incident to banking test, section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act requires the Board to find that
the performance of the activities by Company can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as
greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency that outweigh possible adverse effects, such
as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking
practices. Applicant believes that the proposed activities will benefit the public by enabling Applicant to provide
a broader range of services to its customers and thereby enhance Applicant's ability to compete and expand its participation
in the investment advisory business. Applicant also believes that the proposed activities will not result in any
unsound banking practices or other adverse effects.
In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice
of the proposal is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application
and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the
BHC Act.
Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551, not later than May 16, 1994. Any request for a hearing
on this application must, as required by  262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be accompanied
by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically
any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating
how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.
This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES</USDEPT>



<USBUREAU>Agency for Health Care Policy and Research</USBUREAU>


Process for Determining Need for Updates of Clinical Practice Guidelines


The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) announces a process for determining when updates are needed
of AHCPR-supported clinical practice guidelines. The process consists of obtaining information about new scientific
evidence or new technologies, soliciting opinions from the public, and convening a public meeting to receive relevant
information. Comments on the process are invited.


Background


The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101-239) added a new Title IX to the Public Health Service
Act (the Act), which established the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) to enhance the quality, appropriateness,
and effectiveness of health care services, and access to such services. (See 42 U.S.C. 299-299c-6 and
1320b-12.) The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Reauthorization Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-410),
enacted on October 13, 1992, extended the authorization of AHCPR and amended certain provisions related to the development
of clinical practice guidelines. In keeping with its legislative mandates, AHCPR, through the Office of the Forum
for Quality and Effectiveness in Health Care (Forum), arranges for the development, periodic review, and updating
of clinically relevant guidelines that may be used by physicians, other health care practitioners, educators, and
consumers to assist in determining how diseases, disorders, and other health conditions can most effectively and
appropriately be prevented, diagnosed, treated, and clinically managed. The AHCPR also supports development,
periodic review, and updating of medical review criteria, standards of quality, and performance measures, based
on the guidelines.
Section 912 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 299b-1(b)), as amended by Public Law 102-410, requires that the guidelines:
1. Be based on the best available research and professional judgment;
2. Be presented in formats appropriate for use by physicians, other health care practitioners, medical educators,
medical review organizations, and consumers;
3. Be presented in treatment-specific or condition specific forms appropriate for use in clinical practice, educational
programs, and reviewing quality and appropriateness of medical care;
4. Include information on the risks and benefits of alternative strategies for prevention, diagnosis, treatment,
and management of the particular health condition(s); and
5. Include information on the costs of alternative strategies for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management
of the particular health condition(s), where cost information is available and reliable.
Section 913 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 299b-2) describes two mechanisms through which AHCPR may arrange for development
of guidelines:

1. Panels of qualified private sector experts and health care consumers may be established; and
2. Contracts may be awarded to public and private nonprofit organizations. Guideline contractors are assisted by
panels of private sector experts and health care consumers approved by AHCPR.
Section 914(a) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 299b-3(a)), as amended by Public Law 102-410, identifies factors
to be considered in establishing priorities for guideline topics, including the extent to which the guidelines would:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940425-2-00060 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940425-2-00046 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

1. Improve methods for disease prevention;
2. Improve methods of diagnosis, treatment, and clinical management for the benefit of a significant number of individuals;
3. Reduce clinically significant variations among clinicians in the particular services and procedures utilized
in making diagnoses and providing treatments; and
4. Reduce clinically significant variations in the outcomes of health care services and procedures.
Also, in accordance with Title IX of the PHS Act and section 1142 of the Social Security Act, the AHCPR Administrator
is to assure that the needs and priorities of the Medicare program are reflected appropriately in the priorities for
development of guidelines.


Clinical Practice Guidelines Released and Under Development


The following AHCPR-supported guidelines have been released and disseminated widely:



 1. Acute Pain Management: Operative or Medical Procedures and Trauma
 2. Urinary Incontinence in Adults

<TEXT>
 

1. Urinary Incontinence in Adults 
2. Acute Pain Management: Operative or Medical Procedures and Trauma 


Process for Determining Need for Guideline Updates 


Information regarding the need for a guideline update will be obtained from several sources. 
1. Not later than 24 months following the release of an AHCPR-supported guideline, the Office of the Forum will arrange
for a survey of subsequently published scientific literature in the topic areas addressed by the guideline. The purpose
of this survey is to determine the volume of new scientific evidence, its quality, and the likelihood that such information
would cause a change in the guideline's recommendations. 
2. The AHCPR is required by section 914(a) (42 U.S.C. 
299b-3(a)) to publish annually in the 

Federal Register

 a list of guideline topics under consideration for development. This annual notice will also include a listing of
those guidelines which have been published by AHCPR and for which updates are being contemplated. 
Comments will be solicited from the public regarding the availability of new scientific evidence or new technologies
that may warrant the updating of a clinical practice guideline. 
3. Other information relevant to the updating of guidelines may be obtained from evaluation studies conducted to
examine the implementation or effects of the guidelines; from development and use of guideline-derived medical
review criteria, performance measures, and standards of quality; or from other related activities. 
4. When sufficient data are obtained from the above sources to indicate that a guideline update may be needed, a public
meeting to address the need for and timing of an update will be convened. This meeting will provide an opportunity for
interested parties to contribute relevant information and comments, including new scientific evidence not available
at the time the guideline was written. 
The Office of the Forum will review all the information and scientific evidence obtained in steps 1 through 4 above.
When the need for a guideline update has been established, the Forum will recommend the update and the timing of the
update to the AHCPR Administrator. Following administrative approval, and as allowed by available resources, AHCPR
will arrange for the development of the guideline update by a panel of private sector experts and consumers or a contractor
assisted by such a panel. 


Request for Comments 


Written comments on the process are invited. The AHCPR will not respond to individual comments, but will consider
all comments in determining future modifications to the guideline update process. Comments, in writing, should
be submitted by June 24, 1994, to: Linda K. Demlo, Ph.D., Director, Office of Program Development, AHCPR, suite 603,
2101 East Jefferson Street, Rockville, Maryland 20852. All comments will be available for public inspection at the
Office of Program Development, telephone (301) 594-1457, weekdays between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. 


For Additional Information 


Additional information on the guideline development process is contained in the AHCPR Program Note, ``Clinical
Practice Guideline Development,'' dated August 1993. This document describes AHCPR's activities with respect
to clinical practice guidelines, including the process and criteria for selecting panels. This document may be obtained
from the AHCPR Publications Clearinghouse, P.O. Box 8547, Silver Spring, MD 20907; or call Toll-Free: 1-800-358-9295.

Also, information may be obtained by contacting Carole Hudgings, Ph.D., Acting Director, Office of the Forum for
Quality and Effectiveness in Health Care, Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, Willco Building, 6000 Executive

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Methodology for Establishing Priorities for Health Care Technology Assessments</DOCTITLE>



The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) announces a proposed methodology to be used for establishing
priorities for health care technology assessments conducted by AHCPR's Office of Health Technology Assessment
(OHTA). The methodology consists of weighted criteria, which are based on a study by the Institute of Medicine, statutory
requirements, and the results of a public meeting held by the Technology Assessment Task Force of AHCPR's National
Advisory Council on Health Policy, Research, and Evaluation. 



Background 



The AHCPR was established by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101-239, December 12, 1989)
under Title IX of the Public Health Service Act (the Act). The AHCPR is to enhance the quality, appropriateness, and
effectiveness of health care services, and access to such services through the establishment of a broad base of scientific
research, and through the promotion of improvements in clinical practice (including the prevention of diseases
and other health conditions), and improvements in the organization, financing, and delivery of health care services.
In carrying out these purposes AHCPR, among other activities, conducts and supports specific assessments of health
care technologies. 

Since the establishment of AHCPR, Title IX, including provisions of the authority for health technology assessments,
has been amended by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Reauthorization Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-410,
October 13, 1992) and the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-43, June 10,
1993). 

Section 904(b)(2) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 299a-2(b)(2)) provides that in carrying out health care technology assessments,
the Administrator, AHCPR shall consider the safety, efficacy and effectiveness, and as appropriate, the legal,
social, and ethical implications and appropriate uses of health care technologies, including geographic factors.
Public Law 102-410 added as a requirement that the Administrator also consider the cost-effectiveness of technologies
where cost information is available and reliable. Prior to the enactment of Public Law 102-410, consideration
of the cost-effectiveness of a technology was optional. 

Section 904(e), as amended by Public Law 102-410, requires that the Administrator develop and publish a description
of the methodology used to establish priorities for health technology assessments and a description of the process
used to conduct the assessments. The ``Process for Health Care Technology Assessments and Recommendations for Coverage''
was published, with invitation for comments, in the 

Federal Register

 on December 3, 1993 (58 FR 63988).

This notice provides the proposed methodology, consisting of criteria and numerical weights, that will be used in
setting priorities for assessments to be conducted by AHCPR. Special consideration in setting priorities may be
given to requests for assessments from federally financed health programs to assist them in making coverage decisions.


Written comments on the proposed methodology are invited. The AHCPR will not respond to individual comments, but
will consider all comments received in determining the final methodology. Once adopted the final methodology will
be published in the 

Federal Register

. Comments, in writing, should be submitted by [Insert 45 days from publication date of this notice] to: Linda K. Demlo,
Ph.D., Director, Office of Program Development, Suite 603; 2101 East Jefferson Street; Rockville, Maryland 20857.
All comments will be available for public inspection at the Office of Program Development, Telephone (301) 594-1457,
weekdays between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. 

The AHCPR, through the Office of Health Technology Assessment (OHTA), conducts assessments of health care technologies
on behalf of the Public Health Service. Technology assessments, at the request of federally financed health programs,
have been conducted and the results published since 1981. However, Title IX of the PHS Act does not limit AHCPR's authority
for the conduct of technology assessments to only those requested by federally financed health programs. In 1990,
AHCPR contracted with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to study how topics for technology assessments could be prioritized.
The IOM published a monograph in 1992, which outlines a procedure for establishing such priorities entitled ``Setting
Priorities for Health Technology Assessment: A Model Process.'' 

Section 904 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 299a-2(d)(4)), as amended by Public Law 102-410 in October 1992, states
that the criteria to be used in determining priorities shall include: 

1. The prevalence of the health condition which the technology aims to prevent, diagnose, treat, and clinically manage;

2. Variations in current practice;

3. The economic burden posed by the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and clinical management of the health condition,
including the impact on publicly-funded programs; 

4. Aggregate cost of the use of the technology; 

5. The morbidity and mortality associated with the health condition; and 

6. The potential of an assessment to improve health outcomes or affect costs associated with the prevention, diagnosis,
or treatment of the condition. 

Subsequent to the enactment of Public Law 102-410, OHTA presented to AHCPR's Advisory Council a plan for determining
priorities, based on the IOM report and the statutory criteria, which called for the following steps: 

1. Proposal of criteria for setting priorities and assignment of weights to each criterion; 

2. Solicitation of potential technologies for assessment or reassessment, dependent upon AHCPR resources (This
solicitation would be published as a separate notice); 

3. Compilation of criterion scores for each technology under consideration; that is, quantitative data are gathered
for each criterion, based on information in the published literature or elsewhere in the public record (for example,
data compiled by health specialties organizations);

4. Calculation of a priority score for each potential technology, by adding the products of each criterion weight
and the natural logarithm of the associated criterion score; and 

5. Ranking of all technologies based on the priority scores. 

The Council agreed with this plan, and established a Technology Assessment Task Force to aid the process. In August,
1993, AHCPR announced in the 

Federal Register

 that there was to be a public meeting for the Task Force to solicit comments and recommendations on criteria for setting
priorities for technology assessments. The meeting was held on September 22, 1993, and was attended by representatives
of professional societies, private payors and managed care associations, medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers,
and other interested parties. Oral and written statements were received, representing a broad range of views and
interests. There was extensive discussion about ranking the statutory criteria in order of importance and assigning
a numerical weight to each criterion. This approach followed the ``Model Process'' in the IOM study. The AHCPR was
also encouraged to provide uniform definitions or explanations for the criteria. Additional criteria suggested
were: social, ethical, and legal considerations and the availability of sufficient data on which to base an assessment.

The Task Force took into consideration the comments and recommendations received at the public meeting and presented
recommendations to the Council, which in turn accepted the numerical weights and ranking of the criteria. The AHCPR
is, therefore, proposing the following rank order and numerical weighting of criteria to be used in determining priorities
for the conduct of assessments. 

1. ``The potential of an assessment to improve health outcomes or affect costs * * * '' is defined
as the expected effects of an assessment upon the outcomes of a patient with the clinical condition in question, or
on the cost of that clinical condition. For example, the assessment of autologous bone marrow transplantation indicated
that procedure improved survival in patients with relapsed lymphoma. The mean weight proposed for this criterion
is 4.8 on a scale of 1.0-5.0, where 1.0 is the least important and 5.0 is the most important. 

2. ``The morbidity and mortality associated with the health condition * * *'' is defined by equating
morbidity to severity of illness, and mortality to death. For example, breast cancer would be assigned a greater criterion
score than would low back pain. The proposed mean weight assigned to this criterion is 3.5.

<PARENT> FR940425-2-00047 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

3. ``Variations in current practice * * *'' is defined as the variability in clinicians' use of preventive,
diagnostic or therapeutic endeavors. For example, rates of carotid endarterectomy have been found to vary widely
and inexplicably across regions and States. The proposed mean assigned weight is 2.8. 

4. ``The economic burden posed by the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and clinical management of the health condition
* * *'' is defined as the total direct and induced cost per case per year of management of a clinical condition,
such as stage II breast cancer. The proposed mean assigned weight is 2.7. 

5. ``Aggregate cost of the use of the technology * * *'' is defined as the total direct and induced cost
of the technology in question; for example, the cost of prostate specific antigen screening in males over 50 years
of age, including cost of the test itself and the required followup such as transrectal ultrasound studies and transrectal
needle biopsies. The proposed mean assigned weight is 2.7. 

6. ``The prevalence of the health condition * * *'' is defined as the number of persons with the clinical
condition per 1,000 persons in the general U.S. population. The proposed mean assigned weight is 2.6. 

7. ``The ability of the assessment to inform ethical, social or legal issues'' is defined as the potential that the
assessment has for influencing such matters. For example, AHCPR's 1990 assessment of liver transplantation demonstrated
that one year survival rates following retransplant were significantly lower than for primary transplant. This
information could have a bearing upon public concerns about the ethics of providing additional liver transplants
to some patients, and thereby effectively denying first transplants to others on the waiting list. The proposed mean
weight assigned is 1.8. 

The AHCPR is not including as a criterion the availability of sufficient data. The AHCPR agrees with the IOM that data
will always be inadequate in some sense, and the presence or absence of information does not affect whether, but how
a technology assessment should be done; for example, a full assessment or a more limited technology review. 

The AHCPR will use this proposed methodology for establishing priorities for conducting assessments pending receipt
of comments and adoption of a final methodology. For further information on the assessment process contact: Thomas

Announcement of a Cooperative Agreement With the Association of 
Schools of Public Health 



Summary 



The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR)
through an interagency agreement with CDC, announce the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for a cooperative
agreement program with the Association of Schools of Public Health (ASPH) for the improvement of the interaction
between public health academicians and public health practitioners. Approximately $6,000,000 is anticipated
in FY 1994 depending upon the priorities of CDC/ATSDR. It is expected that the award will begin on September 28, 1994,
and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to 5 years. The funding estimate may vary and
is subject to change. 

The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to assist ASPH in improving the interaction between public health academicians
and public health practitioners, enhancing the preparation of public health workers, and strengthening the public
health system. CDC/ATSDR will collaborate with ASPH in the following activities: 

(1) Supporting research to stimulate the development of knowledge which will improve the preparation of public health
personnel and increase the effectiveness and efficiency of public health programs designed to reduce unnecessary
morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life; 

(2) Identifying priority needs for public health programs at the local, regional, State, national, and international
levels. Provide assistance to ASPH in planning, delivering, and evaluating programs to meet identified needs; 

(3) Developing and testing more effective and efficient models of instruction, disease prevention, health promotion,
and health services delivery and financing. Encourage the adoption of validated models by local, State and international
public health agencies and assist in incorporating the results into appropriate teaching and learning experiences
in the schools of public health; 

(4) Identifying new approaches and opportunities for field experiences in which students can practice applying
skills and knowledge learned in the classroom; 

(5) Participating in workshops and conferences to exchange current information, opinions, and findings in specified
fields of disease prevention and health promotion; and 

(6) Developing an annual work plan that addresses administrative and programmatic concerns of ASPH and CDC/ATSDR.
The format and contents of plan will be decided by mutual agreement of CDC/ATSDR and ASPH. 

The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality
of life. This announcement is related to all the ``Healthy People 2000'' priority areas. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy
People 2000,'' see the section 

Where To Obtain Additional Information

.) 



Authority 



This program is authorized under Section 301(a) of the Public 
Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 241(a), as amended. 



Smoke-Free Workplace 



The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 



Eligible Applicant 



Assistance will be provided only to ASPH for this project. No other applications are solicited. The program announcement
and application kit have been sent to ASPH.

1. ASPH represents the 27 accredited schools of public health in the United States. These schools represent the primary
educational system that trains personnel to operate the Nation's public health agencies, and to administer disease
prevention and health promotion programs. ASPH has the institutional knowledge of the needs of both the schools of
public health and the public health agencies.

2. ASPH's principal purpose is to promote and improve the education and training of professional public health personnel.
The ASPH is the only organization that can comprehensively affect the development and implementation of improved
curricula for teaching public health workers in all 27 accredited schools of public health and provide experiences
to students and faculty in the environment of public health organizations.

3. ASPH has provided the critical framework for the schools of public health and the practitioners of public health
in Federal, State and local governments to cooperate and share their experience and expertise, and to enable the theoretical
and practical perspectives of public health to be blended into comprehensive curricula for teaching health administration,
health promotion, health protection, preventive health service delivery, and health research methods to future
public health workers. These interchanges have assured consistent approaches to the preparation of public health
workers and their performance in controlling today's major health problems.

4. ASPH is uniquely positioned to consult with practitioners of public health because students and faculty often
assist public health agencies with problem resolution and work efforts. The ASPH's access to both practitioners
and academicians provides a unique opportunity to achieve the purpose of this cooperative agreement.

5. ASPH provides the structure and experience for instituting comprehensive public health education programs and
implementing programs that strengthen the public health system by preparing public health workers.

Project Grants_Health Programs for Refugees; Availability of Funds for Fiscal Year 1994 



Introduction 



The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
a grant program for refugees. The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease
prevention objectives of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led 
national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and 
improve the quality of life. This announcement is related 
to the priority area of Immunization and Infectious Diseases. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see
the section ``

Where To Obtain Additional Information

''.) 


Authority 



This program is authorized by section 412(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1522(b)(5)], 
as amended. 



Smoke-Free Workplace 



The PHS strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all
tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of
the American people. 



Eligible Applicants 



Eligible applicants for this program are the official State health agencies and current official public health agencies
of political subdivisions who are recipients of Health Program for Refugees project grant program (New York City;
Philadelphia, PA; Barren River District, KY; Missoula City, MT; Maricopa County, AZ; North Central District, ID).




National Program Goals



The National Program Goals are: 

A. As a high priority, to prevent and control health problems of public health significance among refugees; 

B. As a lesser priority incidental to the provision of services under A., to improve the general health status of the
refugee population through health assessment and referral, emphasizing those health problems that may impede effective
resettlement and prevent economic self-sufficiency.

Availability of Funds 



Approximately $2,700,000 is expected to be available in FY 1994 to fund all approved competing grants. It is expected
that the average award will be $56,000, ranging from $5,000 to $900,000, beginning on or about July 1, 1994, for a 12-month
budget period within a 5-year project period. Funding estimates may change. There is no statutory cost participation
formula. 

In agreement with the Office of Refugee Resettlement, CDC will distribute available funds on an 80% formula and 20%
discretionary basis. (Applicants will continue to submit budgets as in previous years, i.e., line item detail with
a ``Grand Total'' amount of funding requested.) CDC will distribute 80% of the available funds (e.g., $2,160,000
of the $2,700,000) to grantees based on a formula using each State's proportion of refugee arrivals during the past
two years (including a floor amount of $5,000 for States with a small number of refugee arrivals). All applicants with
approved applications will receive formula funding. The remaining 20% of available funding (e.g., $540,000 of the
$2,700,000) will be awarded on a discretionary basis. 


Use of Grant Funds 



Grant funds may be used for costs associated with planning, organizing, implementing, and evaluating public health
and health assessment activities directed to refugees, in accordance with 45 CFR parts 74 and 92. Grant funds may not
be used for construction costs or inpatient care. 

Except in special situations that are explained and justified, grant funds will not be available for direct curative
or rehabilitative services. This restriction applies to subsequent diagnostic or treatment services provided
directly to individual refugees for whom specific health problems have been identified. It is expected that other
sources of support will generally be identified for these purposes. Exceptions will be considered 
for diagnostic and treatment services that are integral to the conduct of public health programs and are otherwise
not available. However, tuberculosis preventive therapy outreach activities that are associated with locating
refugees for diagnosis and the provision of treatment are permitted. 

If grant funds are used to support bilingual outreach staff, applicants should ensure appropriate language and culture
compatibility. Applicants are encouraged to use contractual 
or similar mechanisms that will allow for maximum flexibility 
in making personnel changes due to changing language needs. 



Purpose 



The purpose of this program is to augment State and local resources and to assist States and localities in providing
health assessments and follow-up activities to refugees for problems of public health concern. Health assessments
of refugees are intended to identify and lead to the treatment 
of health conditions that could affect the public health or 
the personal well-being of refugees and impede their effective resettlement. Communities with the largest refugee
populations will be principally targeted for assistance under this program. 

The term ``refugee'' is defined in section 101(a)(42) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(42)].

These grants are made available in recognition of: 
A. The severe strain on public resources in high impact areas represented by the influx of refugees. 
B. Gaps in meeting the health needs of refugees through other forms of Federal assistance. 
C. The need for State level coordination of public health programs, general health assessments, and referrals for
medical, mental, dental, rehabilitative, and social services. 
D. The need to intensify and maintain outreach efforts to improve upon the number of refugees starting and completing
tuberculosis preventive therapy. 


Program Requirements 



In conducting the activities to achieve the purpose of the program, the Grantees must meet the following requirements:




A. 

Identification





Develop and implement a system to identify all officially arriving refugees. Use notification forms received from
CDC port of entry quarantine stations to determine primary refugee arrivals. Include a mechanism to identify secondary
refugee arrivals and give priority to recent arrivals in the United States who have not received an initial health
assessment in their area of previous residence. 



B. 

Contacting Refugees





Contact identified officially arriving refugees shortly after arrival and offer a health assessment. Carefully
explain the importance of receiving a health assessment and where and how to get to a convenient health care provider,
whenever possible, in the language spoken by the refugee. Efforts to contact the refugees should include: 

1. Close coordination with voluntary agencies (VOLAGS) and other service agencies. 

2. Assisting the refugee to overcome any special barriers to receiving the health assessment, e.g., lack of transportation.




C. 

Health Assessment





Provide or coordinate the provision of a health assessment to officially arriving refugees and identified secondary
migrants who have not previously received a health assessment. Give priority to refugees with Class A and Class B medical
conditions. Although it is expected that a standard protocol and recommended priorities for health assessments
will be published at a later date, applicants may include the following components in the health assessment:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940425-2-00070 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940425-2-00049 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

1. Screening for tuberculosis, including a tuberculosis skin test and a chest X-ray if a recent one is not available;
2. Public health history and review of current problems, including immunization needs;
3. Screening of pregnant women for hepatitis B;
4. Testing for intestinal parasites;
5. Testing for anemia;
6. Complete physical examination including:
a. Oral inspection for dental problems;
b. Height and weight measurement to assess pediatric nutritional status;
c. Vision and hearing testing; and,
d. Test for hypertension.


D. Referrals for Health Problems


Refer refugees with health problems identified during the health assessment to the appropriate health care provider
for treatment. Establish a system for follow-up, based on the priority of the condition identified, to ensure appointments
are kept.


E. Health Education


In order for the refugees to be successfully assimilated into the public health care system, the importance of preventive
health should be taught as part of the health assessment process. Refugees should be informed, in their own language,
about the tests they are receiving and what the results of the tests mean. The need for obtaining additional care, testing,
and treatment for an identified health problem should also be carefully explained. Culturally competent and linguistically
appropriate educational pamphlets, slides, or videos, and individual or group education sessions may be used to
provide this information. The applicant may also provide or coordinate the provision of culturally sensitive training
for staff working with refugees.


F. Coordination with Other Agencies/Organizations


To promote the national goals and use all existing resources to this end, place special emphasis on coordinating efforts
with:


1. Voluntary agencies (VOLAGS);
2. Mutual assistance agencies (MAA);
3. State Department of Social Services;
4. State Advisory Council on Refugee Affairs;
5. Other State and Federally funded programs, such as Medicaid, and health department immunization and tuberculosis
control programs;
6. Private providers of health care to refugees.


Evaluation Conditions and Criteria


A. Formula Conditions


Eligible applicants meeting the following conditions will receive an award based on the formula described in the
``Availability of Funds'' section.
1. Has the applicant provided a budget justification and plan of operation and evaluation?
2. Does the application document the size of the refugee population, including secondary migrants?
3. Are the proposed objectives specific, measurable, realistic, time-phased, and related to the National Program
Goals?
4. Does the application document coordination with the State Refugee Resettlement Coordinator?


B. Discretionary Award Evaluation Criteria


Applications will be reviewed and evaluated according to the following criteria, each carrying equal weight of 25
points:
1. Does the application document the need for support, including:
a. The extent and distribution of unique refugee health problems;
b. The extent and distribution of general refugee health problems;
c. The relationship of the project to existing services? 
2. Does the application include a plan for conducting project activities described in the program description that
is consistent with the State Refugee Resettlement Plan and that will integrate refugees into existing health services?
3. Does the application include reasonable and appropriate methods for evaluating the project's effectiveness?
In addition, in determining discretionary award amounts, CDC will consider the applicant's proposed use of project
funds, program potential, other funding resources, past performance and funding, the quality of the data collection
system, appropriateness and reasonableness of the budget request, and plans to provide tuberculosis preventive
therapy and outreach services.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Social Security Administration, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Publication of Notice of Computer Matching Programs to comply with Public Law (Pub. L.) 100-503, the Computer
Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are publishing a notice of an internal computer matching program that SSA will conduct that is subject to the requirements
of Public Law 100-503. The purpose of this publication is to meet the publication requirements of Public Law
100-503.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

A. General 



Public Law 100-503, the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, amended the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C.
552a) by adding certain protections for individuals applying for and receiving Federal benefits. Section 7201 of
Pub. L. 101-508, the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Amendments of 1990, further amended the Privacy
Act regarding protections for such individuals. The Privacy Act, as amended, regulates the use of computer matching
by Federal agencies when records in a system of records are matched with other Federal, State, local government, and
(in certain limited circumstances) internal agency records. It requires Federal agencies involved in computer
matching programs to: 

(1) Negotiate written agreements with the other agency, agencies, or internal agency components participating
in the match; 
(2) Notify applicants and beneficiaries that their records are subject to matching; 
(3) Verify match findings before reducing, suspending, terminating, or denying an individual's benefits or payments;

(4) Furnish detailed reports about matching programs to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget, and 
(5) Establish a Data Integrity Board that must approve match agreements. 



B. SSA Computer Matches Subject to Public Law 100-503 



We have taken action to ensure that all of SSA's computer matching programs comply with the requirements of the Privacy
Act, as amended. Below is a brief description followed by a detailed notice of a match that SSA will be conducting as
of February 1994 or later. 

SSA Matching Between the Deputy Commissioner for Operations, Office of Central Records Operations (DCO, OCRO) and
the Deputy Commissioner for Human Resources, Office of Personnel (DCHR, OPE). 

Purpose: To establish the conditions under which OCRO agrees to the matching of names and Social Security Numbers
(SSN) of its employees to the Master Earnings File (MEF). The MEF is a file housing all the earnings and earnings history
for workers and self employed individuals. 

The output from this match (changes and postings to the MEF credited to the employee's SSN) will be used to verify legitimate
postings, adjustments and permissible self employment occupations as outlined in the Code of Conduct 
and other personnel regulations. The veracity of the changes or postings will be verified before SSA takes any adverse
action with respect to an individual as a result of the matching program. 

This matching activity supplements other existing data integrity/computer security operations to minimize instances
where violations are not detected, and to ensure the accuracy of SSA's earnings records.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, proposes that a 225.33-acre withdrawal for the Black
Range and Mimbres Administrative Sites in the Gila National Forest continue for an additional 20 years. The lands
will remain closed to mining, but will be opened to surface entry and to such forms of disposition as may by law be made
of the National Forest System lands. The lands have been and will remain open to mineral leasing.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, proposes that the existing land withdrawal made by
Public Land Order No. 1413, be continued for a period of 20 years pursuant to section 204 of the Federal Land Policy and
Management Act of 1976, U.S.C. 1714 (1988). The lands are described as follows:



New Mexico Principal Meridian



Gila National Forest



Black Range Administrative Site



T. 16 S., R. 8 W.,



Sec. 17, lots 8, 9, 10, and 11 (exclusive of lands included in mineral patent).



Mimbres Administrative Site



T. 16 S., R. 11 W.,



Sec. 7, W1/2NE1/4.




The areas described aggregate 225.33 acres in Sierra and Grant Counties.





The purpose of the withdrawal is to protect the Black Range and Mimbres Administrative Sites in the Gila National Forest.
The withdrawal segregates the lands from operation of the public land laws generally, including the mining laws,
but not the mineral leasing laws. No change is proposed in the purpose of the withdrawal, but the lands will be opened
to surface entry and to such forms of disposition as may by law be made of the National Forest System lands.

For a period of 90 days from the date of publication of this notice, all persons who wish to submit comments in connection
with the proposed withdrawal continuation may present their views in writing to the State Director in the New Mexico
State Office.

The authorized officer of the Bureau of Land Management will undertake such investigations as are necessary to determine
the existing and potential demand for the land and its resources. A report will also be prepared for consideration
by the Secretary of the Interior, the President, and the Congress, who will determine whether or not the withdrawal
will be continued, and if so, for how long.

The final determination on the continuation of the withdrawal will be published in the 

Federal Register

. The existing withdrawal will continue until such final determination is made.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.





'

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that the MMS plans to join the TTC, a Government-industry nonprofit group, as a means of developing
interactive training modules for use in training members of fits inspection work force.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The MMS is responsible for inspecting oil and gas operations in the Outer Continental Shelf. The MMS inspects these
highly complex operations to make certain that operators conduct them in a safe and environmentally sound manner.
To ensure that a highly trained and professional work force is available to perform these inspections, MMS provides
this work force with accurate and timely training information.



To that end, MMS will augment its program of traditional classroom-based instruction to include computer-based
interactive instruction. An interactive training system will help the agency provide low cost and simple to use training
to its inspection work force. This training will focus on technical, environmental, and safety issues relevant to
offshore oil and gas operations.

The TTC, when incorporated, will be a nonprofit association composed of domestic oil and gas exploration or producing
companies and regulatory agencies. The goal of TTC will be to identify common training needs and to develop training
material using an interactive format (i.e., compact disk interactive or CD-I).

As a training technology, CD-I offers several advantages over traditional classroom-based training approaches.
Short-term retention has been shown to be better; it is portable and can be displayed on several platforms; there is
less time off the job since it is not dependent on a classroom setting and can be done as time permits; and the content
can be changed with relative ease and furnished identically to several locations. Hardware technology supporting
CD-I is also relatively inexpensive.

The TTC will minimize member costs by allowing individuals to pool their financial and technical resources to develop
appropriate training materials. This is particularly important to MMS because it allows MMS inspectors to stay abreast
of technological advances made by the offshore industry. It is anticipated that TTC will be incorporated during the
month of April or May 1994. At that time, MMS intends to become an active member in the consortium.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Government Securities Clearing Corporation: Filing of a Proposed Rule Change
Relating to the Comparison and Netting of Non-Member Trades



April 8, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on March 28, 1994, the Government Securities Clearing Corporation (``GSCC'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and
III below, which items have been prepared by GSCC. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on
the proposed rule change from interested persons.




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The proposed rule change would allow GSCC to continue to offer comparison and netting services for non-member trades
which have been submitted to GSCC by netting members on behalf of non-members executing firms.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, GSCC included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the proposed
rule change, and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. GSCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and
(C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



(a) On December 13, 1991, the Commission approved, on a temporary basis through December 31, 1992, a rule change authorizing
GSCC to implement a non-member, ``executing firm'' information feature as an enhancement to its comparison service.
 On December 23, 1992, the Commission extended its temporary approval of the executing firm feature until June 30,
1994.






On February 14, 1992, GSCC introduced the executing firm feature, which allows trade data to be submitted to GSCC by
a member (the ``submitting member'') on behalf of a non-member firm (the ``executing firm'') that it clears for by
adding two new fields to the comparison system: (1) The name of the executing party associated with the member; and
(2) the name of the executing party associated with the contra-party member. If a submitting member that is a netting
member so elects, a netting eligible trade that it has submitted on behalf of an executing firm may be included in the
net, and the submitting member would be obligated to GSCC as regards such trade to the same degree as if it itself had
executed such trade; therefore, such trade would be considered for purposes of calculating the submitting member's
mark and margin requirements. However, an eligible trade submitted by a submitting member on behalf of an executing
firm will not be included in the net if the submitting member has informed GSCC that it does not wish, because of the type
of relationship that it has with the executing firm (i.e., it does not normally guarantee settlement of such firm's
trades), to have the trades executed by such firm be netted and novated by GSCC .

Initially, participation in the executing firm feature was modest; however, participation has grown significantly
over the past year. Currently, twelve GSCC members have agreements in place pursuant to which, collectively, they
may submit data on trades executed by 271 non-members. GSCC expects that the number of submitting members and executing
firms will continue to grow. GSCC has not experienced any operational or other problems with regard to the executing
firm feature.

GSCC believes that the executing firm feature provides significant benefit to the government securities industry
by improving reconciliation of unmatched trade data and, thus, providing the benefits of GSCC's comparison process
to a broader range of trades. This feature allows access by a greater number of firms (who may otherwise be ineligible
for direct membership in GSCC's netting system) to GSCC's netting and risk management services, including broker-dealers
and institutional customers. The result is that, through the executing firm feature, a greater number of government
securities trades are being margined, netted, and guaranteed by GSCC than would otherwise be the case.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940425-2-00098 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940425-2-00067 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In view of the above, GSCC hereby requests that its authorization to implement the executing firm feature be made permanent.
In the alternative, if the Commission determines that the granting of such permanent authorization is not appropriate
at this time, GSCC requests that it be granted a renewal of its temporary authorization to implement the executing
firm feature.
GSCC also proposes to amend GSCC Rule 2, Section 10 and GSCC Rule 11, Section 4 to permit GSCC to accept trades of a member
after voluntary termination or insolvency in order to ensure an orderly settlement of the member's net settlement
position.

(b) The proposed rule change would allow GSCC to further improve its comparison rate and to provide the benefits of
its comparison and netting processes to more transactions and more market participants. Thus, GSCC believes that
the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder.






B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


GSCC does not believe that the proposed rule change imposes any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others


Comments on the proposed rule change have not yet been solicited or received. Members will be notified of the rule change,
and comments will be solicited, by an Important Notice. GSCC will notify the Commission of any written comments received
by GSCC.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within thirty-five days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to ninety days of such date if it finds such longer
period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so findings or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organizations
consents, the Commission will:
(A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or
(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of GSCC. All submissions should refer to file number SR-GSCC-94-2
and should be submitted by May 16, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (International Colin Energy
Corporation, Inc., Common Shares Without Nominal or Par Value) File No. 1-10755</DOCTITLE>



April 19, 1994.



International Colin Energy Corporation (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule
12d2-2(d) promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration
on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:

According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its common shares are listed on the New York Stock
Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's common shares commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on
March 23, 1994 and concurrently therewith such security was suspended from trading on the Amex.

In making the decision to withdraw its common stock and preferred share purchase rights from listing on the Amex, the
Company considered the direct and indirect costs and expenses attendant on maintaining the dual listing of its securities
on the NYSE and on the Amex. The Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its stock and believes
that dual listing would fragment the market for its common stock.

Any interested person may, on or before May 10, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

Receipt of Petition for Determination That Nonconforming 1987 Alfa Romeo Spider Passenger Cars Are Eligible for
Importation



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of receipt of petition for determination that nonconforming 1987 Alfa Romeo Spider passenger cars are eligible
for importation.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice requests comments on a petition submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
for a determination that a 1987 Alfa Romeo Spider passenger car that was not originally manufactured to comply with
all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards is eligible for importation into the United States because
it is substantially similar to a vehicle that was originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United
States and that was certified by its manufacturer as complying with the safety standards, and it is capable of being
readily modified to conform to the standards.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i),
a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
shall be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless NHTSA has determined that the
motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle
to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards.

Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register

 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the 

Federal Register

.

Champagne Imports, Inc. of Lansdale, Pennsylvania (``Champagne'') (Registered Importer R-90-009)
has petitioned NHTSA to determine whether 1987 Alfa Romeo Spider passenger cars are eligible for importation into
the United States. The vehicle which Champagne believes is substantially similar is the 1987 Alfa Romeo Spider that
was manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States, and certified by its original manufacturer as
conforming to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.

The petitioner states that it carefully compared the non-U.S.-certified 1987 Alfa Romeo Spider to its U.S.-certified
counterpart, and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most applicable
Federal motor vehicle safety standards.

Champagne submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S.-certified 1987 Alfa
Romeo Spider, as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner
as its U.S.-certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily modified to conform to those standards.

Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1987 Alfa Romeo Spider is identical to its U.S.-certified
counterpart with respect to compliance with Standard Nos. 102 Transmission Shift Lever Sequence. * * *,

SUMMARY: 

This notice announces receipt by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of a petition for a determination
that a 1985 Ferrari 412 that was not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards is eligible for importation into the United States because it has safety features that comply with, or are
capable of being modified to comply with, all such standards.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i)(I),
a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
shall be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless NHTSA has determined that the
motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle
to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards. Where there is no substantially similar U.S.-certified motor vehicle, 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(II) of the Act,
15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i)(II), permits a nonconforming motor vehicle to be admitted into the United States if its
safety features comply with, or are capable of being modified to comply with, all applicable Federal motor vehicle
safety standards based on destructive test data or such other evidence as NHTSA determines to be adequate.

Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register

 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the 

Federal Register

.

G&K Automotive Conversion, Inc. of Santa Ana, California (Registered Importer No. R-90-007) has
petitioned NHTSA to determine whether 1985 Ferrari 412 passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United
States. The petitioner contends that this vehicle is eligible for importation under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(II)
of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i)(II), because it has safety features that comply with, or are capable of being
modified to comply with, all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.

Specifically, the petitioner claims that the 1985 Ferrari 412 has safety features that comply with Standards Nos.
