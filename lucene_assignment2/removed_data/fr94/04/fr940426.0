Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service









Importation of Restricted Articles; Port Everglades, FL 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the regulations concerning the importation of nursery stock, plants, roots, bulbs, seeds, and other
plant products by allowing restricted articles that require a written permit to be imported into Port Everglades
at Fort Lauderdale, FL, provided they are then moved by ground transportation and under U.S. Customs bond to the Miami,
FL, plant inspection station. Because many U.S. importers use shipping companies that go into Port Everglades, FL,
but not Miami, FL, these importers prefer to import restricted articles that require a written permit through the
Port Everglades, FL, port of entry. However, Port Everglades, FL, does not have the necessary facilities to inspect
and clear those restricted articles. This final rule will provide U.S. importers with another option for importing
those restricted articles while protecting U.S. agriculture from significant risk of plant pests and diseases.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The regulations in 7 CFR part 319 prohibit or restrict the importation into the United States of certain plants and
plant products to prevent the introduction of plant pests. Sections 319.37 through 319.37-14 (referred to
below as the regulations) contain restrictions on the importation into the United States of nursery stock, plants,
roots, bulbs, seeds, and other plant products. Sections 319.37-2 and 319.37-3 list prohibited and restricted
articles. 

Section 319.37-14(b) of the regulations contains a list of the approved ports of entry through which restricted
articles may be imported into the United States. Restricted articles that do not require a written permit may be imported
through any of the approved ports of entry; restricted articles that do require a written permit, because of their
greater plant pest and disease risk, may be imported only through ports equipped with special inspection and treatment
facilities. Ports having these special facilities, known as plant inspection stations, are indicated on the list
by an asterisk. 

On October 28, 1993, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 57969-57970, Docket No. 93-029-1) a proposal to amend the regulations by allowing restricted
articles that require a written permit to be imported into Port Everglades at Fort Lauderdale, FL, provided they are
then moved by ground transportation and under U.S. Customs bond to the Miami, FL, plant inspection station. We solicited
comments concerning our proposal for a 60-day comment period ending December 27, 1993. We received one comment by
that date. The comment was from the Florida State Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The comment was
in favor of the proposal. 

Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as
a final rule, with minor nonsubstantive editorial changes for clarity. 



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 

This final rule allows restricted articles that require a written permit, for example, nursery stock, to be offered
for importation into the United States at the Port Everglades, FL, port of entry. Based upon requests from importers,
we anticipate that about two to three containers of nursery stock per month could arrive at the Port Everglades, FL,
port of entry, predominantly from Costa Rica and Guatemala. 
Now, about 40 to 50 companies import nursery stock into the United States. Thirty to 40 of these companies employ 100
or fewer people, making them small entities by the Small Business Administration's size criteria. Three of these
small entities will most likely ship most of the nursery stock that could arrive at Port Everglades, FL. 
Based upon U.S. Department of Agriculture information, we estimate that this rule change could result in no more than
five additional import companies shipping nursery stock to Port Everglades, FL. This estimate is based upon the assumption
that most importers who now ship nursery stock directly to the Port of Miami will continue to do so because it is more
feasible and cost effective. All of these companies are considered to be small entities. 
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



Executive Order 12778 



This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: 
(1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; 

(2) Has no retroactive effect; and 

(3) Does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



This rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of
1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). 



List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 319 



Bees, Coffee, Cotton, Fruits, Honey, Imports, Nursery stock, Plant diseases and pests, Quarantine, Reporting and
recordkeeping requirements.

 


Accordingly, 7 CFR part 319 is amended as follows: 



PART 319_FOREIGN QUARANTINE NOTICES

2. The authority citation for ``Subpart_Nursery Stock, Plants, Roots, Bulbs, Seeds, and Other Plant Products''
is removed. 



 319.37-14 

[Amended] 



3. In  319.37-14, paragraph (b), under ``List of Ports of Entry'', the entry for Florida is amended by removing
``Port Everglades'' and the address underneath it, and by adding ``Amman Building, room 305, 611 Eisenhower Boulevard,

Note: 

Restricted articles required to be imported under a written permit pursuant to  319.37-3(a)(1) through

Commuted Traveltime Periods: Overtime Services Relating to Imports and Exports 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the regulations concerning overtime services provided by employees of Plant Protection and Quarantine
by removing and adding commuted traveltime allowances for travel between various locations in Arizona, Kentucky,
Ohio, and Vermont. Commuted traveltime allowances are the periods of time required for Plant Protection and Quarantine
employees to travel from their dispatch points and return there from the places where they perform Sunday, holiday,
or other overtime duty. The Government charges a fee for certain overtime services provided by Plant Protection and
Quarantine employees and, under certain circumstances, the fee may include the cost of commuted traveltime. This
action is necessary to inform the public of commuted traveltime for these locations.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:





Background



The regulations in 7 CFR, chapter III, and 9 CFR, chapter I, subchapter D, require inspection, laboratory testing,
certification, or quarantine of certain plants, plant products, animals, animal byproducts, or other commodities
intended for importation into, or exportation from, the United States. When these services must be provided by an
employee of Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) on a Sunday or holiday, or at any other time outside the PPQ employee's
regular duty hours, the Government charges a fee for the services in accordance with 7 CFR part 354. Under circumstances
described in  354.1(a)(2), this fee may include the cost of commuted traveltime. Section 354.2 contains administrative
instructions prescribing commuted traveltime allowances, which reflect, as nearly as practicable, the periods
of time required for PPQ employees to travel from their dispatch points and return there from the places where they
perform Sunday, holiday, or other overtime duty. 
We are amending  354.2 of the regulations by removing and adding commuted traveltime allowances for travel
between various locations in Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, and Vermont. The amendments are set forth in the rule portion
of this document. This action is necessary to inform the public of the commuted traveltime between the dispatch and
service locations. 


Effective Date 


The commuted traveltime allowances appropriate for employees performing services at ports of entry, and the features
of the reimbursement plan for recovering the cost of furnishing port of entry services, depend upon facts within the
knowledge of the Department of Agriculture. It does not appear that public participation in this rulemaking proceeding
would make additional relevant information available to the Department. 
Accordingly, pursuant to the administrative procedure provisions in 5 U.S.C. 553, we find upon good cause that prior
notice and other public procedure with respect to this rule are impracticable and unnecessary; we also find good cause
for making this rule effective less than 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

. 


Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for
purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 
The number of requests for overtime services of a PPQ employee at the locations affected by our rule represents an insignificant
portion of the total number of requests for these services in the United States. 
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Executive Order 12372 


This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic 
Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which 
requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V.) 


Executive Order 12778 


This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have
preemptive effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations, or policies that conflict with its provisions
or that would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. There
are no administrative procedures that must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this
rule or the application of its provisions. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


This rule contains no new information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). 


List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 354 


Exports, Government employees, Imports, Plant diseases and pests, Quarantine, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,
Travel and transportation expenses. 



Accordingly, 7 CFR part 354 is amended as follows: 


PART 354_OVERTIME SERVICES RELATING TO IMPORTS AND EXPORTS; AND USER FEES 


1. The authority citation for part 354 continues to read as follows: 






Authority:

 7 U.S.C. 2260; 21 U.S.C. 136 and 136a; 49 U.S.C. 1741; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.51, and 371.2(c).

Animals Destroyed Because of Brucellosis 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the brucellosis indemnity regulations to provide for the payment of indemnity to owners who have brucellosis
exposed cattle or bison destroyed that were previously sold or traded from any herd that has, subsequent to the sale
or trade, been found to be affected with brucellosis. This action is necessary to give herd owners sufficient incentive
to destroy their exposed animals in a timely manner. Prompt destruction of brucellosis-affected animals will assist
in eradicating the disease in the United States. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Brucellosis, also called Bang's disease or undulant fever, is a serious infectious disease of cattle, bison, and
other species, including humans, caused by bacteria of the genus 

Brucella.

 Brucellosis in cattle and bison is characterized by fever, sterility, slow breeding, abortion, and loss of milk production.
To help prevent the spread of the disease, the regulations in 
9 CFR part 51 (referred to below as the regulations) provide for payment of Federal indemnity to owners of certain animals
destroyed because of brucellosis. The payment of indemnity is intended to provide owners with a financial incentive
for promptly destroying animals affected with or exposed to brucellosis. Because the continued presence of brucellosis
in a herd seriously threatens the health of animals in that herd and possibly other herds, the prompt destruction of
brucellosis-affected cattle or bison is critical if brucellosis-eradication efforts in the United States are to
succeed. 
In accordance with  51.3(a)(1) of the regulations, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS) may authorize the payment of Federal indemnity by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
to any owner whose cattle or bison are destroyed as brucellosis reactors. 
In accordance with  51.3(a)(2)(i) of the regulations, the Administrator of APHIS may also authorize the payment
of Federal indemnity by USDA to any owner whose herd of cattle or bison is destroyed because of brucellosis. The Administrator
may authorize the payment of Federal indemnity by USDA for brucellosis exposed cattle or bison in the herd only when
the Administrator determines that destruction of all cattle and bison in the herd will contribute to the brucellosis
eradication program. 

Until this final rule becomes effective, the regulations do not provide for the payment of indemnity for destroying
brucellosis exposed cattle and bison that were sold or traded from a herd prior to the time that herd was found to be affected
with brucellosis. 

On December 28, 1993, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 68561-68563, Docket No. 93-023-1) a proposal to amend the regulations to allow for payment
of Federal indemnity to owners who have brucellosis exposed cattle or bison destroyed that were previously sold or
traded from any herd that has, subsequent to the sale or trade, been found to be affected with brucellosis. The amendments
were intended to provide an economic incentive for the timely removal of brucellosis-exposed animals from such herds,
thus minimizing the risk of those animals spreading brucellosis to a new herd. 

We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 30-day comment period ending January 27, 1994. We received four
comments by that date. They were from livestock marketing associations and a representative of the Federal government.
All responses were in favor of the proposal. 
Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as
a final rule. 


Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
The change in the regulations allows for a per-head indemnity payment as cited in  51.3(a)(2)(ii) if the owner
chooses to destroy the exposed animals within a specified amount of time. In all States except Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto
Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States, the amount of Federal indemnity will not exceed $250 for any registered
cattle, $250 for any nonregistered dairy cattle, $150 for any nonregistered cattle other than dairy cattle, and $150
for any bison. In Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States, the amount of Federal indemnity
will not exceed $250 for any cattle or bison. If an owner chooses to accept the indemnity payment, the owner will stand
to lose less money than through either depopulation or quarantine. If the owner chooses to accept the indemnity payment,
the Government will also save money through eliminating the need for quarantining the entire herd and performing
numerous retests. At the same time, there will be less risk of spreading brucellosis to the rest of the animals in the
owner's herd and to adjacent herds. 
APHIS experts estimate that there are about 50 owners nationwide (owning approximately 100 to 150 animals total,
all of which are used for breeding purposes), who may be affected by this change in the regulations. All of the farmers
can be considered ``small'' entities (annual gross receipts of $0.5 million or less, according to Small Business
Administration size standards). 

While an owner still stands to lose money by destroying exposed animals because the amount of the indemnity will not
fully compensate an owner for the loss of an animal, the amount will likely be minimal in comparison to the potential
loss if the entire herd were to become infected. 

In summary, by allowing for an indemnity payment as specified in 
 51.3(a)(2)(ii) for each animal that was part of a herd prior to the time that herd was found affected with brucellosis,
the risk of spreading brucellosis in the new herd should be minimized. Payment of the specified indemnity per head
will give owners an economic incentive to destroy an exposed animal that was part of a herd prior to the time that herd
was found affected with brucellosis. The indemnity payment will provide an economic benefit to owners by minimizing
their financial losses. 

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Executive Order 12372 



This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive

related evidence would be used to establish a probable date when the herd was first infected with brucellosis. Animals
sold after that date would be considered to be exposed; those sold before that date would not. In all States except Alaska,
Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States, the amount of Federal indemnity shall not exceed
$250 for any registered cattle, $250 for any nonregistered dairy cattle, $150 for any nonregistered cattle other
than dairy cattle, and $150 for any bison. In Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States,
the amount of Federal indemnity shall not exceed $250 for any cattle or bison. Indemnity payments shall be made only
for brucellosis exposed cattle or brucellosis exposed bison and only when the Administrator determines that the
destruction of such cattle or bison will contribute to the brucellosis eradication program. Prior to payment of indemnity,
proof of destruction

 shall be furnished to the veterinarian in charge.

Ports Designated for the Exportation of Animals 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the ``Inspection and Handling of Livestock 
for Exportation'' regulations by adding Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in Texas to the list of ports designated
as ports of embarkation and by designating DFW Quarantine as the export inspection facility, for horses only, for
that port. The Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and DFW Quarantine appear to meet the requirements of the
regulations for designation as a port of embarkation and an animal export inspection facility, respectively. We
are also revising the listing for a port of embarkation in Los Angeles, CA, that has changed its name and telephone number.
These actions update the regulations and add a port and an inspection facility through which horses may be processed
for export.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The regulations in 9 CFR part 91, ``Inspection and Handling of Livestock for Exportation'' (referred to below as the
regulations), prescribe conditions for exporting animals from the United States. The regulations state, among
other things, that all animals, except animals being exported to Canada or Mexico, must be exported through designated
ports of embarkation. 
To receive designation as a port of embarkation, a port must have export 
inspection facilities available for the inspection, holding, feeding, and 
watering of animals prior to exportation to ensure that the animals meet 
certain requirements specified in the regulations. To receive approval as an 
export inspection facility, the regulations provide that a facility must meet 
specified standards in  91.14(c) concerning materials, size, inspection 
implements, cleaning and disinfection, feed and water, access, testing and 
treatment, location, disposal of animal wastes, lighting, and office and rest 
room facilities. 
On November 12, 1993, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 59962-59963, Docket No. 93-106-1), a proposal to amend the regulations by designating the
Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in Texas as a port of embarkation for horses. DFW Quarantine in Lewisville,
TX, was proposed as the export inspection facility for that port, for horses only. 
We also proposed to make changes in the regulations indicating the name and telephone number changes undertaken by
the export inspection facility currently listed as Steifel Bros. Livestock in Los Angeles, CA. 
We solicited comments for our proposal for a 30-day comment period ending December 13, 1993. We did not receive any
comments. The facts presented in the proposed rule still provide the basis for this final rule. 
Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as
a final rule without change. 


Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
In 1992, there were over 73,000 horses exported out of the United States. Approximately 60,000 horses (82 percent)
were exported to Canada, mostly 
through northern land border ports, while about 6,000 horses (8 percent) were exported to Western Europe by way of
John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. The remaining exports included about 3,700 horses to Latin America, about 3,500
horses to Asia, and a small number of horses to Australia, New Zealand, and Africa. Horses exported to Latin America
generally were shipped through Miami, while exports to Asia generally were shipped through Los Angeles. 
Although we do not know how many horses will be exported out of the United States through the Dallas/Fort Worth International
Airport, we do not expect the number to exceed 5,000 horses annually. Further, we believe that only a few entities will
engage in the export of horses from Dallas/Fort Worth and that they all will be small entities, having 100 or fewer employees.

We believe, therefore, that this action will have no significant impact on horse exports from the United States. Moreover,
we expect any impact to be beneficial, since the proposal establishes an additional, possibly less expensive, port
for the export of horses from the United States. 
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Commuted Traveltime Periods: Overtime Services Relating to Imports and Exports


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the regulations concerning overtime services provided by employees of Veterinary Services by adding
commuted traveltime allowances for travel between various locations in New Jersey and Illinois. Commuted traveltime
allowances are the periods of time required for Veterinary Services employees to travel from their dispatch points
and return there from the places where they perform Sunday, holiday, or other overtime duty. The Government charges
a fee for certain overtime services provided by Veterinary Services employees and, under certain circumstances,
the fee may include the cost of commuted traveltime. This action is necessary to inform the public of commuted traveltime
for these locations.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


The regulations in 9 CFR, chapter I, subchapter D, and 7 CFR, chapter III, require inspection, laboratory testing,
certification, or quarantine of certain animals, animal byproducts, plants, plant products, or other commodities
intended for importation into, or exportation from, the United States. When these services must be provided by an
employee of Veterinary Services (VS) on a Sunday or holiday, or at any other time outside the VS employee's regular
duty hours, the Government charges a fee for the services in accordance with 9 CFR part 97. Under circumstances described
in  97.1(a), this fee may include the cost of commuted traveltime. Section 97.2 contains administrative instructions
prescribing commuted traveltime allowances, which reflect, as nearly as practicable, the periods of time required
for VS employees to travel from their dispatch points and return there from the places where they perform Sunday, holiday,
or other overtime duty.
We are amending  97.2 of the regulations by adding commuted traveltime allowances for travel between various
locations in New Jersey and Illinois. The amendments are set forth in the rule portion of this document. This action
is necessary to inform the public of the commuted traveltime between the dispatch and service locations.


Effective Date


The commuted traveltime allowances appropriate for employees performing services at ports of entry, and the features
of the reimbursement plan for recovering the cost of furnishing port of entry services, depend upon facts within the
knowledge of the Department of Agriculture. It does not appear that public participation in this rulemaking proceeding
would make additional relevant information available to the Department.
Accordingly, pursuant to the administrative procedure provisions in 5 U.S.C. 553, we find upon good cause that prior
notice and other public procedure with respect to this rule are impracticable and unnecessary; we also find good cause
for making this rule effective less than 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register.




Executive Order 12866


This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866.
The number of requests for overtime services of a VS employee at the locations affected by our rule represents an insignificant
portion of the total number of requests for these services in the United States.
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.


Executive Order 12372


This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive
Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015,
subpart V.)


Executive Order 12778


This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have
preemptive effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations, or policies that conflict with its provisions
or that would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. There
are no administrative procedures that must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this
rule or the application of its provisions.


Paperwork Reduction Act


This rule contains no new information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

).


List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 97

Use of Carbon Dioxide in the Humane Slaughter of Swine


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

FSIS is amending the Federal meat inspection regulations to permit the use of carbon dioxide to induce death in swine.
The amendment, prompted by a petition from the Danish and Swedish Meat Research Institute, is based on scientific
research showing the use of carbon dioxide to induce death in swine to be an effective and humane slaughtering method.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Executive Order 12866


This final rule has been determined to be not-significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has
not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.


Executive Order 12778


This final rule has been reviewed pursuant to Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This final rule will permit
swine to be humanely slaughtered in official meat-packing establishments through the administration of carbon
dioxide.
State and local jurisdictions are preempted under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) from imposing any requirements
with respect to federally inspected premises and facilities, and operations of such establishments, that are in
addition to, or different than, those imposed under the FMIA. States and local jurisdictions are also preempted under
the FMIA from imposing any marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient requirements on federally inspected meat
or meat food products that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under the FMIA. States and local jurisdictions
may, however, exercise concurrent jurisdiction over meat products that are outside official establishments for
the purposes of preventing the distribution of meat products that are misbranded or adulterated under the FMIA or,
in the case of imported articles, which are not at such an establishment, after their entry into the United States.
States and local jurisdictions may also make requirements or take other actions that are consistent with the FMIA,
with respect to any other matters regulated under the FMIA.
Under the FMIA, States that maintain meat inspection programs must impose requirements on State-inspected products
and establishments that are at least equal to those required under the FMIA. These States may, however, impose more
stringent requirements on such State-inspected products and establishments.
No retroactive effect will be given to this final rule, and applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted
before any judicial challenge can be taken to the application of these provisions. Those administrative procedures
are set forth in 9 CFR 306.5.


Effect on Small Entities


The Administrator has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601).


The use of the carbon dioxide (CO

2

) slaughtering methods is voluntary. FSIS is not aware of any domestic establishments that are currently planning
to use this swine slaughtering method. Even if some establishments decide to use the method, there is no indication
that a substantial number of establishments will. There will be no impact on entities other than establishments engaged
in the slaughter of swine and the sale of swine carcasses and parts for human food. A significant investment will be
required by large or small entities establishing CO

2

 slaughtering facilities. Inspection program experts estimate that an investment of $50,000 to $100,000 per slaughtering
line would be necessary, depending on the size and complexity of the establishment. The decision to make this initial
investment will be entirely up to the establishment, although this rule authorizing CO

2

 slaughtering of swine could be a factor in making the decision. This investment could be more than offset by a reduction
in manpower required for restraining, stunning, and handling hogs after stunning.

<DOCNO> FR940426-0-00028 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940426-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Further, the improvement in meat quality, which advocates of the CO

2

 process claim, could lead to a greater amount of saleable product. Because the hogs are much more relaxed when slaughtered
with CO

2

 than they are when slaughtered by current methods, a number of desirable characteristics are imparted to the meat.
The amount of pale, soft, exudative pork, considered undesirable by meat buyers, is reduced under the process, as
well as blood spattering and broken bones. Also, less effort is expended on trimming and the removal of quality defects.
No adverse competitive effects on small entities resulting from adoption of the rule are anticipated. Because the
equipment needed for establishments to benefit from CO

2

 slaughtering is available in a range of prices, larger establishments choosing to use this method will not receive
greater proportional advantages than smaller ones choosing to do the same. For the reasons discussed above, the rule
will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.


Paperwork Requirements


This final rule imposes no new information collection requirements on official establishments or other members
of the public. Under the rules for the use of carbon dioxide to anaesthetize animals before slaughter, establishments
are required to sample gas for analysis from representative locations within the gas tunnels which convey the animals.
Gas concentrations and exposure times are to be recorded throughout each day's operations. These records are subject
to FSIS's standard records retention requirement at 9 CFR 320.3 and must be available to employees of the inspection
service. These carbon dioxide monitoring requirements are continued under this final rule.


Background


Under the Humane Slaughter Act (HSA) of 1958 (7 U.S.C. 1901-1906), as amended, the Secretary of Agriculture
is authorized to designate humane methods of handling and slaughter of food animals. The HSA (section 2 (a) ) sets forth
in number of methods of handling and slaughtering that have been found to be human, including the anaesthetization
of animals by electrical or chemical means before they are shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast, or cut. These methods
are available to slaughtering establishments under the FMIA (section 3; 21 U.S.C. 603).
FSIS was petitioned by the Danish and Swedish Meat Research Institute to amend the Federal meat inspection regulations
to permit the use of CO

2

 for the purpose of inducing death in swine. The petitioners based their request on studies demonstrating the beneficial
effects of this method on meat quality and the efficient handling of slaughter swine. Some Danish firms that export
product to the Untied States are planning to install systems for slaughtering swine with CO

2

, and FSIS believes it may be potentially beneficial to U.S. industry to make generally available the option of this
use of CO

2

.
The use of CO

2

 gas for stunning has been permitted since the early 1900's and is permitted by the HSA. Animals to be anaesthetized
by this method are placed on a conveyor and passed through tunnels filled with the gas. They are moved through the tunnels
at such a slow rate that they are unconscious when they emerge. They are then shackled, hoisted, stuck, and bled out.
In the last two decades, reports in the scientific literature have shown that the stunning of slaughter animals by
the administration of CO

2

 gas is just as effective as electrical stunning. There is little or no difference between the two methods in the amount
of stress inflicted on the animal. Whichever method is used, animals should be carefully handled before slaughter
to reduce stress, and sticking (exsanguination) should take place as soon as possible after stunning to prevent a
return to consciousness.
With respect to the administration of CO

2

, it has been demonstrated that if the concentration of the gas in the tunnels is increased, death ensues. Other effects,
including fewer injuries to the animals or establishment employees, have also been noted. Depending on the facilities
and equipment used and the technique of administration, CO

2

 stunning of swine can yield meat that has improved color, carcasses with fewer broken bones and blood spots in the most
desired cuts, less pale, soft, exudative pork, and higher boning and cutting yields.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940426-0-00029 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940426-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Studies have shown that the necessary conditions for death to take place are a 95-98 percent CO

2

 concentration and an exposure time of 3.5 minutes. The death-to-bleeding interval should be no longer than 2 minutes
to prevent pooling of blood in intestines and edible organs and no longer than 5 minutes to prevent the pooling of blood
in muscle tissue.
Under the FMIA, only those foreign establishments that have complied with inspection standards ``at least equal
to'' those enforced domestically by the United States Government may export product to this country. An establishment
in which slaughter methods are used that are prohibited by regulations under the FMIA is not eligible to export product
to the United States. Without the change in the regulations effected by this final rule, an establishment using CO

2

 to induce death in swine would be unable to export pork products to the United States.


Comments on the Proposed Rule


On September 10, 1993, FSIS published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 47673) a proposed rule to amend the Federal meat inspection regulations to allow official establishments to
induce death in swine by the use of carbon dioxide. The Agency received two comments, one from an industry consultant,
and one from a swine processor. Both commenters supported the proposed change in the regulations, citing research
indicating the process is safe and humane. One of the commenters expressed the belief that use of the carbon dioxide
slaughter process would encourage operators and suppliers to develop improved methods of handling and slaughtering
swine.


Final Rule


The Agency is, therefore, amending  313.5 of the Federal meat inspection regulations to remove the prohibition
against the use of CO

2

 as a direct cause of asphyxiation or death in swine and provide for monitoring of the conditions under which slaughter
by use of CO

2

 gas is administered. This amendment is consistent with the main purpose of the HSA, which is to render animals insensible
to pain before slaughter. The change will not require swine to be asphyxiated by CO

2

 before bleeding, but will permit exposure to concentrations of the gas for a sufficient amount of time for death to
occur. In addition, the requirement for a suitable exhaust system (9 CFR 313.5 (b)(3)) has been amended to more accurately
state the system's purpose, which is, in case of equipment breakdown, to prevent both nonuniform carbon dioxide concentrations
in the gas tunnel and leakage of carbon dioxide gas into the ambient air of the establishment.


List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 313


Humane slaughter of livestock, Meat inspection.



For the reasons set out in the preamble, 9 CFR part 313 of the Federal meat inspection regulations is amended as follows:


PART 313_HUMANE SLAUGHTER OF LIVESTOCK


1. The authority citation for part 313 continues to read as follows:





Authority:

 7 U.S.C. 1901-1906; 21 U.S.C. 601-695; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.55.



2. Paragraph (a)(1) of  313.5 is amended by adding a new last sentence; paragraphs (a)(3), (b)(1)(i), and the
last sentence of paragraph (b)(3) are revised to read as follows:


 313.5

Chemical; carbon dioxide.


* * * * *


(a)  * * *
(1)  * * * In swine, carbon dioxide may be administered to induce death in the animals
before they are shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast, or cut.
(2) * * *
(3) On emerging from the carbon dioxide tunnel, the animals shall be in a state of surgical anaesthesia and shall remain
in this condition throughout shackling, sticking, and bleeding, except for swine in which death has been induced
by the administration of carbon dioxide. Asphyxia or death from any cause shall not be produced in animals before bleeding,
except for swine in which death has been induced by the administration of carbon dioxide.
(b) * * *
(1) * * *
(i) The carbon dioxide gas shall be administered in a tunnel which is designed to permit the effective exposure of the
animal. Two types of tunnels, based on the same principle, are in common use for carbon dioxide anesthesia. They are
the ``U'' type tunnel and the ``Straight Line'' type tunnel, and are based on the principle that carbon dioxide gas
has a higher specific gravity than air. The tunnels are open at both ends for entry and exit of animals and have a depressed
central section. Anesthetizing, or, in the case of swine, death-inducing, carbon dioxide concentrations are maintained
in the central sections of the tunnels. Effective anaesthetization is produced in these central sections. Animals
are driven from holding pens through pathways constructed of large-diameter pipe or smooth metal and onto continuous
conveyor devices that move the animals through the tunnels. The animals are either compartmentalized on the conveyors
by mechanical impellers synchronized with the conveyor or they are otherwise prevented from crowding. While impellers
are used to compartmentalize the animals, mechanically or manually operated gates are used to move the animals onto
the conveyors. Surgically anaesthetized animals, or killed swine, are moved out of the tunnels by the same continuous
conveyors that moved them into and through the carbon dioxide gas.
(2)  * * *
(3)  * * * An exhaust system must be provided so that, in case of equipment failure, non-uniform
carbon dioxide concentrations in the gas tunnel or contamination of the ambient air of the establishment will be prevented.

(1) Revising a statutory citation regarding the transfer of funds and equities between Farm Credit System (System)
institutions, to reflect amendments to the Farm Credit Act of 1971; and 
(2) Updating the mailing address of the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation to reflect its move from New
York to New Jersey. 
In acting on the regulations, the Board determined that notice and public comment are neither required nor necessary.
Section 553(b)(A) of title 5 of the United States Code provides that the notice and comment requirements do not apply
to rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice; thus, no notice is required for regulations relating to
the FCA internal organization. In addition, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) provides that notice and comment requirements do
not apply when the agency for good cause finds that notice and public comment are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary
to the public interest. Because the amendments other than those that relate to agency organization are not substantive
changes to the regulations, involving only technical revisions to a statutory citation and a mailing address, the
Board finds that notice and public comment are unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. Therefore, the Board
finds for good cause that public participation in the promulgation of these regulations is not required, and these
regulations are hereby published in final form.

Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 757 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all Boeing Model 757 series airplanes.
This action requires revising the Non-Normal Procedures Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM)
to include procedures that will enable the flight crew to identify fuel system leaks and to take appropriate action
to prevent further fuel loss. This amendment is prompted by reports that flight crew procedures related to fuel system
leaks are not defined adequately in the FAA-approved AFM for these airplanes. The actions specified in this AD are
intended to ensure that the flight crew is advised of the potential hazard related to fuel exhaustion due to undetected
leakage, and the procedures necessary to address it. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Several in-service incidents have occurred on Model 757 series airplanes in which an engine fuel line has fractured
and a significant fuel leak has occurred. These fuel leaks have occurred at locations within the engine fuel system
upstream of the fuel flow transmitter. Under these circumstances, sufficient fuel may still be supplied to the engine,
and the engine may operate normally. In these instances, the flight crew would receive no indication of abnormal fuel
flow (i.e., fuel leakage) from the fuel flow meter. If the flight crew fails to detect a fuel leak, appropriate action
would not be taken to prevent further fuel loss. This condition, if not corrected, could result in fuel exhaustion
due to undetected fuel leakage. 


In light of this information, the FAA finds that certain procedures should be included in the FAA-approved Airplane
Flight Manual (AFM) for Model 757 series airplanes to enable the flight crew to detect fuel system leaks and to take
appropriate action. The FAA has determined that such procedures currently are not defined adequately in the AFM for
these airplanes. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Boeing Model 757 series airplanes
of the same type design, this AD is being issued to ensure that flight crews are advised of the potential hazard related
to a significantly reduced or exhausted airplane fuel supply, and of the procedures to address it. This AD requires
revising the Non-Normal Procedures Section of the AFM to include procedures that will enable the flight crew to identify
fuel system leaks and to take appropriate action to prevent further fuel loss. 
This is considered to be interim action until final action is identified, at which time the FAA may consider further
rulemaking. 
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 


Comments Invited 


Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption ``ADDRESSES.''
All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments 
submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement
is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-50-AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned
to the commenter. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption 

ADDRESSES.

(a) Within 60 days after the effective date of this AD, revise the Non-Normal Procedures Section of the FAA-approved
Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to include the following procedures, which will enable the flight crew to identify fuel
system leaks and to take appropriate action to prevent further fuel loss. This may be accomplished by inserting a copy
of this AD in the AFM. 


``Flight Management Computer (FMC) Message Fuel QTY Error or Fuel Disagree 


Compare the Fuel Quantity Indicating System (FQIS) total fuel quantity 
and the FMC calculated fuel remaining (based on fuel flow) with estimated 
fuel usage data. 
If a fuel leak is suspected, close the crossfeed valve and turn off the center fuel pumps. Watch for any unusual decrease
in fuel tank quantity and/or a fuel imbalance to determine if fuel is being lost. 
If an engine fuel leak is confirmed (either visually or by cockpit 
indications), shut down the affected engine to stop the leak and retain fuel. 
After shutdown, fuel from the remaining center, left, and right main tanks 
may be used for the operating engine. Use FQIS to determine fuel 
remaining.''
(b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane
Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector,
who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Seattle ACO. 





Note:

 Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained
from the Seattle ACO. 



(c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) 21.197 and 21.199
to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. 
(d) This amendment becomes effective on May 11, 1994.

I. Introduction



The Commission today is adopting a number of initiatives designed to streamline the registration and reporting process
for foreign companies accessing the U.S. public securities markets. In companion releases, the Commission is proposing
additional initiatives to further this goal.

18

 The rule and amendments adopted today were proposed by the Commission on November 3, 1993.

19

 In most respects, the rule and amendments are being adopted substantially as proposed.







Most of the comment letters received regarding the proposals were generally supportive of the Commission's efforts
to reduce the registration and reporting burdens on foreign companies.

20

 A number of commenters suggested modifications to the proposals, a number of which have been incorporated into the
provisions being adopted. 





These provisions are part of the ongoing efforts of the Commission to ease the transition of foreign companies into
the U.S. disclosure system, enhance the efficiencies of the registration and reporting processes and lower costs
of compliance, where consistent with investor protection. 

The new provisions further streamline the foreign issuer integrated disclosure system. This system already provides
a number of accommodations to foreign practices and policies. These accommodations include: 

 Interim reporting on the basis of home country regulatory and stock exchange practices; quarterly reports
are not required from foreign issuers; 

 Exemption from the proxy rules and Section 16 insider stock reports and short-swing profit recovery; 

 Executive compensation disclosure requirements that allow disclosure of compensation for executives on
an aggregate basis, if so reported in the issuer's home country; and 

 Offering document financial statements that are required to be updated principally on a semi-annual, rather
than quarterly, basis. 

Additionally, to facilitate cross border offerings and stock market listings, the Commission staff has implemented
procedures to review foreign issuers' disclosure documents in draft form on a non-public basis, if requested by the
issuer. Recognizing the particular difficulties of co-ordinating time schedules for cross border offerings, the
review process has been tailored to accommodate the special scheduling demands for such offerings. As reflected
in the companion releases, the Commission's efforts to address the special needs of foreign companies entering the
U.S. public markets are ongoing and will continue, as consistent with investor protection.

II. Expanded Availability of Short-Form and Shelf Registration 



The Commission is adopting revisions to its registration forms to extend to foreign issuers the benefits of short-form
and shelf registration to the same extent available to domestic companies. 



A. Short-Form Registration Statements



Under the amendments adopted today, the public float threshold for use of Form F-3 and full shelf registration
is reduced from $300 million to $75 million and the reporting history requirement is reduced from 36 months to 12 months.

21

 These are the same as the eligibility criteria applicable to domestic companies using Form S-3.





As proposed, Form F-3 would not have required that an annual or interim report have been filed or submitted to
the Commission prior to first use of the Form. Despite the proposal's requirement that a foreign issuer have been subject
to the Exchange Act reporting requirements for 12 months to be eligible to use Form F-3, it would have been possible
for an eligible issuer to have filed no reports during that period.

22

 As explained in the Proposing Release, foreign issuers, unlike domestic companies, are required to submit to the
Commission under Form 6-K only those interim reports and other materials that the issuer prepares in accordance
with home country or home market requirements or delivers to its securityholders. Moreover, unlike domestic companies
using Form S-3, foreign companies registering on Form F-3 are not required to incorporate by reference
all their reports on Form 6-K, but may chose which reports are incorporated. In light of these differences, as
suggested by several commenters, the revisions to Form F-3 as adopted require that the company have filed at
least one annual report prior to first use of the Form in order to ensure that information regarding the issuer is available
to the market.

23

 






B. Shelf Registration



The expanded eligibility for short-form registration on Form F-3 in turn will allow more foreign companies
the full benefits of shelf registration.

24

 Issuers eligible to register securities for primary offerings using short-form registration are able to offer those
securities on a delayed or continuous basis under the Commission shelf registration procedures.

25

 Through expanded Form F-3 eligibility, foreign issuers will be allowed the same financing flexibility and
efficiency that domestic issuers have through Form S-3 eligibility.

26

 In addition, as proposed, the unallocated shelf registration process is being extended to foreign companies on the
same basis as for domestic companies.

27

 The unallocated shelf process will permit foreign private issuers registering on Form F-3 to use one registration
statement to register debt, equity and other securities, without specifying the amount of each class of securities
to be offered.

28

 









C. Investment Grade Non-Convertible Securities 



Form F-3 is amended as proposed to permit foreign issuers to use short-form registration for all investment
grade non-convertible securities,

29

 without regard to the size of issuers' public float.

30

 These provisions parallel those applied to domestic companies. The amendments to Forms F-2 and F-3 also
clarify that the investment grade rating must exist at the time of sale to the public, rather than at the time of effectiveness.

The amendments also expand the availability of short-form registration to all investment grade securities of majority-owned
subsidiaries of foreign companies, which mirrors the treatment of domestic companies, as proposed. 


D. Secondary Offerings, Rights Offers, Dividend or Interest Reinvestment Plans, Convertible Securities and Warrants



Previously, a public float test applied to all users of Form F-3. In the amendments adopted today, the Commission,
as proposed, is eliminating the public float requirements for short-form registration in connection with secondary
offerings and certain rights offers, dividend or interest reinvestment plans, conversion of convertible securities
and exercise of warrants,
 to parallel the requirements for domestic issuers. 





For domestic issuers that do not have $75 million in public float, use of Form S-3 for rights offers, dividend
or interest reinvestment plans, conversion of convertible securities and exercise of warrants is conditioned on
delivery of information to subject security holders in the 12 months prior to registration.
 The required information is contained in the issuer's proxy statement and annual report to securityholders prepared
pursuant to the Commission's proxy rules.
 Foreign private issuers are exempt from the proxy rules and thus would not have had reason to deliver such information
to their securityholders. 






Comment was requested concerning whether an information delivery condition should be applied to all or certain foreign
issuers. Several commenters suggested that a foreign issuer with a public float below $75 million should be required
to deliver information similar to that required of domestic issuers. In view of the requirement being adopted today
that an issuer filing a registration statement on Form F-3 have filed at least one annual report under the Exchange
Act and given foreign issuers' historic exemption from the proxy rules, including the annual report delivery requirement,
the revisions to Form F-3 do not impose an information delivery requirement. Form F-3 requires an issuer
to provide copies of its Form 20-F annual report to offerees upon request.
 Thus, annual information will be available to investors. 





III. Streamlining Reconciliation Requirements 



A. Acceptance of Cash Flow Statements Prepared in Accordance With International Accounting Standards 


The Commission is adopting as proposed, with certain clarifications, amendments to accept without reconciliation
a cash flow statement prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards No. 7, ``Cash Flow Statements,''
as amended (``IAS 7''). 

</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940426-0-00040 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940426-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The commenters specifically addressing this issue supported the proposal. Most of the commenters did not believe
that the Financial Accounting Standards Board (``FASB'') should devote the resources to amend Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 95 (``SFAS 95''), and the Commission agrees. One commenter recommended that the final rules
provide guidance on the transition from a statement prepared in or reconciled to U.S. GAAP to one prepared in accordance
with IAS 7. In response to this comment, the General Instructions to Form 20-F provide that the presentation
of cash flow information should be consistent for all periods presented in the filing. 


B. Transitional Reconciliation Requirements 


The Commission is adopting, as proposed, amendments to Form 20-F that would permit first-time registrants
with the Commission to reconcile the required financial statements
 and selected financial data for only the two most recently completed fiscal years and any required interim periods.
 






In each subsequent year an additional year of reconciliation would be required. Thus, for example, a foreign company
with a calendar fiscal year-end entering the U.S. market in November 1994 would be required to provide reconciled
information with respect to 1993 and 1992 and interim periods. In the annual report it files for 1994 and any registration
statement filed thereafter (until the filing of the 1995 annual report), the reconciled data would be provided for
three years, 

i.e.

, 1992, 1993 and 1994, and interim periods if applicable. 
The amendments do not change the requirements with respect to the primary financial statements to be included in the
filings, 

i.e.

, audited balance sheets for the two most recently completed fiscal years and audited income and cash flow statements
for the three most recently completed fiscal years,
 and separate financial statements of significant acquirees or significant investees. Likewise, the requirement
to include selected financial data for the five most recent fiscal years remains unchanged. 





A majority of commenters supported the proposed transitional rules for reconciliation. There were some, on the other
hand, that opposed the change and several others that questioned whether the cost savings from eliminating the reconciliation
of the earliest year of the audited income and cash flow statements would be significant enough to justify the accommodation.

Based on its review of the comments, as well as its prior discussions with foreign issuers that have entered or considered
entering the U.S. public securities markets, the Commission believes the amendments will facilitate foreign companies'
entry into the U.S. public securities market consistent with investor protection. Therefore, the amendments are
adopted as proposed. In response to comments, Form 20-F will be clarified to indicate that the transitional
reconciliation relief also applies to financial disclosures required by U.S. GAAP and Regulation S-X. 
The Commission also is adopting, as proposed, amendments to allow the simpler reconciliation pursuant to Item 17
of Form 20-F for all offerings of non-convertible investment grade securities (whether debt, preferred stock
or other securities) regardless of the registration form used by the foreign private issuer.
 





C. Reconciliation of Financial Statements of Significant Acquirees and Significant Equity Investees 


The Commission is adopting, substantially as proposed, amendments that forego requiring a quantified reconciliation
of separate financial statements of certain acquired businesses and of certain less-than-majority-owned investees
(``equity investees'') based on higher thresholds of significance. A description of differences in accounting
methods would continue to be required. Financial statements of acquirees would not have to be reconciled unless the
acquiree exceeds the 30% significance level based on the registrant's investment, assets and pre-tax income.
 Similarly, financial statements of significant equity investees would not have to be reconciled unless the investee
exceeds the 30% significance level, but using only the investment and pre-tax income tests for significance.
 






Frequently, the information required by Item 18 of Form 20-F regarding U.S. GAAP and Regulation S-X is
more difficult to obtain for financial statements of acquirees and investees than for the issuer, but it is typically
less critical to an understanding of the issuer's financial condition.
 As suggested by several commenters, compliance with Item 17 of Form 20-F will be acceptable for financial statements
of all significant acquirees and investees.

D. Accommodation With Respect to Pro Rata Consolidation 


Generally accepted accounting principles in some countries allow pro rata consolidation for certain joint ventures
that would be accounted for under the equity method pursuant to U.S. GAAP. Net income and shareholders' equity are
not affected by an issuer's use of pro rata consolidation rather than the equity method. There may, however, be significant
differences in line item amounts reported in the balance sheet and statements of income and cash flows as a result of
the method chosen. 
The Commission is adopting, with certain modifications from the proposal, amendments to the forms to streamline
the reconciliation of these differences with respect to foreign private issuers that account for an investment in
a joint venture using pro rata consolidation. The amendments would require an issuer to provide summarized financial
information of the current assets/liabilities, noncurrent assets/liabilities, net sales, gross profit and net
income relating to its pro rata interest in the joint venture.
 Separate financial statements of a joint venture accounted for using the pro rata method are not required to be presented.






Most commenters supported the proposal to allow an issuer that uses pro rata consolidation to provide summarized
condensed financial information on a joint venture in lieu of all of the reconciliation information that would otherwise
be required. Several commenters indicated that condensed cash flow information should be provided to differentiate
cash flow associated with entities controlled by the registrant from those associated with the joint venture. As
suggested by these commenters, the rule requires summarized cash flow information_i.e., totals for major captions
of operating, financing and investing activities. 
As pointed out by commenters, there can be differences between the accounting standards used in the primary statements
and U.S. GAAP relating to the joint venture that effect recognition and measurement. The rule as adopted makes clear
that the omission from the reconciliation requirement only relates to differences in classification and display.

The Commission requested comment on whether the proposed amendment should be limited to certain types of joint ventures.
Several commenters suggested that limitations should apply in order to avoid extending relief to certain financing
situations where the intended purpose was to keep the selected debt and other financing off the balance sheet. The
accounting standards in many countries would limit the application of pro rata consolidation to appropriate situations.
However, given the variability of standards and interpretations, the rule as adopted limits the accommodation to
a joint venture that is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties undertake an economic activity in which
the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the economic activity for purposes of deriving economic
benefits are contractually shared. Therefore, relief under the rule will be available with respect to the accounting
for any operating entity in which the issuer holds an equity interest if the significant financial and operating policies
of the entity are, by contractual arrangement, jointly controlled by all parties having an equity interest in that
entity. The Commission believes that few, if any, substantive joint ventures will fall outside the scope of this relief.
However, in the event that an issuer accounts for other types of joint ventures using pro rata consolidation, the Commission's
staff will consider upon request whether to grant similar relief. 


E. Elimination of Certain Financial Statement Schedules 


The amendments to eliminate six financial schedules are adopted as proposed. As suggested by several commenters,
the Commission is proposing to eliminate several financial schedules and to provide comparable relief to domestic
issuers in a companion release.
 





IV. Safe Harbors for Public Announcements of Unregistered Offerings and Broker-Dealer Research Reports 


A. Company Announcements of Unregistered Offerings 


As noted in the Proposing Release, the growing number of offshore offerings and U.S. private placements has resulted
in repeated requests for guidance concerning appropriate disclosure of such offerings, in light of the limitations
on general solicitation and directed selling efforts in private placements and offshore offerings under Regulation
S.
 To address these concerns, the Commission today is adopting a new safe harbor for issuers' announcements of offerings
not registered or required to be registered under the Securities Act.
 The safe harbor is available to both domestic and foreign issuers. 







</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940426-0-00042 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940426-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In response to the Commission's request for comment on the new safe harbor, the National Association of State Securities
Administrators (NASAA) urged the Commission to provide the safe harbor only for foreign and domestic reporting companies
and foreign companies that have obtained a Rule 12g3-2(b) exemption if such information is deemed material
to the marketplace. NASAA expressed concerns that, as proposed, the safe harbor was overbroad in its applicability
to companies without a public market, and thus particularly vulnerable to abuse. The Commission agrees that it would
be appropriate in introducing the safe harbor that it be limited to reporting companies and foreign companies that
have obtained a Rule 12g3-2(b)

47

 exemption. As adopted, the safe harbor is so limited. Given the safe harbor's requirement that copies be filed or provided
to the Commission and its exclusion of announcements for the purpose of conditioning the market, the rule should provide
adequate means to address abuses without a materiality requirement. 





In all other respects, the terms and conditions of the new safe harbor are being adopted substantially as proposed.
The information permitted in the announcement is limited to that which is allowed under the safe harbor for pre-filing
announcements with respect to registered offerings.

48

 In addition, the announcement must contain a legend stating that the securities are not registered under the Securities
Act and may not be sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements.
To rely on the safe harbor, a company must file or submit the announcement with the Commission under Form 8-K or
6-K, as applicable, or provide it to the Commission in accordance with Rule 12g3-2(b) if the issuer is relying
on that exemptive rule. The safe harbor is not available if the announcement is being used for the purpose of conditioning
the market in the United States for the securities being offered. 





B. Broker-Dealer Research Reports 



The amendments to Rule 139 under the Securities Act are adopted today in the form proposed. The amendments provide
that broker-dealers may rely upon the simpler conditions of the Rule 139 safe harbor with respect to certain foreign
issuers that have had securities listed or quoted on a designated offshore securities market for at least 12 months.




V. Cost-Benefit Analysis 



No specific data were provided in response to the Commission's request regarding the costs and benefits of the rule
and amendments being adopted today. The commenters did not address specifically the costs and benefits of the proposed
rule and amendments. Eight commenters generally opposed the proposals in the belief that they would be detrimental
to U.S. investors. Seventeen commenters addressed specific aspects of the proposals and generally supported the
proposals. The Commission is not aware of any costs that will result from the rule and amendments. The Commission believes
that the adoption of these rules will be beneficial to U.S. investors, as it will encourage more foreign companies
to list their securities and raise capital in the United States and be consistent with investor protection. 



VI. Availability of Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 



A Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act has been prepared with
respect to the final rule and amendments. A summary of a corresponding Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was
included in the Proposing Release. Members of the public who wish to obtain a copy of the Final Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis should contact Annemarie Tierney, Office of International Corporate Finance, Division of Corporation
Finance, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Mail Stop 3-9, Washington, DC 20549, (202)
272-3246. 



VII. Statutory Bases 



The final rule and amendments to the Commission's rules and forms are being adopted pursuant to sections 6, 7, 8, 10
and 19(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and sections 3(b), 4A, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 23 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. 



VIII. Effective Date 



The final rule and amendments to the Commission's rules and forms shall be effective immediately upon publication
in the 

Federal Register

, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, which allows effectiveness in less than 30 days after publication
for, 

inter alia, 

``a substantive rule which grants or recognizes an exemption or relieves a restriction.'' 5 U.S.C.  553(d)(1).

Disclosure by Investment Advisers Regarding Wrap Fee Programs 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Securities and Exchange Commission.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule and form amendments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission is adopting rule and form amendments under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 relating to ``wrap fee''
programs. The amendments specify the information that registered investment advisers that are sponsors of wrap
fee programs must provide to prospective clients in these programs. The amendments are intended to provide prospective
wrap fee program clients with important information regarding the cost of the programs and the services provided.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') today is adopting amendments to: 


(1) Form ADV [17 CFR 279.1] under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80b-1 

et seq

.] (the ``Advisers Act'') to require advisers that sponsor wrap fee programs (``sponsors'') to file with the Commission
as part of Form ADV a document (the ``wrap fee brochure'') containing certain disclosures about the sponsor and its
wrap fee programs in a narrative (rather than check-the-box) format; 
(2) Rule 204-3 under the Advisers Act [17 CFR 275.204-3] to require sponsors to deliver the wrap fee brochure
to current and prospective wrap fee program clients in lieu of the disclosure document they are required to deliver
to other clients and prospective clients; and 
(3) Rule 204-1 under the Advisers Act [17 CFR 275.204-1] setting forth the requirements for updating the
wrap fee brochure. 


I. Discussion 


On January 13, 1994, the Commission issued a release proposing amendments to Form ADV and related rules under the Advisers
Act (``Proposing Release'') to improve the quality of brochure disclosure that clients of wrap fee programs receive.
 A wrap fee program provides an investor with two types of services: investment advisory services and execution services
for a single ``wrap'' fee, usually a percentage of assets under management. Among the advisory services typically
provided are asset allocation, portfolio management, and monitoring of the portfolio management services.
 Other ancillary services, such as custody of client funds and securities and client reporting, are also provided.
The Commission proposed that the sponsor of a wrap fee program provide the wrap fee brochure to prospective clients
of the program in lieu of the brochure the sponsor currently is required to provide to other advisory clients.
 The Commission also proposed requirements for disclosure to be included in the wrap fee brochure. The Commission
received thirty comment letters in response to the proposed amendments.

The Commission is adopting the proposed amendments with some modifications to reflect comments received. The modifications
generally relate to the scope of the obligation to deliver the wrap fee brochure (

i.e.

, the definitions of ``wrap fee program'' and ``sponsor'') and the disclosure requirements of the brochure.

5

 





A. Applicability of Disclosure Requirements 



The Commission proposed to require that the wrap fee brochure be provided by ``sponsors'' of ``wrap fee programs.''
The Commission received several comments concerning the scope of these terms. The amendments, as adopted, contain
modifications to reflect certain of these comments. 



1. Wrap Fee Programs 



Under the proposal, a ``wrap fee program'' was defined, in part, as a program under which any client is charged for investment
advisory and execution services a specified fee or fees not based directly upon the transactions in the client's account.
Some commenters asserted that programs under which clients are charged a wrap fee for portfolio management and execution
of transactions, but under which no advice about portfolio managers is provided, should be excluded from the definition
of wrap fee program because of the absence of advice about portfolio managers.

6

 The wrap fee brochure is intended to address the special disclosure needs of clients participating in programs that
offer investment advice and brokerage for a single fee, regardless of whether advice about portfolio managers is
provided.

7

 Therefore, as adopted, the definition of wrap fee program includes programs under which no advice regarding portfolio
managers is provided.

8

 







a. 

Managed Account Programs

. In the Proposing Release, the Commission requested comment whether ``managed account programs,'' under which
clients are provided with advice about portfolio managers but are charged advisory fees together with transaction-based
commissions (rather than a single fee), should be included in the definition of wrap fee program. Commenters generally
were opposed to the inclusion of managed account programs in the definition. Because managed account programs do
not involve advisory and brokerage services provided for a single fee and thus do not raise the types of disclosure
concerns addressed in the amendments, the Commission has not included these programs within the definition.

9


 




b. 

Mutual Fund Asset Allocation Programs

. The proposed amendments would have included as wrap fee programs arrangements under which advice is provided regarding
the allocation of client assets among mutual funds affiliated with the sponsor. Many commenters argued that mutual
fund asset allocation programs should be excluded from the definition because they are more similar to traditional
advisory services than to wrap fee programs, and the disclosure concerns they raise are addressed under current Part
II of Form ADV (``Part II''). The Commission believes that mutual fund asset allocation programs, because they do
not involve the provision of advisory and brokerage services for a single wrap fee, generally do not raise the disclosure
concerns addressed in the amendments, and has modified the definition of wrap fee program to exclude mutual fund asset
allocation programs. The Commission may consider in connection with future revisions to Form ADV whether additional
disclosure requirements regarding these programs are needed.

2. Sponsors 



The proposed amendments defined the term ``sponsor'' broadly to include an adviser that sponsors or organizes a wrap
fee program or that provides advice to clients regarding the selection of portfolio managers in the program.
 The Commission recognized that such a broad definition might result in a single program's having more than one sponsor,
and therefore proposed to permit the sponsors to choose among themselves the sponsor that would deliver the wrap fee
brochure to clients.
 Some comments suggested that the definition of sponsor unintentionally included advisers who recommend wrap fee
program portfolio managers to clients, but who are not involved with or compensated under the wrap fee program. In
addition, commenters suggested that the definition of ``sponsor'' be made consistent with the North American Securities
Administrators Association's proposed amendments to their Uniform Rules under the Uniform Securities Act.
 







Based on these comments, the Commission is revising the definition of sponsor to include only those advisers that
``are compensated under a wrap fee program for sponsoring, organizing, or administering the program, or for selecting,
or providing advice to clients regarding the selection of, other investment advisers in the program.''
 A registered adviser that has an advisory relationship or prospective advisory relationship with a wrap fee client,
but is not compensated under the wrap fee program, is not a sponsor and must provide the client with the brochure that
the adviser is otherwise required to provide its clients pursuant to rule 204-3 under Advisers Act (the ``general
brochure'').
 A sponsor of a wrap fee program that is a registered investment adviser must deliver the wrap fee brochure (unless another
sponsor has assumed that obligation) to a prospective client of the program even if that sponsor will not have an advisory
relationship with the prospective client (because, for example, that sponsor provides only administrative services
under the program).
 







B. The Separate Brochure 



1. In General 



As noted above, the Commission proposed a narrative wrap fee brochure that would be separate from, and would be provided
to wrap fee clients in lieu of, the sponsor's general brochure. Commenters generally supported requiring a narrative
disclosure document in connection with wrap fee programs. Commenters were divided, however, over whether a separate
wrap fee brochure should be required. Nine commenters supported requiring a separate brochure, six of whom asserted
that a separate document should be required for each program.
 Nine other commenters opposed the separate brochure requirement, arguing that a brochure describing all of the sponsor's
advisory services would provide relevant information about the client's investment alternatives. 





The Commission has decided to retain a separate brochure requirement.
 The Commission has observed that brochures containing disclosure about wrap fee programs often also describe other
programs that are not available to most wrap fee clients because they do not meet the minimum account or other eligibility
requirements of those other programs. Thus, these combined brochures may not in fact provide information about available
investment alternatives, as argued by commenters opposing the separate brochure proposal. Moreover, brochures
describing multiple programs are often lengthy and cumbersome and may discourage prospective clients from reading
them.
 






Commenters opposed to a separate brochure requirement also argued that such a requirement would impose substantial
additional costs on sponsors. The Commission believes, however, that the cost burden of a separate brochure requirement
will be small in relation to its benefits.
 





The Commission does not expect that sponsors will need to deliver both their general brochure and their wrap fee brochure
to significant numbers of prospective advisory clients. Many prospective wrap fee program clients will likely not
be interested in or eligible for other programs. Furthermore, a client being offered a program with a choice of fee
arrangements need only be offered the wrap fee brochure.
 





2. Multiple Wrap Fee Programs 



The proposed amendments would give sponsors the option to prepare either a single brochure describing all their wrap
fee programs or separate brochures describing different programs. The Proposing Release requested comment whether
separate brochures should be required for each of a sponsor's wrap fee programs, or whether a single brochure describing
all programs should be required. Some commenters believed that separate brochures for each program should be required,
while others believed that sponsors should have the flexibility to use either separate or combined brochures. 

The Commission is retaining the provision in the proposal giving sponsors the option to prepare either a single brochure
describing all of their wrap fee programs or separate brochures for each program. A sponsor that uses separate brochures
for different wrap fee programs must note the existence of the other programs in each brochure, and state how brochures
for the other programs can be obtained.
 This disclosure will inform clients that alternative programs may be available to them. 





C. Contents of the Brochure 



The requirements for the contents of the wrap fee brochure are set forth in a new schedule to Form ADV, Schedule H.
 The requirements of Schedule H are substantially similar to the requirements set forth in the proposed amendments.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940426-0-00060 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940426-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission urges sponsors to draft wrap fee brochures in a direct and understandable manner. Consideration should
be given, for example, to the level of sophistication of clients and prospective clients of the program. In addition,
technical language should be avoided, unless it is clearly explained or substantially all of the program's clients
and prospective clients possess the sophistication to understand the disclosure without explanation. 


1. Cover Page and Table of Contents 


Schedule H requires that the cover page of the wrap fee brochure include the sponsor's name, address, telephone number,
and a legend regarding the purpose of the brochure.
 These requirements are the same as those of the proposed amendments. In addition, the amendments require that the
wrap fee brochure include a table of contents reflecting the subject headings in the brochure. The table of contents
need not be on the cover page.
 





2. Fee and Compensation Disclosure 


The Commission is adopting as proposed those provisions of Schedule H that require the wrap fee brochure to set forth
the wrap fee, the services provided for that fee, and whether the fee is negotiable.
 Schedule H also requires that the brochure describe the nature of any fees the client may pay in addition to the wrap
fee, state that the program may cost the client more or less than the same services purchased separately, and disclose
the factors that bear upon the cost of the program in relation to the cost of the same services purchased separately.
 If fees vary according to a schedule (e.g., on the basis of the amount of assets the client has in the program), the fee
schedule must be presented in a table. 





As adopted, Schedule H also retains the requirement of the proposal that the portion of the wrap fee paid to portfolio
managers (or the range of those amounts) be disclosed in the wrap fee brochure.
 The Proposing Release requested comment whether similar information should be required regarding the compensation
paid to registered representatives of the sponsor in connection with wrap fee accounts, and whether disclosure that
registered representatives have a financial incentive to recommend the wrap fee program over other services of the
sponsor should be required. Industry commenters were opposed to requiring amounts of compensation to be disclosed,
in part because the amounts often vary substantially among representatives, but many acknowledged the need for disclosure
that representatives are compensated. 




The method and amount of compensation of an adviser or its representative may create a conflict of interest between
the adviser and its client and the representative and his client if incentives are created for recommending a wrap
fee program rather than, for example, mutual funds or other advisory programs (including traditional fee-plus-commission
arrangements) that meet the needs of clients and that may be less expensive. To alert investors to this conflict of
interest, Schedule H requires that, if persons recommending a wrap fee program receive compensation as a result of
client participation in the program, the wrap fee brochure must disclose (1) that persons recommending the program
will be compensated, (2) that the amount of this compensation may be more than the amount the person would receive if
the client participated in other programs of the sponsor or paid separately for investment advice, brokerage and
other services, and (3) that the person may therefore have a financial incentive to recommend the program over other
programs or services.
 




3. Portfolio Manager Performance Information 


The Commission proposed that the wrap fee brochure be required to disclose if performance information provided to
clients regarding portfolio managers is not calculated on a uniform or consistent basis, and to refer to any standards
under which the information is calculated.
 The Commission also proposed that the brochure disclose whether performance information is reviewed by the sponsor
or a third party, and, if so, the identity of the reviewer.
 These requirements are being adopted substantially as proposed. 





The Proposing Release requested comment whether sponsors should be required to explain the extent of any review of
portfolio manager performance information. Most commenters addressing the issue favored such disclosure, and
the amendments require the wrap fee brochure to describe briefly the nature of the review.
 This description should include, among other matters, whether the review is designed to determine whether the performance
information reflects the actual experience of accounts under management, the appropriateness of the methodology
used to calculate performance, compliance with any standards the sponsor or portfolio manager has stated it will
follow, and/or whether the reviewer has merely reviewed the mathematical accuracy of the calculations.
 If the scope of the review of the performance information is limited to the mathematical accuracy of the calculations,
the brochure should describe that the reviewer has not reviewed the information to determine the appropriateness
of the methodology used or whether the information reflects the actual experience of accounts under management.

4. Other Disclosure Requirements 


The other disclosure requirements of the proposed amendments are being adopted largely as proposed. These requirements
include how portfolio managers in the program are selected,

33

 the information about the client that is communicated to its portfolio manager,

34

 and restrictions placed on client contact with portfolio managers.

35

 The general disclosure about the sponsor that is required to be included in the wrap fee brochure by reference to certain
questions of Part II is also being adopted without modification to the proposal.

36

 







D. Delivery and Updating 


The amendments require that the wrap fee brochure be delivered to prospective wrap fee clients and annually offered
to an adviser's existing wrap fee clients.

37

 The Commission is also requiring that the wrap fee brochure be delivered to all clients (including clients who have
received the sponsor's general brochure) on a one-time basis when the brochure is first filed with the Commission,
so that existing clients of wrap fee programs receive the basic disclosure about the program that will in the future
be provided to prospective clients.

38

 





The wrap fee brochure is required to be updated promptly to reflect material changes to the information it contains,
or within ninety days after the end of the sponsor's fiscal year to reflect other changes.

39

 The wrap fee brochure may be updated by the use of a sticker (

i.e., 

a supplement affixed to the brochure that indicates what information is being added or updated and states the new or
revised information). The proposed amendments would have limited sponsors to two consecutive stickers before all
changes would have had to be incorporated into the brochure itself. As some commenters suggested, the Commission
is not adopting a numerical limit on stickers; instead, updating by sticker will be permitted so long as the resulting
brochure remains readable.

E. Date of Effectiveness 


A sponsor is required to file an amendment to Form ADV to include the necessary wrap fee brochure or brochures, to deliver
the wrap fee brochure to existing wrap fee clients,

41

 and to begin to deliver the wrap fee brochure to prospective wrap fee clients, by October 1, 1994, approximately five
months after the adoption of the amendments.

42

 





II. Cost/Benefit Analysis 


Several commenters raised concerns that the form and rule amendments as proposed, particularly the requirement
for a separate wrap fee brochure, could result in additional costs for sponsors that may be passed on to investors.
The Commission has modified the amendments in part because of these concerns, but continues to believe that the cost
of a separate wrap fee brochure is outweighed by the benefit to investors of improved disclosure about wrap fee programs.

The Commission has narrowed the scope of the terms ``wrap fee program'' and ``sponsor.'' As a result, certain advisers
that would have incurred the costs of the wrap fee brochure under the proposed amendments will not incur any costs as
a result of the amendments, and other advisers will incur reduced costs because fewer of their programs are subject
to the amendments. The Commission has also liberalized the use of stickers, which should reduce the cost of updating
the brochure. 
The Commission does not believe that the cost of a separate wrap fee brochure need be substantial. The brochure need
not be professionally printed, and professionally printed brochures generally can be updated by sticker, rendering
frequent reprinting unnecessary.

III. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis 


A summary of the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, which was prepared in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603, was
published in Investment Advisers Act Rel. No. 1401. No comments were received on this analysis. The Commission has
prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, a copy of which may be obtained by contacting Eric C. Freed, Office
of Disclosure and Investment Adviser Regulation, Division of Investment Management, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20549.

Appendix 1



Schedule H of Form ADV

Applicant:SEC File No.: 801-
Date: MM/DD/YY



(for sponsors of wrap fee programs)



Name of wrap fee program or programs described in attached brochure:

1. 

Applicability of Schedule. 

This Schedule must be completed by applicants that are compensated under a wrap fee program for sponsoring, organizing,
or administering the program, or for selecting, or providing advice to clients regarding the selection of, other
investment advisers in the program (``sponsors''). A wrap fee program is any program under which a specified fee or
fees not based directly upon transactions in a client's account is charged for investment advisory services (which
may include portfolio management or advice concerning the selection of other investment advisers) and execution
of client transactions.

2. 

Use of Schedule. 

This Schedule sets forth the information the sponsor must include in the wrap fee brochure it is required to deliver
or offer to deliver to clients and prospective clients of its wrap fee programs under Rule 204-3 under the federal
Advisers Act and similar rules of the jurisdictions. The wrap fee brochure prepared in response to this Schedule must
be filed with the Commission and the jurisdictions as part of Form ADV by completing the identifying information on
this Schedule and attaching the brochure. Brochures should be prepared separately, not on copies of this Schedule.
Any wrap fee brochure filed with the Commission as part of an amendment to Form ADV shall contain in the upper right hand
corner of the cover page  the  sposor's  registration  number  (801-   ).

3. 

General Contents of Brochure. 

Unlike Parts I and II of this form, this Schedule is not organized in ``check-the-box'' format. These Instructions,
including the requests for information in Item 7 below, should not be repeated in the brochure. Rather, this Schedule
describes minimum disclosures that must be made in the brochure to satisfy the sponsor's duty to disclose all material
facts about the sponsor and its wrap fee programs. Nothing in this Schedule relieves the sponsor from any obligation
under any provision of the federal Advisers Act or rules thereunder, or other federal or state law to disclose information
to its advisory clients or prospective advisory clients not specifically required by this Schedule.

4. 

Multiple Sponsors. 

If two or more persons fall within the definition of ``sponsor'' in Item 1 above for a single wrap fee program, only one
such sponsor need complete the Schedule. The sponsors may choose among themselves the sponsor that will complete
the Schedule.

5. 

Omission of Inapplicable Information. 

Any information not specifically required by this Schedule that is included in the brochure should be applicable
to clients and prospective clients of the sponsor's wrap fee programs. If the sponsor is required to complete this
Schedule with respect to more than one wrap fee program, the sponsor may omit from the brochure furnished to clients
and prospective clients of any wrap fee program or programs information required by this Schedule that is not applicable
to clients or prospective clients of that wrap fee program or programs. If a sponsor of more than one wrap fee program
prepares separate wrap fee brochures for clients of different programs, each brochure prepared must be filed with
the Commission and the jurisdictions attached to a separate copy of this Schedule. Each such brochure must state that
the sponsor sponsors other wrap fee programs and state how brochures for those programs may be obtained.

6. 

Updating. 

Sponsors are required to file an amendment to the brochure promptly after any information in the brochure becomes
materially inaccurate. Amendments may be made by use of a ``sticker,'' 

i.e., 

a supplement affixed to the brochure that indicates what information is being added or updated and states the new or
revised information, as long as the resulting brochure is readable. Stickers should be dated and should be incorporated
into the text of the brochure when the brochure itself is revised.

7. 

Contents of Brochure. 

Include in the brochure prepared in response to this Schedule:

(a) on the cover page, the sponsor's name, address, telephone number, and the following legend in bold type or some
other prominent fashion:

This brochure provides clients with information about [name of sponsor] and the [name of program or programs] that
should be considered before becoming a client of the [name of program or programs]. This information has not been approved
or verified by any governmental authority.

(b) a table of contents reflecting the subject headings in the sponsor's brochure;

(c) the amount of the wrap fee charged for each program or, if fees vary according to a schedule established by the sponsor,
a table setting forth the fee schedule, whether such fees are negotiable, the portion of the total fee (or the range
of such amounts) paid to persons providing advice to clients regarding the purchase of sale of specific securities
under the program (``portfolio managers''), and the services provided under each program (including the types of
portfolio management services);

(d) a statement that the program may cost the client more or less than purchasing such services separately and a statement
of the factors that bear upon the relative cost of the program (

e.g., 

the cost of the services if provided separately and the trading activity in the client's account);

(e) if applicable, a statement that the person recommending the program to the client receives compensation as a result
of the client's participation in the program, that the amount of this compensation may be more than what the person
would receive if the client participated in other programs of the sponsor or paid separately for investment advice,
brokerage, and other services, and that the person may therefore have a financial incentive to recommend the wrap
fee program over other programs or services;

7. (f) a description of the nature of any fees that the client may pay in addition to the wrap fee and the circumstances
under which these fees may be paid (including, if applicable, mutual fund expenses and mark-ups, mark-downs or spreads
paid to market makers from whom securities were obtained by the wrap fee broker);


(g) how the program's portfolio managers are selected and reviewed, the basis upon which portfolio managers are recommended
or chosen for particular clients, and the circumstances under which the sponsor will replace or recommend the replacement
of the portfolio manager;


(h) (1) if applicable, a statement to the effect that portfolio manager performance information is not reviewed by
the sponsor or a third party and/or that performance information is not calculated on a uniform and consistent basis,


(2) if performance information is reviewed to determine its accuracy, the name of the party who reviews the information
and a brief description of the nature of the review,


(3) a reference to any standards (

i.e., 

industry standards or standards used solely by the sponsor) under which performance information may be calculated;


(i) a description of the information about the client that is communicated by the sponsor to the client's portfolio
manager, and how often or under what circumstances the sponsor provides updated information about the client to the
portfolio managers;


(j) any restrictions on the ability of clients to contact and consult with portfolio managers;


(k) in narrative text, the information required by Items 7 and 8 of Part II of this form and, as applicable to clients
of the wrap fee program, the information required by Items 2, 5, 6, 9A and C, 10, 11, 13 and 14 of Part II;


(l) if any practice or relationship disclosed in response to Items 7, 8, 9A, 9C and 13 of Part II presents a conflict between
the interests of the sponsor and those of its clients, explain the nature of any such conflict of interest; and


(m) if the sponsor or its divisions or employees covered under the same investment adviser registration as the sponsor
act as portfolio managers for a wrap fee program described in the brochure, a brief, general description of the investments
and investment strategies utilized by those portfolio managers.


8. 

Organization and Cross References. 

Except for the cover page requirements in Item 7(a) above, information contained in the brochure need not follow the
order of the items listed in Item 7. However, the brochure should not be organized in such a manner that important information
called for by the form is obscured.

Set forth below the page(s) of the brochure on which the various disclosures required by Item 7 are provided.

Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Withdrawal of final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On February 23, 1994 (59 FR 8542), EPA published a document to approve without prior proposal the February 24, 1993,
version of the revisions made by Florida to the Florida State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions established
a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), to be
fully implemented by November 15, 1994. This implementation plan was submitted by the State to satisfy the Federal
mandate to ensure that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory information necessary
to comply with the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (CAA). EPA subsequently received adverse comments on the action.
Accordingly, EPA is withdrawing its direct-final approval. Elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register

, EPA is proposing to approve the February 23, 1993, version of revisions made by Florida and providing an opportunity
to comment on the proposal.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Implementation of the Clean Air Act (CAA) requires small businesses to comply with specific regulations in order
for areas to attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of air
toxics. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that states adopt
a PROGRAM, and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the federally approved SIP. On February 24, 1993, the Florida Department
of Environmental Protection submitted to EPA for approval the requisite revisions to the SIP establishing the PROGRAM.
These revisions were adopted by the Florida Legislature by amending chapter 403 of the Florida Statute, approved
on April 8, 1992. The EPA reviewed this request for revision of the federally approved SIP and found it to be in conformance
with the requirements of the 1990 CAA. EPA therefore published a notice to approve the revisions without prior proposal
(59 FR 8542, February 23, 1994).



In the final rulemaking, EPA advised the public the effective date of the action was deferred for 60 days (until April
25, 1994) to provide an opportunity to submit comments. EPA announced if notice was received within 30 days of the publication
of the final rule that someone wanted to submit adverse or critical comments, the final action would be withdrawn and
a new rulemaking would begin by proposing a 30 day comment period. EPA had earlier published a general notice explaining
this special procedure (56 FR 44477, September 4, 1991).

EPA has received comments on this action that address the structure of the Florida PROGRAM. Accordingly, the Agency
is today withdrawing its approval.

EPA is withdrawing this action without providing prior notice and opportunity for comment. The Agency finds it has
good cause within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 553(b) to proceed without notice and comment. Notice and comment would be
impracticable in this case because EPA needs to withdraw its approval as quickly as possible in order to consider the
comments which the public has submitted or may wish to submit. Moreover, further notice is not necessary because EPA
has already informed the public it would follow this procedure if it received a request for the opportunity to comment.
For the same reasons, EPA finds it has good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(d) to make this withdrawal immediately effective.

The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.

withdrawn.

Georgia; Final Authorization of Revisions to State Hazardous Waste Management Program



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Immediate final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Georgia has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA). Georgia's revisions consist of the provisions contained in RCRA Cluster II which are the
hazardous waste rules promulgated between July 1, 1991, and June 30, 1992. These requirements are listed in section
B of this notice. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Georgia's application and has made a decision,
subject to public review and comment, that the Georgia hazardous waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements
necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve Georgia's hazardous waste program revisions.
Georgia's application for program revisions is available for public review and comment.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Background



States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or
``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent
to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure,
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'') allows
States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements promulgated
under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive ``interim authorization'' for the HSWA requirements
under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and later apply for final authorization for the HSWA requirements.

Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority
is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes
to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 268 and 270.



B. Georgia



Georgia initially received final authorization for its base RCRA program effective on August 21, 1984. Georgia received
authorization for revisions to its program for RCRA Cluster I on January 12, 1994 (11/16/93; FR 60388). Today, Georgia
is seeking approval of its program revisions in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3) for rules promulgated between
July 1, 1991, and June 30, 1992, otherwise known as RCRA Cluster II.

EPA has reviewed Georgia's RCRA Cluster II application and has made an immediate final decision that Georgia's hazardous
waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently,
EPA intends to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to Georgia. The public may submit
written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until May 26, 1994.

Copies of Georgia's application for these program revisions are available for inspection and copying at the locations
indicated in the addresses

 section of this notice.

Approval of Georgia's program revisions shall become effective May 26, 1994 unless an adverse comment pertaining
to the State's revisions discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period.

If an adverse comment is received EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision; or (2)
a notice containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or
reverses the decision.

EPA shall administer any RCRA hazardous waste permits, or portions of permits that contain conditions based upon
the Federal program provisions for which the State is applying for authorization and which were issued by EPA prior
to the effective date of this authorization. EPA will suspend issuance of any further permits under the provisions
for which the State is being authorized on the effective date of this authorization. 

Georgia is today seeking authority to administer the following Federal requirements. 






Checklist 85, Burning of Hazardous Waste in Boilers and Industrial Furnaces, (2/21/91, 56 FR 7134), was submitted
in the authorization application with RCRA Cluster I. EPA is withholding a decision to authorize Georgia for the Burning
of Hazardous Waste in Boilers and Industrial Furnaces Rule as well as the technical corrections in Checklists 94,
96, and 98, until the State's capability has been assessed. 



C. Decision 



I conclude that Georgia's application for these program revisions meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements
established by RCRA. Accordingly, Georgia is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program
as revised, except where otherwise noted.

Georgia now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and
carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program, subject to the limitations of its program revision application, its
previously approved authorities and where otherwise noted in this Notice. Georgia also has primary enforcement
responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement
actions under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA. 



Compliance With Executive Order 12866



The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.



Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act



Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of Georgia's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for
handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities.

This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

Bylaws of the Legal Services Corporation 


<AGENCY>

 Legal Services Corporation.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule removes the bylaws of the Legal Services Corporation (LSC or Corporation) from the Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR), because the bylaws are purely internal procedural rules that do not affect the rights and interests
of parties outside the Corporation.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The bylaws of the Corporation were published as final at 49 FR 23050 (June 4, 1984) and amended at 50 30711 (July 29, 1985).



At its meeting on April 16, 1994, the Corporation's Board of Directors (Board) determined that the Corporation's
bylaws, which appear at 45 CFR part 1601, are purely internal procedural rules of the Corporation not subject to the
notice and comment and/or publication requirement of the LSC Act, 42 U.S.C. 2996g(e). As the bylaws do not affect the
rights and interests of parties outside the Corporation and are not regulations of the Corporation, they should not
be included in the CFR. Therefore, the Board directed that the bylaws be withdrawn from the CFR.

Acquisition Regulation; Additional Miscellaneous Amendments to NASA FAR Supplement 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Procurement, Procurement Policy Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document amends the NASA Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (NFS) to reflect a number of additional
miscellaneous changes: Points of contact; solicitation cover pages; contracting officer technical representatives;
Technical Direction clause; and editorial corrections.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Availability of NASA FAR Supplement 



The NASA FAR Supplement, of which this rule is a part, is available in its entirety on a subscription basis from the Superintendent
of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, telephone number (202) 783-3238. Cite GPO
Subscription Stock Number 933-003-00000-1. It is not distributed to the public, either in whole
or in part, directly by NASA. 



Points of Contact 



This rule revises the list of contacts in section 1801.370. 



Solicitation Cover Pages 



Sections 1814.201-70 and 1815.406-71 are added to standardize the content of solicitation cover pages.




Contracting Officer Technical Representatives (COTR) 



Section 1801.670(b) is revised to increase from $2,500 to $25,000 the threshold below which delegations may be made
for COTRs to sign emergency change orders under construction contracts. The procedures in section 1842.270 for appointing
COTRs are revised. 



Technical Direction Clause 



The clause in section 1852.242-70 uses the term ``requirements'' in paragraph (a) and the term ``scope'' in
paragraphs (d)(2) and (e). There is a concern that the term ``scope'' could be interpreted to mean something more than
the term ``requirements.'' Therefore, the word ``requirements'' is being substituted for ``scope'' in both places.




Editorial Corrections 



A typographical correction is made in section 1815.613-70(c). Section 1852.216-77 is amended to add
a note that was inadvertently omitted. The note explains to NASA contracting officers that, as with the clause at section
1852.216-76, where the number ``6'' is marked by an asterisk, that a period of time greater or lesser than 6 months
may be substituted. 



Impact 



NASA certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.).

1814.201-70 

Solicitation cover page. 


The contracting officer may include a cover page on solicitations if it conforms to the policies stated in section
1815.406-71. 


PART 1815_CONTRACTING BY NEGOTIATION 


5. Section 1815.406-71 is added to read as follows: 


1815.406-71 

Solicitation cover page. 


The contracting officer may include a cover page on solicitations if it conforms to the following policies: 
(a) The cover should not unnecessarily repeat or paraphrase any part of the solicitation; rather, it should only describe
subject material, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
(b) The cover may draw the offeror's attention to specific limitations on who may submit offers, such as the Small Business
Set-Aside provision. 
(c) The cover may include a general reminder that representations and certifications must be carefully read and completed,
but should not include specific listings of individual provisions from Section K, Representations and Certifications.

(d) The cover may include specific listings of clauses that are not located in Section K, but which contain boxes or
fill-ins that must be completed as part of the offer. 
(e) The cover must contain a statement that in the event of a conflict between the cover and the solicitation, the solicitation
takes precedence. 
(f) The cover may include a very brief description or ``executive summary'' of the requirement. This summary should
be no longer than the CBD synopsis, and preferably shorter; if the project title makes clear what is being procured,
that should be sufficient. Generally, only major procurements should utilize a summary. 


1815.613-70 

[Amended] 


6. Paragraph (c) of section 1815.613-70 is amended by revising ``Innovative'' to read ``Innovation''.

7. Section 1842.270 is revised to read as follows: 


1842.270 

Contracting officer technical representative (COTR) delegations. 


(a) A contracting officer may appoint another Government employee to act as the contracting officer's authorized
technical representative in managing the technical aspects of a particular contract. If necessary, the contracting
officer may appoint an alternate COTR to act during short absences of the COTR; the policies and procedures for COTRs
also shall apply to alternate COTRs. Technical organizations are responsible for ensuring that the individual they
recommend to the contracting officer possesses training, qualifications and experience commensurate with the
duties and responsibilities to be delegated and the nature of the contract. The contracting officer shall ensure
that the duties and responsibilities delegated do not exceed the limitations at 1801.670(b). 
(b) COTRs shall be designated by name and position title (see the 1801.670(b) prohibition against delegating COTR
duties solely to a position rather than to a named individual). Each COTR appointment shall be in writing and shall
clearly define the purpose and limitations of the COTR's authorities, duties and responsibilities. NASA Form 1634,
Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) Delegation, shall be used to appoint COTRs. The COTR delegation
shall be signed by the cognizant contracting officer, or at any level above that contracting officer (see 1801.670(b)),
and shall state that the duties and responsibilities may not be redelegated by the COTR and that the COTR may be held
personally liable for unauthorized acts. (However, this does not prohibit the COTR from receiving assistance for
the purpose of monitoring contractor progress and gathering information.) When an individual is appointed as a COTR
on more than one contract, separate delegations shall be issued for each contract. A separate NASA Form 1634 will be
used to appoint an alternate COTR; alternates may act only during official absences of the COTR, such as leave, TDY
or other special assignments. The delegated duties and responsibilities of the alternate may not exceed those of
the COTR. 
(c) A COTR delegation remains in effect throughout the life of the contract unless cancelled in writing by the cognizant
contracting officer or at any level above that contracting officer. The contracting officer may modify the delegation
only by issuance of a new delegation cancelling and superseding the existing delegation. 
(d) A COTR shall not be authorized to initiate procurement actions by use of purchase orders, or to place calls or delivery
orders under indefinite-delivery contracts or basic ordering agreements, or in any way cause a change to the contract
or increase the Government's financial obligations. A COTR shall not be authorized to award, agree to, or sign any
contract or modification or in any way obligate the payment of money by the Government. The COTR is not authorized to
issue technical direction unless the clause at 1852.242-70, Technical Direction, prescribed in 1842.7001,
is included in the contract and the authorization is specifically listed in paragraph 3(m) of the COTR delegation
letter (NASA Form 1634). However, delegations may be made to construction contract COTRs to sign emergency change
orders with an estimated value not to exceed the value specified in writing by the contracting officer in the NASA Form
1634 but in no event to exceed $25,000, on-site at construction sites, if sufficient funds have been previously certified
to cover the emergency change. After issuing an emergency change order, the COTR shall notify the contracting officer
as soon as possible, in person or telephonically, and subsequently provide a written determination supporting the
need for the action. 
(e) The contracting officer shall send the original and one copy of the COTR delegation letter to each COTR, who shall
acknowledge receipt and accept the delegation by signing the original and returning it to the contracting officer.
The original of the COTR delegation letter shall be filed in the applicable contract file. Copies of the signed COTR
delegation letter shall be distributed to the contractor and to each cognizant contract administration office.
Acknowledgement and distribution for terminations of COTR delegations and COTR delegations which revise authority,
duties and responsibilities shall follow the same rules.

(f) The proposed COTR (and alternates) shall be trained in the duties, responsibilities, and authority of the role
of the COTR. That mandatory training shall include, at a minimum, the following core topic areas: contracting authority;
procurement integrity; contract modifications; surveillance plans; contracting for inherently governmental
functions, personal services, and NASA policy on the acquisition of services; the Service Contract Act; the Anti-Deficiency
Act; contract financial management; the ``Changes'' clause; the ``Disputes'' clause; the ``Inspection'' clause;
Government property and policy procedures; and the ``Limitation of Funds'' and ``Limitation of Cost'' clauses.
Procurement Officers are responsible for assuring that the course(s) utilized by their installation address the
mandatory core topics in sufficient detail for the purpose of COTR training.

(g) The contracting officer shall verify that the COTR has received the mandatory training before signing the NASA
Form 1634. Contracting officers shall terminate COTR delegations of COTRs who have not met the above training requirements
by April 1, 1995. If, however, an urgent need arises for the appointment of a COTR and no trained and otherwise qualified
individual is available, then the Procurement Officer may make a temporary COTR appointment not to exceed six months,
which may not be extended by more than six months. Temporary appointments must be so identified and clearly reflect
the appointment expiration date. No technical direction may be issued by a COTR serving under a temporary appointment.
If a COTR serving under a temporary appointment believes that technical direction should be issued to the contractor,
the COTR shall so advise the contracting officer and provide such assistance regarding the proposed direction as
the contracting officer may require.

Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention; Procedures for Selecting Lines 
Subject to Theft Prevention Standard 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule amends the procedures for the selection of new passenger motor vehicle lines that are likely to be high
theft lines. For all Model Year (MY) 1997 and later vehicles, manufacturers must, 15 months in advance of the model
year of introduction, inform NHTSA about new motor vehicle lines that the manufacturers plan to introduce for sale.
Manufacturers must include an analysis whether the new line is likely to be a high or low theft line. The effect of this
final rule is to make the procedures consistent with statutory requirements.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Motor Vehicle Theft Law Enforcement Act of 1984 


The Motor Vehicle Theft Law Enforcement Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-547) (Theft Act), added title VI to the Motor Vehicle
Information and Cost Savings Act (Cost Savings Act). Pursuant to title VI, NHTSA promulgated 49 CFR part 541, titled
``Federal Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard.'' Part 541 establishes performance requirements for inscribing
or affixing identification numbers onto certain major original equipment and replacement parts of high theft lines
of passenger motor vehicles. 
Section 603(a)(2) of title VI states that the specific lines, and the major parts of the vehicles within such lines,
that are to be subject to the theft prevention standard may be selected by agreement between a manufacturer and the
agency. If the agency and manufacturer disagree as to the selection, the selection is made by the agency, after providing
notice to the manufacturer and an opportunity for written comment. 
Section 603(c) states that NHTSA ``shall,

 by rule, require

 each manufacturer to provide information necessary to select pursuant to subsection (a)(2) the high theft lines
and major parts to be subject to the standard.'' (Emphasis added.) However, as promulgated on August 28, 1985 (50 FR
34831), the agency's regulations regarding the selection of high theft lines did not require the submission of such
information. Those regulations, which are contained in part 542, simply set forth the procedures to be followed by
those manufacturers which voluntarily choose to provide the information and to participate in the selection process.

Since the establishment of part 542, some manufacturers have not consistently notified the agency about the introduction
of new lines within the specified time frame of 18 to 24 months before introduction of each new line. On occasion, delayed
notification by manufacturers has prevented the agency from making its preliminary determination sufficiently
in advance of the introduction of such lines to 
permit application of the theft prevention standard to those lines during their introductory model year. To be subject
to the standard in its introductory year, a line must be finally selected as high theft not less than 6 months before
the beginning of that model year. 
In some instances, the agency has had to act on its own initiative by anticipating the introduction of new lines and
making high theft/low theft determinations because the manufacturers did not notify the agency within the specified
period of 18 to 24 months before the introduction of their new lines. In making these determinations, the agency has
relied on reports in the trade press about planned introductions of new lines. Notwithstanding the absence of notification
from the manufacturers, the manufacturers objected to this practice, viewing such agency initiative as an attempt
to second guess them about the timing of the introduction of new model lines, or to reduce their opportunity to provide
input regarding the determination.

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 



On July 21, 1993, NHTSA published in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend part 542 (See 58 FR 38999). In order to solve the problem of manufacturers'
late notification of the agency about new lines, the agency proposed to implement section 603(c) of the Cost Savings
Act. Under the proposal, each manufacturer would be required to provide, for each of its newly planned lines, its determination
whether the line was likely high or low theft, and include a discussion of how it applied the criteria set forth in appendix
C of part 541, in arriving at its determination. The appendix C criteria are: Price; vehicle image; lines competitive
with the new line; line(s) the new line is intended to replace; presence of any antitheft devices; preliminary theft
data for the line, if available. The agency also proposed that a manufacturer be required to submit such information
not less than 18 months before introduction of the planned line. 

In the NPRM, NHTSA stated it believed that requiring manufacturers to submit the necessary information would provide
the agency with more timely submissions of accurate and up-to-date data to evaluate. This would enable the agency
to select more effectively and efficiently (by agreement with the manufacturer, if possible) those new lines likely
to have a high theft rate. Also, since the information would be provided timely and directly to the agency by the manufacturer,
the agency presumably would no longer need to rely upon the trade press accounts. 

In order to provide manufacturers with lead time to comply with the new mandatory procedures, the agency proposed
to continue to permit voluntary submission of information for lines that are introduced before model year 1997, and
require compliance with the mandatory procedures for those lines introduced in model year 1997 and subsequent model
years. The agency made similar proposals regarding the voluntary and mandatory submission of information with respect
to low theft new lines with a majority of major parts interchangeable with those of a high theft line. 

NHTSA also proposed to remove outdated procedures from part 542. The procedures were applicable to lines introduced
before April 24, 1986, the effective date of the theft prevention standard. 

Finally, in the NPRM, NHTSA noted that because of passage of the ``Anti Car Theft Act of 1992'' (ACTA), changes must
be made in NHTSA's and manufacturers' evaluation procedures for low theft lines with major parts interchangeable
with major parts of a high theft line. ACTA's passage redefined ``passenger motor vehicle,'' for title VI purposes,
to include ``any multipurpose passenger vehicle and light-duty truck that is rated at 6,000 pounds gross vehicle
weight or less.'' (See section 601(1) of title VI.) ACTA's passage did not necessitate changes to part 542's regulatory
text. 



Public Comments and NHTSA Response 



In response to the NPRM, NHTSA received comments from four parties: The Chrysler Corporation (Chrysler); the Ford
Motor Company (Ford); the National Truck Equipment Association (NTEA) and Volkswagen of America, Inc. (VW). 

In its comments, Ford concurred with NHTSA's proposal to require manufacturers to provide NHTSA with information
and supporting analysis on new vehicle lines, beginning with Model Year 1997. Ford stated that it understood the NPRM
as indicating that NHTSA is interested only in manufacturers' analyses of new vehicle lines likely to be high theft
lines. Based on its understanding, Ford suggested that there was a need to make several minor changes to the regulatory
text to make it clear that NHTSA is interested in analyses of new lines likely to be low theft, as well as those lines likely
to be high theft. 

NHTSA believes that the proposal was clear regarding the obligation for a manufacturer to conduct evaluations of
each new line using the criteria in appendix C of part 541. Under the proposal, each manufacturer would have been required
``to evaluate each new line and to conclude whether the new line is likely to have a theft rate exceeding the median theft
rate.'' In other words, for each line, the manufacturer would have had to indicate whether its evaluation led it to
conclude that (a) it is likely to have such a rate or (b) it is not likely to have such a rate. That this was the intended
reading of the proposed regulatory text was made abundantly clear in the summary section of the NPRM preamble. There,
the agency stated that manufacturers would be required to ``provide an analysis whether the new line is likely to be
a high or low theft line.''

<TEXT>
 

Nevertheless, NHTSA has no objection to making the changes suggested by Ford. Section 542.1(c), 

Procedures for newly introduced vehicle lines, 

now explicitly states that the manufacturers are to follow the procedures in evaluating whether a new line is likely
to have a theft rate above or below the median theft rate. 

Chrysler and VW recommended that the deadline for manufacturers notifying NHTSA of new lines be 12 months before the
introduction of the line, instead of 18 months before the introduction, as proposed in the NPRM. Both Chrysler and
VW stated that, since the American automobile market is very competitive, manufacturers may decide to introduce
new lines with less than 18 months' lead time. They argued that being allowed to inform NHTSA of new car lines 12 months
in advance would provide more flexibility to the manufacturers. VW further stated that if NHTSA amended part 542,
and issued its preliminary determinations of high or low theft sooner than the 90 days presently provided in part 542,
manufacturers could file new vehicle line information with NHTSA as late as 10 months in advance of introduction of
the line. 

Both the VW and Chrysler objections to the 18 month advance notice requirement are apparently based on the possibility
that each may wish to introduce a new line in the U.S. with less than 18 months' notice. In the 8 years since part 542 took
effect, NHTSA has been notified of a new line less than 18 months before the introduction model year in only a few instances.
No manufacturers, besides VW and Chrysler, objected to the 18 month lead time requirement. 

NHTSA has carefully considered Chrysler and Volkswagen's comments, and calculated the latest date on which it can
accept new line information. For reasons explained below, NHTSA needs to issue final determinations of high or low
theft, at least six months in advance of the manufacturer's model year. NHTSA has decided that it can accept new line
information as late as 15 months before the beginning of the manufacturer's model year, and still issue final determinations
six months before the beginning of the model year. Thus, beginning with model year 1997 vehicles, manufacturers are
required to notify NHTSA of new lines 15 months before the new line is introduced. NHTSA has not shortened part 542's
timeframe for NHTSA's preliminary and final determinations since that is beyond the scope of notice of the NPRM. 

NHTSA needs to issue determinations six months in advance of the model year because under section 603(a)(3) of the
Theft Act, NHTSA must, to the maximum extent practicable, assure that likely high theft lines are selected at least
6 months before the first applicable model year, to notify manufacturers that they must mark the major parts of the
line. More importantly, if NHTSA issues a final high theft determination less than six months before an upcoming model
year, NHTSA cannot require the manufacturer to mark the parts of the high theft line during that model year. Instead,
it cannot mandate parts marking until the following model year. Requiring manufacturers to submit information 15
months (instead of 12 months) before the model year would lessen the likelihood of NHTSA's missing the 6 month deadline
to notify manufacturers, before the first applicable model year, of the high theft status of a new line. 

NHTSA does not believe requiring manufacturers to submit information 15 months in advance of the model year would
pose a hardship. NHTSA does not believe that any of the information to be reported (specified at appendix C of part 541)
is detailed or complex. The appendix C criteria are: Price; vehicle image; lines competitive with the new line; line(s)
the new line is intended to replace; presence of any antitheft devices; and any preliminary theft data for the line.
NHTSA believes that a manufacturer planning a new line for sale in the U.S. knows, 15 months before the model year of
introduction, fundamental information about the new line, including that specified in appendix C, and would have
no difficulty in reporting it. 

NHTSA believes further that even if, on some occasion, a manufacturer does not make a formal decision to introduce
a new line until some time after 15 months in advance of the model year of introduction, the manufacturer must be very
actively entertaining, at the 15 month point, the possibility of making such a decision in the next several months.
The commercial and regulatory logistics involved in introducing a new line to the U.S. market are complex. The very
complexity of this process necessitates that, by 15 months in advance of the model year of introduction, the manufacturers
have a good idea whether they will introduce a new line into the United States. 

If, 15 months before the introduction of a new line, a manufacturer is still undecided whether to introduce the line,
it could nevertheless comply with part 542 by sending a letter to NHTSA stating that it may introduce a new line and providing
the information specified in appendix C of part 542. To avoid the possibility of a disclosure of its potential plans,
the manufacturer may request confidential treatment for the letter. NHTSA has determined that future specific model
plans would presumptively be likely to result in substantial competitive harm if disclosed to the public, before
the date on which the specific model is first offered for sale. (See 49 CFR part 512, appendix B.) If confidential treatment
has been granted, and the manufacturer decides not to introduce the line, NHTSA will not disclose the contents of the
letter.

Finally, NHTSA decided to set the deadline for submission of information about new lines at the 15 month point instead
of at the 12 month point because 15 months is necessary not only to allow NHTSA time to issue a final determination, but
also to allow manufacturers enough time to submit timely petitions for exemption from marking the parts of a new line.
Section 605(b) of the Theft Act specifies that petitions for exemption must be filed ``not later than 8 months before
the commencement of production for the first model year covered by the petition.'' 

The National Truck Equipment Association (NTEA) expressed concern that NHTSA may consider some of its members (which
are primarily small final stage manufacturers of incomplete vehicles, or alterers of vehicles) to be ``manufacturers''
for part 542 purposes, and thus subject to the reporting requirements. These final stage manufacturers and alterers
appear to work on individual vehicles, adapting each vehicle for a special purpose or to otherwise include features
that make each vehicle unique to the customer's needs. NTEA noted, however, that because ACTA's definition of light-duty
trucks and multipurpose passenger vehicles is limited to vehicles weighing 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating
or less, NTEA expects ``very few vehicles'' completed or altered by its members to be subject to part 542. 

For the following reasons, NHTSA does not believe that final stage manufacturers or alterers, are ``manufacturers''
for part 542 purposes. Part 542 applies to a manufacturer that groups motor vehicle models of the same make together
and assigns names to the groups, i.e., lines, or introduces new motor vehicle lines into commerce. Neither final stage
manufacturers nor alterers do these things. 

The grouping of motor vehicle models of the same make together and assigning names to the groups, i.e., lines, is done
at an earlier stage of manufacture in the case of both incomplete motor vehicles that are completed by final stage manufacturers
and of completed vehicles that are modified by alterers. These circumstances are reflected in the agency's requirements
concerning vehicle identification numbers. A vehicle identification number (VIN) is a seventeen character series
of arabic numbers and roman letters which is assigned to a motor vehicle for identification purposes. Manufacturers
must comply with Standard No. 115; 

Vehicle identification number-basic requirements. 

S4.1 of Standard No. 115 states: 




Each vehicle manufactured in one stage shall have a VIN that is assigned by the manufacturer. Each vehicle manufactured
in more than one stage shall have a VIN assigned by the incomplete vehicle manufacturer. Vehicle alterers * * *
shall utilize the VIN assigned by the original manufacturer of the vehicle. 




49 CFR part 565 

Vehicle identification number-content requirements, 

specifies the format and content for VINs. Among other VIN attributes, the first three characters uniquely identify
the manufacturer, make and type of motor vehicle. (See  565.4(a)) Included as VIN attributes for passenger
cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, and incomplete vehicles, are the line and series of the vehicle.
(See  565.4(b), and table I) A manufacturer must, when it assigns a VIN to a motor vehicle, determine the model
or ``line,'' and series of the vehicle. For these reasons, when it creates a VIN, a manufacturer is in effect, determining
the ``line'' of vehicles that it introduces into commerce. 

The manufacturing functions of the NTEA members are performed after the VINs are assigned. As noted above, they either
do final stage manufacturing of incomplete vehicles or alter completed vehicles. Standard No. 115 prohibits final
stage manufacturers or alterers from making changes to the original VIN assigned to the vehicle. The final stage manufacturers
or alterers cannot change any VIN attribute, including the VIN attribute that describes the ``line'' of the vehicle.
Since the final stage manufacturers or alterers, in effect, cannot assign the ``name'' to a ``group'' of vehicles,
i.e., the ``line'', the final stage manufacturers or alterers are not ``manufacturers'' for purposes of part 542.


Finally, since there were no objections to NHTSA's proposal to remove outdated references to vehicle lines introduced
before April 24, 1986, the final rule adopts those amendments.

Regulatory Impacts 



A. Costs and Other Impacts 



This notice was not reviewed under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review). NHTSA has analyzed the
impact of this rulemaking action and determined that it is not ``significant'' within the meaning of the Department
of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. The agency estimates this final rule will impose minimal
reporting costs on manufacturers of passenger motor vehicles. The agency estimates that the average annual cost
per manufacturer per year to report on new vehicle lines is $2,000. The agency estimates that the cost to all affected
manufacturers totals $56,000 per year. 

The Supplementary Information section of this notice discussed the ``Anti Car Theft Act of 1992's'' redefinition
of ``passenger motor vehicle'' to include ``any multipurpose passenger vehicle and light-duty truck that is rated
at 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight or less.'' Thus, manufacturers may now have to follow part 542 procedures for
certain multipurpose passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks. The burden on these manufacturers will be minimal
because relatively few new lines of light-duty trucks and multipurpose passenger vehicles are introduced in any
year. 

The additional burden on manufacturers with respect to passenger cars as a result of reporting becoming mandatory
will also be minimal. Most manufacturers are already providing new car line information on a voluntary basis. 

For these reasons, NHTSA believes that the additional costs will be so minimal as not to warrant preparation of a full
regulatory evaluation. Since there will be so little additional reporting cost, NHTSA does not believe that this
rule will affect the impacts described in the regulatory evaluation (pursuant to E.O. 12291 and the DOT's regulatory
policies) prepared for the proposal published May 10, 1985 (See 50 FR 19728, at 19741) setting forth the substantive
requirements of part 541. Interested persons may wish to examine that regulatory evaluation. Copies of that evaluation
have been placed in Docket No. T84-01; Notice 4, and may be obtained by writing to: National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, Docket Section, Room 5109, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. 



B. Small Business Impacts 



The agency has also considered the effects of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.
601 

et seq.

). I certify that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
The rationale for this certification is that, as noted above, the reporting costs will be minimal. Further, almost
none of the manufacturers of passenger motor vehicles that will be subject to this rule is considered to be a small business,
a small non-profit organization, or a small governmental entity as defined by the SBA. 



C. Environmental Impacts 



In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the agency has considered the environmental impacts
of this rule and determined that, the final rule will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment.




D. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The procedures in this rule for manufacturers to submit new vehicle line information to NHTSA are considered to be
information collection requirements, as that term is defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in 5 CFR
part 1320. The information collection requirements for part 542 have been submitted to and approved by the OMB pursuant
to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

) This collection of information has been assigned OMB Control No. 2127-0539 (``Procedures for selecting lines
to be covered by the theft prevention standard'') and has been approved for use through August 31, 1995. 



E. Federalism 



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the 
preparation of a Federalism assessment. 



F. Civil Justice Reform 



This final rule does not have any retroactive effect, and it does not preempt any State law. Section 613 of the Motor
Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2020), provides that judicial review of this rule may be obtained
pursuant to section 504 of the Cost Savings Act, (15 U.S.C. 2004). The Cost Savings Act does not require submission
of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court.

PART 542_PROCEDURES FOR SELECTING LINES TO BE COVERED BY THE THEFT PREVENTION STANDARD 



Sec. 

542.1 Procedures for selecting new lines that are 
likely to have high or low theft rates. 

542.2 Procedures for selecting low theft new lines with a majority of major parts interchangeable with those
of a high theft line.

 




Authority:

 15 U.S.C. 2021, 2022, and 2023; delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.50. 



 542.1 

Procedures for selecting new lines that are likely to have high or low theft rates. 



(a) 

Scope. 

This section sets forth the procedures for motor vehicle manufacturers and NHTSA to follow in the determination of
whether any new vehicle line is likely to have a theft rate above or below the median theft rate. 

(b) 

Application. 

These procedures apply to each manufacturer that plans to introduce a new line into commerce in the United States on
or after April 24, 1986, and to each of those new lines. 


(c) 

Procedures.

 (1)(i) For each new line introduced before the 1997 model year, each manufacturer uses the criteria in appendix C of
part 541 of this chapter to evaluate each new line and to conclude whether the new line is likely to have a theft rate above
or below the median theft rate established for calendar years 1990 and 1991. 

(ii) For each new line to be introduced for the 1997 or subsequent model years, each manufacturer shall use the criteria
in appendix C of part 541 of this chapter to evaluate each new line and to conclude whether the new line is likely to have
a theft rate above or below the median theft rate. 

(2)(i) For each new line to be introduced before the 1997 model year, the manufacturer submits its evaluations and
conclusions made under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, together with the underlying factual information,
to NHTSA not less than 18 months before the date of introduction. The manufacturer may request a meeting with the agency
to further explain the bases for its evaluations and conclusions. 

(ii) For each new line to be introduced for the 1997 or subsequent model years, the manufacturer shall submit its evaluations
and conclusions made under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, together with the underlying factual information,
to NHTSA not less than 15 months before the date of introduction. The manufacturer may request a meeting with the agency
during this period to further explain the bases for its evaluations and conclusions. 

(3) Within 90 days after its receipt of the manufacturer's submission under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the
agency independently evaluates the new line using the criteria in appendix C of part 541 of this chapter and, on a preliminary
basis, determines whether the new line should or should not be subject to  541.2 of this chapter. NHTSA informs
the manufacturer by letter of the agency's evaluations and determinations, together with the factual information
considered by the agency in making them. 

(4) The manufacturer may request the agency to reconsider any of its preliminary determinations made under paragraph
(c)(3) of this section. The manufacturer shall submit its request to the agency within 30 days of its receipt of the
letter under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The request shall include the facts and arguments underlying the manufacturer's
objections to the agency's preliminary determinations. During this 30-day period, the manufacturer may also request
a meeting with the agency to discuss those objections. 

(5) Each of the agency's preliminary determinations under paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall become final 45
days after the agency sends the letter specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section unless a request for reconsideration
has been received in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section. If such a request has been received, the agency
makes its final determinations within 60 days of its receipt of the request. NHTSA informs the manufacturer by letter
of those determinations and its response to the request for reconsideration.

 542.2 

Procedures for selecting low theft new lines with a majority of major parts interchangeable with those of a high theft
line. 




(a) 

Scope. 

This section sets forth the procedures for motor vehicle manufacturers and NHTSA to follow in the determination of
whether any new lines that will be likely to have a low theft rate have major parts interchangeable with a majority of
the covered major parts of a line having or likely to have a high theft rate. 

(b) 

Application. 

These procedures apply to: 

(1) Each manufacturer that pro
duces_

(i) At least one passenger motor vehicle line that has been or will be introduced into commerce in the United States
and that has been listed in appendix A of part 541 of this chapter or that has been identified by the manufacturer or preliminarily
or finally determined by NHTSA to be a high-theft line under  542.1, and 

(ii) At least one passenger motor vehicle line that will be introduced into commerce in the United States on or after
April 24, 1986 and that the manufacturer identifies as likely to have a theft rate below the median theft rate; and 

(2) Each of those likely submedian theft rate lines. 

(c) 

Procedures. 

(1)(i) For each new line that is to be introduced before the 1997 model year and that a manufacturer identifies under
appendix C of part 541 of this chapter as likely to have a theft rate below the median rate, the manufacturer identifies
how many and which of the major parts of that line will be interchangeable with the covered major parts of any other of
its lines that has been listed in appendix A of part 541 of this chapter or identified by the manufacturer or preliminarily
or finally determined by the agency to be a high theft line under  542.1. 

(ii) For each new line that is to be introduced in the 1997 or subsequent model years and that a manufacturer identifies
under appendix C of part 541 of this chapter as likely to have a theft rate below the median rate, the manufacturer shall
identify how many and which of the major parts of that line will be interchangeable with the covered major parts of any
other of its lines that has been listed in appendix A of part 541 of this chapter or identified by the manufacturer or
preliminarily or finally determined by the agency to be a high-theft line under  542.1. 

(2)(i) If the manufacturer concludes that a new line that is to be introduced before the 1997 model year has a likely
submedian theft rate and will have major parts that are interchangeable with a majority of the covered major parts
of a high theft line, the manufacturer determines whether all the vehicles of those lines with likely submedian theft
rates and interchangeable parts will account for more than 90 percent of the total annual production of all of the manufacturer's
lines with those interchangeable parts. 

(ii) If the manufacturer concludes that a new line that is to be introduced for the 1997 or subsequent model years has
a likely submedian theft rate and will have major parts that are interchangeable with a majority of the covered major
parts of a high theft line, the manufacturer shall determine whether all the vehicles of those lines with likely submedian
theft rates and interchangeable parts will account for more than 90 percent of the total annual production of all of
the manufacturer's lines with those interchangeable parts. 

(3)(i) For new lines to be introduced before the 1997 model year, the manufacturer submits its evaluations and identifications
made under paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (2)(i) of this section, together with the underlying factual information, to
NHTSA not less than 18 months before the date of introduction. During this period, the manufacturer may request a meeting
with the agency to further explain the bases for its evaluations and conclusions. 

(ii) For new lines to be introduced for the 1997 and subsequent model years, the manufacturer shall submit its evaluations
and conclusions made under paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (2)(ii) of this section, together with the underlying factual
information, to NHTSA not less than 15 months before the date of introduction. During this period, the manufacturer
may request a meeting with the agency to further explain the bases for its evaluations and conclusions.

(4) Within 90 days after its receipt of the manufacturer's submission under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the
agency considers that submission, if any, and independently makes, on a preliminary basis, the determinations of
those lines with likely submedian theft rates which should or should not be subject to  541.5 of this chapter.
NHTSA informs the manufacturer by letter of the agency's preliminary determinations, together with the factual
information considered by the agency in making them. 

(5) The manufacturer may request the agency to reconsider any of its preliminary determinations made under paragraph
(c)(4) of this section. The manufacturer must submit its request to the agency within 30 days of its receipt of the letter
under paragraph (c)(4) of this section informing it of the agency's evaluations and preliminary determinations.
The request must include the facts and arguments underlying the manufacturer's objections to the agency's preliminary
determinations. During this 30-day period, the manufacturer may also request a meeting with the agency to discuss
those objections. 

(6) Each of the agency's preliminary determinations made under paragraph (c)(4) of this section becomes final 45
days after the agency sends the letter specified in that paragraph unless a request for reconsideration has been received
in accordance with paragraph (c)(5) of this section. If such a request has been received, the agency makes its final
determinations within 60 days of its receipt of the request. NHTSA informs the manufacturer by letter of those determinations
and its response to the request for reconsideration.

Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Apportionment of reserve.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is apportioning reserve to certain target 
species in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area 
(BSAI). This action is necessary to allow for ongoing harvest 
and account for previous harvest of the total allowable catch 
(TAC).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the U.S. BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according
to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (FMP) prepared
by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by 
regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. 


The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that the initial TACs specified for pollock and Greenland
turbot in the Bering Sea subarea (BS), for Pacific ocean perch, Greenland turbot, and pollock in the Aleutian Islands
subarea (AI), for Atka mackerel in the combined Eastern Aleutian District and BS, and for Pacific cod in the BSAI, need
to be supplemented from the nonspecific reserve to continue operations and account for prior harvest. Therefore,
in accordance with  675.20(b), NMFS is apportioning from the reserve to TACs for the following species: (1)
for the BS_99,750 metric tons (mt) to pollock and 700 mt to Greenland turbot; (2) for the AI_1,635 mt to Pacific ocean
perch, 350 mt to Greenland turbot, and 4,245 mt to pollock; (3) for the combined Eastern Aleutian District and BS_2,021
mt to Atka mackerel; and (4) for the BSAI_28,650 mt to Pacific cod. 
These apportionments are consistent with  675.20(a)(2)(i) and do not result in overfishing of a target species
or the ``other species'' category because the revised TACs are equal to or less than specifications of acceptable
biological catch. 
Pursuant to  675.20(a)(3)(i), the apportionments of pollock are allocated between the inshore and offshore
components: (1) for the BS_34,913 mt to vessels catching pollock for processing by the inshore component and 64,837
mt to vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component; (2) for the AI_1,486 mt to vessels catching
pollock for processing by the inshore component and 2,759 to vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore
component. 
Pursuant to  675.20(a)(3)(iv), the apportionment of the BSAI Pacific cod TAC is allocated 573 mt to vessels
using jig gear, 12,606 mt to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear, and 15,471 mt to vessels using trawl gear. 
This apportionment was proposed in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 14383, March 28, 1994), requesting public comment. The public comment period ended on April 7, 1994. No comments
were received. 


Classification 


This action is taken under 50 CFR 675.20. 
The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, has determined, under section 553(d)(3) of the Administrative
Procedure Act, that good cause exists for waiving the 30-day delayed effectiveness period for this action. Fisheries
are currently taking place that will be supplemented by this apportionment. Delaying the effective date would be
disruptive and costly to these ongoing operations. 
This action is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Announcement of criteria for loan origination_1995-1996 academic year. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary of Education issues criteria for the origination of student loans by schools participating in the Federal
Direct Student Loan (Direct Loan) Program in the 1995-1996 academic year, which begins July 1, 1995. This notice
relates to the Federal Direct Stafford Loan Program, the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program, and
the Federal Direct PLUS Program, collectively referred to as the Direct Loan Program.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Student Loan Reform Act of 1993, enacted on August 10, 1993, established the Direct Loan Program under the Higher
Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). See Subtitle A of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-66).
Under the Direct Loan Program, loan capital is provided directly to student and parent borrowers by the Federal Government
rather than through private lenders as in the Federal Family Education Loan Program. 


Background 


The statute directs the Secretary to exercise discretion in the selection of schools so that the loans made under the
Direct Loan Program will represent 40 percent of the new student loan volume for academic year 1995-1996, the
second year of this program. The standards for participation in the Direct Loan Program in the second year were published
in the 

Federal Register

 on February 17, 1994 (59 FR 8080). The Secretary will select schools for the 1995-1996 academic year from schools
that respond to the February 17, 1994 invitation to participate in the Direct Loan Program, as well as those eligible
schools that applied for the 1994-1995 academic year.

The criteria for originating loans in the second year of the Direct Loan Program are issued in this announcement in
final form. The program regulations to implement other aspects of the Direct Loan Program in the second year and subsequent
academic years are being developed through a negotiated rulemaking process. The Secretary anticipates publishing
final program regulations for the 1995-1996 academic year by December 1, 1994. 
While the criteria in this document were not developed through negotiated rulemaking, the members of the Direct Student
Loan Regulations Negotiated Rulemaking Advisory Committee were consulted in the development of the criteria at
their February meeting. 


Eligibility for Origination 


In the 1995-1996 academic year, a school originating loans in the Direct Loan Program will be in one of two levels
of origination. The Secretary has adopted the criteria in this document because they are indicators of a school's
ability to administer financial aid programs. Under the criteria, a school may participate in the first level of origination
(Level 1) only if it has a demonstrated ability to fully administer the Direct Loan program. 
A school that meets all the criteria for Level 1 origination is eligible to perform all originating functions. If a
school does not qualify for Level 1 origination, it is eligible to perform those functions allowed in the second level
of origination (Level 2), unless it fails to meet one or more of the criteria required for that level. 
A school that is eligible for Level 1 origination may choose to participate in Level 2 origination or use the services
of an alternative originator. Similarly, a school eligible for Level 2 origination may choose to use the services
of an alternative originator. 
The Secretary may exercise discretion and allow a school to originate loans at a level for which it would not otherwise
be eligible if the Secretary determines that the school is fully capable of originating loans at that level. The Secretary
may also require a school that meets the criteria for Level 2 origination to use the services of an alternative originator
if the extent to which the school fails to meet certain other origination criteria merits such an action. 


Functions Performed by Level 1 and Level 2 Originating Schools 


Under the Direct Loan Program, schools and consortia that originate loans must use software provided by the Secretary,
or other software based on specifications provided by the Secretary, to create a loan origination record containing
the basic information necessary to make a loan. The software provided by the Secretary reformats the data received
from the Central Processing System and computes gross disbursements, loan fees, and net disbursements on the basis
of the loan amounts entered by the school. The school must add data, such as the type of loan, loan amount, and disbursement
dates, and may computer-generate the Stafford Promissory Note and Disclosure (promissory note). A school may also
transmit the information collected by the school to the Direct Loan Program Servicer (Servicer) which, upon request,
prints promissory notes on behalf of the school and sends them to the school. 
A student who accepts a Direct Loan completes a promissory note and returns it to the school; the school may not disburse
Direct Loan funds without a completed promissory note. 


Functions Performed Only by Level 1 Originating Schools 


A Level 1 originating school in the Direct Loan Program requests and obtains loan funds from the Secretary using a process
similar to the process for drawing down funds for other Department of Education (ED) programs. A Level 1 originating
school transmits to ED a specific Direct Loan funding request that is separate from its funding requests for other
programs and is based on immediate disbursement needs. Direct Loan capital must be tracked separately and cannot
be used for purposes other than making Direct Loans. The electronic transfer of funds uses the same delivery process
as is used for the Federal Pell Grant Program. After a request for funds is received, the Secretary uses the Automated
Clearinghouse (ACH) process through the Federal Reserve Banking system to deposit funds in a school's designated
bank account. Currently, this process takes between 48 to 72 hours from the school's request for funds until the school's
receipt of funds.

<TEXT>
 

After receiving funds from the Secretary, a school disburses funds to students by issuing checks or by crediting their
accounts at the school. Before a school may disburse funds to a borrower, the school must ensure that it has a completed
and signed promissory note. The funds received by a Level 1 originating school that are intended for specific borrowers
but not disbursed to those borrowers may be used to fund other borrowers. After the first disbursement is made, the
school must record the actual disbursed amount and the date of the disbursement in the loan origination record and
transmit all completed loan records and promissory notes (if not previously submitted) to the Servicer. The school
transmits subsequent disbursement data to the Servicer as the disbursements occur. 


Functions Performed by Level 2 Originating Schools 


A Level 2 originating school is assisted in the management of funds by the Servicer. The Servicer reviews the loan origination
records and promissory notes transmitted by the school before funds are disbursed. The promissory notes must be correct
and complete before funds can be disbursed. The Servicer initiates the transfer of funds to the school three days prior
to the anticipated loan disbursement date on the basis of loan origination records and the completed promissory notes.
The school receives a roster from the Servicer identifying each borrower, the anticipated disbursement date and
amount to be disbursed for each borrower, and the total amount of funds received by the school. Through the ACH process,
the funds are sent to the school's bank within 48 to 72 hours following the initiation of the transfer of funds. The funds
received by a Level 2 originating school are intended for specific borrowers and may not be used to fund other borrowers.
Level 2 originating schools are responsible for reporting actual disbursement data to the Servicer. 


Schools That Use an Alternative Originator 


The alternative originator manages both the promissory note and funds management processes for schools that use
the alternative originator. These schools transmit the data necessary for the alternative originator to generate
the promissory note. The alternative originator sends the promissory note to the borrower. The borrower must complete
the promissory note and send it back to the alternative originator. The alternative originator reviews the promissory
note before funds are disbursed. The promissory note must be correct and complete before funds can be disbursed. The
alternative originator initiates the transfer of funds to the school three days prior to the anticipated loan disbursement
date on the basis of the loan origination records and the completed promissory notes. The school receives a roster
from the alternative originator identifying each borrower, the anticipated disbursement date and amount to be disbursed
for each borrower, and the total amount of funds received by the school. Using the ACH process, the funds are sent to
the school's bank within 48 to 72 hours following the initiation of the transfer of funds. The funds received by a school
using the alternative originator are intended for specific borrowers and may not be used to fund other borrowers.
Schools that use the alternative originator are responsible for reporting actual disbursement data to the Servicer.
In addition, the Secretary may provide additional loan counseling to students at a school under alternative origination.



Federal Direct Plus Loans 


Federal Direct PLUS loans are made through a process similar to the one used in the Federal PLUS loan program. The parent
obtains an Application and Promissory Note (promissory note) from the school and, after completing the promissory
note, sends it to the school. The school completes the school section of the promissory note and forwards it to the Servicer,
where data from the note is key entered and a credit check is performed. Alternatively, a school enters data from the
note using the software provided and electronically forwards this information to the Servicer along with the paper
copy of the promissory note. In either case, the Servicer performs a credit check to determine whether the parent has
an adverse credit history and notifies the school and the parent of the results. If the loan is approved, the Servicer
sends a disclosure statement to the parent. If the credit check indicates an adverse credit history, the Servicer
advises the parent of available options; for example, the parent may obtain an endorser without an adverse credit
history. If the loan is approved and the school is a Level 1 originating school, the school may draw down money and disburse
loan funds in the same manner as it would for other loans made under the Direct Loan Program. If the school is not a Level
1 originating school, the Servicer electronically transmits the funding request for the school based on the loan
origination records and promissory notes that the Servicer holds for that school.

Reconciliation of Records Performed by All Participating Schools 


A school is required to reconcile cash and individual loan records monthly. To reconcile cash, a school must provide
documentation to the Servicer that the total net disbursements minus cancellations, plus return of excess cash,
is equal to the amount of money the school has drawn down during a one-month period. This process must be completed by
the end of the next month. For example, loan records and promissory notes for all disbursements and cancellations
made in July 1995 must be transmitted to the Servicer by the end of August 1995. To reconcile loan records, a school's
records must match the records of the Servicer. The software that is provided to participating schools is designed
to assist schools in this reconciliation process. 


Administrative Fees 


Level 1 originating schools will have greater responsibility than Level 2 originating schools in the area of funds
management. Because of this greater responsibility, a Level 1 originating school will receive a higher administrative
fee than a Level 2 originating school. The HEA does not allow a school that participates under alternative origination
to receive administrative fees. 


Consortia 


A consortium of schools in the Direct Loan Program interacts with the Secretary in the same manner as other schools,
except that the communication between the Secretary and the schools in the consortium is consolidated and channeled
through a single point. Each school in a consortium must sign the Direct Loan Program participation agreement with
the Secretary and is responsible for the information it supplies through the consortium. If a consortium wishes to
originate loans, each school in the consortium must be eligible to originate. The consortium will be eligible to originate
at the most restrictive level any school in the consortium is eligible to originate. For example, if one school in a
consortium is eligible to originate at the second level and the other schools in the consortium are eligible to originate
at the first level, the consortium is eligible to originate only at the second level of origination. 




Criteria Chart 


The following chart is provided to show, in a summary format, the criteria for the different levels of origination.
Any differences between the language in the chart and the language in the criteria announced in this document should
be resolved in favor of the latter.

extent to which the school fails to meet other criteria merits such an action. A consortium of schools may originate
loans at a level of origination for which all members of the consortium are eligible.

Executive Order 12866 



The contents of this announcement have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of
the order, the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of the criteria in this announcement. 

The potential costs associated with the criteria in this announcement are those resulting from statutory requirements
and those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently.
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these criteria the Secretary
has determined that the benefits of the criteria justify the costs. 

The Secretary has also determined that the criteria in this announcement do not unduly interfere with State, local,
and tribal governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. 

The criteria in this announcement are consistent with the requirements of the HEA and promote the President's priorities.




Waiver of Rulemaking 



It is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations.
The Secretary has consulted with the members of the Direct Student Loan Regulations Negotiated Rulemaking Advisory
Committee in the development of the criteria in this announcement, and many of the comments of those members have been
adopted. However, the timely implementation of the Direct Loan Program for the 1995-1996 academic year does
not permit the solicitation of further public comment on the criteria for origination for that year. 
To ensure successful implementation of the Direct Loan Program in the second year, schools need to receive program
and software training, integrate Direct Loan Program materials into school publications, and interface Direct
Loan software and origination procedures with the school's own systems and procedures. The Secretary believes that
the training of school personnel, the development and distribution of materials, and the updating of Direct Loan
systems and procedures must begin by June 1994. These preparations require that the Secretary, as soon as possible,
initiate the school selection process and prescribe the standards and procedures for the origination of loans by
schools that are considering whether to participate. 

The increase from five percent of new student loan volume in the first year of the program to 40 percent in the second
year means that the number of schools participating in the program in the second year is likely to increase from 104
to over 2,000. In light of the preparations required to accommodate the dramatic growth in the Direct Loan Program
in the 1995-1996 academic year, the Secretary finds that the requirements for the second-year implementation
of the program do not permit the solicitation of further public comment on the criteria for loan origination in that
year. Therefore, the Secretary finds that such a solicitation would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest
under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B).

Accordingly, under the authority of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, the Secretary announces the criteria
for loan origination for the 1995-1996 academic year, as follows: 



Criteria for Loan Origination_1995-1996 Academic Year 



I. Origination 



(a) To be eligible to participate in the first level of origination of the Direct Loan Program, a school must meet the
following criteria: 

(1) Be currently participating in the Federal Perkins Loan Program or the Federal Pell Grant Program or, for a graduate
and professional school, a similar program. 

(2) If participating in the Federal Perkins Loan Program, not have exceeded the applicable maximum default rate under
section 462(g) of the Higher Education Act (HEA) for the most recent fiscal year for which data are available. 

(3) Have participated in at least one of the student financial assistance programs under title IV of the HEA for the
three years immediately preceding July 1, 1995. 

(4) Not be provisionally certified to participate in programs under title IV of the HEA. 

(5) Not be on the reimbursement system of payment in the Federal Pell Grant Program. 

(6) Not have received notice that the school is subject to an emergency action or a proposed or final limitation, suspension,
or termination action under section 428(b)(1)(T), 432(h), or 487(c) of the HEA. 

(7) Not, in the opinion of the Secretary, have had severe performance deficiencies for any of the programs under title
IV of the HEA, including deficiencies demonstrated by audits or program reviews submitted or conducted during the
five calendar years immediately preceding the date of application to participate in the Direct Loan Program. These
performance deficiencies may also include the school's failure to fulfill its responsibilities as an originating
school in the program. 

(8) If participating in the Federal Pell Grant Program, have submitted Student Aid Reports on a timely basis. 

(9) Not be overdue on Federal cash transaction reports required under title IV of the HEA. 

(10) Not be overdue on program or financial reports or audits required under title IV of the HEA. 

(11) Provide an assurance that the school has no delinquent outstanding debts to the Federal Government, unless (i)
those debts are being repaid under or in accordance with a repayment arrangement satisfactory to the Federal Government,
or (ii) the Secretary determines that the existence or amount of the debts has not been finally determined by the cognizant
Federal agency. 

(b) To be eligible to participate in the second level of origination, a school must meet the criteria in part I (a)(5),
(6), and (7) of this announcement. 



II. Alternative Origination 



A school participating in the Direct Loan Program that is not eligible to originate loans under part I of this announcement
must use the services of an alternative originator.
 


III. Determination of Origination Status 



The Secretary may allow a school to originate loans at a level for which it would not otherwise be eligible if the Secretary
determines that the school is fully capable of originating loans at that level. The Secretary may also require a school
that meets the criteria for the second level of origination to use the services of an alternative originator if the
extent to which the school fails to meet other origination criteria merits such an action. A consortium of schools
may originate loans at a level of origination for which all members of the consortium are eligible.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of revised contract rent annual adjustment factors. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The United States Housing Act of 1937 (1937 Act) requires that the assistance contracts signed by owners participating
in the Department's section 8 Housing Assistance Payments programs provide for annual or more frequent adjustment
in the maximum monthly rentals for units covered by the contract to reflect changes based on fair market rents prevailing
in a particular market area, or on a reasonable formula. This Notice announces revised Annual Adjustment Factors
(AAFs), which are based on a formula using data on residential rent and utilities cost changes from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the HUD Random Digit Dialing (RDD) rent change surveys.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 8(c)(2)(A) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(c)(2)(A)) requires HUD to provide for
adjustments in the maximum monthly rents for units covered by the section 8 Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) Contracts.
Adjustments must reflect changes in the Fair Market Rents (FMRs) prevailing in particular market areas, or they must
be based on a reasonable formula. 



HUD has elected to establish the AAFs using the formula-based alternative. HUD regulations provide that the AAFs
will be published annually in the 

Federal Register

 (24 CFR 888.202). These revised AAFs are applicable (subject to the limitations on applicability discussed below)
for adjusting Contract Rents on or after November 8, 1993, the anniversary date for this publication.

Applicability of AAFs to Various Section 8 Programs 



AAFs established by this Notice are used to adjust Contract Rents for section 8 program units. The following provides
a general description of how AAFs apply under the several section 8 Housing Assistance Payments programs. The specific
application of the AAFs should be determined by reference to the HAP Contract and to appropriate program regulations
or requirements. 

In certain cases, AAFs are not used to adjust Contract Rents. AAFs are not used for the section 8 Voucher program. In
addition, AAFs are not used for section 8 Certificate program units subject to 24 CFR 882.110(d), which applies to
units in certain otherwise subsidized projects that are rented to section 8 Certificate program families. (The housing
assistance payment for such a unit is equal to the difference between the subsidized rent and the rent payable by the
eligible family. Adjustments to the subsidized rents are made in accordance with rules and procedures governing
the particular subsidized housing program involved.) In addition, AAFs are not used for units placed under HAP contract
in recent years under the section 202/section 8 program. Instead, those rents are based on a HUD-approved budget for
the project. 

Contract Rents for many projects receiving section 8 subsidies under the Loan Management provisions of 24 CFR part
886, subpart A, and for projects receiving section 8 subsidies under the Property Disposition provisions of 24 CFR
part 886, subpart C, are adjusted, at HUD's option, either by applying the AAFs or by adjusting rents in accordance
with 24 CFR 207.19(e). 

Under the section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program, the public housing agency (PHA) should use the base rent, not
the Contract Rent, to select the correct AAF to apply to the base rent. 



AAF Areas 



This year's AAF areas incorporate the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) revised definitions of metropolitan
areas. OMB released revised definitions based on 1990 Census data, effective as of December 31, 1992 and further modified
on June 30, 1993 (OMB Bulletins Nos. 93-05 and 93-17). Last year, HUD announced in the January 13, 1993 publication
of AAFs that the OMB definitions were being evaluated to determine their use in the next round of published AAFs. HUD
conducted this evaluation in conjunction with the FY 1994 section 8 Existing Program Fair Market Rent (FMR) cycle,
and, with the few exceptions discussed in the following paragraphs, accepted the OMB definitions. 

The HUD exceptions for AAF purposes are for six large metropolitan areas, where HUD considers the area covered by the
revised OMB definitions to be larger than appropriate for use as a housing market area definition. HUD therefore modified
the definitions for these areas by deleting some of the counties that OMB had added to its revised definitions. The
following counties are deleted from the HUD definitions of AAF areas: 






Separate AAF schedules are listed in this publication for the above counties and are identified with an asterisk (*)
next to the area name. The asterisk denotes that there is a difference between the OMB metropolitan area and the HUD
AAF area definitions for these areas. 

Each AAF applies to a specified geographical area and to units of all bedroom sizes. AAFs are provided for the metropolitan
parts (exclusive of CPI areas) and the nonmetropolitan parts of the ten HUD Regions. AAFs, developed from local CPI
surveys, are provided for 103 separate areas. 

Program participants should refer to the Area Definitions at the end of Schedule C to make certain that they are using
the correct AAFs. Units located in metropolitan areas with a local CPI survey must use the corresponding AAFs listed
separately for those metropolitan areas. Units that are located in metropolitan areas without a local CPI survey
must use the appropriate HUD Region Metropolitan AAFs. Units located in nonmetropolitan counties must use the appropriate
HUD Region Nonmetropolitan AAFs. 

The AAF Area Definitions shown in Schedule C are listed in alphabetical order by State. The associated HUD Region is
shown next to each State name. Within each State, areas whose AAFs are determined by local CPI surveys are listed first.
All CPI defined areas have separate AAF schedules and are shown with their corresponding county definitions or as
metropolitan counties. Listed after the CPI defined areas (in those states that have such areas) are the metropolitan
and nonmetropolitan counties of each State. In the six New England states, the listings are for counties or parts of
counties as defined by towns or cities. 

Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands use the HUD Region IV AAFs. All areas in Hawaii use the AAF schedule for Hawaii, which
is based on the CPI survey for the Honolulu metropolitan area. The Pacific Islands use the HUD Region IX Nonmetropolitan
AAFs. The Anchorage metropolitan area has its own AAFs based on a local CPI survey; all other areas in Alaska use the
HUD Region X Nonmetropolitan AAFs.
