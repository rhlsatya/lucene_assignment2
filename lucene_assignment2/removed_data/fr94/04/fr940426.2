AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT


Housing Guaranty Program; Investment Opportunity


The Agency for International Development (USAID) has authorized the guaranty of loans to the Government of Zimbabwe
(``Borrower'') as part of USAID's development assistance program. The proceeds of these loans will be used for mortgage
finance and to finance shelter-related infrastructure for low-income families in Zimbabwe. At this time, the Government
of Zimbabwe has authorized USAID to request proposals from eligible lenders for a loan under this program of Fifteen
Million U.S. Dollars (US$15,000,000). The name and address of the Borrower's representatives to be contacted by
interested U.S. lenders or investment bankers, the amount of the loan and project number are indicated below:

A. Pure Magnesium



The products covered by these investigations are imports of pure primary magnesium regardless of chemistry, form
or size, unless expressly excluded from the scope of these investigations. Primary magnesium is a metal or alloy containing
by weight primarily the element magnesium and produced by decomposing raw materials into magnesium metal.

Pure primary magnesium encompasses all products that contain at least 99.95% primary magnesium, by weight (generally
referred to as ``ultra-pure'' magnesium), as well as products containing less than 99.95% but not less than 99.8%
primary magnesium, by weight (generally referred to as ``pure'' magnesium). Products that have the aforementioned
primary magnesium content, but that do not conform to ASTM Specifications or other industry or customer-specific
specifications, are included in the scope of these investigations.

Pure primary magnesium is cast and sold in various physical forms and sizes, including ingots, slabs, rounds, billets
and other shapes.

Excluded from the scope of these investigations are primary magnesium anodes, granular primary magnesium (including
turnings and powder), and secondary magnesium.

Granular magnesium, turnings, and powder are classifiable under 

Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States

 (HTSUS) subheading 8104.30.00. Magnesium granules and turnings (also referred to as chips) are produced by grinding
and/or crushing primary magnesium and thus have the same chemistry as primary magnesium. Although not susceptible
to precise measurement because of their irregular shapes, turnings or chips are typically produced in course shapes
and have maximum length of less than 1 inch. Although sometimes produced in larger sizes, granules are more regularly
shaped than turnings or chips, and have a typical size of 2mm in diameter or smaller.

Powders are also produced from grinding and/or crushing primary magnesium and have the same chemistry as primary
magnesium, but are even smaller than granules or turnings. Powders are defined by the Section Notes to Section XV,
the section of the HTSUS in which subheading 8104.30.00 appears, as products of which 90 percent or more by weight will
pass through a sieve having a mesh aperture of 1mm. (See HTSUS, Section XV, Base Metals and Articles of Base Metals,
Note 6(b).) Accordingly, the exclusion of magnesium turnings, granules and powder from the scope include products
having a maximum physical dimension (

i.e.

, length or diameter) of 1 inch or less.

The products subject to these investigations are classifiable under subheadings 8104.11.00 and 8104.20.00 of the
HTSUS. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description
of the scope is dispositive.



B. Alloy Magnesium



The products covered by these investigations are imports of alloy primary magnesium regardless of chemistry, form
or size, unless expressly excluded from the scope of these investigations. Primary magnesium is a metal or alloy containing
by weight primarily the element magnesium and produced by decomposing raw materials into magnesium metal.

These investigations cover alloy primary magnesium products which contain 50% or greater, but less than 99.8%, primary
magnesium, by weight. Products with the aforementioned primary magnesium content that do not conform to ASTM Specifications
or other industry or customer-specific specifications are included in the scope of this investigation. In addition
to primary magnesium, ``alloy'' magnesium generally contains one or more of the following items in amounts less than
the primary magnesium itself: (1) Other elements deliberately added to the primary magnesium; (2) magnesium scrap
or secondary magnesium; (3) oxidized magnesium; and (4) other elements present as impurities.

Alloy primary magnesium is cast and sold in various physical forms and sizes, including ingots, slabs, rounds, billets
and other shapes.

Excluded from the scope of these investigations are primary magnesium anodes, granular primary magnesium (including
turnings and powder), and secondary magnesium.

Granular magnesium, turnings, and powder are classifiable under 

Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States

 (HTSUS) subheading 8104.30.00. Magnesium granules and turnings (also referred to as chips) are produced by grinding
and/or crushing primary magnesium and thus have the same chemistry as primary magnesium. Although not susceptible
to precise measurement because of their irregular shapes, turnings or chips are typically produced in coarse shapes
and have maximum length of less than 1 inch. Although sometimes produced in larger sizes, granules are more regularly
shaped then turnings or chips, and have a typical size of 2mm in diameter or smaller.

Powders are also produced from grinding and/or crushing primary magnesium and have the same chemistry as primary
magnesium, but are even smaller than granules or turnings. Powders are defined by the Section Notes to Section XV,
the section of the HTSUS in which subheading 8104.30.00 appears, as products of which 90 percent or more by weight will
pass through a sieve having a mesh aperture of 1mm. (

See

 HTSUS, Section XV, Base Metals and Articles of Base Metals, Note 6(b).) Accordingly, the exclusion of magnesium turnings,
granules and powder from the scope include products having a maximum physical dimension (

i.e.

, length or diameter) of 1 inch or less.

The products subject to these investigations are classifiable under subheadings 8104.19.00 and 8104.20.00 of the
HTSUS. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description
of the scope is dispositive.



United States Price and Foreign Market Value



A. Non-Market Economy Determination



The PRC, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine have all been determined to be non-market economy (NME) countries within
the meaning of sections 771(18)(A) and (C) of the Act in previous investigations and the presumption of NME status
continues for the initiation of these investigations. See, 

e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Compact Ductile Iron Waterworks Fittings and
Accessories Thereof from the PRC

, 58 FR 37908 (July 14, 1993); 

Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Ferrosilicon from the Russian Federation

, 58 FR 29192 (May 19, 1993); 

Preliminary Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Ferrosilicon from Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation,
and Ukraine

, 57 FR 61876 (December 29, 1992).

In accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, foreign market value (FMV) in NME cases is based on NME producers' factors
of production, valued in a market economy country. Absent evidence that a particular NME country government determines
which of its factories shall produce for export to the United States, we intend, for purposes of this investigation,
to base FMV only on those factories that produced pure and/or alloy magnesium sold to the United States during the period
of investigations (POI).

In the course of these investigations, parties will have the opportunity to address these NME determinations and
provide relevant information and argument on these issues. In addition, parties will have the opportunity in these
investigations to submit comments on whether FMV should be based on prices or costs in the respective NME.

B. Pure Magnesium




For the PRC, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine, petitioners based United States price (USP) on 1993 country-specific
Customs unit values for entries of pure primary magnesium.


For all three countries, petitioners contend that the FMV of imports subject to these investigations must be determined
in accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, which concerns NME countries (see ``Non-Market Economy Determination''
section of the notice, above). Accordingly, petitioners calculated FMV on the basis of the valuation of the factors
of production. The factors of production used by petitioners were based on Magcorp's experience with a production
process similar to that used in the PRC, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine.


Petitioners' FMV consisted of the sum of materials, labor, energy, overhead, general expenses, profit, and packing.
To value the factors of production, petitioners relied where possible on publicly available information from an
appropriate surrogate country. Where such information was unavailable, petitioners resorted to publicly available
information from the United States and proprietary information based on their own experience. For one production
factor, petitioners also relied on an export price from the PRC.


For purposes of these initiations, we have accepted, pursuant to section 773(c)(4) of the Act, petitioners' view
that India (for the PRC) and Brazil (for the Russian Federation and Ukraine) are appropriate surrogate countries.
We have disregarded factor values based on prices in the United States because (1) petitioners have failed to follow
the Department's established hierarchy with respect to factor valuation, and (2) petitioners provide no basis for
determining that United States values are representative of the appropriate surrogate country values. In addition,
we have disregarded the factor value based on an export price in the PRC since the PRC is an NME and cannot be an appropriate
surrogate to value factors of production.


Pursuant to section 773(c)(1) of the Act, petitioners added to the labor and material costs the percentage for overhead
based on their own experience and the statutory minima of ten percent for general expenses and eight percent for profit,
as well as an amount for packing (which, because it was based on U.S. values, was disallowed).



C. Alloy Magnesium




For the PRC, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine, petitioners based USP on 1993 country-specific Customs unit values
for entries of alloy primary magnesium. For each country, petitioners calculated FMV for alloy primary magnesium
using the same factors of production as were used for pure primary magnesium. Petitioners contend that the pure primary
magnesium must be manufactured and then mixed with an alloy to create alloy primary magnesium, and that this process
involves additional cost. Therefore, the use of the pure primary magnesium factor values to determine an alloy primary
magnesium FMV produces a conservative estimate. 

See, e.g., Final Affirmative Determination; Rescission of Investigation and Partial Dismissal of Petition: Pure
and Alloy Magnesium from Canada, 

57 FR 30939 (July 13, 1992).



Fair Value Comparisons



A. Pure Magnesium




Based on a comparison of USP and FMV, petitioners' alleged dumping margins, as corrected by the Department for methodological
errors and/or unsupported data, are as follows:







B. Alloy Magnesium




Based on a comparison of USP and FMV, petitioners' alleged dumping margins, as corrected by the Department for methodological
errors and/or unsupported data, are as follows:







Initiations of Investigations




We have examined the petitions on pure and alloy magnesium and have found that they meet the requirements of section
732(b) of the Act. Therefore, we are initiating antidumping duty investigations to determine whether imports of
pure and alloy magnesium from the PRC, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine are being, or are likely to be, sold in the
United States at less than fair value.



ITC Notification




Section 732(d) of the Act requires us to notify the International Trade Commission (ITC) of these actions, and we have
done so.



Preliminary Determination by the ITC




The ITC will determine by May 16, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that imports of pure and alloy magnesium
from the PRC, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S.
industry. Any ITC determination which is negative will result in the respective investigation being terminated;
otherwise, these investigations will proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits.


This notice is published pursuant to section 732(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.13(b).

Market Development Cooperator Program 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 International Trade Administration (ITA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The mission of ITA is to promote U.S. exports and to strengthen the international trade position of the United States.
ITA's ability to fulfill its mission is enhanced through building partnerships with the private sector. To encourage
such partnerships, ITA has created the Market Development Cooperator Program to develop, maintain, and expand foreign
markets for nonagricultural goods and services produced in the United States. For purposes of this program, ``nonagricultural
goods and services'' means goods and services other than agricultural products as defined in 7 U.S.C. 451. ``Produced
in the United States'' means having substantial inputs of materials and labor originating in the United States, such
inputs constituting at least 50 percent of the value of the good or service to be exported. 



The advantage of a joint effort is that it permits the Government to pool expertise and funds with non-federal sources
so that each maximizes its market development resources. Partnerships of this sort also may provide a sharper focus
on long-term export market development than do traditional trade promotion activities and serve as a mechanism for
improving Government-industry relations. 

While the Market Development Cooperator Program is sponsored, guided and funded by the Department of Commerce with
a matching requirement by the recipient, applicants are expected to develop, initiate and carry out market development
project activities. As an active partner, ITA will provide assistance identified by the applicant as being essential
to the achievement of project goals and objectives. U.S. industry is best able to assess its problems and needs in the
foreign marketplace and to recommend innovative solutions and programs that can be the formula to success in international
trade. 

Examples of activities that might be included in an applicant's project are described below. Not one of these activities
or any combination of these activities must be included for a proposal to receive favorable consideration. Applicants
are encouraged to propose activities that (1) would be most appropriate to market development needs of their industry
or industries; and (2) display the imagination and innovation of the applicant working in partnership with the Government
to obtain the maximum market development impact. 

A public meeting for parties considering applying for funding under the MDCP will be held on May 10, 1994. Attendance
at this public meeting is not required of potential proposers. The purpose of the meeting is to provide general information
regarding the MDCP procedures, selection process, and proposal preparation to potential applicants unfamiliar
with the MDCP. No discussion of specific proposals will occur at this meeting.

Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA)



No. 11.112, Market Development Cooperator Program. 



Program Description 



The objective of the Market Development Cooperator Program is to develop, maintain, and expand foreign markets for
nonagricultural goods and services produced in the United States. The intended beneficiaries are U.S. producers
of nonagricultural goods or services that seek to export such goods or services. 

Market Development Cooperator Program funds should not be viewed as a replacement for funding from other sources,
either public or private. An important goal of this program is to increase the sum of Federal and non-Federal export
market development activities. This goal can best be achieved by using program funds to encourage new initiatives.
In addition to new initiatives, expansion of the scope of an existing project also may qualify for funding consideration.
The Department of Commerce will consider such projects as entirely new initiatives. 

Applicants are encouraged to propose activities that would be most appropriate to the market development needs of
their industry or industries. The following are examples of activities which might be included in an application
(no one of these activities or any combination of these activities must be included for an application to receive favorable
consideration): 

(1) Opening an overseas office or offices to perform a variety of market development services for companies joining
a consortium to avail themselves of such services; such an office should not duplicate the programs or services of
the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS) post(s) in the region; 

(2) Detailing a private sector individual to a US&FCS post in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 4723(c); 

(3) Entering into a contract with a bona fide market research company to conduct detailed, product-specific market
research; 

(4) Assigning industry specialists to work with Department of Commerce/U.S. Executive Director Procurement Liaison
Offices at the Multilateral Development Banks to seek out and develop procurement opportunities; 

(5) Underwriting the cost of overseas market research or participation in overseas trade exhibitions and trade missions
to promote U.S. exports, or covering the expenses of reverse trade missions and/or foreign buyer group travel to U.S.
domestic trade shows; 

(6) Overseas product demonstrations; 

(7) Export seminars in the United States or market penetration seminars in the market(s) to be developed; 

(8) Technical trade servicing that helps overseas buyers to choose the right U.S. good(s) or service(s) and to use
the good or service efficiently; 

(9) Joint promotions with foreign customers; 

(10) Training of foreign nationals to perform after-sales service or to act as distributors; 

(11) Working with organizations in the foreign marketplace responsible for setting standards and for product testing
to improve market access; and 

(12) Publishing an export resource guide or an export product directory for the industry or industries in question
if no comparable one exists. 



Funding Availability




The total amount of funds available for this program is $2.5 million for fiscal year (FY) 94. It is contemplated that
a minimum of four (4) cooperative agreements will be concluded with eligible entities for this program. Each cooperative
agreement will not exceed a total of $500,000 regardless of the duration of the award.

Matching Requirements


Applicants will be expected to supply two thirds (2/3) of total project costs, with the Federal portion to be one third
(1/3). The Department of Commerce will support only a portion of the direct costs of each project. Each applicant will
support a portion of the direct costs (to be specified in the application). For purposes of this program, ``direct
costs'' are defined as personnel, fringe benefits, travel, equipment, supplies, contractual, and other direct
costs (e.g., rent and furnishings for an overseas office). 
A minimum of one half (1/2) of each applicant's support must be in the form of new cash outlays expressly for the project.
The balance of the applicant's support may consist of in-kind contributions (goods and services). Applicants may
charge companies in the industry or other industry organizations reasonable fees to take part in or avail themselves
of services provided as part of applicants' projects. Plans to charge fees should be described in detail in the applicant's
application. 


Type of Funding Instrument


Since it is anticipated that ITA will be substantially involved in the implementation of each project for which an
award is made, the funding instrument for this program will be a cooperative agreement. 


Eligibility Criteria


Trade associations, nonprofit industry organizations, state trade departments and their regional associations
including centers for international trade development, and private industry firms or groups of firms in cases where
no entity described above represents that industry are eligible to apply for cooperative agreements under this program.
For the purpose of this program, a ``nonprofit industry organization'' is defined as any nonprofit organization
(such as chambers of commerce and world trade centers) made up of firms in an industry, or which is established or funded
by and which operates on behalf of an industry. For the purpose of this program, a ``trade association'' is defined
as consisting of member firms in the same industry, or in related industries, or which share common commercial concerns.
The purpose of the association is to further the commercial interests of its members through the exchange of information,
legislative activities, and the like. 
Eligible entities may join together to submit an application as a joint venture and to share costs. For example, two
trade associations representing different segments of a single industry or related industries may pool their resources
and submit one application. Foreign businesses and private groups also may join with eligible U.S. organizations
to submit applications and to share the costs of proposed projects. Applications will be accepted from eligible entities
representing any industry, subsector of an industry or related industries. Each applicant must permit all companies
in the industry in question to participate, on equal terms, in all activities that are scheduled as part of a proposed
project whether or not the company is a member or constituent of the eligible organization. 
Eligible entities desiring to participate in this program must demonstrate the ability to provide a competent, experienced
staff and other resources to assure adequate development, supervision and execution of the proposed project activities.
Applicants must describe in detail all assistance expected from the Department of Commerce or other Federal Government
agencies to implement project activities successfully. Each applicant must provide a description of the membership
of the eligible entity, the degree to which the entity represents the industry or industries in question, and the role,
if any, foreign membership plays in the affairs of the eligible entity. Applicants should summarize both the recent
history of their industry or industries' competitiveness in the international marketplace and the export promotion
history of the eligible entity or entities submitting the application.

Project proposals must be compatible with U.S. trade and commercial policy. 


Award Period


Funds may be expended over the period of time required to complete the scope of work, but not to exceed three (3) years
from the date of the award. 


Indirect Costs


The total dollar amount of the indirect costs proposed in an application under this program must not exceed the indirect
cost rate negotiated and approved by a cognizant Federal agency prior to the proposed effective date of the award or
100 percent of the total proposed direct costs dollar amount in the application, whichever is less. 


Application Forms and Kit


Standard Forms 424 (Rev. 4-92), 424A (Rev. 4-92), and 424B (Rev. 4-92), which are required as part
of the application, are available from the contact person indicated above. Applicants must submit a signed original
and three (3) copies of the application and supporting materials. 


Project Funding Priorities


Applications may be targeted for any market in the world. In ITA's view, projects in the following sectors and countries
present opportunities to develop, maintain and expand overseas markets and enhance jobs through U.S. exports: 
(a) 

Sectors: 

Environmental technologies, transportation technologies, energy technologies, information technologies,
health technologies, and financial services; 
(b) 

Geographic Markets: 

Argentina, Brazil, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Poland, Russia and the other Newly Independent
States of the former Soviet Union, South Africa, Taiwan, and Turkey. 
While the proposed projects may entail an overseas presence, activities may take place in the United States if it is
necessary to the project's success. 
Developing a project plan requires solid background research. Applicants should study, and applications should
reflect such study of, the following: 
1. The market potential of the good(s) or service(s) to be promoted in a particular market(s), 
2. The competition from host-country and third-country suppliers, and 
3. The economic situation and prospects that bear upon the ability of a country to import the good(s) or service(s).

Applicants should present in their applications an assessment of industry resources that can be brought to bear on
developing a market; the industry's ability to meet potential market demand expeditiously; and the industry's after-sales
service capability in a particular foreign market(s). 
After describing their completed basic research, applicants should develop marketing plans that set forth the overall
objectives of the projects and the specific activities applicants will undertake as part of these projects. Applications
should display the imagination and innovation of the private sector working in partnership with the Government to
obtain the maximum market development impact. 


Evaluation Criteria 


The Department of Commerce is interested in projects that demonstrate the possibility of both significant results
during the project period and lasting benefits extending beyond the project period. To that end, consideration for
financial assistance under the Market Development Cooperator Program will be based upon the following evaluation
criteria: 


(1) Anticipated


(a) Increase in U.S. exports generated (per dollar of cooperator program funds spent) by the proposed expenditure
of funds; and

(b) Increase in the industry's foreign market share. Applicant should provide quantifiable estimates of expected
project results, along with detailed explanations, for (1)a and (1)b above. 



(2) Anticipated



(a) Increase in the number of U.S. companies operating in the market(s) selected (multiplier effect); and/or 

(b) Increase in the number of current companies in the market undertaking new export initiatives. Applicant should
provide quantifiable estimates of expected project results for either (2)a or (2)b above, or for both where proposed
project increases are anticipated. 

(3) Export potential of the good(s) and/or service(s) to be promoted. 

(4) Willingness and ability of the applicant to back up promotional activities with aggressive marketing and after-sales
service and probability that the project can be continued on a self-sustained basis after the completion of the award.


(5) Intent and capability of the applicant to enlist the participation of small and medium size American companies
in consortia and activities that are to be part of the proposed project; 

(6) Size of the cash portion of the applicant's funding for the proposed project and institutional capacity of the
applicant to carry out the work plan; 

(7) Creativity and innovation displayed by the work plan while at the same time being realistic; and 

(8) Reasonableness of the itemized budget for project activities. 

Evaluation criteria 1-3 are of utmost importance in the selection process and will be worth 60 out of a possible
100 points as follows:




Criterion 

#

1_maximum 20 points. 
Criterion 

#

2_maximum 20 points. 
Criterion

<DOCTITLE>United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement, Article 1904 Binational Panel Reviews: Request for an Extraordinary
Challenge Committee</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

NAFTA Secretariat, United States Section, International Trade Administration, Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Review for an Extraordinary Challenge Committee to review issues raised by the May 6, 1993 and December 17,
1993, decisions of the binational panel that reviewed the final countervailing duty determination and the determination
on remand made by the United States Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration in the matter of Certain
Softwood Lumber Products from Canada, Secretariat File No. USA-92-1904-01. This Request was filed
with the United States Section of the NAFTA Secretariat on April 6, 1994.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On April 6, 1994, the Office of the United States Trade Representative filed a Request for an Extraordinary Challenge
Committee to review decisions dated May 6, 1993 and December 17, 1993. In May 6, 1993 decision, the Binational Panel
remanded to the International Trade Administration on several grounds. In the December 17, 1993 decision, the three-person
majority ordered Commerce to find certain programs non-specific and to find the stumpage subsidies non-market distorting.
This finding effectively required Commerce to determine that neither program represents a countervailable subsidy.
The NAFTA Secretariat has assigned file number ECC-94-1904-01USA to this Request. Copies of the
Request and the Panel decision are available from the NAFTA Secretariat.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Chapter 19 of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') establishes a mechanism to replace
domestic judicial review of final determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty cases involving imports
from the other country with review by independent binational panels. When a Request for Panel Review is filed, a panel
is established to act in place of national courts to review expeditiously the final determination to determine whether
it conforms with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the country that made the determination.




Under Article 1904.13 of the Agreement, where a Party alleges that a binational panel has seriously departed from
a fundamental rule of procedure, has manifestly exceeded its powers, authority or jurisdiction or that a member of
the panel has materially violated the Code of Conduct established pursuant to Article 1910, and further alleges that
any of these actions have materially affected the panel's decision and threaten the integrity of the panel review
process, that Party may request that an Extraordinary Challenge Committee be established under the procedure set
out in Annex 1904.13 of the Agreement.

Under Annex 1904.13 of the Agreement, the Government of the United States and the Government of Canada established
Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Extraordinary Challenge Committees (``ECC Rules''). These ECC Rules were published
in the 

Federal Register

 on December 30, 1988 (53 FR 53222). These Rules were amended in the 

Federal Register

 on February 8, 1994 (59 FR 5910). The ECC Rules give effect to the provisions of Chapter Nineteen of the Agreement with
respect to Extraordinary Challenge Committee proceedings conducted pursuant to Article 1904 of the Agreement.
The ECC Rules are intended to result in decisions typically within 30 days after the establishment of the Extraordinary
Challenge Committee. The Extraordinary Challenge Committee proceeding in this matter will be conducted in accordance
with these ECC Rules.

Background



On May 28, 1992, Commerce issued its final affirmative determination respecting Certain Softwood Lumber Products
from Canada. Requests for Panel Review were filed as required by the Article 1904 Panel Rules, and a Binational Panel
was convened to review the final determination.

On May 6, 1993, the Binational Panel remanded Commerce's final determination on several grounds. The Panel remanded
Commerce's specificity determination concerning stumpage on grounds that Commerce is required to articulate an
analysis under all four illustrative specificity factors identified in Commerce's proposed regulations. Second,
the Panel remanded the B.C. log export ban specificity finding on the grounds that Commerce's 

de jure

 specificity analysis was inadequate. It invited commerce to present a 

de facto

 analysis of the export ban. Third, as a second basis for remanding the finding that the stumpage programs were countervailable,
the Panel directed Commerce to evaluate whether the programs could and did have a distorting effect on the operation
of normal competitive markets.

Commerce issued its determination on remand on September 17, 1993. Commerce reaffirmed its position that the governing
statute did not require it to determine whether a government's provision of a good that otherwise satisfied the statutory
definition of a subsidy also distorted the market by causing a price or output effect. Nevertheless, in accordance
with the Panel's order, Commerce reviewed the literature, existing studies, and other record evidence and determined
that the provision of stumpage at preferential rates by provincial governments affected the price or rates by provincial
governments affected the price or output. Specifically, Commerce found that changes in stumpage fees resulted in
changes in the output of softwood lumber.

On December 17, 1993, the Panel issued its second decision. Two Panelists in dissent stated that they would have affirmed
Commerce's specificity and preferentiality findings made on remand. In addition, the two dissenting Panelists
indicated that they had reconsidered their earlier decision and reached an opposite conclusion with respect to the
issues of specificity (both for stumpage and log export restrictions) and stumpage preferentiality, and would have
affirmed commerce's original determination on those issues. The three-person Majority, however, ordered Commerce
to find both programs non-specific and to find the stumpage subsidies non-market-distorting. This finding effectively
required Commerce to determine that neither program represents a countervailable subsidy.

On January 6, 1994, Commerce issued a second remand. Commerce reaffirmed its original position concerning issues
contained in the Majority's December 17 decision. However, in compliance with the Panel's decision, Commerce determined
that neither provincial stumpage programs nor B.C.'s log export restrictions constituted a countervailable subsidy
under U.S. law.



Request for an Extraordinary Challenge Committtee



On April 6, 1994, the United States Trade Representstive filed a Request for an Extraordinary Challenge Committee
on behalf of the United States Government in its capacity as a Party to the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement,
with the United States Secretary of the NAFTA Secretariat. Four specific counts are contained in the Request: 

(1) That two of the Binational Panelists maintained relationships or engaged in activities creating the appearance
of partiality or bias or, in the case of one of the panelists, constituting a serious conflict of interest; 

(2) The Panel in its May 1993 determination, manifestly exceeded its power, authority, and jurisdiction by failing
to apply the appropriate standard of review and general legal principles that a court of the United States would apply
when it ruled that Commerce must determine that the preferential treatment in timber pricing led to an increased output
of lumber;

(3) In its analysis of Commerce's determination that provincial stumpage programs in fact benefit industry or group
of industries, the Majority manifestly exceeded its power, authority, or jurisdiction by failing to apply the appropriate
standard of review and by seriously misapprehending the U.S. substantive law it was required to apply. Instead of
determining whether Commerce's finding was a permissible exercise of its discretion under U.S. law, the Majority
systematically substituted its own judgment for that of Commerce as to interpretations of law and fact; and

(4) For reasons similar to the case of stumpage, the Majority manifestly exceeded its powers, authority, and jurisdiction
in its finding concerning whether B.C.'s log export restrictions were ``specific'' under U.S. countervailing duty
law. Commerce's remand determination with regard to specificity of B.C.'s log export restrictions, and the Majority's
opinion reviewing the determination, each incorporated much of their respective analyses of specificity concerning
stumpage programs. Hence the defects in the Majority's approach in the stumpage context identified above also apply
to the context of specificity of log export restrictions.

Rule 37 of the ECC Rules requires that Notices of Appearance in this proceeding must be filed with the United States
Secretary within ten days after the Request is filed (by April 28, 1994). Under Rule 38 of the ECC Rules, briefs must
be filed with the United States Secretary within 21 days of the filing of the Request (by April 27, 1994).

<DOCTITLE>Changed Meeting; Public Scoping Meeting for an Environmental Impact Statement for Disposal and Reuse of Naval Base,
Charleston, South Carolina, Has Been Changed</DOCTITLE>



Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (title 42, United States Code, section
4332, as amended), as implemented by the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-08),
and in accordance with the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-510), the Department
of the Navy announced its intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate the environmental
effects of disposal and reuse of the Naval Base Charleston, South Carolina, in the 

Federal Register

 on Tuesday, April 12, 1994 (59 FR 17350). 

The Department of the Navy co-scheduled the scoping meeting with the regular meeting of the Building Economic Solutions
Together Team (BEST), who is preparing a Re-Use plan. The BEST Team has rescheduled the date of its meeting from April
26 to May 11; therefore, the scoping meeting for the EIS has been changed accordingly.

The proposed action to be evaluated in the EIS involves the disposal of land, buildings, and infrastructure of Naval
Base Charleston for subsequent reuse. The public scoping meeting's purpose is to determine the scope of issues addressed
by the EIS and to identify the significant issues related to this action. The Department of the Navy will hold public
scoping meetings for this EIS at four different locations: Wednesday, May 11, 1994, beginning at 7 p.m. at the Chicora
Neighborhood Center at 2012 Success Street, North Charleston, South Carolina; Wednesday, May 11, 1994, beginning

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In support of the transformation within the Department of Energy as it redirects its focus from a primarily mission
oriented, inward-facing agency to a service-oriented, customer-driven agency, the Secretary of Energy has implemented
plans for supporting economic development and community assistance activities around DOE sites affected by changing
program missions. Each Operations Office has been charged with notifying the public of available facilities, technology
partnership opportunities and economic development and diversification programs for the purpose of stimulating
local economic growth through community partnerships. It is anticipated that assistance through community economic
development plans will help to minimize the impact of DOE downsizing on the local area and work force. Community representatives,
including elected officials, business executives, community leaders, and the academic field, have selected TRIDEC,
under a Memorandum of Understanding, to be the Community Reuse Organization (CRO) and single point of contact for
coordinating community efforts and resources and performing site-specific economic development planning and
management. The ultimate goal is to stimulate local economic growth through community partnerships so that when
the Department of Energy has completed its mission and closes its operations at this site, the economical impact on
the community will be minimal.

In the Matter of: Goodman Manufacturing Company. (Case No. F-066) 


Background 


The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Public Law 94-163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy
Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Public Law 95-619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation
Act of 1987 (NAECA), Public Law 100-12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA
1988), Public Law 100-357, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), Public Law 102-486, 106 Stat. 2776,
which requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer
products, including furnaces. The intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption
that will assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart
B. 
The Department amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 to create a waiver process. 45 FR 64108,
September 26, 1980. Thereafter, DOE further amended its appliance test procedure waiver process to allow the Assistant
Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver from test
procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures.
51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986. 
The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to waive temporarily test procedures for a particular basic model
when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing according
to the prescribed test procedures or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner so
unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers
generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective, resolving the problem that is
the subject of the waiver. 
The Interim Waiver provisions added by the 1986 amendment allow the Assistant Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver
when it is determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver
is denied, if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines
that it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition
for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the
Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary.

Goodman filed a ``Petition for Waiver,'' dated November 29, 1993, in accordance with  430.27 of 10 CFR part 430.
The Department published in the 

Federal Register 

on February 23, 1994, Goodman's petition and solicited comments, data and information respecting the petition.
58 FR 8608. Goodman also filed an ``Application for Interim Waiver'' under section 430.27(g) which DOE granted on
February 10, 1994. 58 FR 8608, February 23, 1994. 
No comments were received concerning either the ``Petition for Waiver'' or the ``Interim Waiver.'' The Department
consulted with The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) concerning the Goodman Petition. The FTC did not have any objections
to the issuance of the waiver to Goodman. 


Assertions and Determinations 


Goodman's Petition seeks a waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute time delay between the ignition
of the burner and the starting of the circulating air blower. Goodman requests the allowance to test using a 30-second
blower time delay when testing its GMPV series central furnaces. Goodman states that since the 30-second delay is
indicative of how these models actually operate and since such a delay results in an improvement in efficiency of approximately
1.0 percent, the petition should be granted. 
Under specific circumstances, the DOE test procedure contains exceptions which allow testing with blower delay
times of less than the prescribed 1.5-minute delay. Goodman indicates that it is unable to take advantage of any of
these exceptions for its GMPV series central furnaces. 
Since the blower controls incorporated on the Goodman furnaces are designed to impose a 30-second blower delay in
every instance of start up, and since the current provisions do not specifically address this type of control, DOE
agrees that a waiver should be granted to allow the 30-second blower time delay when testing the Goodman GMPV series
central furnaces. Accordingly, with regard to testing the GMPV series central furnaces, today's Decision and Order
exempts Goodman from the existing provisions regarding blower controls and allows testing with the 30-second delay.

It is, therefore, ordered that: 
(1) The ``Petition for Waiver'' filed by Goodman Manufacturing Company (Case No. F-066) is hereby granted as
set forth in paragraph (2) below, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (3), (4), and (5). 
(2) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of Appendix N of 10 CFR part 430, subpart B, Goodman Manufacturing Company,
shall be permitted to test its GMPV series central furnaces on the basis of the test procedure specified in 10 CFR part
430, with modifications set forth below: 
(i) Section 3.0 of Appendix N is deleted and replaced with the following paragraph: 




3.0 Test Procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified in section 9 in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-82
with the exception of sections 9.2.2, 9.3.1, and 9.3.2, and the inclusion of the following additional procedures:




(ii) Add a new paragraph 3.10 to Appendix N as follows: 



3.10 Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. The following paragraph is in lieu of the requirement specified
in section 9.3.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-82. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the
cool-down test and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature,
using the thermocouple grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner
start-up, delay the blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t-), unless: (1) The furnace employs a single motor to drive the
power burner and the indoor air circulating blower, in which case the burner and blower shall be started together;
or (2) the furnace is designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case
the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower; or (3) the delay time results in the activation of a temperature
safety device which shuts off the burner, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the
latter case, if the fan control is adjustable, set it to start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control
is permitted to start the blower, measure time delay, (t-), using a stopwatch. Record the measured temperatures.
During the heat-up test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain the draft in the flue pipe within 

#

0.01 inch of water column of the manufacturer's recommended on-period draft. 



(iii) With the exception of the modifications set forth above, Goodman Manufacturting Company shall comply in all
respects with the test procedures specified in Appendix N of 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B. 
(3) The Waiver shall remain in effect from the date of issuance of this Order until DOE prescribes final test procedures
appropriate to the GMPV series central furnaces manufactured by Goodman Manufacturing Company. 
(4) This Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements, allegations, and documentary materials submitted
by the petitioner. This Waiver may be revoked or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying
the petition is incorrect. 
(5) Effective [Insert Date of Issuance], this Waiver supersedes the Interim Waiver granted the Goodman Manufacturing
Company on February 10, 1994. 58 FR 8608, February 23, 1994 (Case No. F-066).

<DOCTITLE>Disbursement of Discretionary Funds to Federally-Recognized American Indian Tribes </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of inquiry and request for comment. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy (DOE) is developing eligibility standards and funding criteria for the distribution of
DOE discretionary funds to federally-recognized American Indian tribes by DOE's Office of Environmental Management
(EM). Discretionary funds, pursuant to section 646 of the DOE Organization Act, are awarded to Indian tribes to participate
in DOE's remediation and management program for wastes produced as the result of its activities at its former and current
weapons production facilities. Such participation relates directly to DOE's American Indian Tribal Government
policy, pursuant to DOE Order 1230.2, recognizing a government-to-government relationship with Indian tribes.




Because of the potential for broad interest, DOE is providing interested parties an opportunity for comment on issues
related to the funding of Indian tribes who are directly affected by DOE activities. DOE invites written comment on
the criteria development process before proposing guidelines. In addition, DOE will schedule public workshops
at several of its sites. At these workshops, tribes and other interested parties will have an opportunity to further
discuss issues related to guidance.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This Notice supplements a Notice of Inquiry, published on February 4, 1994 (59 FR 5405), to announce the dates and locations
of public workshops related to the development of funding guidance under the Office of Environmental Management.




I. Background 



In 1989, the Office of Environmental Management was established to address environmental problems at the Department's
facilities. Many of the Department's past, present, and future activities potentially affect Indian tribes. Past
activities of DOE involved the research and production of plutonium, uranium, and other hazardous substances. Present
and future activities focus on the management and remediation of wastes produced as a result of the Department's production
activities. 

Because DOE's activities may affect tribes in close proximity to DOE sites, the Department's policy is to consult
with these tribes and support tribal environmental remediation programs. The fundamental goals of DOE's policy
are to involve affected tribes in remediation activities, provide tribes safe access to and management of cultural
and natural resources, and promote tribal economic competitiveness and self-sufficiency pursuant to administration
policy and legal requirements. 

In the past, DOE discretionary funds have been distributed to Indian tribes primarily through planning grants. Planning
grants have funded tribal environmental restoration and waste management programs to identify, analyze and take
initiatives to address waste management and cleanup issues stemming from DOE sites and facilities. The Nez Perce
Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, and the Yakama Indian Nation have received planning
grants related to the Hanford site. 

As an alternative to planning grants, DOE has used cooperative agreements to fund tribal activities. A cooperative
agreement requires greater involvement between DOE and the participant in negotiating and conducting the proposed
activities. This involvement results in specific project milestones and products that ensure greater accountability.
The Department has successfully employed cooperative agreements to implement hazardous materials emergency response
programs, as occurred in the case of the Waste Isolation Pilot Project with the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes, and at the
Hanford site with the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. Based on this experience, DOE intends
to use cooperative agreements as the prime vehicle for tribal involvement in environmental remediation activities.
In addition to the use of cooperative agreements, the government-to-government relationship between DOE and tribal
nations may also be expressed through site-specific agreements, memoranda of understanding, and joint ventures.

The amount of DOE discretionary funds available for tribal cleanup activities in the early years of the DOE environmental
program was based on large projected budget increases. However, present and anticipated budget constrictions for
the EM program only allow for moderate funding. As a result, the amount of funds available for tribal environmental
management and cleanup activities has leveled, while the degree of involvement by tribes, and the number of tribes
that want to be involved in remediation activities, continue to grow. Budget limitations, coupled with DOE's commitment
to involve affected tribes in its cleanup and management activities, necessitate the development of standards and
guidance for disbursement of DOE discretionary funds to tribes. 

These standards will require the development of criteria relating to eligibility and funding. Eligibility criteria
would determine which tribes would qualify to enter into cooperative agreements with DOE. Funding criteria would
determine the types of activities that are to be funded and the levels of funding. DOE acknowledges that eligibility
and funding criteria may utilize similar factors. 



II. Discussion_Eligibility and Funding Criteria 



A. Eligibility 



Eligibility criteria would determine if a federally-recognized Indian tribe qualifies to enter into a cooperative
agreement allowing tribal participation in DOE environmental remediation activities. The following considerations
could be used to determine tribal eligibility: 

(1) Should a tribe be considered eligible if its legal interests arising from treaty, statutes, and case law are affected
by a DOE hazardous waste site. 

(2) Should a tribe be considered eligible if its legal interests arising from treaty, statutes, and case law are affected
by a DOE produced waste stream or transportation corridor which carries DOE hazardous wastes? 

(3) Should a tribe be considered eligible if its cultural and natural resources are located on or in close proximity
to a DOE hazardous waste site, DOE produced waste stream, or transportation corridor which carries DOE hazardous
wastes? Please define cultural and natural resources. 

(4) Should a tribe be eligible if its reservation is located on or in close proximity to a DOE hazardous waste site, DOE
produced waste stream, or transportation corridor which carries DOE hazardous wastes? 

(5) Should ``close proximity'' be limited to a geographically defined area in relation to a DOE hazardous waste site,
DOE produced waste stream, or transportation corridor which carries DOE hazardous wastes (e.g., a geographic area
of not more than 50 miles, 100 miles, etc., from a hazardous site)? 

(6) Should ``close proximity'' be defined to include more distant areas where actual or likely physical harm could
occur as a result of a DOE hazardous waste site, DOE produced waste stream, or transportation corridor which carries
DOE hazardous wastes? 

(7) What other factors should be considered in determining eligibility? 



B. Funding 



Once it is ascertained which tribes are eligible to enter into cooperative agreements with DOE, the next determination
is what particular tribal activities should be funded and at what levels. The following considerations which could
be used to determine tribal funding include: 

(1) Should a priority system be used to categorize activities by factors such as the following: 

(a) The degree of the threat or actual level of harm to a tribe (e.g., the greater threat of harm, the greater the priority,
etc.); 

(b) Size of affected tribal population; and 

(c) Types of activities proposed, (e.g., a groundwater monitoring activity to ensure a safe drinking water supply
versus the remediation of a cultural site). 

(i) Should activities that support tribal management of cultural resources receive greater priority than other
activities? 

(ii) Should activities which would assist a tribe in becoming more economically competitive and self-sufficient
receive greater priority than other activities?

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940426-2-00030 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940426-2-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) Should the fact that a tribe was previously funded by DOE mean it should receive greater consideration than a tribe
that has never been funded, or the opposite? 

(3) Should a tribe receive greater funding consideration for past participation in DOE activities that were well
performed by the tribe? 

(4) Where possible, should tribes that coordinate and prepare a joint proposal receive more favorable consideration
than proposals by individual tribes? 

(5) To what extent should proximity be taken into account in funding one tribe that can argue a greater degree of affectedness
over another tribe? ``Affected'' is defined in this instance to apply to a tribe that faces a substantial environmental
or health impact. 



III. Request for Submissions 



The criteria and other ideas raised in this Notice are suggestions for comment. Comments need not address all suggestions
raised in this inquiry and can be limited to particular points. DOE welcomes additional comments on eligibility and

El Paso Natural Gas Co.; Tariff Filing



April 20, 1994.



Take notice that on April 15, 1994, El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso), tendered for filing, pursuant to Part 154
of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) Regulations Under the Natural Gas Act and in compliance
with the Commission's Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Requests for Rehearing and Clarification issued
March 1, 1994 (March 1, 1994 order) at Docket No. RP88-44-044, certain tariff sheets to its FERC Gas Tariff,
First Revised Volume No. 1-A.

El Paso states that on November 5, 1992, in compliance with the Commission's order dated October 9, 1992 at Docket No.
RP88-44-020 El Paso filed revised tariff sheets to provide, among other things, correlative (comparable)
discounts when El Paso discounted the rate it charged for the transportation of its sales gas or the gas of marketing
affiliates on the mainline. On May 21, 1993, El Paso states that it filed modifications to the comparable discount
provisions in compliance with the Commission's order dated May 6, 1993, which granted rehearing in part of the October
9, 1992 order. El Paso states that the Commission, in its March 1, 1994 order, found that it was a mistake to apply the
comparable discount requirements of Order Nos. 497 and 636 to El Paso prior to restructuring and the spin-off of its
merchant division. Accordingly, El Paso states, the Commission reversed its prior decision to require comparable
discounts under the requirements of Order Nos. 497 and 636 before pre-restructuring.

El Paso states that it is filing in compliance with the March 1, 1994 order. El Paso states that it has removed the comparable
discount requirements for the time period prior to El Paso's implementation of restructuring.

El Paso requests all necessary waivers of the Commission's regulations so as to permit the tendered tariff sheets
to become effective on October 9, 1992.

El Paso states that copies of the filing were served upon all of El Paso's interstate pipeline system transportation
and sales customers and interested state regulatory commissions.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with  385.211 of the Commission's Rules and
Regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before April 27, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission
in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding.
Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference
room.

<DOCTITLE>Midwest Gas Storage Inc.; Revised Initial Tariff Filing</DOCTITLE>



April 14, 1994.



Take notice that on April 8, 1994, Midwest Gas Storage Inc. (Midwest), 13100 Southwest Highway, Palos Park, Illinois
60464, filed in Docket Nos. CP90-454-004 and MT94-3-000 a First Revised Volume No. 1 of its
FERC Gas Tariff, with a proposed effective date of May 15, 1994.

In its revised tariff, Midwest proposes to convert its tariff from a volumetric basis to a thermal basis and incorporates
the Commission's Order No. 497 tariff requirements to reflect a new marketing affiliate, Midwest Gas Services, Inc.
Midwest states that the new marketing affiliate will provide interested persons with gas that is stored in Midwest's
facilities.

Midwest states that in addition to the 6-month waiver to implement its electronic bulletin board previously requested
in Docket No. CP90-454-002, Midwest requests approval to implement on an interim basis, a Telephone Bulletin
Board, which Midwest indicates is similar to that of Tarpon Transmission Company and Louisiana-Nevada Transit Company.
In addition, Midwest requests waiver of the flexible receipt and delivery point requirement because it is anticipated
that nearly 100 percent of Midwest's storage activity will take place through only one point: the Panhandle Eastern
Pipe Line Company/Midwest interconnection.

Any person desiring to be heard or protest the subject filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections
385.211 and 385.214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure: 18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214. All such motions
and protests should be filed on or before April 25, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining
the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the parties. Any person wishing
to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and available
for public inspection.

(Transportation Contract).

Natural seeks a declaratory order from the Commission that:

(1) The Settlement and its implementation are in the public interest insofar as they affect jurisdictional services,
rates and charges on Natural's system;

(2) The Commission waives or amends Opinion No. 119 to implement the Settlement pricing provisions (such determination
would also resolve a pending complaint insofar as it relates to the Natural-Dakota arrangements); and

(3) Natural will be permitted to recover costs incurred pursuant to the Settlement and any payments incurred in connection
with assignment of the reformed Coal Gas Contract through Natural's mechanism(s) under Order Nos. 636, 

et seq.

 for recovery of GSR costs in effect from time to time.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR 385.214
and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before April
27, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will
not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 United States Environmental Protection Agency.




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of final action.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The purpose of this notice is to announce the final

Agency action regarding the Prevention of Significant

Deterioration (PSD) permit issued by the Virginia 

Department of Environmental Quality on September 15, 1993 to 

Patowmack Power Partners, L.P. in Loudoun County, Virginia. This

determination was appealed to the Environmental Protection 

Agency (EPA). 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 6, 1993 and October 8, 1993, petitions were submitted to the Environmental Appeals Board requesting review
of a PSD permit issued to Patowmack Power Partners, L.P. for construction of a 315-megawatt gas/oil fired electric
generating facility in Loudoun County, Virginia. These petitions were submitted by Edward A. Mainland and Mary Fraser-Priest,
respectively. The PSD permit was issued by the 
Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VDEQ) on September 

15, 1993, pursuant to a delegation of authority from the EPA, 

Region III, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Because of the 

delegation, any PSD permit issued by the VDEQ is an EPA-issued 
permit for purposes of Federal law (40 CFR 124.41; 45 FR 
33413 (May 19, 1980)), and is subject to review by the Agency 

under 40 CFR 124.19 before becoming final.



The Environmental Appeals Board issued an Order Denying 

Review of the permit on February 24, 1994, concluding that review 
of VDEQ's permit determination was not warranted and that it met 

all necessary requirements of Federal law.

Anyone wishing to review the final permit, petitions, Order 

Denying Review, or related materials should contact one of the 

following offices:




U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, Air Enforcement Branch, New Source Review Section (3AT22), 
841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107.

Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, P.O. Box 10089, Richmond, Virginia 23240.

Pursuant to 40 CFR 124.19(f)(2), for purposes of judicial 

review, final Agency action occurs when a final PSD permit is 

issued and Agency review procedures are exhausted. This notice,

being published today in the 

Federal Register

, constitutes notice 
of the final Agency action denying review of the PSD permit. If 

available, judicial review of these determinations under section 

307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act (Act) may be sought 

only

 by

the filing of a petition for review in the United States Court of 
Appeals for the appropriate circuit within 60 days from the date 

on which this determination is published in the 

Federal Register

. 
Under section 307(b)(2) of the Act, this determination 

shall not be subject to later judicial review in any civil or 

criminal proceedings for enforcement.

Background Information 



Toxic contaminants in bottom sediments of the nation's lakes, rivers, wetlands, and coastal waters create the potential
for continued environmental impact even where water column contaminant levels comply with established water quality
criteria. In addition, contaminated sediments can have impacts on water quality even when additional pollutants
are no longer being added by any other source. It is intended that sediment quality criteria be protective of benthic
organisms and be used to: Assess the extent of sediment contamination, aid in implementing measures that limit or
prevent additional contamination, and identify when appropriate remediation activities are needed. 

Section 304 (a)(1) of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1314(a)(1)), directs EPA to develop and publish criteria reflecting
the latest scientific knowledge on the identifiable effects of pollutants on public health and welfare, aquatic
life, wildlife and recreation. EPA has periodically issued ambient water quality criteria guidance, beginning
with the publication of ``Water Quality Criteria 1972''. All criteria guidance through late 1986 was summarized
in an EPA document entitled ``Quality Criteria for Water, 1986.'' EPA has subsequently published, from time to time,
new ambient water quality criteria guidance for additional pollutants or revised existing criteria guidance. 


EPA's criteria documents are intended to provide a comprehensive toxicological evaluation of each chemical addressed
therein, based on available information. For toxic pollutants, the documents tabulate the numeric acute and chronic
toxicity information for aquatic life and, where sufficient information is available, derive the numeric criteria
maximum concentrations (acute criteria) and the numeric criteria continuous concentrations (chronic criteria)
that the Agency recommends to protect aquatic life resources. The documents also provide recommended criteria to
protect human health. EPA has published numeric aquatic life criteria for 30 priority pollutants and human health
criteria for 91 priority pollutants. Aquatic life criteria address potential water column impacts only. 

EPA is now proposing sediment quality criteria for five priority pollutant chemicals (endrin, dieldrin, fluoranthene,
phenanthrene, and acenaphthene) that EPA has determined are present in the sediment of the Nation's waters and cause
or have the potential to cause adverse effects to the water column and benthic assemblages and their hierarchical
foodchains including humans. Pursuant to Section 104 of the Clean Water Act, the Agency has conducted research, experiments
and demonstrations and has studied the effects of contaminated sediment on freshwater, marine, and estuarine aquatic
life. EPA used this information to develop the proposed sediment quality criteria, which represent EPA's first effort
to develop sediment quality criteria. These five chemicals were selected because of their known toxicity, hydrophobicity,
and persistence. 


EPA developed the proposed sediment quality criteria using a methodology called the Equilibrium Partitioning Approach
which was selected after considering a variety of approaches that could be used to assess sediment contamination.
Technical reviews of the methodology and supporting science was conducted by the EPA Science Advisory Board (SAB)
in February 1989 and June 1992. 
Data collected in support of the ambient aquatic life water quality criteria or an equivalent data base were also used
to derive the proposed sediment quality criteria. Sediment criteria concentrations are expressed as micrograms
chemical per gram organic carbon and apply to sediments with >/=0.2% organic carbon.

<DOCTITLE>Chase Manhattan Corporation, New York, New York; Application to Engage in Nonbanking Activities</DOCTITLE>


Chase Manhattan Corporation, New York, New York (Applicant), has applied pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the Bank
Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC Act) and  225.23(a)(3) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(3))
to engage 

de novo

 through its wholly owned subsidiary, Chase Securities, Inc., New York, New York (Company), a broker-dealer registered
with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a 

et seq.

), in underwriting and dealing, to a limited extent, in all types of equity securities, including without limitation,
common stock, American Depositary Receipts, Global Depository Receipts, securities convertible into equity securities
and options, and other direct and indirect equity ownership interests in domestic and foreign corporations and other
entities, warrants and other rights issued in connection with the above securities, and securities issued by closed-end
investment companies but not including ownership interests in open-end investment companies. Applicant proposes
to conduct these activities throughout the United States and the world.
Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires
that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine
that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case
that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public
benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects.
A particular activity may be found to meet the closely related to banking test if it is demonstrated that banks have
generally provided the proposed activity; that banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally
similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity; or that banks
generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their provision
in a specialized form. 

National Courier Ass'n v. Board of Governors

, 516 F.2d 1229, 1237 (D.C. Cir. 1975). In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that
the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement
Regarding Regulation Y, 49 FR 806 (January 5, 1984).
The Board previously has approved, by order, underwriting and dealing in, to a limited extent, all types of debt and
equity securities. 

J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated, et al.

, 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 192 (1989) (1989 Section 20 Order), 

as modified by

 Order dated September 21, 1989, 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 751 (1989) (Modification Order) and the Order dated January
4, 1990 (Foreign Bank Order). Applicant has stated that, except as described below, it will conduct the proposed underwriting
and dealing activities using the same methods and procedures, and subject to the same prudential limitations established
by the Board in the 1989 Section 20 Order, as modified by the Modification Order, including the Board's 10 percent revenue
limitation on such activities. For this reason, Applicant contends that approval of the application would not be
barred by section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act (12 U.S.C. 377), which prohibits the affiliation of a state member bank
with any company principally engaged in the underwriting, public sale, or distribution of securities.
Applicant has submitted a request for a confirmation that foreign subsidiaries of Company's bank affiliates are
not subject to the section 20 firewalls relating to personnel interlocks and cross-marketing activities. 

See J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated, et al.

, 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 192, 215 (1989). Applicant argues that the scope of these firewalls should be limited
to U.S. affiliates of section 20 companies and that the extension of these firewalls to the foreign subsidiaries of
Company's bank affiliates is not warranted in light of the regulatory framework applicable to these foreign subsidiaries,
and that to do so would impose serious competitive disadvantages on Applicant. 
Applicant proposes that its subsidiary banks and the direct and indirect broker-dealer subsidiaries of such banks
(including overseas broker-dealer subsidiaries of Edge Act subsidiaries of those banks) act as riskless principal
or broker for customers in buying and selling bank-eligible securities that Company underwrites or deals in and to
market such securities on behalf of Company. Applicant maintains that these activities are consistent with the Board's
determinations in 

BankAmerica Corporation

, 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 1163, 1165 (1993) and 

Chemical Banking Corporation

, 80 Federal Reserve Bulletin 49, 50 n.3 (1994). Applicant otherwise would continue to comply with the Section 20 Firewalls
set forth in 

J.P. Morgan, supra

, as modified subsequently by the Board. 
In order to satisfy the proper incident to banking test, section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act requires the Board to find that
the performance of the activities by Company can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as
greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency that outweigh possible adverse effects, such
as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking
practices. Applicant believes that the proposed activities will benefit the public by promoting competition, lower
financing costs, and more innovative financing. Applicant also believes that approval of this application will
allow Company to provide a wider range of services and added convenience to its customers. Applicant believes that
the proposed activities will not result in any unsound banking practices or other adverse effects.
In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice
of the proposal is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application
and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the
BHC Act.
Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than May 16, 1994. Any request for a hearing
on this application must, as required by  262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be accompanied
by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically
any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating
how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.
This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

AGENCY:

 Center for Mental Health Service, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability of funds and request for applications.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) intends to support one cooperative agreement for a Technical Assistance
Center (hereafter referred to as the TA Center) to provide training and technical assistance in support of the Comprehensive
Community Mental Health Services for Children and Adolescents with Serious Emotional Disturbances Program (Request
for Applications No. SM 93-02 and 94-01) which is part of the CMHS Child, Adolescent, and Family Mental
Health Services Program. The TA Center will provide expert assistance to the eleven current grantees of that initiative,
to the seven to ten new grantees projected for fiscal year (FY) 1994, and to new grantees in future years, as applicable.
Assistance will be provided to grantees in planning, developing, and operating systems of care. This assistance
must be delivered through at least three regional entities that will be organized by the TA Center, and will use the
expertise available among existing Child, Adolescent, and Family Mental Health Services Program grantees to the
maximum extent possible to provide on-site, telephonic, and written consultation. A cooperative agreement is being
used to permit maximum utilization of the knowledge and skills of CMHS staff in the conduct of this project, and to assure
that the activities of the TA Center are appropriately coordinated with related CMHS training, technical assistance,
and evaluation activities as well as with related technical assistance activities of the Annie E. Casey and the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundations' Mental Health Services Initiative for Youth, among others. 



This notice consists of three parts: 



Part I 

covers information on the legislative authority and the applicable regulations and policies related to this CMHS
cooperative agreement program. 



Part II 

describes the programmatic goals, target population, project requirements and discusses eligibility, availability
of funds, period of support and the receipt date for applications.

the administration of grants, are applicable to these awards. 

PHS Grants Policy Statement: Grants must be administered in accordance with the PHS Grants Policy Statement (Rev.
April 1, 1994). 

Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number: The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number for this
program is 93.104. 

Reporting Requirements: Interim and final progress reports and financial status reports will be required and specified
to awardees in accord with PHS Grants Policy requirements.

Promoting Non-use of Tobacco: Studies have clearly established that the use of tobacco products increases mortality
and morbidity, not only for the primary users of these products but for those in close proximity to the user. Statistics
published by the National Cancer Institute indicate that cigarette smoking and chewing of tobacco are responsible
for as many as 1,500 deaths per day in the United States. Recent studies conducted by the Environmental Protection
Agency indicate that prolonged exposure to second-hand smoke significantly increases the probability of developing
heart and lung disease. Therefore, the PHS strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace
and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the
physical and mental health of the American people. 


Part II_Programmatic Goals, Target Population, Project Requirements, Eligibility and Application Receipt Date






Program Goals: 

The primary goal of this cooperative agreement is to support the individual CMHS Comprehensive Community Mental
Health Services for Children and Adolescents with Serious Emotional Disturbance grantees in their efforts to develop
and implement local systems of care that are consonant with the overall program goals. A secondary goal is to serve
the entire field of children's mental health services by developing a variety of practical and needed materials (e.g.,
manuals, monographs) as well as efficient and effective methods for providing training and technical assistance.

These goals are consistent with health care reform initiatives (e.g., providing quality mental health services
and reducing unnecessary inpatient care) and support the Department of Health and Human Services Secretary's themes
of fostering independence through empowering the people, preventing future problems, and improving services to
our customers. 


Target Population: 

The TA Center must make its formal training and technical assistance activities available to CMHS Comprehensive
Community Mental Health Services for Children and Adolescents with Serious Emotional Disturbance grantees and
to any organization participating in activities funded by the grant. Materials developed by the TA Center will be
distributed to a wider audience of child mental health service providers as resources permit. All materials developed
must reflect cultural competencies and be gender appropriate. 


Project requirements: 

The proposals must address in detail the following required activities, including the resources to be expended in
each area: 
 Create at least three organizations in separate regions of the country (hereafter referred to as Hubs) to provide
training, consultation and on-going support (on-site as necessary) to CMHS Comprehensive Community Mental Health
Services for Children and Adolescents with Serious Emotional Disturbance grantees and to any organization participating
in activities funded by the grant to implement a full array of community-based mental health services within an organized
system of care. 
Each Hub will act independently on operational issues while maintaining a close, interdependent relationship with
the other Hubs on strategic and long-term issues. Each Hub will be responsible for training and technical assistance
activities for a defined geographic region and will develop its own network of consultants (although some consultants
may be ``shared'' among the Hubs). In addition, a ``focus area'' will be developed in each Hub that will define, at least
in part, the specific types of expertise that the Hub concentrates on. CMHS strongly encourages applicants to consider
one or more of the following as focus areas: mental health services in rural areas, cultural competence, systems integration,
and clinical services issues. 
Hubs will be located in appropriate geographic settings that will permit them to serve as effective catalysts for
system of care development. Each of the regional Hubs will be expected to develop formal collaborative relationships
with appropriate regional representatives of the other child-serving agencies including child welfare, education,
juvenile justice, and any mental health and public health knowledge synthesis and transfer initiatives in the region.

Hubs must be capable of providing technical assistance, either directly or through consultants, on the entire range
of service issues that grantees are required to address. In addition to the substantive content, the Hubs will also
devote attention to developing community leaders. They will establish mentoring relationships between experts
on a specific issue and their peers who are grappling with similar issues. They will establish on-going connections
with clinical training institutions and will utilize the expertise of senior clinicians connected with such institutions
and programs. 
As part of its training and technical assistance activities provided through the Hubs, the TA Center may also organize
national and/or regional meetings of CMHS Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children and Adolescents
with Serious Emotional Disturbance grantees for training and technical assistance purposes. 
 Develop monographs and other materials related to children's and adolescents' mental health services where
they do not currently exist, and as needed by grantees. 
The TA Center must develop substantive reference and resource materials (e.g., bibliographies, manuals) to facilitate
the cross fertilization of innovative practices throughout the service sites as well as for broader use by the services
community. Plans for reproduction and distribution of such materials should be indicated. 
 Establish a steering committee of external representatives to coordinate TA Center activities with existing
Federal and non-Federal initiatives addressing the mental health needs of children and adolescents as well as any
future private or public efforts in this area.

It is essential that all activities undertaken in this cooperative agreement be carried out with maximum opportunity
for input and participation from representatives of the affected stakeholders. The TA Center must have a steering
committee that will provide advice and consultation in the development of technical assistance strategies, the
establishment of priorities, and the charting of new directions. The committee will be comprised of 12 to 14 members
and meet at least once a year to review TA Center activities and make recommendations regarding strategic directions.
The steering committee will include representatives of the child mental health services grant project directors,
CMHS staff, the project directors from the three CASSP-sponsored TA Centers, recognized experts in the delivery
of mental health services to children and adolescents, representatives of the national family advocacy groups and
other key stakeholders in the public, private, and academic sectors. It will reflect the diverse racial and ethnic
minority groups served by this program, and will contain an appropriate gender balance. The steering committee will
be chaired by the project director of the TA Center who will select members subject to the approval of CMHS program staff.

 Establish an internal governance structure to translate steering committee input into strategic plans for
the central organization and the Hubs. 
The TA Center must have a plan for the organization and management of the TA Center itself and for the organization and
management of the Hubs. An executive committee (or similar entity) must be established by the TA Center to guide the
operations of the Hubs, establish priorities, chart new directions, assure the completion of required tasks, guide
policy development, and process feedback from the field (evaluation) on Hub operations. The CMHS staff collaborator
will be included as a member of this body. 
 Conduct an ongoing formative evaluation of the TA Center's activities with a primary focus on the efficiency
and effectiveness of the regional Hubs. 
The TA Center must conduct an ongoing formative evaluation of its activities. In this context, formative evaluation
means ongoing activities designed to provide information on the program for the primary purpose of improving program
operations and effectiveness. Included should be information on who will conduct evaluation activities, what those
activities will be, and how the results of the evaluation activities will be used to improve services provided. The
activities should include a management information system capable of providing reasonably comprehensive information
on the technical assistance activities of each of the Hubs. 
 Develop a plan for prioritizing activities if resources are not sufficient to meet all requests for technical
assistance. 
At times, the TA Center may be unable to comply with competing requests for technical assistance. Therefore, it must
have a plan for making rational choices between or among competing requests.

<DOCTITLE>Determinations Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance and NAFTA Transitional Adjustment
Assistance</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Labor herein presents summaries
of determinations regarding eligibility to apply for trade adjustment assistance for workers (TA-W) issued
during the period of April, 1994.

In order for an affirmative determination to be made and a certification of eligibility to apply for worker adjustment
assistance to be issued, each of the group eligibility requirements of section 222 of the Act must be met.

(1) That a significant number or proportion of the workers in the workers' firm, or an appropriate subdivision thereof,
have become totally or partially separated,

(2) That sales or production, or both, of the firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely, and

(3) That increases of imports of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by the firm or appropriate
subdivision have contributed importantly to the separations, or threat thereof, and to the absolute decline in sales
or production.

<USDEPT>LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Bylaws of the Legal Services Corporation</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Legal Services Corporation.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the availability of the bylaws of the Legal Services Corporation (LSC or Corporation) and proposes
to amend the provision of the bylaws governing amendments to the bylaws.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 By final rule published elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, the Corporation has withdrawn its bylaws from the Code of Federal Regulations. Copies of the Corporation's bylaws,
however, are available to the public, and may be obtained by submitting a request to: Victor M. Fortuno, General Counsel,
at the address noted.



At the April 16, 1994, meeting of the Corporation's Board of Directors (Board), the Board proposed to delete the following
provision of the bylaws governing publication of proposed amendments to the bylaws:




Whenever feasible, the proposed amendment [to the bylaws] shall have been published in the 

Federal Register

 at least thirty (30) days before the meeting [at which the action to amend the bylaws is taken] and interested parties
shall have been afforded a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon.




The Corporation's bylaws are purely internal procedural rules governing the Board and the officers and employees
of the Corporation. As such, the bylaws are rules of organization and procedure which do not affect the rights and interests
of parties outside the Corporation. Therefore, the bylaws are not subject to the notice and comment and/or publication
requirements of the LSC Act, 42 U.S.C. 2996g(e), and are not of sufficient interest to the public to otherwise require
that a notice and comment and/or publication procedure be followed prior to their amendment.

Furthermore, in order to proceed with the process of updating the Corporation's bylaws, the Board believes that prompt
consideration of this proposed amendment is important and desirable. Thus, the Board has deemed it necessary to act
on the proposed amendment at the next Board meeting, scheduled for May 14, 1994. Publication of this notice of proposed
amendment 30 days prior to Board consideration would, therefore, not be feasible. The Board believes, however, that
since the proposed amendment affects a single provision of the bylaws in a very straightforward manner, a shorter
notice period provides an ample and reasonable opportunity for comment by any interested members of the public.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Sierra Nuclear Corporation; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption to Sierra
Nuclear Corporation (SNC) (formerly Pacific Sierra Nuclear Associates), located in Roswell, Georgia, to fabricate
(but not use) a modified version of its NRC-approved Ventilated Storage Casks (VSC-24). These modified casks
are intended to be used by Entergy Operations, Inc. (Entergy) to store spent fuel at its Arkansas Nuclear One (ANO)
plant (Docket Nos. 50-313/368, License Nos. DPR-51/ NPF6) located near Russellville, Arkansas.


Environmental Assessment


Identification of Proposed Action


The request, proposed by SNC letter dated January 24, 1994, would exempt SNC from the requirements of 10 CFR 72.234(c),
which states that ``Fabrication of casks under the Certificate of Compliance must not start prior to receipt of the
Certificate of Compliance for the cask model.'' Specifically, SNC proposed to fabricate the first fourteen (14)
casks prior to the Commission's issuance of a revised Certificate of Compliance. The Commission is considering granting
the exemption for four (4) casks and deferring action with respect to the remaining ten (10) casks. Granting the exemption
at this time for fabrication of four (4) casks would readily enable ANO to proceed with activities to support its scheduled
plant outages. The proposed exemption for fabrication would not authorize use of the casks to store spent fuel.


The Need for the Proposed Action


SNC's request for exemption is to ensure the availability of storage casks for planned loading in October 1994, in
order to support ANO's upcoming refueling outages. SNC has indicated that in order to meet this schedule, purchase
of the cask components and materials must begin promptly and fabrication must commence thereafter. The application
for a revised Certificate of Compliance for the VSC-24, dated June 14, 1993, is being considered by the Commission.
Procurement, fabrication, and construction activities by SNC under the exemption would be entirely at SNC's own
risk. Favorable NRC action on the exemption request shall not be construed as an NRC commitment to favorably consider
SNC's application for a revised certificate, or to approve SNC's modified proposed design for the VSC-24. SNC
would bear the risk of any activities conducted under the exemption, including the risk of modification of the casks,
if necessary, in light of NRC's forthcoming action on SNC's application and proposed design.


Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action


The Commission has evaluated the environmental impacts of the proposed action, which is limited to fabrication only
and would not authorize any action with respect to use of the casks to store spent fuel. The NRC reviewed the VSC-24
design Final Safety Analysis Report (SAR), and on April 28, 1993, issued a Safety Evaluation Report (SER) approving
the SAR, and on May 3, 1993, issued a Certificate of Compliance for use of the VSC-24 under a general license. As
a result of this SAR review and approval, SNC has an NRC-approved quality assurance program under which the VSCs can
be fabricated. SNC has developed procurement and fabrication specifications under this approved QA program, which
will be used to control procurement and fabrication activities related to construction of these casks. Environmental
impact from the limited fabrication activities would be similar to small concrete construction activities at an
existing facility and similar to the assembly of metal components at a large machine shop. The environmental assessments
for the Proposed Rule (54 FR 19397) and Final Rule (55 FR 29181), ``Storage of Spent Fuel in NRC-approved Storage Casks
at Power Reactor Sites,'' and Final Rule (58 FR 19849), ``List of Approved Spent Fuel Storage Casks: Additions'' considered
the environmental impact associated with the construction and use of such certified casks and concluded that these
activities would have no significant impact on the environment. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that the
exemption to fabricate (but not use) the limited number of casks, will have no significant radiological or nonradiological
environmental impacts.


Alternative to the Proposed Action


The alternative would be to deny the requested exemption. This would result potentially in the loss of lead time for
procurement and fabrication necessary for the availability of casks intended for Entergy, and could thereby cause
disruptions in planned activities for a series of plant outages beginning in 1995.


Agencies and Persons Consulted


The Commission's staff reviewed SNC's request and did not consult other agencies or persons.


Finding of No Significant Impact


Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action would not
have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not
to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption.
For further details with respect to this action, the request for exemption dated January 24, 1994, and other documents
are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20555, and the Local Public Document Room at the Tomlinson Library (Depository), Arkansas Tech
University, Russellville, Arkansas 72801.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

The following information is provided concerning the topics to be discussed at the meeting:





Efficacy of Quality Assurance Requirements for Brachytherapy: 

The NRC staff will provide a discussion of the possible need for QA requirements to be included in 10 CFR 35.400, use
of sources for brachytherapy, similar to those included in 10 CFR 35.600 for teletherapy. 



National Academy of Science Presentation: 

The National Academy of Science will brief the ACMUI on the progress of the contract to perform an independent review
of the NRC's medical use regulatory program. 



NUREG: ``Management of Radioactive Material Programs at Medical Facilities.'': 

The NRC staff will discuss the progress on the Draft NUREG since the last ACMUI meeting. Included will be the comments
received during the recent peer review, and plans for publication. 



Inadvertent administration to the wrong patient: 

The staff will seek comments regarding reporting of the inadvertent administration of byproduct material to the
wrong patient or individual when the dose does not meet the criteria for a misadministration.



American Osteopathic Board of Radiology Certification (AOBR): 

The staff will provide the AOBR certification requirements for ACMUI review to determine ACMUI's recommendation
as to whether AOBR certified individuals meet the criteria specified in 10 CFR 35.930.

Status reports on proposed rulemaking:



Proposed Amendments to 10 CFR 35.75, Release of patients containing radiopharmaceuticals or permanent implants:


The staff will provide a status report regarding proposed rulemaking in response to three petitions for rulemaking,
one from Carol Marcus, M.D. (February 6, 1991); and two from the American College of Nuclear Medicine (January 14,
1992, and April 21, 1992), regarding criteria for the release of patients administered byproduct material. 



Proposed Amendments on Preparation, Transfer, and Use of Byproduct Material for Medical Use: 

In June 1989, the American College of Nuclear Physicians and Society of Nuclear Medicine (ACNP/SNM) filed a petition
with NRC addressing five issues relating to the preparation and use of radiopharmaceuticals. A proposed rule was
published for public comment (58 FR 33396; June 17, 1993). The staff has considered comments on the proposed rule and
expects to submit the final rule to the Commission for approval by June 1994. 



Administration of Byproduct Material or Radiation from Byproduct Material to Patients Who May Be Pregnant or Nursing;
Pregnancy and Breast-feeding: 

The staff will provide a status report on issues and recommendations concerning unintended radiation doses or dosages
to an embryo, fetus, or nursing infant, resulting from administration of radiopharmaceuticals or radiation to pregnant
or breast-feeding patients.

<DOCTITLE>Carolina Power & Light Co., Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 & 2; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment
to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity
for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating
License Nos. DPR-71 and DPR-62 issued to Carolina Power & Light Company (the licensee) for operation
of the Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, located in Brunswick County, North Carolina.

The proposed amendment would relocate the instrument response time tables 3.3.1-2, Reactor Protection System
(RPS) Response Times; 3.3.2-3, Isolation System Instrumentation (ISI) Response Time; and 3.3.3-3,
Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) Response Times, from the Technical Specifications to the Updated Final Safety
Analysis Report (FSAR). The RPS, ISI, and ECCS instrument Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCO) will be reviewed
to read that the instruments ``shall be operable'' without a reference to a specific response time table in these LCOs.
The references to the response time tables will also be deleted from the Surveillance Requirements.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:




1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. Relocating the instrument response time tables to the Updated FSAR is an administrative change
which in no way affects the design or operation of equipment that could initiate or mitigate any accident previously
evaluated.

2. The proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. This amendment is involves [sic] administratively relocating the response time testing
to the Updated FSAR. The amendment would not affect the operation or design of the plant equipment; therefore, no new
credible accidents are created. In addition, the proposed amendment would not affect the capability of the response
systems to mitigate the consequences of any accident previously evaluated; therefore, no new or different accident
would result from this change.

3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The amendment would allow
increases to administratively control changes to response time limits for the involved instrumentation under the
provisions of 10 CFR 50.59 and existing Section 6 Administrative Technical Specifications. No safety limits are
affected by this change. Therefore, the amendment would not result in a reduction in any margin of safety.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to room 6/D/22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555.
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
By May 26, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, William Madison
Randall Library, 601 S. College Road, Wilmington, North Carolina 28403-3297. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an
appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity
the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.
The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference
to the following factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding;
(2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the
possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should
also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene.
Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without
requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but
such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. Not later than 15 days prior
to the first prehearing conference schedule in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition
to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention
must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner
shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert
opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing.
The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware
and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

<DOCTITLE>Entergy Operations, Inc.; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant
Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF-47 issued to Entergy Operations, Inc. (the licensee) for operation of the River Bend Station,
Unit 1, located in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana.

The proposed amendment would revise various instrumentation technical specifications by extending the allowable
outage times (AOTs) of the instruments, and by increasing their channel functional surveillance test intervals
(STIs) to quarterly. The amendment also revises certain technical specification actions to address loss-of-function
concerns associated with the AOT and STI changes.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:



Reactor Protection System (RPS)



1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

These proposed changes do not involve a change to the plant design or operation, they simply involve the frequency
at which testing of the RPS instrumentation is performed and the allowable outage time (AOT) for instruments. Failure
of the RPS instrumentation itself cannot create an accident. As a result, these proposed changes cannot increase
the probability of occurrence of any design basis accident previously evaluated.

As identified in NEDC-30851P, these proposed changes increase the average RPS failure frequency from 4.6 x 10

^6

/year to 5.4 x 10

^6

/year. This increase (8 x 10

^7

/year) is considered to be insignificant. As identified in the NRC Staff's Safety Evaluation Report of NEDC-30851P,
this increase in average RPS failure frequency would contribute to a very small increase in core-melt frequency.
The small increase in average RPS failure frequency is offset by safety benefits such as a reduction in the number of
inadvertent test-induced scrams, a reduction in wear due to excessive equipment test cycling, and better optimization
of plant personnel resources. Hence, the net change in risk resulting from these proposed changes would be insignificant.
Therefore, these proposed changes do not result in a significant increase in either the probability or the consequences
of any accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The proposed changes do not result in any change to the plant design or operation, only to the AOT and frequency at which
testing of the RPS instrumentation is performed. Since failure of the RPS instrumentation itself cannot create an
accident, these proposed changes can at most affect only accidents which have been previously evaluated. Therefore,
these proposed changes cannot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
As identified above, these proposed changes increase the average RPS failure frequency from 4.6x10

^6

/year to 5.4x10

^6

/year. The NRC Staff's Safety Evaluation Report of NEDC-30851P concluded that this small average RPS failure
frequency increase would contribute to a very small increase in core-melt frequency. This small increase in average
RPS failure frequency would be offset by safety benefits such as a reduction in the number of inadvertent test-induced
scrams, a reduction on wear due to excessive equipment test cycling, and better optimization of plant personnel resources.
Hence, the net change in risk resulting from these proposed changes would be insignificant. In addition, RBS has confirmed
that the proposed changes to the functional test intervals will not result in excessive instrument drift relative
to the current established setpoints. Therefore, these proposed changes do not result in a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. 


Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) 


1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
These proposed changes do not involve a change to the plant design or operation, they simply involve the frequency
at which testing of the ECCS actuation Instrumentation is performed and the allowable outage time (AOT) for instruments.
Failure of the ECCS actuation instrumentation itself cannot create an accident. As a result, these proposed changes
cannot increase the probability of occurrence of any design basis accident previously evaluated. 
As identified in NEDC-30936P (Part 2), these proposed changes increase the calculated average water injection
failure frequency from 1.952x10

^5

 to 1.992x10

^5

 per year for Case 5B and from 1.386x10

^4

 to 1.401x10

^4

 per year for Case 5C. This represents an increase of 4x10

^7

 for Case 5B (2.0%) and 1.5x10

^6

 for Case 5C (1.1%), which are well within the acceptance criteria (4%) provided in NEDC-30936P (Part 2). The
small increase in average water injection failure frequency is offset by safety benefits such as a reduction in the
number of inadvertent test-induced scrams, a reduction in wear due to excessive equipment test cycling, and better
optimization of plant personnel resources. Hence, the net change in risk resulting from these proposed changes would
be insignificant. Therefore, these proposed changes do not result in a significant increase in either the probability
or the consequences of any accident previously evaluated. 
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The proposed changes do not result in any change to the plant design or operation, only to the AOT and frequency at which
testing of the ECCS actuation instrumentation is performed. Since failure of the ECCS actuation instrumentation
itself cannot create an accident, these proposed changes can at most affect only accidents which have been previously
evaluated. Therefore, these proposed changes cannot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any accident previously evaluated. 
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
As identified above, these proposed changes increase the calculated average water injection failure frequency
from 1.952x10

^5

 to 1.992x10

^5

 per year for Case 5B and from 1.386x10

^4

 to 1.401x10

^4

 per year for Case 5C. This increase is well within the acceptance criteria found acceptable in the NRC Staff's Safety
Evaluation Report for NEDC-30936P (Part 2). This small increase in average ECCS actuation failure frequency
would be offset by safety benefits such as a reduction in the number of inadvertent test-induced scrams, a reduction
on wear due to excessive equipment test cycling, and better optimization of plant personnel resources. Hence, the
net change in risk resulting from these proposed changes would be insignificant. In addition, RBS has confirmed that
the proposed changes to the functional test intervals will not result in excessive instrument drift relative to the
current, established setpoints. Therefore, the proposed changes do not result in a significant reduction in a margin
of safety. 


Control Rod Block Instrumentation


1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
These proposed changes do not involve a change to the plant design or operation, only the Allowable Outage Time (AOT)
and frequency at which testing of the Control Rod Block Instrumentation is performed. Failure of the Control Rod Block
instrumentation itself cannot create an accident. As a result, these proposed changes cannot increase the probability
of occurrence of any design basis accident previously evaluated.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940426-2-00087 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940426-2-00057 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

As identified in NEDC-30851P, Supplement 1, these proposed changes increase the average Control Rod Block
failure frequency less than 0.06%. As provided in the NRC Staff's Safety Evaluation Report of NEDC-30851P,
Supplement 1, this increase is very slight and is offset by the safety benefits associated with the proposed changes
to the RPS and Control Rod Block Instrumentation. As a result, the combined effect of the changes proposed for the RPS
and Control Rod Block Instrumentation requirements should result in an overall improvement in plant safety. Therefore,
these proposed changes do not result in a significant increase in either the probability or the consequences of any
accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The proposed changes do not result in any change to the plant design or operation, only to the AOT and frequency at which
testing of the Control Rod Block instrumentation is performed. Since failure of the Control Rod Block instrumentation
itself cannot create an accident, these proposed changes can at most affect only accidents which have been previously
evaluated. Therefore, these proposed changes cannot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any accident previously evaluated.

3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

As identified above, these proposed changes increase the average Control Rod Block failure frequency less than 0.06%.
This increase is very slight and is offset by the safety benefits associated with the proposed changes to the RPS and
Control Rod Block Instrumentation. As a result, the combined effect of the changes proposed for the RPS and Control
Rod Block Instrumentation requirements should result in an overall improvement in plant safety. In addition, RBS
has confirmed that the proposed changes to the functional test intervals will not result in excessive instrument
drift relative to the current, established setpoints. Therefore, the proposed changes do not result in a significant
reduction in a margin of safety.



Isolation Actuation Instrumentation



1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

These proposed changes do not involve a change to the plant design or operation, only the Allowable Outage Time (AOT)
and frequency at which testing of the Isolation Actuation instrumentation is performed. Failure of the Isolation
Actuation instrumentation itself cannot create an accident. As a result, these proposed changes cannot increase
the probability of occurrence of any design basis accident previously evaluated.

As identified in NEDC-30851P, Supplement 2, these proposed changes to the surveillance test interval requirements
for the Isolation Actuation instruments which are common to RPS or ECCS have a negligible (less than 1%) impact on the
average isolation unavailability when combined with the individual valve failure probability, and that the changes
to the AOTs has [have] less than a 2% impact. The analyses demonstrate that the individual valve failure probabilities
dominate the overall isolation failure probability. As provided in the NRC Staff's Safety Evaluation Report of NEDC-30851P,
Supplement 2, these proposed changes would have a very small impact on plant risk. As a result, overall plant safety
is not reduced by these proposed changes.

As identified in NEDC-31677P, the proposed changes to the requirements for Isolation Actuation instrumentation
not common to RPS or ECCS result in a small decrease of 1.97x10

-8

/year in the average isolation failure frequency. As identified in the NRC Staff's Safety Evaluation Report of NEDC-31677P,
the NRC agreed that these proposed changes are acceptable because the failure frequency impact is minimal. As a result,
overall plant safety is not reduced by these proposed changes.

The small increase in the average failure frequency of the instruments common to RPS or ECCS due to the proposed changes
to the Isolation Actuation instrumentation requirements is offset by safety benefits such as a reduction on the number
of inadvertent test-induced scrams and engineered safety feature actuations, a reduction in wear due to excessive
test cycling, and better optimization of plant personnel resources. Hence, the net change in risk resulting from
these proposed changes would be insignificant. Therefore, these proposed changes do not result in a significant
increase in either the probability or the consequences of any accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The proposed changes do not result in any change to the plant design or operation, only to the AOT and frequency at which
testing of the Isolation Actuation instrumentation is performed. Since failure of the Isolation Actuation instrumentation
itself cannot create an accident, these proposed changes can at most affect only accidents which have been previously
evaluated.

Therefore, these proposed changes cannot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.


3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.


As identified above, the proposed changes to the requirements for Isolation Actuation instruments common to RPS
or ECCS have a negligible impact on the average isolation unavailability when combined with the individual valve
failure probability. The analyses demonstrate that the individual valve failure probabilities dominate the overall
isolation failure probability.


The proposed changes to the requirements for Isolation Actuation instruments not common to RPS or ECCS decrease their
average isolation failure frequency approximately 1.97x10

^8

/year.


The small increase in average Isolation Actuation instrumentation failure frequency of the instruments common
to RPS or ECCS are offset by the safety benefits such as a reduction on the number of inadvertent test-induced scrams
and engineered safety feature actuations, a reduction in wear due to excessive test cycling, and better optimization
of plant personnel resources. As a result, the NRC Staff's Safety Evaluation Reports for these BWROG report concluded
that these proposed changes would have a very small impact on plant risk. In addition, RBS has confirmed that the proposed
changes to the functional test intervals will not result in excessive instrument drift relative to the current, established
setpoints. Therefore, the proposed changes do not result in a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



Other Technical Specification Instrumentation




1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.


These proposed changes do not involve a change to the plant design or operation, only the Allowable Outage Time (AOT)
and frequency at which testing of the associated instrumentation is performed. These instruments are designed to
mitigate the consequences of previously analyzed accidents. Failure of these instruments cannot increase, and
is independent of, the probability of occurrence of such accidents. As a result, these proposed changes cannot increase
the probability of any accident previously evaluated. As identified in GENE-770-06-01, although
not specifically analyzed, these proposed changes are bounded by the results of the analyses discussed in Parts I
through IV of this request. Such analyses have shown that the safety function failure frequency is not significantly
impacted by similar proposed changes. In addition, any increase in the probability of failure of these instruments
to perform their required functions would be offset by safety benefits such as a reduction in the number of inadvertent
test-induced scrams and engineered safety features actuations, a reduction in wear due to excessive equipment test
cycling, and better optimization of plant personnel resources. Therefore, these proposed changes do not result
in a significant increase in the probability or the consequences of any accident previously evaluated

2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The proposed changes do not result in any change to the plant design or operation, only to the AOT and frequency at which
testing of the associated instrumentation is performed. As a result, these proposed changes can at most affect only
accidents which have been previously evaluated. Therefore, these proposed changes cannot create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.


3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.


As identified in GENE-770-06-01, although not specifically analyzed, these proposed changes
are bounded by the results of the analyses discussed in Parts I through IV of this request. Such analyses have shown
that the safety function failure frequency is not significantly impacted by similar proposed changes. In addition,
any increase in the probability of failure of these instruments to perform their required functions would be offset
by safety benefits such as a reduction in the number of inadvertent test-induced scrams and engineered safety features
actuations, a reduction in wear due to excessive equipment test cycling, and better optimization of plant personnel
resources. As a result, these proposed changes will reduce overall plant risk. In addition, RBS has confirmed that
the proposed changes to the functional test intervals will not result in excessive instrument drift relative to the
current, established setpoints. Therefore, these proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin
of safety.



Technical Specification Changes Relating to Loss-of-Function Issues


1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

The proposed changes associated with the ``loss-of-function'' checks ensure a plant configuration which would
have the capability to automatically actuate the respective system/valve(s). These instruments are designated
to mitigate the consequences of previously analyzed accidents. Failure of these instruments cannot increase, and
is independent of, the probability of occurrence of such accidents. As a result, the proposed changes cannot increase
the probability of any accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes do not involve a change to the plant design
or operation and do not degrade the capability of the system(s) to perform its required function. Further, these functions
or tripped channel(s) in an isolation logic are not considered as initiators for any accidents previously analyzed.
Therefore, these changes do not significantly increase the consequences of any accident previously evaluated.


2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.


The proposed changes do not result in any change to the plant design and no new mode of plant operation is introduced.
As a result, the proposed changes can at most affect only accidents which have been previously evaluated. Therefore,
the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 

3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 

The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety since the required safety function
of the inoperable channel(s) will be fulfilled. The allowable Outage Time (AOT) for several trip functions have been
increased but only in conjunction with the incorporation of the loss-of-function check which ensures a plant configuration
which would have the capability to automatically actuate the respective system/valve(s). Therefore, the proposed
changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

 


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration. 

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the

The filing requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By May 26, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Government Documents Department, Louisiana State University,
Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70803. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date,
the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on
the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice
of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding and (3) the possible effect of
any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the
specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.

If the final determination is that the amendment requests involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to William D. Beckner, Director, Project Directorate IV-1: petitioner's
name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of the 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Mark J. Wetterhahn, Esq., Winston & Strawn, 1400 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005,
attorney for the licensee.

Nontimely filings of petitioners for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(l)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated January 14, 1994, which is
available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Government Documents Department, Louisiana

<DOCTITLE>Pendency of Request for Exemption From the Bond Escrow Requirement Relating to the Sale of Assets by an Employer who
Contributes to a Multiemployer Plan; Home Team Limited Partnership</DOCTITLE>

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of pendency of request.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice advises interested persons that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has received a request from
The Home Team Limited Partnership for an exemption from the bond/escrow requirement of section 4204(a)(1)(B) of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, with respect to the Major League Baseball Players
Benefit Plan. Section 4204(a)(1) provides that the sale of assets by an employer that contributes to a multiemployer
pension plan will not result in a complete or partial withdrawal from the plan if certain conditions are met. One of
these conditions is that the purchaser post a bond or deposit money in escrow for the five-plan-year period beginning
after the sale. The PBGC is authorized to grant individual and class exemptions from this requirement. Before granting
an exemption the PBGC is required to give interested persons an opportunity to comment on the exemption request. The
purpose of this notice is to advise interested persons of the exemption request and solicit their views on it.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background





Section 4202 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multiemployer Pension Plan
Amendments Act of 1980 (``ERISA'' or ``the Act''), provides that a bona fide arm's-length sale of assets of a contributing
employer to an unrelated party will not be considered a withdrawal if three conditions are met. These conditions,
enumerated in section 4204(a)(1)(A)-(C), are that_

(A) The purchaser has an obligation to contribute to the plan with respect to the operations for substantially the
same number of contribution base units for which the seller was obligated to contribute;

(B) The purchaser obtains a bond or places an amount in escrow, for a period of five plan years after the sale, in an amount
equal to the greater of the seller's average required annual contribution to the plan for the three plan years preceding
the year in which the sale occurred or the seller's required annual contribution for the plan year preceding the year
in which the sale occurred (the amount of the bond or escrow is doubled if the plan is in reorganization in the year in
which the sale occurred); and

(C) The contract of sale provides that if the purchaser withdraws from the plan within the first five plan years beginning
after the sale and fails to pay any of its liability to the plan, the seller shall be secondarily liable for the liability
if (the seller) would have had but for section 4204.

The bond or escrow described above would be paid to the plan if the purchaser withdraws from the plan or fails to make
any required contributions to the plan within the first five plan years beginning after the sale.

Additionally, section 4204(b)(1) provides that if a sale of assets is covered by section 4204, the purchaser assumes
by operation of law the contribution record of the seller for the plan year in which the sale occurred and the preceding
four plan years.

Section 4204(c) of ERISA authorizes the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') to grant individual or
class variances or exemptions from the purchaser's bond/escrow requirement of section 4204(a)(1)(B) when warranted.
The legislative history of section 4204 indicates a Congressional intent that the sales rules be administered in
a manner that assures protection of the plan with the least practicable intrusion into normal business transactions.
Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 96th Cong., 2nd Sess., S. 1076, The Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments
Act of 1980: Summary and Analysis of Considerations 16 (Comm. Print, April 1980); 128 Cong. Rec. S10117 (July 29, 1980).
The granting of an exemption or variance from the bond/escrow requirement does not constitute a finding by the PBGC
that a particular transaction satisfies the other requirements of section 4204(a)91). Such questions are to be decided
by the plan sponsor in the first instance, and any disputes are to be resolved in arbitration. 29 U.S.C. 1382, 1399,
1401.

Under the PBGC's regulation on variances for sales of assets (29 CFR part 2643), a request for a variance or waiver of
the bond/escrow requirement under any of the tests established in the regulation (29 CFR 2643.12-2643.14)
is to be made to the plan in question. The PBGC will consider waiver requests only when the request is not based on satisfaction
of one of the four regulatory tests or when the parties assert that the financial information necessary to show satisfaction
of one of the regulatory tests is privileged or confidential financial information within the meaning of 5 U.S.C.
552(b)(4) (the Freedom of Information Act).

Under section 2643.3 of the regulation, the PBGC shall approve a request for a variance or exemption if it determines
that approval of the request is warranted, in that it_

(1) Would more effectively or equitably carry out the purposes of Title IV of the Act; and

(2) Would not significantly increase the risk of financial loss to the plan.

Section 4204(c) of ERISA and  2643.3(b) of the regulation require the PBGC to publish a notice of the pendency
of a request for a variance or exemption in the 

Federal Register

, and to provide interested parties with an opportunity to comment on the proposed variance or exemption.



The Request



The PBGC has received a request from The Home Team Limited Partnership (``the Buyer'') for an exemption from the bond/escrow
requirement of section 4204(a)(1)(B) with respect to its purchase of The Orioles, Inc. (``the Seller'') on October
4, 1993. In support of the request, the Buyer represents among other things that:

1. The Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan (the ``Plan'') was established and is maintained pursuant to a collective
bargaining agreement between professional major league baseball teams and the Major League Baseball Players Association.

2. The Seller was a participating employer in the Plan.

3. The major league clubs have established the Major Leagues Central Fund (the ``Central Fund'') pursuant to the ``Major
League Agreement in re Major Leagues Central Fund.'' Under this agreement, contributions to the Plan for all participating
employers are paid by the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball from the Central Fund on behalf of each participating
employer in satisfaction of the employer's contribution obligation arising under the Plan's funding agreement.
The monies in the Central Fund are derived directly from (i) gate receipts from All-Star games, (ii) radio and television
revenues from World Series, League Championships, intradivision play-offs and All-Star games, and (iii) certain
other radio and television revenues from regular and exhibition games, including revenues from foreign broadcasts.

4. For the Plan year ended March 31, 1993, the Central Fund contributed approximately $34.1 million to the Plan on behalf
of the Clubs; 1/26 of that amount represented contributions paid on behalf of the Seller.

5. The Buyer and the Seller entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement for the Buyer to purchase substantially all of
the assets and assume substantially all of the liabilities of the Seller relating to the business employing the employees
covered by the Plan. The final closing of the transaction occurred on October 4, 1993 (the ``Closing'').

<PARENT> FR940426-2-00058 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

6. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Buyer assumed the obligation to contribute to the Plan for substantially
the same number of contribution base units as the Seller was obligated to contribute to the Plan.



7. The Asset Purchase Agreement further provided that:




[I]f the Buyer thereafter, but prior to the end of the fifth plan year commencing after Closing, partially or completely
withdraws from the Plan, Seller shall be and remain secondarily liable for any withdrawal liability it would have
had to the Plan but for the operation of ERISA section 4204.








8. The amount of the bond/escrow that would be required under section 4204 (a)(1)(B) of ERISA beginning as of April
1, 1994, is $1,401,449, and the estimated amount of the withdrawal liability that the Seller would incur if not for
section 4204 is $7,672,235.




9. In support of the waiver request the Buyer states that:




The Plan is funded directly from the Revenues which are paid from the Central Fund directly to the [Plan's] Trust without
first passing through the hands of any of the Employers. Therefore, the Plan enjoys a substantial degree of security
. . . . A change in ownership of an Employer does not affect the obligation . . .
to fund the Plan . . . . Nor does a change in ownership in any way create the possibility that there
will be difficulty in collecting Plan contributions due from any new Employer.







10. The Buyer has sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, a complete copy of the request to the Plan and the
collective bargaining representative.




Comments




All interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the pending exemption request to the above address.
All comments will be made a part of the record. Comments received, as well as the relevant non-confidential information
submitted in support of the request, will be available for public inspection at the address set forth above.




Issued at Washington, DC, on this 20th day of April, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to Amendments
to its Listing Fee Schedule for Listed Companies </DOCTITLE>


April 19, 1994.


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on March 8, 1994, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 


The PSE is proposing to make certain changes to its Listing Fee Schedule for listed companies. The Fee Schedule is proposed
to be amended as follows:






II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the fee
increase and discussed any comments it received on the fee increase. The text of these statements may be examined at
the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements. 


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


(1) Purpose


The exchange is proposing to amend its fees for listed companies. Specifically, the Exchange is proposing, first,
to increase its original listing fee for the common stock of exclusively listed companies from $10,000 to $20,000.
Second, the Exchange is proposing to increase its initial processing fee, applicable to all original listing applications,
from $250 to $500. Third, the Exchange is proposing to increase its annual maintenance fee for exclusively listed
companies from $1,000 to $2,000. 
The Exchange is proposing these changes in order to offset rising costs associated with maintaining listing services
and related overhead expenses. 


(2) Statutory Basis


The Exchange believes that the proposed fee increases are consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(4) in particular in that they are intended to assure the equitable allocation of reasonable
dues, fees, and other charges among members, issuers, and other persons using the Exchange's facilities. 


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or others.


No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the fee increase. 


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:
(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or 
(B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Participants Trust Company; Filing of Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Eligibility
of Certain Securities Guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association </DOCTITLE>



April 19, 1994.





Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on April 4, 1994, the Participants Trust Company (``PTC'') filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change (File No. SR-PTC-94-01) as described
in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by the self-regulatory organization. On April
15, 1994, PTC filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.






I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 



The proposed rule change will allow PTC to designate certain securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage
Association (``GNMA'') as ``eligible securities'' as permitted by Article I, Rule 2 of PTC's Rules (``GNMA Securities'').







II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. 



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




The purpose of the proposed rule change is to allow PTC to designate certain securities guaranteed by GNMA as eligible
securities as permitted by Article I, Rule 2 of PTC's Rules. PTC currently acts as depository for single-class GNMA
I and GNMA II mortgage-backed securities (``MBS'') and REMIC securities
 guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (``VA'').

1. Current GNMA Programs



GNMA is a wholly-owned corporate instrumentality of the United States within the Department of Housing and Urban
Development (``HUD''). Through its single-class CNMA I and GNMA II MBS programs, GNMA guarantees the timely payment
of principal and interest on securities issued by private institutions and backed by pools of federally insured or
guaranteed mortgage loans. The GNMA guarantee is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.

Each issue of GNMA I and GNMA II MBS has a single class of securities with one coupon rate and scheduled maturity. Annual
volume of new GNMA guaranteed single-class MBS over the past four years has been approximately $65 billion in fiscal
1990, $63 billion in fiscal 1991, $72 billion in fiscal 1992, and $143 billion in fiscal 1993. Over 97% of this volume
represents pools of single-family mortgage loans and, of this, over 86% are GNMA I MBS.






2. Proposed GNMA REMIC Program



GNMA is now establishing a GNMA REMIC program under which GNMA will guarantee multi-class securities issued by REMIC
trusts. The GNMA REMIC securities will be issued through single-purpose trusts created by GNMA-approved sponsors
which will assemble GNMA-guaranteed single-class mortgage-backed securities to constitute the corpus of the REMIC
trust. The sponsors will be private-sector entities such as investment bankers.

The Federal National Mortgage Association (``FNMA'') and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (``FHLMC'')
currently issue REMIC securities that are backed by GNMA MBS, in addition to a substantial volume of REMIC issues backed
by their own collateral. Upon issuance, the General Counsel of HUD will render an opinion that GNMA's obligations
under the GNMA guarantee of its REMIC securities will constitute absolute and unconditional general obligations
of the United States, for which the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged.

The authorizing Federal statute
 provides that the GNMA REMIC program be implemented by GNMA's publication of a notice in the 

Federal Register

, and that GNMA subsequently publish regulations within twelve months of the publication of the initial notice, based
upon the comments received and the experience of GNMA in carrying out the program.





GNMA will implement its REMIC program in two stages. During the initial stage, GNMA will restrict participation in
the REMIC program to a small number of participants (consisting of sponsors, co-sponsors, trustees, trust counsel,
and accounting firms) and a limited number of REMIC issuances. The initial stage will commence upon the closing of
the first transaction, after publication of the notice in the 

Federal Register

, and is expected to last several months, during which time GNMA will establish standard documentation, and guidelines
and procedures applicable to the full implementation of the REMIC program.






GNMA has retained Kenneth Leventhal & Company as its financial advisor and Hunton & Williams as its legal
advisor in implementing the REMIC program, and is currently engaged in approving the initial program participants.
After the initial stage, GNMA anticipates that it will publish a REMIC Guide containing program requirements and
standardized documents as it does for its MBS programs.

While GNMA has not yet determined the characteristics of the GNMA REMIC tranches, for processing purposes it is assumed
that the GNMA REMIC classes will have the same basic processing requirements as the VA REMICs, which PTC has had on deposit
for approximately the last two years. It is assumed that, as in the case with the VA REMIC securities, all classes of
the GNMA REMIC securities except the residual class will be established and maintained in book-entry form through
the facilities of PTC, although holders will have the right to request certificated securities.

<TEXT>
 

REMIC issuances will be limited during the initial stage of the program. Once the REMIC program is fully established,
however, GNMA anticipates that a substantial percentage of its annual production of GNMA single-class securities
will be securitized by GNMA REMICs, resulting in perhaps 100 or more REMIC transactions per year.



3. PTC as GNMA REMIC Depository



GNMA has requested that PTC serve as custodian of the new GNMA REMIC security and is designating PTC as depository for
the GNMA REMIC securities. PTC currently acts as depository for the GNMA I and GNMA II securities and for VA REMIC securities.

It is anticipated that each class of the GNMA REMIC securities will be issued initially in the form of one or more physical
certificates registered in the name of the Mortgage Backed Securities Clearing Corporation, nominee for PTC, and
held in physical form by PTC's custodian, with participants receiving and delivering REMIC securities by book-entry
on PTC's books. REMIC securities may be held subsequent to original issuance in either certificated form, outside
of PTC, or on PTC's book-entry system, as is currently the case with the GNMA I and GNMA II single-class MBS and the VA
REMIC securities on deposit at PTC. PTC's current custody agreement with its custodian, Chemical Bank, accommodates
the deposit of GNMA REMIC securities with the custodian.

The REMIC securities will be supported entirely by the cash flows on the underlying GNMA-guaranteed GNMA I MBS. REMIC
trustees will be required to pay principal and interest (``P&I'') on the REMIC securities in same day funds on
the 16th day of the month, or the first business day thereafter if the 16th is not a business day. REMIC P&I will therefore
be paid to REMIC holders on the same day that the P&I on the underlying MBS is paid to MBS holders. PTC will pass through
the REMIC payment on the same day as received.

Not later than the 14th day of each month, the trustee will deliver to PTC and Chemical Bank the factor information for
payment on the REMIC securities. PTC will follow the instructions from the trustee for the disbursement of funds received
on the GNMA MBS collateralizing the REMIC trust.

The volume of the GNMA REMIC securities initially deposited at PTC will be modest compared to the total face amount
GNMA securities now on deposit at PTC (approximately $880 billion) and is expected to have a comparably small impact
on PTC's overall transaction volume. GNMA I's that constitute the corpus of a GNMA REMIC trust will remain immobilized
at PTC and, therefore, will be removed from PTC's transactions volume after the creation of the REMIC. In addition,
CMO/REMIC tranches historically have been less actively traded than single-class mortgage-backed securities.

It is expected that PTC will utilize pricing sources and the methodology employed for the VA REMIC pricing at PTC for
the GNMA REMIC product. As an eligible security, functionally and legally comparable to GNMA single-class and VA
REMIC securities, PTC's Rules and Procedures are currently consistent with, and govern PTC's and its participants'
rights and obligations with respect to, the GNMA REMIC securities. PTC end-of-day borrowing agreements also currently
apply to GNMA REMIC securities without change. Finally, PTC anticipates that the fees imposed by PTC for providing
depository services for GNMA REMIC securities will be the same as those in effect for GNMA MBS.

PTC believes that since the proposed rule change provides for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of
securities transactions it is consistent with section 17A of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable
to PTC.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



PTC does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others



PTC has neither solicited nor received comments on this proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(A) By order approve such proposed rule change or,

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available

<DOCTITLE>Emerging Markets Growth Fund, Inc., et al.; Application</DOCTITLE>



April 20, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for an Order under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

Emerging Markets Growth Fund, Inc. (the ``Fund''), New Europe East Investment Fund (``New Europe Fund''), Capital
International Emerging Markets Fund (``CIEMF''), and Capital International, Inc. (the ``Manager'').




RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under sections 6(c) and 17(b) exempting applicants from section 17(a), and under section 17(d) and
rule 17d-1 thereunder permitting certain transactions.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order to permit the Fund to invest up to 21/2% of its assets in the New Europe Fund, an affiliated closed-end
Luxembourg investment company that invests in equity securities of developing countries in Eastern Europe and the
former Soviet republics.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations




1. The Fund is a closed-end management investment company organized as a corporation under Maryland law. The Fund's
investment objective is to seek long-term capital growth through investment in developing country equity securities.
It invests principally in developing country securities that are listed on a securities exchange or are traded actively
in an over-the-counter market.

2. Applicants believe that the proposed transaction is structured to protect the interests of Fund shareholders.
Of the Fund's fourteen directors, eight directors (who are not ``interested persons,'' as defined in section 2(a)(19),
of the Fund) represent institutional shareholders of the Fund. Two additional non-interested directors represent
former shareholders of the Fund. All of the non-interested Fund directors are full-time investment professionals
who act in such capacity for their respective employers in addition to their service to the Fund. 

3. Persons purchasing shares of the Fund in issuer directed offerings must satisfy strict suitability standards.
An investor that is a ``company,'' as defined in the Act, must have total assets in excess of $5 million. An investor
who is a natural person must be an ``accredited investor'' within the meaning of Regulation D under the Securities
Act of 1933 (``1933 Act''), with an individual net worth of at least $1 million or an individual income in excess of $200,000
during each of the two most recent years.

4. The Fund proposes to invest in the emerging markets of Eastern Europe by purchasing shares of the New Europe Fund.
The New Europe Fund is a closed-end investment company incorporated in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Its investment
objective is to seek long-term capital appreciation through investment in companies domiciled in the countries
of East Central Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union that are client countries of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation.

5. CIEMF, an investment company organized and operated outside of the United States, also proposes to invest in the
New Europe Fund. CIEMF is not subject to the Act because it has not made, and presently does not propose to make, a public
offering of its securities in the United States, and because the outstanding securities of CIEMF are beneficially
owned by less than 100 United States persons.

6. The Manager, an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the ``Advisers Act''),
advises the Fund, the New Europe Fund, and CIEMF. 

7. Shares of the New Europe Fund will be offered privately to institutional investors worldwide to be paid for in four
tranches. The New Europe Fund has two classes of securities: (i) voting ordinary shares of $10.00 par value per share
(``A Shares'') and (ii) voting preferred shares of $10.00 par value per share (``B Shares''), both of which carry the
right to one vote per share at all meetings of the company. The A shares will be offered at a subscription price of $5,000
per share, and the B Shares will be offered at a subscription price of $125,000 per share. In general, the New Europe
Fund anticipates that substantially all investment in the B Shares will be made by investors who also purchase A Shares
and who, for tax or other reasons, are required to limit the amount of voting power they may acquire. Neither the A Shares
nor the B Shares will be redeemable, and the New Europe Fund presently does not intend to repurchase either class of
shares. Applicants represent that no application currently is being made to list the A Shares or the B Shares. In addition,
none of these shares may be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, in the United States or to any United States person
except in a transaction which is exempt from registration under the 1933 Act.

8. The Fund proposes to invest U.S. $50 million, approximately 21/2% if its total assets, to acquire approximately
25% of the economic value of the New Europe Fund's securities. Section 12(d)(1) restricts registered investment
companies from acquiring more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of another investment company. To comply
with this restriction, the Fund will invest in a combination of A Shares and B Shares so that it will hold less than 3%
of the total voting power, but approximately 25% of the economic power, of the New Europe Fund.

9. CIEMF proposes to invest approximately 2% of its total assets, equivalent to U.S. $6,100,000, to acquire approximately
3% of the Company's outstanding securities. The Capital Group, Inc., the indirect parent company of the Manager,
also plans to invest approximately $2 million to acquire approximately 1% of the New Europe Fund's securities. Both
CIEMF and The Capital Group, Inc. will purchase only A Shares. The Capital Group, Inc. and all of its affiliates, including
CIEMF, who purchase shares of the New Europe Fund will vote their shares in the New Europe Fund in the same proportion
as the votes of all other shareholders in the company. Applicants represent that this minimizes the risk that insiders
will use their voting power to advance their interests to the detriment of other shareholders of the company.

10. Under the Investment Advisory and Service Agreement currently in effect between the Fund and the Manager, the
Fund pays the Manager a fee at the annual rates of 0.90% of the first U.S. $400 million of aggregate net assets of the Fund,
0.80% of such aggregate net assets in excess of U.S. $400 million, and 0.70% with respect to aggregate net assets in
excess of U.S. $1 billion, as determined on the last business day of each week. The Manager has agreed to waiver that
portion of its fee that would exceed 0.65% of aggregate net assets in excess of $2 billion. To avoid the possibility
that the Manager will receive duplicate fees from the Fund and the New Europe Fund, the Manager will waive its fee, including
administrative fees, with respect to the Fund's net assets represented by the Fund's proposed investment in the New
Europe Fund. In calculating the fee waiver, the Manager will not take into account the amount of expenses or fees, if
any, that were reimbursed to or waived for the Fund in connection with any voluntary or mandatory expense cap limitation
or any fee waiver. Currently, the Fund does not have an expense cap arrangement with the Manager, although the Fund
is subject to mandatory expense cap limitations imposed by state regulatory authorities. Any applicable expense
cap or fee waiver will not limit the Manager's fee waiver with respect to the Fund's investment in the New Europe Fund.

11. The Manager will be entitled to a one-time incentive fee payable if and when the New Europe Fund becomes open-ended
or has its shares listed and traded or, failing either, is placed in liquidation. Applicants believe that the incentive
fee arrangement complies with the safe harbor of rule 205-3 of the Advisers Act. In addition, as investment adviser
to the New Europe Fund, the Manager will receive an advisory fee at the rate of 2% per annum of the New Europe Fund's total
adjusted assets, 

i.e., 

total net assets without a deduction for any accrual of the Manager's incentive fee.



Applicant's Legal Analysis



1. Section 17(a) generally provides, in part, that it is unlawful for any affiliated person of a registered investment
company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, knowingly to sell or purchase any security
or other property to or from such investment company. Section 17(b), however, provides that the SEC may grant an exemption
from section 17(a) if the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching
on the part of any person concerned, the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment
company concerned, and the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act.

<PARENT> FR940426-2-00065 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

2. Under section 6(c), the SEC may exempt any series of transactions from any provisions of the Act or rule thereunder
if and to the extent such exemption is ``necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions'' of the Act. Applicants request an exemption
under section 6(c) as well as section 17(b) because the relief is requested to exempt more than one transaction.



3. Section 2(a)(3)(C) defines an ``affiliated person'' as ``any persons directly or indirectly controlling, controlled
by, or under common control with, such other person.'' In addition, under section 2(a)(3)(E) the investment adviser
to an investment company is an ``affiliated person'' of such company. The Fund, the New Europe Fund, and CIEMF may be
deemed to be under common control because the Manager is the investment adviser to each of them. Accordingly, the New
Europe Fund may be affiliated with the Fund, and section 17(a) may prohibit the New Europe Fund from selling its securities
to the Fund.



4. Applicants contend that the proposed transaction meets the standards for relief under sections 6(c) and 17(b).
Applicants believe that the terms of the transactions between the Fund and the New Europe Fund are reasonable and fair
and do not involve overreaching. The Fund will purchase A Shares and B Shares of the New Europe Fund at the same purchase
price and on the same basis as all other purchasers of such shares. Applicants further believe that the proposed transaction
is consistent with the policies of the Fund. By purchasing securities in the New Europe Fund, the Fund can invest in
the emerging markets of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics while benefiting from the economies and diversification
provided by pooled investments. In addition, applicants believe that the proposed transaction is consistent with
the general purposes of the Act because the Fund and its shareholders are not disadvantaged by the self-dealing or
overreaching of any affiliated person.



5. Section 17(d) prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company from affecting any transaction
in which the company is a joint participant in contravention of SEC rules. Rule 17d-1 prohibits an affiliated
person of any registered investment company, acting as principal, from participating in or affecting any transaction
in a ``joint enterprise or other joint arrangement'' in which the company is a participant, without prior SEC approval.
The Fund and CIEMF's investment in shares of the New Europe Fund may constitute a joint enterprise or other joint arrangement
within the meaning of rule 17d-1. Applicants believe that the proposed transaction is consistent with the provisions,
policies, and purposes of the Act. Applicants assert that the Fund's highly autonomous board has approved the Fund's
investment in the New Europe Fund after considering all relevant factors and concluding that the Fund would not be
disadvantaged by the proposed transaction. Moreover, investing in the New Europe Fund will enable the Fund to diversify
its investments in the emerging securities markets of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics at a lower cost
than would be possible if it were to pursue such investments directly. In addition, the Fund, CIEMF, and all other investors
in the New Europe Fund will participate in the investment on equal terms.




Applicants' Conditions





Applicants agree that any order granting an exemption will be subject to the following conditions:



1. The manager will waive its management fee (which includes administrative fees) with respect to the Fund's net assets
represented by the Fund's proposed investment in the New Europe Fund. To effectuate this waiver, Fund assets represented
by the New Europe Fund securities purchased by the Fund under the proposed investment will be excluded from the net
assets of the Fund in the calculation of the Manager's fee. As such waiver relates to the Manager's fee schedule, any
Fund assets invested in the New Europe Fund will be excluded from the Fund's assets before any fee calculation is made;
thus, the Fund's aggregate net assets would be adjusted by the amount invested in the New Europe Fund prior to determining
the fee based on the Manager's fee schedule (the amount waived pursuant to this procedure shall be defined as the ``Reduction
Amount'' for purposes of Condition 4, 

infra

).



2. Any fees payable by the Fund to the Manager so excluded in connection with the proposed transaction will be excluded
for all time, and will not be subject to recoupment by the Manager or by any other investment adviser at any other time.



3. The Fund's proposed investment in the shares of the New Europe Fund will be limited to 21/2% of the Fund's total assets,
taken at the time of the Fund's subscription.



4. If the Manager waives any portion of its fees or bears any portion of its expenses in respect of the Fund (an ``Expense
Waiver''), the adjusted fees for the Fund (gross fees minus Expense Waiver) will be calculated without reference
to the Reduction Amount. Adjusted fees then will be reduced by the Reduction Amount. If the Reduction Amount exceeds
adjusted fees, the Manager will reimburse the Fund in an amount equal to such excess.



5. The Fund's shares of the New Europe Fund will be voted by an independent director designated to act in such capacity.



6. All shareholders of the New Europe Fund that are affiliated with The Capital Group, including CIEMF, will vote their
shares in proportion to the vote of all other shareholders of the New Europe Fund.

Funding Availability (NOFA) for Fiscal Year 1994, Section 8 Community Investment Demonstration Program



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner, HUD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of funding availability (NOFA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 1994.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This NOFA announces the availability of $100 million in FY 1994 section 8 budget authority for a national competition
to be administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to section 6 of the HUD Demonstration
Act of 1993. That section directs the Secretary to carry out ``a demonstration program to attract pension fund investment
in affordable housing through the use of project-based rental assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing
Act of 1937.'' This NOFA invites pension funds (public or private) or their affiliates to submit applications to participate
in this new demonstration program.



Under this demonstration, selected pension funds will receive a set-aside of section 8 funding authority. They will
select projects to be assisted, within guidelines established by HUD, and submit them to the Department for approval.
New construction and substantial rehabilitation projects are eligible. At least 50 percent of the set-aside must
be for HUD-owned properties or properties with HUD-held mortgages. No more than 50 percent of the units in any project
(except HUD-owned or HUD-held) may be assisted; however, HUD may provide exceptions to this rule for limited special
circumstances such as meeting the needs of the homeless, disabled or displaced. In the case of HUD-owned properties,
the number of units required to be assisted will be determined in the disposition plan in accordance with statutory
requirements. The pension fund will provide assistance from its set-aside for one-half the number of units to be assisted
as determined in the disposition plan; HUD will provide the other one-half from its property disposition set-aside.

If the project-specific proposal is approved by HUD, a portion of the pension fund's section 8 set-aside will be assigned
to the project. After completion of construction or rehabilitation, pursuant to an agreement between HUD and the
project owner, a Housing Assistance Payments Contract will be executed between the owner and HUD. Under this Contract,
the owner will be responsible for all management and operation of the project, including determining eligibility
of and leasing to low-income families.

The NOFA contains information for the applicants regarding the allocation of section 8 budget authority, the application
process, including the application requirements and the deadline for filing applications; pension fund selection
criteria; and the selection criteria for selecting specific projects to be funded.

Detailed instructions and guidelines implementing this demonstration are contained in HUD Notice 94-19.
Prospective applicants should request a copy of the Notice from the address below before submitting an application
to participate in the demonstration.

A presubmission conference for parties who may be interested in participating in this demonstration program has
been scheduled at 1:00 p.m., May 11, 1994, in room 10233, Departmental Conference Room, at HUD headquarters. While
not a precondition to eligibility for submission of a formal application, representatives of the pension funds or
their affiliates are encouraged to attend.




<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Paperwork Reduction Act Statement



The information collection requirements contained in this NOFA have been approved by the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. OMB has approved the section 8 information collection requirements
under the assigned control number 2577-0169.



(I) Purpose and Substantive Description



(A) Background



Section 6 of the HUD Demonstration Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-120, 107 Stat. 1144, approved October 27, 1993) directs
the Secretary of HUD to carry out a demonstration program to attract pension fund investment in affordable housing
through the use of project-based rental assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937. In carrying
out this demonstration program the Secretary must ensure that not less than 50 percent of the funds appropriated for
each year are used in conjunction with the disposition of either: (1) Multifamily properties owned by the Department;
or (2) multifamily properties securing mortgages held by the Department.

An appropriation of $100 million for fiscal year 1994 was authorized and has been provided to carry out this demonstration
program.

Project-based section 8 assistance under the program will be provided pursuant to a contract entered into by the Secretary
and the owner of the eligible housing that: (1) Provides assistance for a term which, taking into account the financing
and other factors relating to the specific project proposal, is not less than 60 and not greater than 180 months; and
(2) provides for contract rents to be determined by the Secretary.

The Fair Market Rent Schedule for this demonstration is 120 percent of the Existing Housing Fair Market Rent Schedule
most recently published in the 

Federal Register

. Initial gross rents (contract rents plus allowance for tenant paid utilities) for any new construction project,
and any substantial rehabilitation project with per unit rehabilitation costs of $5000 or more, may not exceed the
Fair Market Rents applicable to this demonstration. Initial gross rents for any substantial rehabilitation project
with per unit rehabilitation costs of less than $5000 may not exceed 100 percent of the published Existing Housing
Fair Market Rent Schedule.

Contract rents must be reasonable on the basis of comparison with rents for unsubsidized units of similar age, design
and location which include comparable amenities and services.

HUD's multifamily mortgage insurance programs, the risk sharing programs under section 542 of the Housing and Community
Development Act of 1992, and Farmers Home Administration loan and loan guarantee programs are not available for housing
developed or assisted under this demonstration program. A pension fund may not have an ownership interest in a project
for which a project-specific proposal is submitted to HUD or for which assistance is provided under this demonstration.
The Secretary may establish such other standards regarding financing and securitization of project mortgages as
the Secretary deems appropriate.

This NOFA announces the availability of $100 million in FY 1994 section 8 budget authority to carry out this demonstration
program which will assist between approximately 900 and 2500 units. The number that can be assisted will vary depending
on the level of gross rents (i.e., contract rents plus allowance for tenant paid utilities), contract administration
fee and term of contract. For example,









(B) Allocation Amounts



From the amounts of section 8 assistance made available in the VA, HUD-Independent Agencies Appropriation Act for
FY 1994 (Pub. L. 103-124, 107 Stat. 1275, Approved October 28, 1993) the Department has set aside $100 million
in budget authority for this demonstration program. No pension fund may receive an initial set-aside of more than
$50 million.

<DOCNO> FR940426-2-00117 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940426-2-00075 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A Category A pension fund may receive an initial set-aside of not more than $50 million. A Category A fund is any pension
fund that identifies and documents in its application the presence of a pipeline of projects for which project-specific
proposals sufficient to use the total amount of the set-aside requested by it can be submitted to HUD within 120 days
after HUD selects the fund for participation in the demonstration. 

A Category B fund is any pension fund that does not make such identifications or documentations. A Category B fund may
receive an initial set-aside of not more than $10 million. 

The Department may not initially provide (or make a commitment to provide) more than 50 percent of the funding for housing
financed by any single pension fund, except that this limitation shall cease to apply if the Secretary, after the end
of the 6-month period beginning on the date of this NOFA determines that: (1) There are no expressions of interest that
are likely to result in approvable applications in the reasonably foreseeable future; or (2) any such expressions
of interest are not likely to use all funding under this section. If, after the required six month period, it is determined
that, given the extent of expressions of interest in this demonstration, it does not appear likely that all of the $100
million in budget authority will be used (and the Department so informs the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban
Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate) the
Department then may reserve funding for, and consider an application from, a pension fund requesting an award for
amounts in excess of $50 million. 

The Department may not enter into any new funding commitments under this program after September 30, 1998. 



(C) Eligible Applicants



Any applicant for participation in this program must demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Department that: (1)
It is a trust, fund, plan or other program established or maintained by an employer or other person for the purpose of
providing income or benefits to employees after the termination of employment or deferring income by employees until
the termination of employment; (2) it is an entity that engages principally in the investment of the funds of such a
trust, fund, plan, or other program; or (3) it is a partnership or organization established to invest pension funds
in affordable multifamily housing. 

The applicant must have adequate staff capacity to perform the functions required under this demonstration or it
may contract or enter into a partnership for such services so long as the applicant is responsible for overall program
administration and decisions. 



(D) Pension Fund Applications



1. All applications from pension funds must contain information as to the number of projects and units expected to
be financed, the number and percent in each project expected to receive Section 8 assistance, contract terms anticipated,
anticipated initial contract rents, total Section 8 budget authority requested, the number of units to be newly constructed
and the number to be substantially rehabilitated; types of families (elderly, large, disabled, displaced, homeless
or families/individuals with special needs) and number of each expected to assisted. 

2. All applications must contain information sufficient for HUD to evaluate the applicant on the basis of the Pension
Fund Selection Criteria set forth in Subpart (E) below. 



(E) Pension Fund Selection Criteria



All applications for participation in the demonstration will be evaluated on the basis of the following criteria.
Applicants should refer to HUD Notice 94-19 for details as to the supporting information required for each criterion.

Applications received during each 15 calendar-day period, beginning 30 days after publication of this NOFA, will
be evaluated against each other. Applications will be selected on the basis of numerical ratings assigned to the criteria
identified above. Additional, more detailed information and instructions with respect to the above criteria, as
well as on application and program procedures in general, are contained in HUD Notice 94-19, which will be provided
pension funds upon request to the HUD program headquarters office referred to above. 

The Department will formally notify each pension fund as to whether or not it was selected to participate in this demonstration
program and the amount of set-aside awarded. 



(F) Guidelines on Eligible Projects



Pension funds selected by HUD to participate in this demonstration must submit proposals for projects they wish to
finance to the Department for approval. Each pension fund will be required to use at least 50% of its section 8 set-aside
in connection with HUD-owned properties or properties with mortgages held by HUD unless the Department determines
that the overall statutory provision to this effect will be met and approves an exception. 

New construction projects are eligible under this demonstration. In addition, the following types of existing projects
are eligible for substantial rehabilitation: 

A multifamily project owned by the Secretary or subject to a mortgage held by the Secretary that is delinquent, under
a workout agreement, or being foreclosed upon by the Secretary; 

A multifamily project eligible for assistance as a troubled project under section 201 of the Housing Community Development
Amendments of 1978; 

A multifamily project located in an empowerment zone or enterprise community designated pursuant to Federal law;

Any other multifamily project, including those to be occupied by homeless persons or homeless families as defined
in section 103 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. 

High rise elevator projects for families with children are not eligible for this demonstration unless HUD determines
there is no practical alternative. 



(G) Project Selection Criteria 



Pension funds may establish their own criteria for selecting project-specific proposals but such criteria must,
in the aggregate, reflect the following public purposes to the satisfaction of the Secretary:

 


_Achieving economic mix; 
_Increasing housing choices and fostering neighborhood diversity; 
_Providing affordable housing for large, low-income families and providing access to necessary supportive facilities
and services; 
_Involving other state and local and public and private resources to achieve these objectives and to limit Section
8 assistance to less than 50% of the units (except in HUD-owned properties or properties with mortgages held by HUD
and under limited special circumstances, such as assistance for homeless, disabled, or displaced approved by HUD);

_Facilitating maximum use of available Section 8 budget authority by limiting gross rents to less than the Fair Market
Rent Limitations and contract terms to less than 15 years; 
_Facilitating geographic/locality diversity of project sites and complying with any applicable court orders;

_Using HUD owned properties and properties with mortgages held by HUD in a variety of geographic locations; and 
_Meeting special needs of homeless, disabled, or displaced etc.

 


More detailed information with respect to these criteria and methods of selection is contained in HUD Notice 94-19.


Pension funds should be aware that certain projects are not eligible for participation in this demonstration. These
include projects that are subject to mortgage prepayment restrictions, including projects meeting the definition
of ``eligible low income housing'' under the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of
1990 (LIHPRHA) and projects that are subject to Section 250(a) of the National Housing Act. 

A list of HUD-owned properties is available from HUD Headquarters, Office of Preservation and Property Disposition,
telephone (202) 708-3343. Information on properties with mortgages held by HUD is available from the Office
of Multifamily Housing Management in HUD Headquarters, telephone (202) 708-3730. 

HUD Notice 94-19 sets forth the format and specific information needed in order for pension funds to meet the
requirements of this subpart (G). 



(H) Section 8 Project-Specific Contract Award 



A Category A pension fund will have 120 days from the date of its selection to participate in the demonstration to submit
project-specific proposals utilizing the total amount of its Section 8 set-aside. It will have 10 months from the
date of selection to commit (i.e., closing of construction financing) its Section 8 set-aside to specific projects.


A Category B pension fund will have 12 months to reach closing of construction financing. It must submit project-specific
proposals sufficient to use its Section 8 set-aside no later than 120 days before the end of the 12 month period. 

Any amount of set-aside not committed to specific projects by the end of the time periods indicated above may be withdrawn
by HUD and reallocated to other pension funds based on the performance of the receiving pension fund in utilizing it
previous allocation(s) or to pension funds not previously selected by HUD due to the lack of available set-aside authority.
HUD may extend these deadlines. 

Project-specific proposals must include the information and certifications, and be submitted in the format, identified
in HUD Notice 94-19. 



(I) Processing of Project-Specific Proposals 



After receipt of a project-specific proposal, HUD, in accordance with HUD Notice 94-19, will perform certain
HUD-retained reviews for compliance with:

 


_Site acceptability criteria for this Demonstration; 
_Environmental requirements except HUD may accept and adopt an environmental review in accordance with 24 CFR Part
58 conducted by a CDBG or HOME grantee; 
_Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing requirements; 
_Previous participation of project principals in HUD programs; 
_Obtain and issue appropriate Davis-Bacon wage rate determinations; and 
_Subsidy layering guidelines, unless the Housing Credit Agency has agreed to perform subsidy layering reviews for
projects receiving Low Income Housing Tax Credits.




Upon completion of the HUD reviews, Headquarters will notify the pension fund whether or not the proposal is acceptable,
the amount of Section 8 that will be reserved for the project when the HAP Agreement is signed and the steps requisite
to execution of the HAP Agreement.

<DOCNO> FR940426-2-00120 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940426-2-00075 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(J) Post Approval Processing 



The HAP Agreement may not be executed nor may construction or substantial rehabilitation begin until the certifications
required by HUD Notice 94-19 are submitted to HUD and found acceptable. 



(K) Contract Administration 



The statute calls for assistance to be provided through ``a contract entered into by the Secretary and the owner''.
It is the Department's intent to enter into a HUD/Private Owner HAP Agreement and Contract. HUD will then enter into
a contract with an HFA or PHA that has jurisdiction over the geographic area in which the project is located. For a fee,
the HFA or PHA will carry out certain administrative or ministerial functions that otherwise would be the responsibility
of HUD as the Section 8 Contract Administrator. Any administrative fee payable to the HFA or PHA will not exceed 5 percent
of the published 2 bedroom Fair Market Rent for Existing Housing for the area and will be payable out of the Section 8
contract and budget authority reserved for each project. 



(L) Project Construction and Completion 



Project construction, completion and cost certification requirements are contained in HUD Notice 94-19.
HUD may perform field reviews if necessary to substantiate compliance with program requirements. 



(M) HUD-Private Owner HAP Contract 



If the pension fund and owner are in compliance with HUD Notice 94-19, HUD will execute a HUD-Private Owner HAP
Contract with the owner. The contract will contain provisions relative to: (1) The terms of the contract which may
be not less than 5 nor more than 15 years; (2) the responsibilities of the owner for project management and maintenance;
(3) a prohibition on the use of other Federal programs so long as the contract is in effect; (4) a limitation on assistance
for the project to the housing assistance payments available under the Contract; (5) the requirement that in the event
the project is refinanced to lower the interest rate and/or debt service payment, HUD may reduce the Contract rents;
and (6) the right for HUD to terminate the Contract for cause if the owner fails to perform in accordance with the provisions
of the Contract. 



(N) Supplementary Program Information 



Coincident with the preparation of this NOFA the Department has been developing more detailed information and instructions
for program participants in the form of HUD Notice 94-19. The Office of Insured Multifamily Housing Development
at HUD Headquarters, Room 6134, Telephone (202) 708-3000, will make these instructions available to pension
funds and other interested parties upon request. 



II. Other Matters



(A) Environmental Impact



A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with the Department's
regulations at 24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969
(42 U.S.C. 4332). The Finding is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office
of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, room 10276, 451
Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410. 



(B) Federalism Impact



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that this NOFA does not have substantial, direct effect on the States, on their political subdivisions, or on the relationship
between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power or responsibilities among the various
levels of government, because this NOFA would not substantially alter the established roles of HUD, the States and
local governments.

<PARENT> FR940426-2-00075 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(C) Impact on the Family


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, the Family, has determined that this
notice does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being
within the meaning of the Executive Order and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order. This is a funding notice
and does not alter any HUD program requirements affecting the family. 


(D) Accountability in the Provision of HUD Assistance


HUD has promulgated a final rule to implement section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform
Act of 1989 (HUD Reform Act). The final rule is codified at 24 CFR part 12. Section 102 contains a number of provisions
that are designed to ensure greater accountability and integrity in the provision of certain types of assistance
administered by HUD. On January 16, 1992, HUD published at 57 FR 1942, additional information that gave the public
(including applicants for, and recipients of, HUD assistance) further information on the implementation of section
102. The documentation, public access, and disclosure requirements of section 102 are applicable to assistance
awarded under this NOFA as follows: 
(1) Documentation and Public Access. HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application
submitted pursuant to this NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied.
This material, including any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period
beginning not less than 30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with
the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD
will include the recipients of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly 

Federal Register

 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the
notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.) 
(2) Disclosures. HUD will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (HUD Form 2880)
submitted in connection with this NOFA. Update reports (also Form 2880) will be made available along with the applicant
disclosure reports, but in no case for a period generally less than three years. All reports_both applicant disclosures
and updates_will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing
regulations at 24 CFR part 15. (See 24 CFR subpart C, and the notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these disclosure requirements.)

(E) Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities


The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) (the
``Byrd Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of
Federal contracts, grants, or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches
of the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the
awarding of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification
regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000
must certify that no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance.



(F) Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel


Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing
with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements
on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the
taking of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts
the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of
housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt
of assistance. 
HUD's regulation implementing section 13 is codified at 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence
the Department in these ways, they are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples contained in Appendix
A of the rule. Appendix A of this rule contains examples of activities covered by this rule. 
Any questions concerning the rule should be directed to the Office of Ethics, Room 2158, Department of Housing and
Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410. Telephone: (202) 708-3815 (voice/TDD).
This is not a toll-free number. Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD office.



(G) Prohibition Against Advance Information on Funding Decisions


Section 103 of the HUD Reform Act proscribes the communication of certain information by HUD employees to persons
not authorized to receive that information during the selection process for the award of assistance. HUD's regulation
implementing section 103 is codified at 24 CFR part 4. In accordance with the requirements of section 103, HUD employees
involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are restrained by 24 CFR part 4 from providing
advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding decisions, or from
otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance in this competition
should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted by 24 CFR part 4. Applicants who have questions should
contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708-3815 (voice/TDD). (This is not a toll-free number.)

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On November 26, 1993, the Federal Transit 
Administration published a Notice in the 

Federal Register

 
proposing to rescind its current guidance on private enterprise 
participation, which was believed to be unnecessary, as well as 
overly restrictive of the ability of local planning agencies and 
transit operators to make rational transportation choices in 
light of local needs. The agency provided a 60-day comment 
period in connection with the Notice. This final notice 
announces the agency's decision to rescind the private 
enterprise guidance as proposed and presents its statement of 
policy on this issue.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Introduction 


On November 26, 1993, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) 
published a Notice of Proposed Recision of Private Enterprise 
Participation Guidance (58 FR 62407) (the Notice) in which it 
sought public comment on a proposal to rescind its current 
guidance on the participation of private enterprise in the 
provision of mass transit service. The agency stated its belief 
that the current guidance is unnecessary and restricts the 
ability of local planning agencies and transit operators to make 
rational transportation choices in light of local needs. As 
discussed in detail below, FTA received a total of 415 comments 
from the public on its proposal. Although many comments were 
not supportive, we found all helpful in the decisionmaking 
process. In the end, FTA remains convinced that its proposed 
course of action represents responsible public policy that 
adheres to the statutory construct and recognizes the 
appropriate roles to be played by the entities involved; 
accordingly, FTA hereby provides final notice to the public of 
its decision to rescind its policy statement, ``Private 
Enterprise Participation in the (Federal Transit) Program'' (49 
FR 41310, October 22, 1984); Circular 7005.1; Chapter X of 
Circular 9040.1C; and Chapter IV of Circular 9070.1C. 
In this final notice, we present FTA's view of the private 
enterprise provisions at issue, summarize the comments received 
in this docket, respond to the five primary issues raised, 
and discuss the policies that will guide FTA action in this 
arena in the future. 


II. Background 


In light of the comments received, the background discussion of 
the private enterprise provisions in our November Notice bears 
reiteration and expansion. As noted there, the principal 
purpose of the Federal Transit Act, as amended (FT Act), 49 
U.S.C. app. 1601 et seq., is to assist the development and 
improvement of mass transportation systems in metropolitan and 
rural areas. In sections 3, 9, 16(b)(2), and 18, Congress has 
authorized FTA to make funds available to State and local public 
bodies for capital acquisition and construction, operating 
assistance, and planning activities in connection with mass 
transportation projects. Congress has expressed its concern 
that such Federal assistance not be used without regard for the 
interests of private enterprise. The agency's original 
authorizing statute, the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964, 
now the FT Act, contained two provisions, section 3(e) and the 
first two sentences of section 4(a), which expressed this 
intent. Section 4(a) provided that



[N]o federal financial assistance shall be provided pursuant to 
subsection (a)- of section 3 unless the Secretary determines 
that the facilities and equipment for which the assistance is 
sought are needed for carrying out a program * * * necessary for 
the sound economic and desirable development of such area. 

Such 
program shall encourage to the maximum extent feasible the 
participation of private enterprise.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

The Federal Public Transportation Act of 1978 deleted this 
provision, but added a new section 8 that included subsection 
(e), now subsection (o), which provides that ``[t]he plans and 
programs required by this section shall encourage to the maximum 
extent feasible the participation of private enterprise.'' 
In section 3(e), as revised by the 1978 Act, Congress has 
directed that where an existing mass transportation company is 
providing service, FTA may not provide financial assistance to a 
public body for the operation of competing or supplemental 
service, unless it finds that the relevant transportation 
improvement program required by section 8 provides for the 
participation of private enterprise to the ``maximum extent 
feasible.''

In South Suburban Safeway Lines, Inc. 

v. 

City of Chicago, 

416 
F.2d 535, 539 (7th Cir., 1969), the court observed that in 
section 3(e) 




Congress seems to have been primarily concerned over the 
possibility of public acquisition of private facilities * * * 
although competition with and supplementation of existing 
facilities are also dealt with. 




The legislative history of section 3(e) is consistent with the 
court's understanding. In brief, section 3(e) originated in 
Senate Bill S.6 (88th Cong., 1st Sess.), one of the bills 
leading to the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964. The 
principal sponsor of S.6, Senator Harrison Williams of New 
Jersey, indicated that this provision was intended to further a 
neutral Federal posture on the question of whether public or 
private companies should operate federally assisted mass 
transportation services. In discussing the provisions of the 
bill, Senator Williams said that 




The public would not have to operate the transit facilities and 
equipment itself. It could provide for their operation by lease 
or other arrangement. 

Thus, every locality would remain free to 
choose public or private operation of its transportation system 
or any combination of the two. 




109 Cong. Rec. 198 (Daily ed., January 14, 1963) (emphasis 
added). 




In the House of Representatives, an amendment to H.R. 3881 
(88th Cong., 1st Sess.) contained language substantially similar 
to that which the Senate had passed. Subsequently, the Senate 
adopted the House language, and the provision was signed into 
law. The debate in the House revealed that the intent of 
section 3(e) was to provide fair and equitable treatment of 
private providers whose existing operations might face 
competition from or acquisition by federally funded transit 
systems and to require the Administrator to use his judgment in 
making the required findings. 110 Cong. Rec. 14464 (Daily ed., 
June 25, 1964). However, the legislative history provides no 
guidance on how the required findings are to be made. 

The statute does not favor private operations over publicly 
owned operations. ``All the statute requires is encouragement of 
private participation to the maximum extent feasible. It does 
not allow private operators to write their own ticket.'' 
Westport Taxi Service, Inc.

 v. 

Adams,

 Civil No. B-76-369 
(D.Conn., April 13, 1977), slip opinion at 12; aff'd. in part, 
rev'd. in part, 571 F.2d 697 (2d Cir. 1978). 

At the same time, Congress has made it clear that decisions 
regarding mass transportation services to be provided with 
Federal assistance are to be made locally. Indeed, section 2(b) 
of the FT Act states that one of the fundamental purposes of the 
Act is 




To provide assistance to State and local governments and their 
instrumentalities in financing such systems, 

to be operated by public or private mass transportation companies as determined by local needs * * *.







49 U.S.C. app. 1601(b)(3) (emphasis added). Strongly 
reinforcing this principle, section 12(d) prohibits FTA from 
regulating ``in any manner the mode of operation of any mass 
transportation system * * *.'' Thus, the public/private 
operator choice is to be made at the local level. 



This emphasis on local decisionmaking in determining how best 
to serve the transportation needs of the local area has been 
recognized by the courts: 




The statutory scheme of (FTA) emphasizes the large role to be 
played by local bodies responsible for urban mass transit * * *. This reliance on the local or State
group is consistent with 
the statute's encouragement of local responsibility in urban 
mass transportation. The statute does not promote a procedure 
which leaves all decisions with the Secretary (of 
Transportation), but rather emphasizes local solutions to 
problems. 





Pullman

 v. 

Volpe,

 337 F. Supp. 432, 438-439 (E.D. Pa. 1970). 




The participation of private enterprise in mass transit is 
addressed at several points in the current FT Act; most notably, 
section 9(f) requires that in developing a proposed program of 
projects recipients consult with ``interested parties, including 
private transportation providers'' and in developing the final 
program of projects recipients particularly consider the 
``comments and views * * * of private transportation providers.'' This activity at the recipient
level is the first step that 
leads to the planning process under section 8. In section 8(o) 
Congress has required that local transportation plans and 
programs prepared under section 8 encourage ``to the maximum 
extent feasible the participation of private enterprise.'' In 
section 3(e), Congress has directed that where an existing mass 
transportation company is providing service, FTA may not provide 
financial assistance to a public body for the operation of 
competing or supplemental service, unless it finds that the 
relevant transportation improvement program required by section 
8 provides for such private enterprise participation to the 
``maximum extent feasible.'' In section 9(e)(1), Congress 
extended the requirement of section 3(e) to the section 9 
formula grant program. 

The statutory scheme viewed as a whole thus juxtaposes two 
potentially competing interests: private enterprise 
participation and local determination. By authorizing the 
Administrator to use his discretion in making the required 
finding, Congress has placed responsibility for resolving any 
conflicts in the hands of the Federal agency. Since that 
finding rests on judgments of ``feasibility,'' which are made in 
the first instance in the program of projects developed by the 
local metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), it is apparent 
that Congress has vested the agency with broad discretion in 
carrying out this responsibility. 

Between 1964 and 1984, FTA provided no separate guidance 
relating to the participation of private enterprise in mass 
transportation. FTA first issued guidance on this issue in a 
policy statement, ``Private Enterprise Participation in the 
(Federal Transit) Program'' (49 FR 41310, October 22, 1984), 
which set forth the factors FTA would consider in determining 
whether a recipient's planning process appropriately considered 
the participation of private enterprise. These factors included 
consultation with private providers in the local planning 
process, consideration of private enterprise in the development 
of the mass transit program, the existence of records 
documenting the participatory nature of the local planning 
process, and the rationale used in determining whether or not to 
contract with private operators for transit services. 

In 1986, FTA further informally implemented its private 
enterprise guidance for sections 3 and 9 recipients in FTA 
Circular 7005.1 (``Documentation of Private Enterprise 
Involvement in sections 3 and 9 Programs'') and for sections 
16(b)(2) and 18 recipients in Chapter X of FTA Circular 9040.1C 
(``Section 18 Program Guidance'') and Chapter IV of FTA Circular 
9070.1C (``Section 16(b)(2) Program Guidance''). These circulars 
state clearly that FTA will not condition grants on a certain 
level of private enterprise involvement. At the same time, the 
circulars outline certain elements and procedures relating to 
private enterprise participation that a grantee should use in 
its planning process. 

Congress has responded twice to FTA's 1984/1986 policy 
initiative on private enterprise participation, on both 
occasions acting to restrain the agency. First, in the 
Conference Report accompanying the Department of Transportation 
and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1987 (Pub. L. 99-464), 
Congress expressed concern that FTA had exceeded its discretion 
by conditioning certain section 9 grants on private enterprise 
involvement; section 327 of that Act prohibited such 
conditioning of section 9 formula grants. 

Second, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 
1991, Pub. L. 102-240, (ISTEA) amended section 8(i)(5) of the FT 
Act to add the following: 




The Secretary shall not withhold certification under this 
section based upon the policies and criteria established by a metropolitan 
planning organization or transit grant recipient for 
determining the feasibility of private enterprise 
----participation in accordance with section 8(o) of the Federal 
Transit Act. 




Thus, on the one hand, section 3(e) requires that FTA make a 
finding that the MPO has appropriately encouraged private 
enterprise participation; on the other, this new provision 
requires that in considering whether to certify that an MPO is 
meeting its obligations under Federal law, FTA may not consider 
the process used by the MPO (or a transit grant recipient) to 
determine the feasibility of private enterprise participation. 
Moreover, the ISTEA Conference Committee Report states that 
under section 8(i)(5), ``localities shall be afforded wide 
flexibility in establishing criteria to be used in determining 
the `feasibility' of private involvement in local programs.'' 
Clearly, then, Congress signaled FTA that it is to pay as 
significant deference to MPO judgments as to feasibility. 

In the Notice, FTA stated that it had reviewed its policy in 
light of the statutory background and believed that the 
1984/1986 initiatives should no longer be part of its guidance. 
The Notice pointed out that FTA has not generally provided 
advance notice and opportunity for comment when adopting or 
rescinding the circulars it uses to provide guidance to 
grantees. FTA invited public comment on the 1984 Policy 
Statement and Circular 7005.1 only after their issuance as final 
documents. In this proceeding, however, FTA has provided prior 
notice of its proposal to change policy consistent with ISTEA to 
remove unnecessary Federal direction of local parties' discharge 
of their planning responsibilities under the FT Act and to 
thereby give full weight to the local decisionmaking process. 
FTA invited comments on its proposed action during the 60 days 
following publication of the Notice. 

Before summarizing the comments generally, we will briefly address 
two issues. First, a few commenters suggest, in effect, that 
the agency's action to rescind the previous policy represents a 
retreat from the statute's requirements. We firmly disagree. 
The participation of private enterprise in the Nation's transit 
industry is not only encouraged by the FT Act, it is essential 
to the health and success of that industry. The question 
addressed in this notice is not whether, but how, FTA will go 
about encouraging that participation.

Second, this question is essentially one of policy choices. An earlier administration chose to play an active Federal
role in restricting the options of MPOs and grantees in their consideration of private enterprise participation
(e.g., requiring the use of a particular accounting method and mandating route reviews every three years). The program
it developed, based on 20-year-old statutory provisions previously unelaborated by the agency and adopted without
the benefit of prior notice and comment, can be argued to have been a fair exercise of the discretion vested in an administrative
agency wrestling with policy choices. But as discussed at greater length below, the claims of a few commenters that
the previous policy had, in effect, taken on some kind of quasi-statutory status cannot withstand scrutiny. As the
Supreme Court has noted, 




An agency to which Congress has delegated policymaking responsibilities may, within the limits of that delegation,
properly rely upon the incumbent administration's views of wise policy to inform its judgments. While agencies are
not directly accountable to the people, the Chief Executive is, and it is entirely appropriate for this political
branch of the Government to make such policy choices * * *







Chevron U.S.A. 

v. 

Natural Resources Defense Council

, 497 U.S. 837, 865-866 (1984). 




In the transportation arena, new State and Federal mandates_the Americans with Disabilities Act and mandated drug
and alcohol testing, for example_require new programs and services, but the availability of Federal operating assistance
to help pay the costs of these programs remains limited. Given the increasingly limited funds available, it is local
decisionmakers responsible for meeting the transit needs of the community who most keenly feel the need to obtain
the most transit service possible with the funds available. 


III. Summary of Comments 


A. -Overview 



Some 415 comments were received in response to the Notice from commenters representing a variety of views and interests,
including transit systems, private operators, unions, and members of Congress: 


--Transit systems and government entities 
73 Private operators--- 
263 --Unions------
55 --Members of Congress----
24 





In general, private operators opposed the proposed recision, arguing that the existing private enterprise policy
was effective and consistent with the FT Act, brought needed competition to the provision of transit services, and
helped lower the cost of those services. Unions, a number of transit systems, and others, in contrast, took the view
that the current policy needlessly creates paperwork burdens and reviews that are time consuming and not relevant
to privatization efforts, which should be left to the local decisionmaking process. Many commenters simply expressed
general support for or opposition to the policies under review. 

B. -Summary of Comments by Issue 

1. Procedural Objections 



While many commenters addressed the substance of the proposal, a few asserted that the manner in which the agency announced
its proposal, i.e., the Notice of Proposed Recision, was itself flawed. These commenters noted that the FT Act specifically
requires the agency to follow notice and comment procedures. The fact that an agency uses the term ``guidance'' or
``guideline'' is not controlling; the status of such materials as ``rules'' is determined by their binding character.
By rescinding the existing guidance, the commenters contend, the FTA will effectively create a new ``binding norm''
by establishing the standards and procedures by which the agency maintains it will fulfill its statutory obligation
to encourage participation of private transportation companies in transit service. Further, these commenters
argued, the existing guidance clearly is mandatory in nature. Because such guidance effectively is a rule, they assert,
the agency is obligated to comply with rulemaking procedures before amending or repealing the guidance. One commenter
cited a Supreme Court case to the effect that an agency changing its course by rescinding a rule is obligated to supply
reasoned analysis for the change beyond that which may be required when an agency acts in the first instance. In this
regard, commenters also alleged that, contrary to what FTA stated in its Notice, there is no significant record to
show that grantees have found the existing guidance burdensome. 

Another commenter noted that although certain specific protections and activities are explicitly and implicitly
contained in the FT Act, no process or procedure is prescribed in the statute for the enforcement of these requirements,
which is therefore left to the rulemaking process. Nor is the agency free to act independent of the administrative
record. The problem with the FTA analysis, asserted this commenter, is that it has failed to adhere to the requirement
that a nexus exist between the need for changes and the underlying, supportive facts. 

Another commenter argued that the agency had predetermined its final action on the Notice, notwithstanding its notice
and comment review period. This commenter maintained that the agency's Notice misstates the private enterprise
requirements, the statutory provisions, and the legislative history. This commenter also argued that the Notice
misrepresents the material in the agency's files, the agency's interpretations of the current requirements, and
the enforcement history of the program. 

On the other hand, many commenters supported the agency's proposal and the procedure by which it was announced. One
argued that much of the administrative burden imposed by the existing requirements could have been avoided or alleviated
had the policies been subjected to the 

Federal Register

 notice and comment process. 

2. Fully Allocated Cost Methodology 



The current private enterprise policies require that grantees use a fully allocated cost methodology when calculating
their costs of providing service for comparison with those of potential private operators. The Notice indicated,
however, that the method was not always an appropriate gauge of the true cost of providing a particular service and
that FTA believes that in comparing public and private costs of operating a particular service, a recipient should
be free to use any reasonable accounting method it finds appropriate in a given setting. A number of commenters particularly
supported this aspect of the Notice. They noted that they long have argued that the criteria and policies for choosing
among public and private providers should be left to local transit agencies and community planners and that the proper
role for the Federal government should be one of neutrality. The constraints imposed on local decisionmakers by the
fully allocated cost method resulted in service choices that not only failed to produce expected cost savings, but
resulted in serious service, safety, and maintenance problems as well, they contended.

One commenter stated that recision of the guidance would enable 
it to award contracts consistent with its Board's policy 
requiring it to consider only avoidable costs when evaluating 
the cost-effectiveness of private carrier proposals. This 
transit system argued that the avoidable cost method best 
measures the true cost savings achieved through the contracting 
of service. 
One commenter presented an analysis by a Columbia University 
professor of a report by a consulting company recommending, on 
the basis of a fully allocated cost methodology, that a large 
transit system privatize 25 percent of its transit bus service. 
Contrary to the cost savings projected in the report, the 
professor's study, using a marginal cost analysis, concluded 
that the proposed privatization program would produce no savings 
and, in fact, would cost the transit agency a considerable sum. 
Moreover, the commenter argued, the proposal would result in 
seriously fragmented service and the associated organizational, 
safety, and service problems evidenced in other cities that 
privatized on this basis. 
Another commenter argued that experience throughout the country 
indicates that forced privatization efforts have resulted in 
significant cost increases, serious service problems, and 
ridership and revenue losses. This submission provided examples 
of areas where privatization allegedly increased costs. In one 
case, an audit showed that projected savings of 30-40 percent 
were actually in the 3 to 4 percent range. The commenter 
contended that because the fully allocated cost analysis 
requires public agencies to include their fixed costs as part of 
their bottom line as well as costs incurred for buses and 
employees, comparisons on this basis are fundamentally flawed. 
They contended that fixed costs should not be included among the 
costs of a public transit operator because these costs will be 
incurred regardless of whether the particular service is offered 
or not. 
On the other hand, some commenters argued in favor of the fully 
allocated cost methodology. By standardizing the way costs are 
counted, they contended, the fully allocated cost method can 
reduce transactional costs, help highlight and eliminate 
cross-subsidies, and improve accountability and transparency. 
One commenter argued: (1) That permitting public transit 
agencies to submit cost of service bids based solely on the 
short-run marginal cost of service would result in calculations 
that ignore the costs of facilities and rolling stock and assume 
that the public transit agency operates its system at the least 
possible cost; (2) that marginal cost analysis does not permit 
the riding public and taxpaying public to compare the total 
costs of service for the transit system with and without the 
proposed alternative service patterns of providers of service; 
(3) that direct comparisons of labor productivity between the 
public transit agency and private contractors would be difficult 
or impossible since the bases for calculating costs would be 
different, as might the reliability and quality of the service 
in question; and (4) that fully allocated cost comparisons are 
intended to permit a transparent view of the costs of existing 
and proposed services and the acquisitions of assets and 
liabilities that may be relevant. 
Another commenter noted that concern about using fully 
allocated costs is misplaced in that the disclosure of all costs 
is designed to level the playing field in light of Federal and 
other subsidies available to public operators. This commenter 
further noted that the fully allocated cost method is an 
analytical baseline, more of a disclosure than an absolute sum, 
and that fully allocated costs may be discounted for costs that 
cannot be saved when determining the feasibility of using 
private contractors. 



3. Institutional Barriers 



The current policy requires that local authorities ignore local 
law when considering the feasibility of using private enterprise 
in local transit service. That is, under the current private 
enterprise policy, FTA does not recognize, as legitimate 
barriers to private enterprise participation, local laws or 
policy or labor agreements that call for direct operation of 
mass transit service. Many commenters maintained that this 
position unduly restricts the prerogatives of local officials 
and impedes their ability to consider a broad range of transit 
options. They also argued that the successful negotiation of 
collective bargaining agreements often requires that transit 
officials be accorded a maximum degree of bargaining 
flexibility. The comments in response to this point varied: 
unions and certain transit systems argued for flexibility in 
light of unique local situations. Private operators argued in 
favor of a ``level playing field'' so that local arrangements are 
not used to bar private operators from being considered for the 
purpose of providing public transit services. 
A commenter argued that FTA must balance the two often 
conflicting provisions of the FT Act: the section 13(c) labor 
protection provisions and the private enterprise provisions. To 
the extent that FTA reduces the private enterprise requirements 
while the 13(c) requirement continues in full effect, this 
commenter argued, the balance will inevitably be altered and 
riders of public transit will be harmed by the imbalance. 
Another commenter noted that Federal financial assistance 
necessarily comes with overriding Federal requirements, e.g., 
procurement rules, that follow the Federal dollar. It is 
inconsistent, the commenter contended, for an agency to impose 
Federal procurement requirements on grantees, but at the same 
time to permit them to thwart the purposes and conditions of 
Federal assistance merely by agreeing with third parties such as 
unions. If, continued the commenter, the concern about 
institutional barriers is labor protection, then one must 
consider that section 13(c) of the Act contains express 
provisions for the protection of labor. If Congress intended 
to exempt contrary provisions of labor agreements from the 
private enterprise mandates of the Act, it would have done so; 
breaking down institutional barriers is a necessary precondition 
to enabling competition to develop new and more efficient means 
to deliver transit services. 
On the other hand, others argued against using the transit 
program to override State constitutional prohibitions, State and 
local laws and referenda, rulings of State regulatory bodies, 
and local collective bargaining agreements. This policy, they 
contended, has had the net effect of depriving local 
transportation leaders of the flexibility to determine to what 
extent privatization is in the best interest of their local 
communities. 
Indeed, a member of Congress commented that ``the ISTEA and 
prior congressional directives have emphasized that the criteria 
and policies for choosing among public and private providers 
should be left to local transit agencies and community planners 
and that the proper role for the Federal government should be 
one of neutrality on this essentially local decision.'' The 
proposal, the same member noted, ``properly reflects the emphasis 
on local decision-making which I and other architects intended 
in the ISTEA.'' Similarly, a United States Senator noted that 
``the new language (in the Notice of Proposed Recision) properly 
reflects the intent of ISTEA.'' And: ``The ISTEA emphasized that 
the criteria for choosing among public and private transit 
providers should be left to local transit agencies and community 
officials.'' 



4. Review of Existing Service 



The existing private enterprise policy provides that recipients 
should review each route every three years to determine whether 
the services in question could be more effectively provided by 
private operators. FTA noted that this represented a 
significant burden, particularly for major transit systems, and 
indicated that local authorities should determine the frequency 
of any such reviews.

<TEXT>
 

Those commenters opposed to this requirement contended that it 
is burdensome and unnecessary, while those in favor argued that 
it forces systems to review routes on a regular basis, giving 
private operators an opportunity to make their case. 
One transit system commenter noted that the requirement was 
``oddly redundant'' since all of its service already was provided 
by the private sector, and noted that it was a burden because of 
the inordinate amount of staff time required to complete the 
task. A Senator stated that the agency's proposed action 
``wisely reduces burdensome paper work and other restrictive 
requirements, while retaining options of private enterprise 
participation.'' 
A large transit system stated that the current requirements 
entail a significant administrative burden for many transit 
agencies with large and complex route structures, necessitating 
the diversion of significant resources to conducting reviews on 
a three-year cycle. Another transit operator stated that the 
requirement places an inordinate planning burden on it, without 
any corresponding benefits. Rather than such a mandated 
approach, this operator supported route analysis based on local 
needs and considerations and noted that it carries on an ongoing 
analysis of service levels required to meet demand. 
Commenters supporting this requirement, in contrast, contended 
that contracting out has saved significant sums and that the 
three-year review period is necessary to realize these savings, 
as well as for the agency to satisfy the private enterprise 
provisions in the statute. One commenter stated that the 
three-year review helps to ensure efficiency and effectiveness 
in the delivery of transit services. Competition, this 
commenter noted, requires periodic review of results. Whatever 
FTA's view on three-year reviews of routes, this commenter 
continued, the claim that they are burdensome is without 
foundation. 



5. Appeal Process 



The private sector circulars provide that both recipients and 
MPOs should develop a process for the resolution of disputes 
with private operators, with an appeal to FTA available to 
private operators if they fail to resolve disputes at the local 
level. In the Notice, FTA indicated that since it would be 
conducting regular reviews of grantee compliance with planning 
requirements, a formal appeal process leading to FTA did not 
appear necessary, although the agency is always available to 
receive reports of planning process failures. 
This aspect of the Notice did not generate much specific 
comment, but appeared to be included in the general opposition 
to ``burdensome'' requirements on the part of some commenters, and 
on the other hand, to be one of the elements that those in favor 
of the existing guidance support. 
One commenter noted that, in response to a Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) request, it was provided with FTA's 
private sector complaint decisions: of the twelve complaints, 
eight were dismissed for failure to state a cognizable claim; 
two were remanded for failure to have a local dispute process; 
and two included findings of violations with no penalties 
imposed. This record, the commenter argued, underscores the 
lack of burden created by the FTA appellate process. 




IV. FTA Response To Comments 



A. Procedural and Legal Adequacy of the Notice 



1. Procedural Objections 



Several commenters objected to the Notice as failing to meet 
the rulemaking requirement of section 12(i)(3) of the FT Act: 
``The Secretary shall propose or implement rules governing 
activities under this Act only in accordance with this section 
except for routine matters and matters having no significant 
impact.'' They pointed out that in the Notice, FTA acknowledged 
that the proposed recision of its private enterprise guidance is 
``a relatively significant change''; consequently, they argued, 
the section 12(i)(3) rulemaking requirement applies to this 
proceeding. Section 12 defines a ``rule'' as a ``statement of 
general or particular applicability designed to implement, 
interpret, or prescribe law or policy in carrying out provisions 
of this Act'' and requires the following procedures:

 


(i) Rulemaking procedures. 

(1) Procedures. 

The Secretary shall provide an agenda listing all areas in which 
the Secretary intends to propose rules governing activities 
under this chapter within the following twelve-month period. 
The Secretary shall publish the proposed agenda in the 

Federal 
Register

 as part of the Secretary's semi-annual rulemaking 
agenda which lists rulemaking activities of (FTA). The 
Secretary shall also transmit the Agenda required by the first 
sentence of this paragraph to [various committees] on the day 
that the Secretary's semi-annual rulemaking agenda is published 
in the 

Federal Register

. 

(2) Views. 

Except for emergency rules, the Secretary shall give interested 
parties not less than sixty days to participate in any 
rulemaking under this chapter through submission of written 
data, views, arguments with or without the opportunity for oral 
presentation, except when the Secretary for good cause finds 
that public notice and comment are unnecessary due to the 
routine nature or matter or insignificant impact of the rule, or 
that an emergency rule should be promulgated. The Secretary may 
extend the 60-day period if the Secretary determines that such a 
period is insufficient for diligent persons to prepare comments 
or that other circumstances justify an extension of time. An 
emergency rule shall terminate 120 days after the date on which 
it is promulgated. 

(3) Limitation.

<TEXT>
 

The Secretary shall propose or implement rules governing 
activities under this Act only in accordance with this section except for routine matters and matters having no significant
impact.



The Secretary's most recent semi-annual agenda of rulemaking 
activities was published on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 56632). As 
the agenda indicates, it was based on reports submitted by the 
Department's initiating offices in July 1993, five months prior 
to the publication of the Notice and well before the agency had 
formulated its proposal. We do not believe that the publication 
requirement serves to foreclose FTA's ability to proceed with 
proposals to amend rules or guidance that were developed 
subsequent to the most recently published agenda and prior to 
the next. Moreover, as the agenda itself notes, its purpose is 
to ``enable the public to be more aware of and allow it to more 
effectively participate in the Department's regulatory 
activity.'' This objective has been clearly met, as an 
extraordinarily large number of commenters have participated in 
this proceeding. FTA has complied with the public 
participation requirement by providing prior notice and a 60-day 
public comment period. FTA believes that in this proceeding 
it has met the requirements of section 12(i). 
Two commenters in particular objected to the path FTA has 
followed, arguing that FTA should instead conduct a rulemaking 
proceeding under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 
5 U.S.C. 553, that would entail a notice of proposed rulemaking 
and provide for public comment. FTA finds this essentially 
semantical argument to be without merit. These commenters 
identified no procedural defects in the process FTA has 
followed, nor did they assert any prejudice to their ability to 
meaningfully participate. In short, these commenters simply 
argue that FTA's action is legally defective because it titled 
its November notice, ``Notice of Proposed Recision * * *,'' 
instead of ``Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.'' FTA believes that 
since it has followed the notice and comment procedure of 
section 12(i), the labels used are irrelevant. We note also 
that, although the APA requires prior notice and comment, that 
requirement does not apply to a matter relating to a Federal 
grant program. 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2). 
The objection of these commenters would have been more valid in 
the context of the process used to adopt the current policies. 
In 1984 and 1986, FTA did not provide prior notice and 
opportunity for comment. If these commenters believed the 
policies then issued in final form without prior notice or 
comment to constitute a ``binding norm,'' they could have gone to 
court asserting the consequent invalidity of the 1984/1986 
guidance. 
In the past, FTA has issued guidance in the form of statements 
of policy and circulars. For example, FTA has issued circulars 
addressing third-party procurement, cross-border leasing, and 
suspension and debarment. Thus, FTA's 1984/1986 guidance was 
consistent with its general practice. 
Even if FTA wanted to use the label favored by these 
commenters_thus agreeing that action to rescind the 1984/1986 
guidance constitutes rulemaking_it would have faced a certain 
awkwardness. Issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking to propose 
the amendment of a rule generally refers to something codified 
in the Code of Federal Regulations. Here, no such target 
exists; accordingly, FTA judged that a proposal to rescind the 
current nonregulatory guidance, especially when providing prior 
notice and comment, would be appropriate and would adequately 
serve the evident public interest in this issue. 


2. Objections Based on the Record- 


Two commenters argued that the Notice fails to state a 
rationale for recision of the guidance and is thus legally 
defective. They cited 

Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association 


v. 

State Farm Mutual Insurance,

 463 U.S. 29, 42 (1983), in which 
the Court held that ``an agency changing its course by rescinding 
a rule is obligated to supply a reasoned analysis for the change 
beyond that which may be required when an agency acts in the 
first instance.'' They pointed out that FTA based its proposal, 
in part, on its belief that some grant recipients have found 
elements of the policy to be burdensome. They noted that in 
response to a request for documents under the Freedom of 
Information Act, FTA produced few such written grantee 
complaints. They concluded that FTA has acted in an arbitrary 
and capricious manner, since it has not supplied the ``reasoned 
analysis for the change'' required by 

State Farm. 
We note, however, that elsewhere in State Farm,

 which involved 
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) 
recision of a passive restraint requirement for automobiles, the 
Court stated:




Recision of the passive restraint requirement would not be 
arbitrary and capricious simply because there was no evidence in 
direct support of the agency's conclusion. It is not infrequent 
that the available data do not settle a regulatory issue, and 
the agency must then exercise its judgment in moving from the 
facts and probabilities on the record to a policy conclusion. 


--- 



Id. 

at 44.

 

The question, then, is not whether FTA has evidence in support 
of its belief that grantees find the current policy burdensome. 
Indeed, the Court invalidated NHTSA's finding that the passive 
restraint requirement was unnecessary not because it lacked 
supporting evidence, but because there was substantial evidence 
to contradict that finding. Moreover, 

State Farm

 involved 
review of a final rule, and no court has held that an agency 


proposal

 is somehow invalid for lack of a sufficient record. 
FTA believes that the record it has developed in this proceeding 
fully supports the action it is here announcing.

Here, FTA finds that the weight of the documentary evidence in 
its records, including responses of grantees to complaints by 
private operators, protests from labor unions representing 
transit workers, and documented failures of specific 
privatization programs to realize cost savings or improvements 
in service quality, strongly indicates that the policy has 
imposed significant administrative and financial burdens on 
recipients, while conferring little measurable benefit on public 
transit providers and users. In addition, many comments to this 
docket support FTA's judgment. 
The current policy was not developed with the benefit of prior 
notice and comment and is thus not due the same deference as a 
rule so developed, as was the rule at issue in 

State Farm. 

In 
addition, the effects of the current policy have not been the 
subject of scientific study or extensive research. FTA must 
accordingly base its new approach to the participation of 
private enterprise on its experience in administering the 
current policy, on the insight developed in this proceeding, and 
on recent legislation emphasizing greater local decisionmaking 
such as the ISTEA amendment to section 8(i)(5) of the FT Act. 
Of course, FTA has broad statutory authority in developing its 
approach to implementing the private sector provisions of the FT 
Act, ``an administrative decision which is essentially an 
exercise of discretion.'' 

South Suburban Safeway Lines, Inc. 

v. 


City of Chicago, 

416 F.2d 535, 539 (7th Cir. 1969). 
In a decision handed down a year after 

State Farm,

 the Supreme 
Court emphasized the deference that must be given to an agency's 
judgments within the agency's field of discretion and expertise. 
In 

Chevron,

 the Court upheld an Environmental Protection Agency 
rule under the Clean Air Act allowing states to treat all 
pollution-emitting devices within the same industrial grouping 
as though they were encased in a single ``bubble.'' Having 
determined that Congress had not expressed any specific 
intention regarding the applicability of the statutory 
provisions in question, the Court decided that the only question 
on review was whether or not the agency's interpretation was a 
``reasonable one'' in light of the environmental and policy 
objectives of the statute. For a unanimous Court, Justice 
Stevens stated that 



An agency to which Congress has delegated policymaking 
responsibilities may, within the limits of that delegation, 
properly rely upon the incumbent administration's views of wise 
policy to inform its judgments. While agencies are not directly 
accountable to the people, the Chief Executive is, and it is 
entirely appropriate for this political branch of the Government 
to make such policy choices_resolving the competing interests 
which Congress itself either inadvertently did not resolve, or 
intentionally left to be resolved by the agency charged with 
the administration of the statute in light of everyday realities. 

When a challenge to an agency construction of a statutory 
provision, fairly conceptualized, really centers on the wisdom 
of the agency's policy rather than whether it is a reasonable 
choice within a gap left by Congress, the challenge must fail. 
In such a case, federal judges_who have no constituency_have a 
duty to respect legitimate policy choices made by those who do.

Citing 

Morton 

v. 

Ruiz, 

415 U.S. 199, 231 (1974), the Court 
noted that ``the power of an administrative agency to administer 
a congressionally created * * * program necessarily requires 
the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any 
gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress.'' 

Id. 

at 844. 
In enacting the private enterprise provisions of the FT Act, 
sections 3(e), 8(o), and 9(f), Congress did not indicate how 
they were to be applied or implemented. Indeed, for the first 
20 years, 1964-1984, the private enterprise provisions were 
regarded as largely self executing, as FTA issued neither formal 
nor informal guidance until 1984 and 1986. Instead, Congress 
left decisions concerning the implementation of the provisions 
to the discretion of the FTA Administrator. 

South Suburban 

at 
539. 
In the FT Act, Congress made it clear that decisions regarding 
mass transportation services to be provided with Federal 
assistance are to be made locally; indeed, section 2(b) states 
that one of the fundamental purposes of the Act is 



To provide assistance to State and local governments and their 
instrumentalities in financing such systems, to be operated by 
public or private mass transportation companies 

as determined by 
local needs.






49 U.S.C. app. 1601(b)(3)(emphasis added).



Congress further declared that ``[i]t is the purpose of this Act 
to create a partnership which permits the local community, 
through Federal financial assistance, to exercise the initiative 
necessary to satisfy its urban mass transportation 
requirements.'' 49 U.S.C. app. 1601(a)(emphasis added). This 
emphasis on local decisionmaking in determining how best to 
serve the transportation needs of the local area has been 
recognized by the courts:



The statutory scheme of (FTA) emphasizes the large role to be 
played by local bodies responsible for mass transit * * *. This reliance on the local group is consistent
with the statute's encouragement of local responsibility in urban mass transportation. The statute does not -promote
a procedure which leaves all decisions with the Secretary (of Transportation), but rather emphasizes local solutions
to problems.




Pullman 

v. 

Volpe 

at 438-439. 



This original congressional intent that local decisionmakers 
determine the feasibility of private enterprise involvement has 
been reiterated in a recent amendment to section 8(i)(5) of the 
FT Act made by ISTEA, which prohibits FTA from withholding 
certification of a MPO on the basis of its private enterprise 
policies or those of a recipient. Section 8(i)(5) thus 
reinforces the fundamental statutory principle on this issue: 
local decisionmakers should make the decision as to whether 
transit service should be publicly or privately operated.

The recently issued joint FTA/Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) statewide and metropolitan planning regulations
(49 CFR part 613 and 23 CFR part 450) offer an appropriate vehicle for such local decisionmaking. These regulations
require a process for demonstrating explicit consideration of and response to public views, including those of private
operators of transit service, during the planning and program development process provided for in 23 CFR 450.212(a)(5)
and 450.316(b)(1)(v). FTA believes that these processes will afford private operators ample opportunity to express
their views and comments on the development of transit programs, while allowing local officials to encourage the
participation of private enterprise to the maximum extent feasible. 

Some commenters questioned the wisdom of FTA's proposed recision of the current policy, stating that this action
would ``cause irreparable economic harm to the private surface transportation industry.'' They indicated that
recision would impede the statutory goal of developing responsive and widely accessible transit services. One commenter
cited a report containing data from FTA's section 15 report showing that from 1984 to 1990, contracted revenue miles
increased from 2.8 percent of total mass transit revenue miles to 4.2 percent. However, a close examination of the
report shows both annual increases and decreases during those years in contracted revenue miles, with no clear trend
apparent. The author notes that overall, ``the numbers indicate that the extent of contracted bus service is relatively
low and the trend has been stable with only modest increases.'' He also acknowledges that the report ``does not address
performance areas such as safety, reliability, and overall quality of service.'' The commenter observed that contracted
services, which he claims have been consistently shown to produce cost savings for local transit agencies, are still
a very small share of the total market. The commenter claimed that ``the situation would be much worse without the increase
in transit services brought about by the (current) FTA policies and guidance,'' but provided no evidence for this
assertion. 

Other commenters cited reports detailing specific experiences of transit authorities with privatization of bus
routes, including one FTA-funded demonstration project, that resulted in limited or no cost savings and a decrease
in service quality and reliability. They stated that implementation of FTA's private sector requirements has often
placed an undue and unnecessary burden on staff because of a lack of interest by private operators or their inability
to provide the type of services required. 

Commenters opposed to the recision failed to provide substantive evidence demonstrating that the current policy
has resulted in a significant increase in private sector involvement in the provision of mass transit services or
assisted in the development and improvement of mass transit systems; accordingly, FTA cannot agree that recision
will cause financial harm to private operators or prevent the agency from accomplishing its statutory mission. The
evidence presented, even by commenters opposed to the recision, indicates that the existing requirements have been
of limited effectiveness and questionable utility in furthering private sector involvement in mass transit. FTA
therefore believes that its decision to allow local authorities to make their own determinations concerning private
enterprise involvement without rigid Federal mandates is justified by the record before the agency, reasonable
in light of the objectives of the FT Act, and responsive to the specific provisions of the statute. 

Several commenters opposed the recision on the ground that it represents an abrogation by FTA of its responsibility
to enforce the private sector provisions of the FT Act. They claimed that without the current requirements, FTA will
be unable to ensure the participation of private enterprise ``to the maximum extent feasible,'' as required by the
statute. 

FTA strongly disagrees. As indicated above, the available data do not demonstrate that the current requirements
are effective. In our view, no commenter has established a causal relationship between the implementation of the
requirements and increased private enterprise participation. On the other hand, public transit authorities have
cited specific examples of hardship or undue burdens caused by the imposition of the existing guidance. FTA therefore
believes that it is justified in exercising its administrative and policymaking discretion by implementing the
private sector provisions in a manner consistent with the statutory scheme and reinforced by ISTEA, i.e., through
local decisionmaking rather than through Federal mandates. 

One commenter alleged that FTA did not open the comment period for this proceeding prepared to evaluate fully and fairly
all the comments submitted, but rather with a fixed and predetermined purpose to ``paper'' its previously decided
action. The commenter submitted as evidence of FTA's prejudgment certain statements made by the Administrator before
a trade association group prior to commencement of this proceeding, indicating that the agency found the current
private enterprise requirements inappropriate and burdensome and intended to seek their recision. FTA finds nothing
improper in the Administrator's comments. 

In 

Association of National Advertisers 

v. 

FTC, 

627 F.2d 1151 (D.C. Cir. 1979), 

cert. denied, 

447 U.S. 921 (1980), the court ruled that certain statements made by the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission prior
to a rulemaking proceeding under the Federal Trade Commission Improvements Act did not disqualify the Chairman from
participation in or invalidate the proceeding. The court emphasized that the Chairman's presentation to a trade
group of his views on issues later addressed in the rulemaking was a valid exercise of his policymaking prerogatives:
``The view of a neutral and detached adjudicator is simply an inapposite role model for an administrator who must translate
broad statutory commands into concrete social policies. If an agency official is to be effective, he must engage in
debate and discussion about the policy matters before him.''

453 U.S. 913 (1981). 

Indeed, stated the court,

 


One cannot even conceive of an agency conducting a rulemaking proceeding unless it had delved into the subject sufficiently
to become concerned that there was an evil or abuse that required regulatory response. It would be the height of absurdity,
even a kind of abuse of administrative process, for an agency to embroil interested parties in a rulemaking proceeding,
without some initial concern that there was an abuse that needed remedying, a concern that would be set forth in the
accompanying statement of the purpose of the proposed rule. 

Investigation and policy-making are integral to the total function just as much as decisionmaking. It is appropriate
and indeed mandatory for agency heads and staff to maintain contacts with industry and consumer groups, trade associations
and press, congressmen of various persuasions, and to present views in interviews, speeches, meetings, conventions,
and testimony * * *

Accordingly, FTA finds that far from impairing the integrity of this proceeding, the Administrator's remarks cited
by the commenter reflect the agency's valid concern with the current private enterprise requirements. 



B. Review of Existing Service

Circular 7005.1 provides that recipients should review each of their routes every three years to determine whether
that service could be more effectively provided by private operators. FTA proposed to eliminate this provision,
since reports from grantees indicated that it entails a significant administrative burden, especially for major
grantees with large and complex route structures, requiring the devotion of substantial staff time to conducting
reviews on an arbitrary three-year cycle. 

Five commenters, one representing private transit providers and four representing public transit agencies, addressed
this issue. The commenter for the private sector termed an anomaly FTA's characterization of three-year route review
as an undue burden, since the FT Act calls for Federal review of a grantee's planning processes every three years. This
comment confuses FTA's statutory duty to conduct triennial reviews to ensure that transit programs comply with Federal
requirements with a nonstatutory, nonregulatory mandate that a grantee review all routes within its system, even
if use of a private operator is not feasible on its face or if, in fact, no private operator is available to provide service
on these routes. This commenter also indicated that three-year route review is necessary to stimulate competition
for transit services, but offered no evidence that the provision has ever been successful in increasing competitive
bidding opportunities. 

The four commenters on behalf of transit agencies supported recision of the provision, agreeing that it requires
an inordinate amount of staff time while producing few corresponding benefits. They emphasized that the decision
of whether to put routes out to competitive bid should be made by the local transit authority working with the community
and determined in the community's best interest. One grantee stated that the provision was redundant, since all of
its service is already provided under contract with private operators. Another agency objected to a Federal mandate,
suggesting on-going analyses of service to assess the cost-effectiveness and appropriate service levels required
to meet demand, with an evaluation of whether service should be put to competitive bid based on its location, service
area, deadhead miles, ridership level, and relationship to other services within the region. FTA agrees that use
of such factors should provide some grantees with a more rational basis for determining the frequency of route reviews
than the current mandatory three-year cycle, which, according to the commenters, is often an empty and time-consuming
exercise. 

FTA therefore concludes that the three-year reviews of service routes provided by Circular 7005.1 should no longer
be required. Instead, FTA encourages grantees to include periodic review of route service in the consultative process
required under section 9(f) of the FT Act (49 U.S.C. app. 1607a). Grantees should base the frequency of these reviews
on the factors cited above and any other factor a grantee finds relevant to its local circumstances. FTA believes that
route evaluation using this process will relieve grantees of an undue administrative burden, while resulting in
competitive bidding decisions that are based on appropriate and meaningful local factors. 



C. Fully Allocated Cost Analysis 



Circular 7005.1 provides that grantees should use a fully allocated cost methodology when providing service for
comparison with the costs of potential private operators. The use of this accounting methodology was intended to
ensure that local decisionmakers have considered all costs associated with the provision of service by a public agency.

In the Notice, FTA pointed out that the experience of many recipients shows that in the context of their operations,
the fully allocated cost methodology is not always an appropriate gauge of the true cost of providing a particular
service; in some cases, it takes into account costs already incurred or costs that remain fixed, such as salaries of
senior managers and other personnel who would be on the recipient's payroll regardless of whether the service was
operated by the recipient. Similarly, FTA has interpreted the current policy to require that recipients bid fully
allocated costs when competing with the private sector in response to a procurement solicited by a third party. FTA
now concludes that this requirement interferes with maximum open competition by artificially restricting price
competition between recipients and private enterprise. Moreover, FTA's ``Fully Allocated Cost Analysis Guidelines''
are set forth in a complex and lengthy document that imposes a significant administrative burden, especially on smaller
recipients that lack adequate staff resources. 

FTA proposed that in comparing public and private costs of operating a particular service, recipients should be free
to use any reasonable accounting methodology. FTA noted that cost is but one factor to be used in local decisionmaking
and that maximum feasible participation of private operators may depend on other factors, e.g., the ability to maintain
quality service, operate in a coordinated system, and provide an adequate measure of safety. 

Several commenters representing private operators and the majority of those representing public operators addressed
this issue. Private sector commenters, who overwhelmingly opposed the proposed recision, recalled that the intent
of the fully allocated cost methodology is to measure the true cost of a transit service, taking into account the direct
cost of service as well as the portion of shared costs attributable to the service in question. They argued that allowing
public operators to use marginal costs in comparative bid situations results in an unfair comparison of costs, which
in the majority of situations will favor public carriers, and provides a distorted picture of the real costs of public
operators to taxpayers. They stated that the fully allocated cost methodology is essential to evaluating the efficiency
and effectiveness of capital and operating dollars spent on transit. 

Public transit operators related, however, that practical experience with the fully allocated cost methodology
has produced less than favorable results. Several pointed out that the FTA guidelines are extremely complex and difficult
to apply, even by trained accounting staff. They noted that the fully allocated cost methodology is not a normal analytical
tool that has other applications. They stated that the calculation of ``fully allocated cost'' has caused a great
deal of controversy due to differing opinions about which model truly reflects the real world in which transit systems
operate. 

For instance, one grantee related that it spent $28,912 to have a consultant develop a cost allocation model that was
unusable in its delivered form. Numerous additional staff hours were required before the model was even marginally
useful, and the model must be updated every year through a cumbersome process. According to the grantee, the result
of this substantial investment has been more expenses due to litigation brought against it by private providers whose
opinion of how a fully allocated cost model ought to work differed from the grantee's. In the case of just one challenge
by a private operator, the grantee spent $19,125 to have a consultant audit cost comparisons. This figure does not
include legal fees associated with that complaint. 

Some grantees complained that certain private operators have taken advantage of the fully allocated cost requirement
to thwart local initiatives. One grantee, for example, stated that for 13 years, it provided demand response service
for 80 severely handicapped adults, taking them from home to their worksite. A private carrier convinced the mental
health agency overseeing the program to put the service out for bid. Because it was required to include all of its overhead
costs in the bid, the transit agency concluded that it could not compete with the private operator and chose not to bid.
The private operator then withdrew its original bid and renegotiated a fee structure approximately 50 percent higher
than its original bid. The mental health agency determined that it could not afford the service and rejected the bid.
As a result, a transit-dependent population, which had for 13 years been served by the transit agency, is now without
any transit service. 

One commenter for the private sector cited a report by a noted economist who, on the basis of a study of the utilities
industry, advocates the use of a fully allocated cost methodology, since ``years of experience in the electric power
industry have shown that cost analysis must be the same for both the buyer and the seller of electricity.'' 

However, a commenter supporting the recision provided an analysis of a specific FTA grantee privatization proposal
by another economist, who points out that the use of the FTA-mandated fully allocated cost methodology often results
in a skewed cost comparison. That methodology requires accounting for all of the grantee's fixed costs, from implementation
of the Americans with Disabilities Act requirements to police protection of transit property and system planning
and marketing. In contrast, private operators are not charged with responsibility for managing a regional transportation
network and usually provide only a limited amount of bus service. They are thus able to submit lower bids that do not
necessarily reflect the actual per-hour cost savings of privatizing service.

Many public transit agencies pointed out that even under the current guidance, cost is only one factor that grantees
may consider in determining whether or not to privatize service. The participation of private operators ``to the
maximum extent feasible'' may also depend on the quality, reliability, or the specialized nature of the service they
provide. Several grantees stated that, based on their own specific local needs, even if the requirements to use the
fully allocated cost methodology and other elements of the current guidance are rescinded, they will continue to
seek proposals for transit service from private providers. 

Given the complexity and difficulty of applying the fully allocated cost methodology and its dubious value as an analytical
tool, FTA concludes that grantees should no longer be required to use it when comparing public and private costs of
operating a particular service. Instead, recipients should use any reasonable and generally accepted accounting
method they find appropriate under their local circumstances. FTA believes that recision of this element will relieve
local officials of an undue administrative burden while increasing their flexibility to determine whether service
is ``to be operated by public or private mass transportation companies as determined by local needs,'' consistent
with section 2(b) of the FT Act. 



D. Local Institutional Barriers 



The 1984 Policy Statement and the circulars provide that FTA will not recognize, as acceptable limitations on private
enterprise participation, local institutional and policy constraints such as local labor agreements or local laws
or policy that call for direct operation of mass transit service. In the Notice, FTA noted the view of many grantees
that this position unduly restricts the prerogatives of local officials and impedes their ability to consider a broad
range of transit options. Moreover, the successful negotiation of collective bargaining agreements often requires
that transit officials be accorded a maximum degree of bargaining flexibility. 

Commenters representing the private sector objected to FTA's proposed recision of this policy. One argued that this
proposal, if adopted, would further entrench institutional barriers, resulting in a stifled marketplace, steadily
declining ridership, and steadily increasing costs for services. Another noted that Federal financial assistance
necessarily comes with overriding Federal conditions, such as ADA mandates or environmental quality requirements.
Generally speaking, these commenters maintained that breaking down institutional barriers is a necessary precondition
to enabling competition to develop new and more efficient means to deliver transit services. 

Commenters for the public sector supported FTA's proposal to recognize that there can be legitimate institutional
barriers to privatization. These commenters stated that FTA's use of the grant program to override state constitutional
prohibitions, state/local laws and referenda, rulings of state regulatory bodies, and local collective bargaining
agreements has had the net effect of depriving local transportation leaders of the flexibility to determine to what
extent privatization is in the best interest of their local community. Another commenter asserted that this aspect
of FTA's private enterprise guidance, and its often vigorous implementation, has encouraged grantees to renege
on or contravene the terms of collective bargaining agreements concluded under section 13(c) of the FT Act, which
mandates that grantees afford certain protections to transit workers. 

One grantee noted that as a result of a recent State Supreme Court ruling, the contracting out of bus routes is subject
to negotiation and binding arbitration with its labor union. Given that fixed route service is at the core of the collective
bargaining unit's work function, the grantee stated, the union's concurrence in any decision to privatize existing
fixed route bus service is unlikely. 

Another grantee stated that it was adversely affected by this failure to recognize institutional barriers when,
in 1989 and 1990, FTA refused to make two section 9 grant awards because local requirements in section 13(c) agreements
required the successful proposer to take on the employees of the outgoing private operators. FTA held that this successor
employer clause was unacceptable under the FT Act because the provision limited the ability of proposers to submit
competitive bids. The issue was resolved only when Congress adopted special legislation allowing the particular
grantee's use of the successor clause. Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of
1991, Public Law 501-516, section 335, and Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations
Act of 1993, Public Law 102-388, section 342. A review of FTA files reveals several similar instances in which
grantees were threatened with suspension or withdrawal of FTA funds because of the existence of local institutional
barriers to private sector participation in their mass transit programs. 

A commenter for the private sector noted that the congressional action mentioned above was limited in applicability
to one particular grantee and argued that one can therefore infer congressional approval of the overall existing
policy. FTA finds that argument entirely speculative. Congress has never specifically approved this or any other
aspect of the current private enterprise policy. Congress' intervention in that case is instead consistent with
its pattern since 1984 of allowing FTA discretion in defining and implementing the private sector provisions, but
of curtailing the agency's action when it threatened local officials' wide discretion in determining the feasibility
of using private operators. FTA believes, moreover, that in view of such legal and collective bargaining impediments,
the requirement that a grantee ignore institutional barriers to private sector involvement is not reasonable. It
sometimes places grantees in the untenable position of being required to violate State or local laws, court rulings,
or the terms of their own statutorily mandated collective bargaining agreements in order to receive funds under the
FT Act, which states that such funds may be used to provide service ``to be operated by public or private mass transportation
companies, as determined by local needs.'' 49 U.S.C. app. 1601(b)(3). Accordingly, this aspect of the guidance is
an unacceptable restraint on a grantee's statutory responsibility to determine what level of private sector involvement
is feasible based on particular local factors. FTA further notes that, like other elements of the current policy,
the institutional barriers provision does not rest on specific statutory authority, but instead was adopted for
policy reasons, without prior notice and comment.

One commenter states that FTA's proposed acceptance of 
institutional barriers to private sector involvement is 
inconsistent with Executive Order 12893 (January 26, 1994), 
which provides that ``agencies should work with State and local 
enities to minimize legal and regulatory barriers to private 
sector participation in the provision of infrastructure 
facilities and services.'' This commenter maintains that 
recision would undermine this policy. The Executive Order makes 
it clear, however, that encouragement of private sector 
participation, like the other principles of sound infrastructure 
management, is to be implemented through efficient State and 
local programs. Accordingly, the Executive Order directs that 
Federal agencies work with State and local entities to minimize 
such institutional barriers, not to mandate that local officials 
overlook them. Indeed, by stating that institutional barriers 
should be minimized rather than ignored, the Executive Order 
recognizes that such barriers exist and must be taken into 
account by local officials in determining the feasibility of 
private sector involvement. FTA finds, therefore, that recision 
of its current guidance concerning institutional barriers to privatization is fully consistent with Executive
Order 12893. 



FTA finds that no data demonstrate that the current policy has 
resulted in increased private sector involvement and that the 
current policy has curbed the ability of local communities to 
determine which transit options best meet the needs of their 
community. FTA believes that this recision of the previous 
policy will restore to local transit officials the flexibility 
they need to determine to what extent privatization is feasible 
without the imposition of a Federal mandate that has often 
disrupted the grantmaking process and jeopardized the balance 
between Federal and State/local requirements. 




E. Appeal Process 





The circulars provide that both recipients and MPOs should 
develop a process for the resolution of disputes with private 
operators. Private operators may appeal to FTA if they fail to 
resolve their disputes at the local level. Pursuant to this 
provision, FTA has rendered administrative decisions following 
an investigation of disputes. In certain of these decisions 
under the current policy, FTA has indicated that it would 
withhold Federal funds from grant recipients that failed to 
conform to an FTA determination. In the Notice, FTA stated that 
since it will be conducting regular reviews of grantees' 
compliance with the planning requirements, a formal appeal 
process leading to FTA does not appear necessary. 



Commenters for the private sector supported a continued role by 
FTA in the private sector complaint process. One commenter 
stated that by proposing to do away with the appeal process, FTA 
is showing that it will not enforce the statutory requirements 
of the FT Act. Another noted that of the 12 private enterprise 
complaints brought to FTA since the current private sector 
policy was adopted, eight were dismissed outright because the 
grantee had committed no procedural error, two resulted in 
remands to the grantee, and in all but one other case, the 
grantee's decision was upheld. This, argues the commenter, ``is 
not a record of heavy-handed federal interference in local 
decisionmaking.'' 



FTA agrees that the appeal process has not played a significant 
role in furthering the private enterprise provisions of the FT 
Act. The figures cited by this commenter reveal that the 
process has in fact resulted in lengthy and cumbersome delays 
(FTA has taken up to two years to decide certain matters) and 
has had little impact on the local decisionmaking process or on 
the level of private sector involvement. A review of FTA 
records indicates that in the one case in which a grantee was 
cited for a violation of the private enterprise provisions and 
ordered to reopen a certain route to private sector bids, no 
private operator submitted a bid to provide service on the 
route. 



FTA therefore concludes that the appeal process has been a 
fruitless exercise. Periodic FTA reviews should ensure that 
grantees are in compliance with the planning requirements for 
local participation without needless Federal intrusion and 
additional paperwork and administrative burdens on both grantees 
and FTA. FTA will therefore eliminate the appeal to FTA. 
However, FTA notes that the agency may investigate and take 
action in the case of any failure by a grantee or MPO to follow 
Federal requirements. Since private enterprise participation in 
the planning process is mandated by ISTEA and the new 
metropolitan and statewide planning regulations (49 CFR part 613 
and 23 CFR part 450), FTA will monitor and investigate any 
apparent failures by grantees and MPOs to follow the procedures 
set out in their own local planning process.

V. FTA's Final Action 




In keeping with congressional intent that FTA carefully respect the prerogatives of local decisionmakers with regard
to the participation of private enterprise in the provision of mass transit, FTA is rescinding its 1984 Policy Statement
(49 FR 41310, October 22, 1984), Circular 7005.1, Chapter X of Circular 9040.1C, and Chapter IV of Circular 9070.1C.
The recision of this guidance will become effective thirty days after publication of this notice. 


FTA's recision of the current guidance is based on its judgment that the requirements it imposes, while ineffective,
have unduly infringed on the decisionmaking authority that local officials are entitled to exercise under the FT
Act. FTA believes that this recision is within the broad limits of its authority under the FT Act, that it is, in fact,
``an admi
