SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issued interim regulations on December 7, 1993, which allow a Cabinet Secretary
to redelegate his or her authority to approve coverage of individual law enforcement, and firefighter positions
under the special retirement provisions of CSRS. The Secretary of Agriculture is delegating authority to make special
retirement coverage determinations on CSRS positions to the Assistant Secretary for Administration. This rule
relates to internal agency management. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, notice of proposed rule making and opportunity
for comment are not required, and this rule may be made effective less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. Further, since this rule relates to internal agency management, it is exempt from the provisions of Executive Order
Nos. 12778 and 12866. Finally, this action is not a rule as defined by Pub. L. No. 96-354, the Regulatory Flexibility
Act, and, thus, is exempt from the provisions of that Act.

Spearmint Oil Produced in the Far West; Revision of the Salable Quantity and Allotment Percentage for ``Class 3''
Native Spearmint Oil for the 1993-94 Marketing Year



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final rule increases the quantity of Class 3 (Native) spearmint oil produced in the Far West that handlers
may purchase from, or handle for, producers during the 1993-94 marketing year. This rule was recommended by
the Spearmint Oil Administrative Committee (Committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the
marketing order for spearmint oil produced in the Far West. This rule was recommended in order to avoid extreme fluctuations
in supplies and prices and thus help to maintain stability in the spearmint oil market.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule is issued under Marketing Order No. 985 [7 CFR part 985], regulating the handling of spearmint oil produced
in the Far West (Washington, Idaho, Oregon, and designated parts of California, Nevada, Montana, and Utah), hereinafter
referred to as the ``order.'' This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended
[7 U.S.C 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.''



The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.

This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the provisions of the marketing
order now in effect, salable quantities and allotment percentages may be established for classes of spearmint oil
produced in the Far West. This rule increases the quantity of Class 3 spearmint oil produced in the Far West that may
be purchased from or handled for producers by handlers during the 1993-94 marketing year, which ends on May 31,
1994. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule.

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.

Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

There are eight spearmint oil handlers subject to regulation under the order and approximately 260 producers of spearmint
oil in the regulated production area. Of the 260 producers, approximately 160 producers hold ``Class 1'' (Scotch)
oil allotment base, and 145 producers hold ``Class 3'' (Native) oil allotment base. Small agricultural service firms
have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than
$3,500,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000.
A minority of handlers and producers of Far West spearmint oil may be classified as small entities.

The Far West spearmint oil industry is characterized by producers whose farming operations generally involve more
than one commodity and whose income from farming operations is not exclusively dependent on the production of spearmint
oil. The U.S. production of spearmint oil is concentrated in the Far West, primarily Washington, Idaho, and Oregon
(part of the area covered by the order). Spearmint oil is also produced in the Midwest. The production area covered
by the order normally accounts for 75 percent of the annual U.S. production of spearmint oil.

This rule increases the salable quantity and allotment percentage of Native spearmint oil that handlers may purchase
from, or handle for, producers during the 1993-94 marketing year, which ends on May 31, 1994. This rule increases
the salable quantity from 714,665 pounds to 772,611 pounds and the allotment percentage from 37 percent to 40 percent
for Native spearmint oil.

The salable quantity is the total quantity of each class of oil which handlers may purchase from, or handle on behalf
of, producers during a marketing year. Each producer is allotted a share of the salable quantity by applying the allotment
percentage to the producer's allotment base for the applicable class of spearmint oil.

The initial salable quantities and allotment percentages for both Native and Scotch spearmint oils for the 1993-94
marketing year were recommended by the Committee at its October 15, 1992, meeting. The Committee recommended salable
quantities of 714,665 pounds and 716,164 pounds for Native and Scotch oils, respectively, and allotment percentages
of 37 percent and 41 percent for Native and Scotch oils, respectively.

A proposed rule incorporating the Committee's October 15, 1992, recommendation was published in the December 7,
1992, issue of the 

Federal Register

 [57 FR 57695]. Comments on the proposed rule were solicited from interested persons until January 6, 1993. No comments
were received. Accordingly, based upon analysis of available information, a final rule establishing the Committee's
recommendation as the salable quantities and allotment percentages for the 1993-94 marketing year was published
in the May 13, 1993, issue of the 

Federal Register

 [58 FR 28340].

Pursuant to authority contained in sections 985.50, 985.51, and 985.52 of the order, at its February 23, 1994, meeting
in Pasco, Washington, the Committee recommended that the salable quantity and allotment percentage for Native spearmint
oil for the 1993-94 marketing year be increased. The Committee vote resulted in seven members in favor and one
member opposed to the recommendation. The member voting in opposition believes current demand for Native spearmint
oil is not adequate enough to warrant an increase in the salable quantity and allotment percentage.

The Committee's recommendation to increase the allotment percentage for Native spearmint oil by three percent results
in a 57,946 pound increase in the salable quantity, from 714,665 to 772,611 pounds. Growers currently hold in reserve
1,436,020 pounds of Native oil and 948,063 pounds of Scotch oil. However, the Committee states that not all producers
have reserve oil available to fill their increase in the salable quantity. In those cases, no additional oil is made
available to the market. Therefore, this rule provides an actual increase of 55,553 pounds of additional base rather
than the calculated amount. This small difference between the calculated and actual amounts of released oil will
not have a significant impact on the availability of marketable oil.

The Committee, in reaching its decision to recommend an increase in the 1993-94 salable quantity and allotment
percentage for Native spearmint oil, took into consideration the current supply and anticipated demand for both
Native and Scotch spearmint oils. The available supply of Native and Scotch spearmint oil as of February 23, 1994,
is 59,599 pounds and 175,000 pounds, respectively. When considering its initial recommendation for the 1993-94
season, the Committee estimated that the recommended salable quantity and allotment percentage would result in
an approximate carryover of 90,000 pounds of Native oil. This places the current available supply of Native oil below
the expected carryover.

<TEXT>
 

Over the past five years, the average utilization of Native oil between March 1 and May 31 is 91,375 pounds. This figure
is considerably more than the existing available supply. In addition, a majority of spearmint oil buyers indicated
they will be in a position to buy additional Native spearmint oil if it is made available. By increasing the Native spearmint
oil allotment percentage by three percent, the available supply (as of February 23, 1994), will increase by 55,553
pounds, from 59,599 pounds to 115,152 pounds. 

In its deliberations on how best to meet the anticipated demand, Committee members and other industry participants
indicated that the available Native spearmint oil supply should be increased by three to seven percent. The majority
of the individuals recommending some level of increase favored three percent, indicating a higher level may push
Native oil supply into a surplus situation before the end of the marketing year. The Committee did not recommend an
increase in the supply of Scotch spearmint oil since it is anticipated that there will be a surplus supply of this type
of oil by the end of the marketing year. 

The Department, based on its analysis of available information, has determined that an allotment percentage of 40
percent should be established for Native spearmint oil for the 1993-94 marketing year. This percentage will
provide an increase in the salable quantity of Native spearmint oil from 714,665 pounds to 772,611 pounds. 

Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this interim final
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including that contained in the prior proposed and final rules
in connection with the establishment of the salable quantities and allotment percentages for Native and Scotch spearmint
oils for the 1993-94 marketing year, the Committee's recommendation and other available information, it is
found that to revise  985.212 [58 FR 28340] to change the salable quantity and allotment percentage for Native
spearmint oil, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause exists
for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) This final action increases the quantity of Native spearmint oil that may be marketed immediately; (2)
The Committee recommended this rule at a public meeting and all interested persons had an opportunity to provide input;
(3) Handlers and producers should be apprised as soon as possible of the salable quantity and allotment percentage
of Native oil contained in this interim final rule; and (4) This rule provides a 30-day comment period and any comments
received will be considered prior to finalization of this rule.

Scrapie: Sheep and Goats Less Than 1 Year of Age Moved to Slaughter



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the scrapie regulations to allow sheep and goats less than 1 year of age from scrapie-infected or source
flocks to move interstate to slaughter, without being permanently identified with an indelible ``S'' mark, if they
are accompanied by a permit and moved in a sealed means of conveyance. We are also providing that the diagnosis of scrapie
necessary to categorize a flock as an infected flock, source flock, or trace flock must have been made after March 31,
1989, and are providing that flank tattoos and ear tattoos are acceptable forms of identification for certain sheep
and goats moved interstate. These changes will provide safeguards necessary to guard against the interstate spread
of scrapie, while eliminating unnecessarily restrictive marking and identification requirements.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Background



The regulations in 9 CFR part 79 (referred to below as the regulations) contain provisions restricting the interstate
movement of sheep and goats because of scrapie. Scrapie is a progressive degenerative disease of the central nervous
system of sheep and goats. The disease develops slowly, with an incubation period lasting from months to years. The
regulations are designed to prevent the interstate transmission of scrapie.

On November 12, 1993, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 59955-59959, Docket No. 93-050-1) a proposal to amend the regulations to allow sheep and goats
less than 1 year of age from scrapie-infected or source flocks to move interstate to slaughter, without being permanently
identified with an indelible ``S'' mark, if they are accompanied by a permit and are moved in sealed means of conveyance.
We also proposed to provide that the diagnosis of scrapie necessary to categorize a flock as an infected flock, source
flock, or trace flock must have been made after March 31, 1989, and proposed to make flank tattoos and ear tattoos acceptable
forms of identification for certain sheep and goats moved interstate.

We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 60-day comment period ending January 11, 1994. We received four
comments by that date, from a member of the lamb industry, a veterinary medical association, and two sheep industry
associations. One commenter supported the entire proposal. One commenter raised issues beyond the scope of the proposal.

The other two commenters supported the proposal with one qualification. Both indicated that our proposal stated
that flank tattoos and ear tattoos should be considered acceptable forms of identification because electronic implant
devices are ``unavailable.'' The commenters stated that, rather than being unavailable, electronic implant devices
enjoy widespread acceptance and usage. Both commenters stated that such devices offer more consistency and are more
likely to be permanent than other forms of identification. One of the commenters recommended that the Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service (APHIS) coordinate the distribution and application of electronic implants for the voluntary
scrapie flock certification program.

We are making no changes based on these comments. We agree with the commenters that electronic implant devices are
in many ways superior to either flank tattoos or ear tattoos. However, at present, electronic implant devices are
cost-prohibitive for many owners.

In addition to this problem, there does not yet exist an internationally recognized set of standards for electronic
implant devices. Therefore, a reader capable of reading one type of electronic implant device might not be able to
read another. Although APHIS is committed to purchasing electronic implant readers as part of the voluntary scrapie
flock certification program, we do not consider such purchases advisable until one reader can be used on several different
companies' implants. For these reasons, we consider it appropriate at this time to allow forms of identification
other than electronic implant devices.

Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in this document, we are adopting the provisions
of the proposal as the final rule.



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act



This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been
reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.

The changes we are making include allowing the interstate movement to slaughter of sheep and goats less than 1 year
of age from scrapie-infected flocks or source flocks that do not meet the requirements of  79.2 (a)(1) through
(a)(7) of the regulations, if the animals are moved in a sealed means of conveyance and accompanied by a permit. This
approach will be less restrictive and more efficient than allowing these animals to be moved interstate only if the
animals have been identified with an ``S'' mark to the left jaw.

Although the change applies to both sheep and goats, at present no goats are being moved interstate with an ``S'' mark.

There are approximately 92,500 sheep farms in the United States, with approximately 11 million sheep. The large majority
of these are small entities. Ninety-nine percent of the sheep farms in this country each have annual sales totalling
less than $500,000, and approximately 77,000 have fewer than 100 sheep.

The number of farms and animals that will be affected by this change is relatively small. There are approximately 81
infected or source flocks in this country, with only about 4,050 animals. All of these flocks are on what are considered
small farms. The total number of farms affected will be less than .1 percent of the total number of sheep farms in the
United States.

It costs approximately $0.50 to brand a lamb. This amount will be saved by those farms that choose to ship animals according
to the regulations. This compares to the average market value for a finished market lamb of $65.

We are also providing that the diagnosis of scrapie necessary to categorize a flock as an infected flock, source flock,
or trace flock must have been made after March 31, 1989. This change excludes from such categorizations flocks that
completed a 42-month surveillance period prior to October 1, 1992, and in which scrapie has not been diagnosed since.
This change clarifies our intent as to the definitions in question and will have no economic effect.

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Executive Order 12778

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>











Public Utility Holding Company Act Rules 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''). 

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rules. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission today is adopting amendments to rules and forms under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935
(``Act''). The amendments will expand certain exemptions, and generally update and clarify the requirements of
the rules. The Commission is rescinding rule 50, which required competitive bidding in connection with the purchase
or underwriting of securities of companies in a registered system. The rulemaking is intended to reduce regulatory
burdens under the Act. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On November 4, 1992, the Commission proposed for comment a rulemaking intended to modernize and streamline regulation
under the Act.

1

 The Commission is adopting the proposed amendments to rules 7 (17 CFR 250.7), 26 (17 CFR 250.26), 27 (17 CFR 250.27),
29 (17 CFR 250.29), 40(a)(5) (17 CFR 250.40(a)(5)), 41(c) (17 CFR 250.41(c)), 42(b) (17 CFR 250.42(b)), 43(b) (17
CFR 250.43(b)), 44(b) (17 CFR 250.44(b)), 49 (17 CFR 250.49), 52 (17 CFR 250.52), 62 (17 CFR 250.62), 63 (17 CFR 250.63),
65(b)(2) (17 CFR 250.65(b)(2)), and 71(b) (17 CFR 250.71(b)) under the Act [15 U.S.C. 79 

et seq

.] and forms U5S, U-12(I)-A and U-12(I)-B, and rescinding rule 50 (17 CFR 250.50). The Commission
is deferring action on the proposed amendments to rule 83(d) (17 CFR 250.83(d)) and to the annual report on Form U-13-60
for service company subsidiaries of registered holding companies (17 CFR 259.313), pending further consideration.






Comments were received from eight registered holding companies,

2

 two service company subsidiaries of registered holding companies,

3

 and two other parties.

4

 The Commission has carefully considered these comments, and is incorporating a number of the suggestions in the rule
and form amendments that it is adopting today. 







I. Introduction 



The Commission is adopting various measures intended generally to modernize the rules under the Act and, in particular,
to reduce undue regulatory burdens on companies in a registered holding company system. These measures grew out of
the Commission's continuing assessment of the appropriateness of existing regulatory requirements.

A. Rule 7(a): Companies Deemed Not To Be Electric or Gas Utility Companies 



Under rule 7(a), a company is deemed not to be an electric utility company or a gas utility company, within the meaning
of sections 2(a)(3) and 2(a)(4) of the Act, respectively, if the company is primarily engaged in one or more nonutility
businesses, and the company's gross sales of electricity, or of natural or manufactured gas distributed at retail,
do not exceed a specified amount.

5

 At present, the rule permits such companies to make annual utility sales of up to $100,000. The proposed amendment
would allow average annual sales of up to $5 million.

6

 






Columbia, CNG and Heritage support adoption of the amendment. Northeast suggests that the amendment, as it relates
to sales of electricity, is unnecessary in view of the broad exemptions already provided under the Public Utility
Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (``PURPA'') [16 U.S.C.  824a-3(e)],

7

 and the Energy Policy Act of 1992.

8

 The exemption under rule 7(a), however, is not related to the exemptions under PURPA and the Energy Policy Act. The
rule is intended to accommodate a small amount of energy sales by a company that is otherwise engaged in a nonutility
business. In comparison, the exemptions under PURPA and the Energy Policy Act are intended to encourage the growth
of a competitive energy market. The proposed amendment does not conflict with these statutes or the legislative policies
that underlie them. 





Columbia and Heritage ask the Commission to adopt a different test of revenues. Columbia suggests that the exemption
should apply to a company with gas utility revenues no greater than 5% of its nonutility revenues.

9

 Under the Heritage proposal, a company that is not a state-regulated utility could receive up to 20% of its gross revenues
from the sale of manufactured gas at retail. The Commission is concerned that these approaches could vitiate the rationale
for the exemption, which is the small absolute size of the utility operations, not the relative size of utility and
nonutility operations, and so declines to adopt them. 





The Commission believes that the increase in the dollar limit to $5 million is appropriate in view of the changes in
the industry since rule 7(a) was adopted in 1941.

10

 A company with annual utility revenues that exceed $5 million may request an order, upon application, declaring it
not to be a utility company for purposes of the Act.

Accordingly, the Commission is adopting the amendment substantially as proposed.

12

 





B. Rule 29: Filing of Reports to State Commissions 



Rule 29(a), adopted under sections 14 and 15 of the Act, requires a company in a registered holding company system to
file with the Commission two copies of each report submitted to stockholders.

13

 The Commission believes that the reporting requirement under the rule is no longer necessary. The Commission receives
copies of system companies' annual reports to shareholders as exhibits to the Form U5S filed by the parent company.

14

 System companies are also subject to extensive disclosure requirements under the other federal securities laws.
Among other things, the companies file with the Commission periodic reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and
current reports on Form 8-K, in addition to the special reports that may be required under circumstances such
as a proxy solicitation or tender offer. 






The commenters uniformly favor amendment of rule 29 to delete the reporting requirement as it applies to shareholder
reports. Accordingly, the rule is so amended. 



C. Rule 40(a)(5): Exemption of Acquisitions From Nonaffiliates 



Companies in a registered system generally require prior Commission approval, under the standards of section 10,
for the acquisition of any security.

15

 Rule 40(a)(5) provides a limited exemption to this requirement for the acquisition of securities of local industrial
or other nonutility enterprises.

16

 Under the rule, the acquisition cannot result in an affiliation between the system company and the local enterprise.
Further, the rule limits to $50,000 the aggregate amount that a system company can invest each year ``for the purpose
of, and in accordance with a State law specifically relating to, promoting the development of business and industry
in such territory,'' and to $10,000 the aggregate annual amount that a system company can invest in other local nonutility
enterprises. 






These dollar amounts have not been increased since the rule was adopted more than 50 years ago. The Commission, however,
has authorized by order a number of ``good citizen'' investments in larger amounts.

17

 In light of these orders, and to increase the usefulness of the rule, the Commission proposed to remove the dollar limit
on investments pursuant to state business development laws, and to increase to $1 million the annual limit on investments
in other local enterprises. The amended rule would exempt investments in nonutility enterprises located in the service
territory of the acquiring public-utility company or, if the acquiring company were not a public-utility company,
in the service territory of the registered system. 





Upon further consideration, the Commission believes that the proposed amendment may be overbroad as it relates to
investments pursuant to state business development laws. It does not appear necessary at this time to provide an unlimited
exception for such investments. The rule provides a narrow exception to the requirements of section 9(a)(1) for investments
in industrial development and similar entities. The Commission is concerned that an unbounded rule could encourage
investments unrelated to the purpose of the rule. Accordingly, the Commission is not removing the dollar limitation
but, instead, is increasing it from $50,000 to $5 million per year for investments pursuant to state business development
laws. In addition, the Commission is adopting the proposal to increase to $1 million annually the limit on investments
in other local enterprises. 

The commenters have suggested several modifications to the proposed amendment. Northeast asks the Commission to
expand the geographic scope to include the entire area served by the entity in which an investment is to be made or in
which the activities of the entity have an economic impact, and to the entire state or states in which the system companies
operate. Such an expansion could encourage investments that have little or no relationship to the system's service
territory, and thus undercut the rationale for the exemption.

18

 Accordingly, the Commission declines to grant this request. 





CSW urges the Commission to increase to $5 million annually the permissible aggregate investment in local enterprises
that are not organized pursuant to state business development laws. The comment suggests that this dollar amount
is necessary to provide a meaningful stimulus in a given region. The Commission declines to adopt this suggestion.
The $1 million limit is intended to facilitate certain limited ``good citizen'' investments. The nominal dollar
amount provides a safeguard against potential abuses. A company seeking to engage in a transaction that is not within
the terms of the rule may, of course, seek Commission approval by order upon application.

<TEXT>
 

Northeast also recommends that the Commission amend the rule to permit an acquisition of up to 10% of the voting securities
of a local enterprise.

19

 Under Northeast's proposal, a regulated company could become an affiliate or a holding company of a local business,
without the need to apply for or receive Commission approval. The Commission declines to follow this recommendation.
Rule 40(a)(5) requires that an acquisition not result in an affiliation with the issuer. This requirement is intended
to ensure that the rule is not used to circumvent the requirements of sections 9, 10 and 11, consistent with the limited
scope of section 9(c)(3).

20

 The Commission declines to expand the scope of the rule, as requested by Northeast.

21

 







The Commission is also amending Form U5S to require disclosure of the aggregate amount of investments in entities
operating in the service territory of the registered holding company. 



D. Rule 41(c): Exemption of Public-Utility Subsidiaries With Respect to Limited Acquisition of Utility Assets 



Under section 9(a)(1) of the Act, companies in a registered system generally require Commission approval, by order
upon application, before acquiring utility assets. Rule 41(c) provides a limited exception to this requirement
for the acquisition by a system public-utility company of electric utility assets that are, or immediately following
the transaction will be, connected with electric utility assets that the acquiring company already owns and operates,
or gas utility assets that are located in, or adjacent to, the service area in which the acquiring company already owns
and operates gas utility assets.

22

 The existing rule limits the amount of such acquisitions to the lesser of $100,000 or 5% of the acquirer's gross utility
revenues in a given calendar year. 





The proposed amendment would increase the annual limit to the lesser of $5 million or 5% of the gross annual revenues
that the acquiring company derived from its operations as a public-utility company during the preceding calendar
year. The commenters uniformly supported this amendment. The Commission is adopting the rule as proposed.

23

 





E. Rule 42(b): Acquisition, Retirement and Redemption of Securities by the Issuer Thereof 



Transactions by which a company in a registered system acquires, retires or redeems a security of which it is the issuer
(or which it has assumed or guaranteed) generally require Commission approval by order upon application under sections
9(a), 10 and 12(c), and rules thereunder. At present, rule 42(b) provides a limited exemption to this requirement.

24

 The proposed amendment would expand the rule to exempt all transactions in which a system company acquires, retires
or redeems a security of which it is the issuer (or which it has assumed or guaranteed). 





Under the amendment, system companies could more easily adjust their capital ratios in response to changing economic
conditions. Commenters, citing the important role of the capital markets in regulating the capital structures of
publicly-held corporations, uniformly support expansion of the exemption. The Commission recognizes that rating
agencies, financial institutions and state regulators play important roles in ensuring appropriate capital ratios
for public-utility companies.

25

 





To forestall potential abuse, the exemption remains unavailable for affiliate transactions.

26

 CNG asks the Commission to modify this exclusion to exempt the acquisition of shares of common stock pursuant to the
exchange and tax withholding provisions of an employee benefit plan. The commenter states that the modification
is necessary because the rule, at present, does not exempt transactions with the officers and directors of system
companies, who are affiliates of such companies within the meaning of the Act.

27

 The Commission declines to adopt this recommendation. A party may continue to seek Commission approval, by order
upon application, for these types of transactions.

<PARENT> FR940428-0-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The acquisition by a registered holding company of its own securities as part of a ``going-private'' transaction
is exempt from the requirements otherwise applicable to such transactions under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

28

 To ensure that these transactions do not escape review, the amended rule will not exempt transactions within the meaning
of rule 13e-3(a)(3) under the Securities Exchange Act.

29

 






Accordingly, the Commission adopts the amendment substantially as proposed. 



F. Rule 43(b): Sales to Affiliates 



Rule 43, adopted under sections 12(d) and 12(g) of the Act, generally requires prior Commission approval for sales
to an affiliate of securities, utility assets, or any other interest in any business.

30

 Under the present rule, a sale of securities is excepted from this requirement if the acquisition is within the terms
of section 9(b)(2),

31

 the consideration is less than $100,000 and the acquisition does not require Commission approval,

32

 or the transaction involves the sale of securities of a subsidiary service company.

33

 The proposed amendment would create a single class of exemptions for sales to affiliates of securities, utility assets,
or any other interests in any business up to a total annual aggregate consideration of $5 million when the acquisition
does not require Commission approval.

34

 









The Commission believes that existing reporting requirements under the Act should guard against potential abuses.

35

 The commenters generally favor the proposed amendment.

36

 CNG asks whether the dollar limitation applies to each transaction or the annual aggregate amount of such transactions.
The $5 million limit is intended as an annual aggregate maximum amount for all transactions under the rule. CNG also
seeks an additional exemption for intrasystem transactions when the acquisition is otherwise subject to approval
of the Commission. The Commission does not perceive the need for such an exemption. The rule, therefore, is adopted
substantially as proposed. 






G. Rule 44(b): Sales of Securities and Assets 



Rule 44, adopted under section 12(d) of the Act, governs sales of utility securities or utility assets by a registered
holding company to any person.

37

 The rule, at present, exempts four classes of such sales from the general requirement of Commission approval by order
upon application. The proposed amendment would replace the existing exemptions with a single one that would exempt
all sales up to an annual aggregate amount of $5 million where the acquisition of the securities or assets does not require
Commission approval. The Commission believes that existing reporting requirements under the Act offer a safeguard
against potential abuses. The commenters generally support this amendment. Accordingly, the rule is amended. 





H. Rule 50: Requirement of Public Invitation of Proposals for the Purchase or Underwriting of Securities 



The Commission is rescinding rule 50.

38

 The rule, which established a requirement of competitive bidding with respect to the issuance or sale of securities
by a registered holding company or its subsidiary, was intended to prevent abuses in the issue and sale of securities.
In practice, many system companies relied upon various exceptions to this requirement. The Commission believes
that the rule is no longer necessary in view of the extensive reporting requirements imposed by the Act and the other
federal securities laws. In addition, unless otherwise exempted, the underlying financing will remain subject
to Commission review.

39

 Rescission of the rule will permit companies in a registered holding company system to choose the marketing method
that offers the most advantageous terms. The commenters strongly support this proposal.

40

 The rule is hereby rescinded.

I. Rule 65: Expenditures in Connection With Solicitation of Proxies 



Rule 65, adopted under section 12(i) of the Act, generally requires prior Commission approval for certain expenditures
in connection with the solicitation of proxies by a company in a registered system.

41

 The rule currently provides an exemption for annual aggregate expenditures of $1,000. The proposed amendment would
increase the annual exemption to $100,000. 





The commenters generally support this proposal. Columbia, however, asks the Commission to rescind the rule. The
commenter notes that regulated companies are already subject to the proxy solicitation rules under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934,

42

 and contends that there are no current abuses that justify the additional restrictions under the Act.

43

 Northeast asks the Commission to amend the rule to require only that proxy solicitations be conducted in conformity
with the Commission's proxy rules. 






Both the proxy rules and rule 65 require the disclosure of the identity of paid solicitors and the cost of the solicitations.

44

 A proposal to rescind rule 65 may be an appropriate subject for a future rulemaking. In the meantime, however, the rule
is amended as proposed. 





J. Rule 71: Statements To Be Filed Pursuant to Section 12(i) of the Act 



Under section 12(i) of the Act, persons employed or retained by any registered holding company or its subsidiary,
who engage in activities before Congress, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (``FERC'') or the Commission,
must disclose the nature and character of their employment and related compensation. Rule 71(a) currently requires
a report on Form U-12(I)-A within 10 days of the date of such activities.

45

 Rule 71(b) permits the filing of an advance statement on Form U-12(I)-B covering anticipated activities
for the remainder of the calendar year. The proposed amendment would lengthen the advance statement period to three
years. 





The commenters generally support the amendment. CNG asks the Commission to clarify the types of persons that are required
to file under the rule. In general, support staff, such as secretarial staff, are not subject to the filing requirement,
in contrast to officers and attorneys who represent the companies.

46

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940428-0-00016 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940428-0-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Columbia suggests that the Commission exempt from filing all regular employees in the holding company whose expenses
do not exceed $30,000 per year. By its terms, however, section 12(i) does not appear to permit a 

de minimis

 exemption.

47

 The Commission therefore declines to adopt this suggestion. Accordingly, the rule is adopted as proposed. 




K. Rule 83: Exemption in the Case of Transactions With Foreign Associates 



Section 13 of the Act requires that service, sales and construction contracts be performed economically and efficiently
for the benefit of associate companies at cost, fairly and equitably allocated among the companies. 

Under rule 83(d), any subsidiary company can perform service, sales and construction contracts for a foreign associate
company without complying with the standards of section 13(b), and without the need to apply for, and receive, prior
Commission approval, so long as the aggregate cost of such contracts does not exceed $10,000 annually.

48

 The Commission proposed to amend the rule to extend the exemption to all transactions, at not less than cost, with foreign
associate companies. 





The Commission had believed that the pricing requirement under the proposed amended rule would provide an adequate
safeguard against abuse. A question has arisen, however, whether the rule would protect against a diversion of management
and other expertise away from the needs of the system's core utility operations. The Commission will consider these
issues in a companion rulemaking involving a proposed amendment to rule 87.

49

 Accordingly, the Commission is deferring action for further consideration of the proposed amendment to rule 83.





L. Uniform System of Accounts and Form U-13-60: Annual Report for Mutual and Subsidiary Service Companies



The Commission is deferring action on a proposed amendment to the annual report form for mutual and subsidiary service
companies, Form U-13-60.

50

 The proposed amendment was intended to harmonize the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts for Mutual and Subsidiary
Service Companies and the FERC's standard accounts for utility companies. 




Most commenters expressed confusion as to the proposed changes and the degree of flexibility they would afford. These
commenters asked the Commission to clarify its proposal. In light of these comments, the Commission has decided to
defer action to enable it to consider the matter more closely. 


M. Other Matters 


Finally, the Commission is amending or deleting obsolete language in certain rules, including references to the
Federal Power Commission, the Atomic Energy Commission and the Bankruptcy Act.

51

 




II. Summary of the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 


The Commission has prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in accordance with section 603 of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603, regarding the amendment to rule 7. The Analysis explains that the amendment is intended
to expand the exemption from regulation for companies that are primarily engaged in nonutility businesses. The Analysis
describes the present regulatory framework under which a company operating public-utility facilities must obtain
a Commission order declaring it not to be an electric or gas utility company, unless the gross sales of electric energy,
or of natural or manufactured gas distributed at retail by means of the facilities owned or operated by such company,
did not exceed $100,000 during the previous calendar year. The exemption by order is not available for companies that
own but do not operate such facilities. The amendment would increase the dollar sales allowable under the exemption
to $5 million. The Analysis states that several significant alternatives to the amendment were considered, including
continuing to grant exemptions by order on a case-by-case basis, but concludes that the amendment provides the least
impact on, or cost to, small businesses. A copy of the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis may be obtained from Brian
P. Spires, at Mail Stop 10-6, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 5th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549.

The other rule and form amendments will not affect any small entities as defined in rule 110. Pursuant to section 605(b)
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Chairman of the Commission has certified that the amended
rules would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Commission did not
receive any comments with respect to the Chairman's certification. 


III. Cost/Benefit of Proposed Actions



The amendments will decrease regulatory compliance costs for companies in a registered holding company system.
In fiscal year 1993, for example, the amendments would have eliminated the need for 22 applications and approximately
545 forms, and would have reduced the regulatory burden associated with an additional 86 applications, for an estimated
savings of more than 4,114 hours per year. Moreover, the amendments would have reduced by approximately 1,576 hours
the staff time associated with reviewing and analyzing these applications. The only cost to the companies complying
with the amended rules will be the cost of reporting on Form U5S the information required by rule 40(a)(5). It is estimated
that no more than one-half hour will be required to complete the additional information required by the change to Form
U5S. 


IV. Paperwork Reduction Act


The Office of Management and Budget has approved the amended rules and forms for continued use through December 31,
1995 and February 28, 1996 (Control No. 3235-AF68).

New Animal Drugs For Use In Animal Feeds; Salinomycin, Roxarsone, and Bacitracin Zinc


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of an abbreviated
new animal drug application (ANADA) filed by Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co. The ANADA provides for using approved
single ingredient Type A medicated articles to make Type C medicated broiler feeds containing salinomycin with roxarsone
and bacitracin zinc.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co., P.O. Box 2500, Somerville, NJ 08876-1258, filed ANADA 200-086 for the
use of salinomycin with roxarsone and bacitracin zinc. The ANADA provides for using approved single ingredient Type
A medicated articles to make Type C medicated broiler feeds containing 40 to 60 grams per ton (g/t) of salinomycin sodium
activity, 45.4 g/t of roxarsone, and 4 to 50 g/t of bacitracin zinc, for the prevention of coccidiosis in broiler chickens
caused by 

Eimeria tenella

, 

E

. 

necatrix

, 

E

. 

acervulina

, 

E

. 

maxima

, 

E

. 

brunetti

, and 

E

. 

mivati

, including some field strains of 

E

. 

tenella

 that are more susceptible to roxarsone combined with salinomycin than to salinomycin alone, and for increased rate
of weight gain and improved feed efficiency.


ANADA 200-086 is as a generic copy of Agri-Bio's NADA 137-536 and is approved as of April 27, 1994. The regulations
are amended in  558.550 

Salinomycin

 (21 CFR 558.550) to reflect the approval.
This approval is for use of single ingredient Type A medicated articles to make Type C medicated feeds. Roxarsone is
a Category II drug which, as provided in  558.4, requires an approved Form FDA 1900 for making a Type C feed. Therefore,
the use of salinomycin, roxarsone, and bacitracin zinc Type A medicated articles to make Type C medicated feeds as
provided in ANADA 200-086 requires an approved Form FDA 1900.
In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and  514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21
CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval
of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm.
1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(d)(1)(ii) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.


List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 558


Animal drugs, Animal feeds.
Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food
and Drugs and redelegated to the Center for Veterinary Medicine, 21 CFR part 558 is amended as follows:
 

PART 558_NEW ANIMAL DRUGS FOR USE IN ANIMAL FEEDS


1. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 558 continues to read as follows:





Authority: 

Secs. 512, 701 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b, 371).

Special Local Regulations: Lake Worth, ICW, Mile 1022



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Temporary final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Special local regulations are being adopted for the Lake Worth Sunfest '94. This event will be held on April 27 through
May 1, 1994; from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. EDT (Eastern Daylight Time) on April 27 and 28; from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. EDT on April 29;
and, from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. EDT on April 30 and May 1. The regulations are needed to provide for the safety of life on navigable
waters during the event.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for these regulations and good
cause exists for making them effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. The updated information to hold the event was not received until April
1994, and there was not sufficient time remaining to publish proposed rules in advance of the event or to provide for
a delayed effective date.



Drafting Information



The drafters of this regulation are ENS B. DAILEY, Project Officer, Coast Guard Group Miami, and LT J. LOSEGO, Project
Attorney, Seventh Coast Guard District Legal Office.



Discussion of Regulations



There will be approximately 45 racers in race boats, ski boats, jet skis, and canoes, ranging in size from 12 to 17 feet,
participating in the Palm Beach County Sunfest '94. High speed race boats traveling up to 120 m.p.h., and canoes, jet
skis, and water skiers, require calm waters to perform and create an extra or unusual hazard in the navigable waters.
As a result, there will be a no wake zone in the Lake Worth Intracoastal Waterway between the Royal Palm Bridge and the
Flagler Memorial Bridge where the event will take place.



Federalism



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Environmental Assessment



The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposal consistent with Section 2.B.2.08 of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, and this proposal has been determined to be categorically excluded. Specifically, the Coast
Guard has consulted with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service regarding the
environmental impact of this event, and it was determined that the event does not jeopardize the continued existence
of protected species. As a condition to the permit, the applicant is required to educate the operators of spectator
craft and parade participants regarding the possible presence of manatees and the appropriate precautions to take
if the animals are sighted.



List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 100



Marine safety, Navigation (water). 



Regulations



In consideration of the foregoing, part 100 of title 33, Code of Federal Regulations, is amended as follows:

1. The authority citation for Part 100 continues to read as follows:






Authority:

 33 U.S.C. 1233; 49 CFR 1.46 and 33 CFR 100.35.




2. A temporary section 100.35T07-049 is added to read as follows:

five (5) knots, whichever is slower.

(2) All vessels shall immediately follow any specific instructions given by event patrol craft and exercise extreme
caution while operating in or near the regulated area. A succession of not fewer than 5 short whistle or horn blasts
from a patrol vessel will be the signal for any nonparticipating vessel to take immediate action to avoid collision
and avoid interference with event participants. The display of an orange distress smoke signal from a patrol vessel
will be the signal for any and all vessels to stop immediately.

(3) After the termination of the Sunfest '94 event on each respective day, all vessels may resume normal operations.

(c) Effective dates: This section becomes effective on April 27 through May 1, 1994; from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. EDT (Eastern
Daylight Time) on April 27 and 28; from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. EDT on April 29; and, from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. EDT on April 30 and May

Drawbridge Operation Regulations; Kissimmee River, FL



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is changing regulations governing the operation of the CSX Railroad bridge, at mile 37.0, near Fort
Basinger, Florida, by requiring 96 hour advance notification for an opening of the draw. This proposal is being made
to be consistent with three other bridges on the waterway. This action will relieve the bridgeowner of the burden of
having a person available within 72 hours to open the draw, which has not opened during the past twenty years, while
still providing for the reasonable needs of navigation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Drafting Information




The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Walter Paskowsky, Project Manager, and LT J. M. Losego,
Project Counsel.



Regulatory History



On November 9, 1993 the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled Drawbridge Operation Regulations
in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 59426). The Coast Guard received no comments on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested and one was not
held.



Background and Purpose



This swingbridge presently opens with 72 hours advance notice for the passage of floating equipment employed for
flood control work under the jurisdiction of the South Florida Water Management District or the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers. This regulation was established in 1964 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with the Kissimmee River Flood
Control Project was under construction. The State Road 70, 78 and 98 highway bridges which cross the same waterway
have been authorized to open with 96 hours advance notice. This change will allow the CSX Railroad bridge at mile 37.0,
which must be opened by hand, to open with a similar 96 hour advance notice.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940428-0-00023 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940428-0-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The limitation on the type of vessel navigation which would be allowed an opening will be removed; however, there is
not expected to be an increase in the number of openings since the level of navigation on the waterway is limited to small
recreational vessels. The rule will also reflect the bridge owner's name change from Seaboard System to CSX Railroad.


Discussion of Comments


No comments were received. The owner of the bridge CSX Transportation, concurred with the proposed change prior to
the publication of the notice of proposed rulemaking.


Regulatory Evaluation


This rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under the Department
of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the
economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary. We conclude this because
the drawbridge has not been opened during the past twenty years.


Small Entities


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently
owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business
concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). Since the drawbridge has not opened since 1970,
the increase in advance notification requirements will not affect commercial navigation. Because it expects the
impact of the proposal to be so minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under Section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.


Collection of Information


This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.).


Federalism


The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.


Environment


The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.g.(5)
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, promulgation of operating requirements or procedures for drawbridges is
categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusive Determination is available
in the docket.

Safety Zone; Ohio River Mile 468.5 to 473.0


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Temporary final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone on the Ohio River. The regulation is needed to control vessel traffic
in the regulated area while transiting downbound at night during high water conditions. The regulation will restrict
commercial navigation in the regulated area for the safety of vessel traffic and the protection of life and property
along the river.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Drafting Information


The drafter of this regulation is LT Phillip Ison, Project Officer, Marine Safety Office, Louisville, Kentucky.


Regulatory History


In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. In effect, this regulation extends
an existing safety zone which will terminate at 7 p.m. EDST on April 15, 1994. Although this regulation continues restrictions
which have been in place for fifteen days, following normal rulemaking procedures would have been impracticable.
Specifically, the high water periods in the Cincinnati, Ohio area are natural events which cannot be predicted with
any reasonable accuracy. The need to extend the restrictions, and how long they should be kept in place, could not have
been predicted until recently, making it more practical to issue a new regulation instead of extending the current
one. As the river conditions present an immediate hazard to navigation, life, and property, the Coast Guard deems
it to be in the public's best interest to issue a regulation now.


Background and Purpose


The situation requiring this regulation is high water in the Ohio River in the vicinity of Cincinnati, Ohio. The Ohio
River in the Cincinnati area is hazardous to transit under the best of conditions. To transit the area, mariners must
navigate through several sweeping turns and seven bridges. When the water level in the Ohio River reaches 45 feet,
on the Cincinnati gage, river currents increase and become very unpredictable, making it difficult for downbound
vessels to maintain steerageway. During hours of darkness the background lights of the city of Cincinnati hamper
mariners' ability to maintain sight of the front of their tow. The regulation is intended to protect the public and
the environment, at night during periods of high water, from a potential hazard of large downbound tows carrying hazardous
material through the regulated area.


Regulatory Evaluation


This rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under Department
of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979); it will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and it contains no collection of information requirements.
The Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary.


Federalism Assessment


Under the principles and criteria of Executive Order 12612, this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.


Environmental Assessment


The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation as an
action required to protect the public and the environment.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim rule with request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is extending the upper limits of the Mississippi River regulated navigation area, which presently
exists between miles 88 and 127, Mississippi River, above Head of Passes, Louisiana, to cover the area between river
miles 88 and 240, above Head of Passes, up to the Port of Baton Rouge. This regulation is necessary to improve the safety
of barge fleeting areas that exist on the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, an extremely
confined navigation area with a high volume of marine traffic. The extension of this regulated navigation area will
result in safer, standardized methods of mooring barges at and around barge fleeting facilities along the lower Mississippi
River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Drafting Information


The drafters of this regulation are LTJG Stephanie Spunt, project officer for the Captain of the Port, New Orleans,
Louisiana, LT Verne Gifford, project officer, Eighth Coast Guard District Marine Safety Division, and CDR D. G. Dickman,
project attorney, Eighth Coast Guard District Legal Office.


Regulatory Information


This rule is being published as an interim rule and is being made effective on the date of publication. Many barge fleet
breakaways have occurred outside the currently regulated area that are a direct result of inadequate mooring practices
that are addressed by this regulation. Current high water conditions in the amended regulated area have exacerbated
the problem. Continued high water conditions are expected in the regulated area throughout the spring and summer
months. Immediate action is needed to limit the number and effect of barge breakaways and to protect the environment,
especially during high water conditions. For these reasons, the Coast Guard for good cause finds, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)
and (d)(3), that notice, and public procedure on the notice, before the effective date of this rule are contrary to
the public interest and that this rule should be made effective in less than 30 days after publication.


Background and Purpose


Recent barge fleet breakaways on the Mississippi River within the Captain of the Port New Orleans zone show that there
are a statistically significant higher incidence of barge fleet breakaways between miles 127 and 240 above Head of
Passes, which is outside of the current regulated navigation area. Coast Guard fleet inspectors have found that many
fleeting operations located between miles 127 and 240 do not currently conform with the mooring regulations that
apply to fleets operating within the current regulated navigation area.
Casualty investigations have indicated that a majority of the breakaways occur as the result of a passing tow or deep
draft vessel striking the fleet. Additionally, barge fleet breakaways are also caused by large wakes from passing
deep draft vessels. Both of these causal factors increase during high water conditions as faster currents and increased
debris result from the high water conditions. This contributes to more collisions and to more incidents from large
vessel wakes. Most often, in these cases, barge moorings outside the current regulated area have been determined
to have been weak or inadequate to withstand these foreseeable increased forces. High water conditions currently
exist and it is expected that higher than normal river stages will continue to exist during the spring and summer of
1994.


Discussion of Rules


The existing regulations establish general procedural and equipment requirements for mooring of barge fleets on
the Mississippi River between miles 88 and 127 above Head of Passes. These regulations further outlined additional
specific fleeting requirements during periods of high water. High water is specified in the regulations as existing
when the Carrollton Gauge stands at 12 feet, or when the Carrollton Gauge stands at 10 feet, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
forecasts the Mississippi River will rise to 12 feet and the District Commander determines the conditions to be hazardous.
The Coast Guard has determined that extending the regulated navigation area to include the area of the Mississippi
River between mile 88 and mile 240 above Head of Passes will improve the management and mooring procedures for the bare
fleets in this area and will reduce the number of breakaways as well as create a safer environment for the entire maritime
community in the Captain of the Port New Orleans zone.


Regulatory Evaluation


This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11034); February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures
of DOT is unnecessary.


Small Entities


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. section 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider the economic impact
on small entities of a rule for which a general notice of proposed rulemaking is required. ``Small entities'' may include:
(1) Small businesses and not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant
in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. This rule does not require
a general notice of proposed rulemaking and, therefore, is exempt from the requirements of the Act. Although this
rule is exempt, the Coast Guard has reviewed it for potential impact on small entities. 
There are approximately 33 barge fleeting operations outside of the current regulated area that will be required
to comply with the increased mooring and supervision requirement as a result of the expansion of the regulated area.
Operators of barge fleets often share locations and some operators have multiple locations both within and without
the current regulated area, meaning that the businesses affected will be less than the number of fleets.

Therefore, the Coast Guard's position is that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. If, however, you think that your business or organization qualifies as a small entity and
that this rule will have a significant economic impact on your business or organization, please submit a comment (see


ADDRESSES

) explaining why you think it qualifies and in what way and to what degree this rule will economically affect it.


Collection of Information


Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. section 3501 et seq.), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviews
each rule that contains a collection-of-information requirement to determine whether the practical value of the
information is worth the burden imposed by its collection. Collection-of-information requirements include recordkeeping,
notification, and other, similar requirements.
This rule contains collection of information requirements in the following section: Section 165.803(i). The following
particulars apply:


DOT No.:

 2115.


OMB Control No.:

 2115-0092.


Administration:

 U.S. Coast Guard.


Title:

 Regulated Navigation Area; Mississippi River, Miles 88 to 240 Above Head of Passes.


Need for Information:

 To ensure that the operators of barge fleeting facilities follow the proper mooring and inspection procedures, in
order to prevent barges from breaking away from a fleeting facility and creating a hazard in a very congested area of
the Mississippi River.


Proposed Use of Information:

 To provide documentary evidence that inspections are being made and to aid in the investigation of any occurrences
of barge fleet breakaways.


Frequency of Response:

 Barge fleeting facilities must record: the time of commencement and termination of each inspection of barge moorings
and the name of each person who does the inspection (twice daily); the date and time of each barge entering or leaving
the facility; and the hazardous cargoes in them.


Burden Estimate:

 Estimated burden is as follows:




9.3 recordings per day x 365 days x 70 fleets x 5 minutes per recording divided by 60 (minutes per
hour) = 19801 hours. Annual total cost is $158,408. (Current approved burden is 11032 hours and annual total cost of
$88,256.)




Respondents:

 70 barge fleeting operators in the regulated area.


Form(s):

 None specified.


Average Burden Hours per Respondent:

 283 hours per respondent per year.
This rule represents an increase of 8769 total hours in recordkeeping requirements.
The Coast Guard is submitting the increased requirements to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under
section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). The section number is  165.803(i) and
the current OMB control number is OMB Control Number 2115-0092. Persons submitting comments on the requirements
should submit their comments both to OMB and to the Coast Guard where indicated under 

ADDRESSES

Traffic Separation Scheme; In The Approaches to Chesapeake Bay



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard amends the traffic separation scheme (TSS) in the Approaches to Chesapeake Bay by realigning and reconfiguring
the Southern Approach to incorporate a deep-water (DW) route. The Coast Guard suspended the Southern approach lanes
on October 15, 1988, because the water depth was too shallow to accommodate the deeper draft vessels which were able
to call on the port after completion of a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) channel deepening project in Hampton Roads.
The realigned and reconfigured Southern Approach utilizes naturally occurring deeper water and incorporates the
proposed Atlantic Ocean Channel, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers navigation improvement project.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Drafting Information




The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Margie G. Hegy, Project Manager, John R. Walters, Project
Officer, Fifth Coast Guard District Portsmouth, VA, and Helen G. Boutrous, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel.



Regulatory History



On September 6, 1990, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled ``Traffic Separation Scheme;
In the Approaches to Chesapeake Bay'' in the 

Federal Register

 (55 FR 36666). The Coast Guard received six letters commenting on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested
and one was not held.



Background and Purpose



The Ports and Waterways Safety Act (PWSA), 33 U.S.C. 1223 authorizes the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast
Guard is operating to establish TSSs and shipping safety fairways, where necessary, to provide safe access routes
for vessels proceeding to or from United States ports.

A TSS is an internationally recognized routing measure that minimizes the risk of collision by separating vessels
into opposing streams of traffic through the establishment of traffic lanes. To be internationally recognized,
a TSS must be approved by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). IMO approves a TSS only if the proposed routing
system complies with IMO principles and guidelines on ships' routing. Vessel use of a TSS is voluntary; however, vessels
operating in or near an IMO approved TSS are subject to Rule 10 of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions
at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), 33 U.S.C. foll. 1602.

The TSS in the Approaches to Chesapeake Bay was established on December 1, 1969, and was adopted by IMO on October 12,
1971. In consists of three parts: Part I, Precautionary Area; Part II, Eastern Approach; and Part III, Southern Approach.

Regulatory Background



The 1978 amendments to the PWSA required the Coast Guard to undertake a port access route study to determine the need
for TSSs or shipping safety fairways to increase vessel traffic safety in offshore areas subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States. The Coast Guard initiated this study by publishing a notice of study on April 16, 1979 (44 FR 22543).
The final notice of study results for the TSS in the Approaches to Chesapeake Bay was published on July 22, 1982 (47 FR
31766). The study concluded that the existing TSS was adequate for the foreseeable future.

The Water Resources Development Act of 1986, Public Law 99-662, (33 U.S.C. 2201 

et seq.

) authorized the deepening of the Thimble Shoals, Newport News, Craney Island Reach, Norfolk Harbor Reach, and the
Entrance Reach Channels in the port of Hampton Roads to a depth of 55
' below mean low water (MLW) and construction of a new channel, to be known as the Atlantic Ocean Channel. The
Atlantic Ocean Channel will connect deep water at the entrance to Chesapeake Bay with deep water in the Atlantic Ocean.

Completion of the dredging of all channels except the Atlantic Ocean Channel to 50
' (MLW) allows vessels with drafts exceeding the water depths in the existing Southern Approach lanes to call
on the ports of Hampton Roads. The COE conducted hydrographic surveys in 1985 and 1986 and found that the water depth
in the Southern Approach lanes was only 48
' (MLW); however, water depths of 50
' were found in the immediate vicinity. To ensure safe navigation for vessels with drafts exceeding the water
depth in the Southern Approach lanes, the Coast Guard suspended the Southern Approach lanes (Notice to Mariners No.
31, July 30, 1988). A system of safewater buoys was established, as an interim measure, to direct vessels to naturally
occurring deeper waters in the immediate vicinity.

The Coast Guard opened a Port Access Route Study on July 12, 1988 (53 FR 26282). The study, conducted by the Fifth Coast
Guard District in Portsmouth, VA, evaluated the need for vessel routing measures in the approaches to Chesapeake
Bay. The study area encompassed the approaches to Chesapeake Bay, including the TSS.

The study results were published on July 13, 1989, at 54 FR 29627. The study, concluding that there is a continuing need
for the TSS, recommended that the Southern Approach be realigned and reconfigured to incorporate a deep-water route
with specific rules for vessels operating therein.

A deep-water route is an internationally recognized routing measure primarily intended for use by ships, which because
of their draft in relation to the available depth of water in the area concerned, require the use of such a route. In the
Southern Approach, water depths outside of the planned deep water route are insufficient for use by vessels drawing
more than 45
' of water. It is also a general requirement of IMO that traffic which does not require the use of the deep-water
route should avoid using the route.

The Coast Guard submitted the amended TSS, as proposed in the NPRM, to IMO's Subcommittee on Safety of Navigation (NAV)
for consideration and approval at its September 1990 meeting. The Subcommittee approved the establishment of a deep-water
route between the traffic lanes of the southern approach of the TSS as proposed by the U.S., but ``could not agree with
the proposal to recommend the use of the deep-water route by certain ships with a draft of less than 45
' (13.5 meters) which need not use the deep-water route.'' The Subcommittee amended the U.S. proposal accordingly
and forwarded it to IMO's Maritime Safety Committee for consideration and adoption. The Committee adopted the revised
proposal at its May 1991 meeting for implementation at 0000 hours UTC, 0500 Eastern Time Zone, on 16 November 1991.

The Coast Guard is reconfiguring the Southern Approach, which is crucial to continued navigation safety and protection
of the marine environment, and publishing the Precautionary Area and Eastern Approach parts of the existing TSS.

The Southern Approach consists of inbound and outbound lanes for vessels drawing 45
' of water or less, separated by a 1300
' wide deep-water route for inbound and outbound vessels drawing over 45
' of water and for naval aircraft carriers.

Both the inbound and outbound lanes for vessels drawing 45
' feet of water or less measure 0.75 nautical miles (1500 yards) in width as determined by multiplying the published
standard error of LORAN-C (0.25 NM) by three. Because of the low-lying coast of the Commonwealth of Virginia
and the lack of prominent landmarks, LORAN-C remains an acceptable aid to navigation for use in these inbound
and outbound lanes.
The deep water route, for vessels drawing over 45
' of water, measures 1300
' in width and has a charted natural depth of 50
' or greater. As currently planned, the COE will construct the Atlantic Ocean Channel in this location when
funds become available in both the Federal and Commonwealth of Virginia budgets. Due to uncertain economic conditions,
a dredging completion date is unknown.


Discussion of Comments and Changes


Six written comments were received in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking. Five comments fully support
establishment of the traffic separation scheme and the sixth comment offered editorial suggestions. Specific comments
pertaining to other aspects of the proposal are discussed below.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) advised that due to budgetary consideration in the Commonwealth of Virginia,
dredging of the Atlantic Ocean Channel would be rescheduled to an indefinite time in the future. The COE also pointed
out an error in one of the geographical positions for the inbound traffic lane. This information has been corrected
in the final rule.
One comment, which is not adopted in this final rule, suggested that the draft limitation for use of the deep-water
route be changed to ``vessels drawing 45 feet or more'' while four comments agreed with the proposal to provide vessels
drawing greater than 45 feet exclusive use of the deep-water route.
Five comments strongly objected to the proposal to recommend that all vessels carrying dangerous cargo and petroleum
distillates as cargo use the deep-water route. IMO's Subcommittee on Safety of Navigation also objected to this provision
and amended the U.S. proposal to exclude it from consideration and adoption by the Maritime Safety Committee. Based
on the comments and IMO's action, this proposed recommendation is deleted from this final rule.
Three comments objected to naval aircraft carriers using the deep-water route. In response to the notice of study,
the U.S. Navy requested that it be allowed to use the deep-water route to ensure the continued safe, uneventful transit
of aircraft carriers to and from sea. The Coast Guard and IMO agree that aircraft carrier usage of the deep-water route
will enhance navigation safety and therefore will be permitted.
One comment suggested placement of a buoy near latitude 36
 54.43
' longitude 75
 53.2
'W to mark lesser water depths adjacent to the inbound traffic lane. The 1500-yard inbound lane, with the use
of LORAN-C or radar, is sufficient to allow safe passage through the area without the placement of a buoy. Therefore,
this comment is not adopted.
Three comments disagreed with the proposed recommendation that vessels announce their intentions to use the deep-water
route. One comment objected to Channel 16 VHF-FM usage because of frequency congestion by other users. Two comments
recommended that vessels call at least one hour prior to entering the deep-water route instead of at the time the vessel
approaches Chesapeake Bay Southern Approach Lighted Whistle Buoy CB on the south end, or Chesapeake Bay Junction
Lighted Buoy CBJ on the north end of the route, as proposed in the NPRM. The Coast Guard realizes that Channel 16 is crowded,
however it is recognized as the distress, safety, and calling frequency in the United States and internationally
as evidenced by IMO's adoption of this recommended practice. If the exchange of additional information is required,
shifting to another VHF-FM channel would be appropriate.
Other minor editorial and administrative changes have been made to improve the clarity of this part.


Regulatory Evaluation


This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and non-significant
under the DOT regulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). Vessels have been complying with
the requirements of this rule since IMO implementation on November 16, 1991. No additional costs are associated with
this final rule. The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation
under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.


Small Entities


There are no additional costs associated with this final rule as vessels have been using the newly configured southern
approach lanes since it was implemented by IMO on November 16, 1991. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under Section
605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.) that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.


Collection of Information


This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.).


Federalism


The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order
12612 and has determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.
The authority to establish TSSs and shipping safety fairways, where necessary, to provide safe across routes for
vessels proceeding to or from U.S. ports is committed to the Coast Guard by Federal Statute. Therefore, the Coast Guard
does not expect this rule to raise any preemption issues with respect to state actions on the same subject matter.


Environmental Impact


The Coast Guard has determined that this action will not have a significant impact on the environment and that an environmental
impact statement is not necessary. A Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) is on file in the docket for inspection
or copying where indicated under 

ADDRESSES

. Comments received as a result of the NPRM did not address any environmental concerns.

Veterans Education; Flight Training 


<AGENCY>

 Department of Veterans Affairs. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final regulations. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 These amended regulations permit pilot flight training pursuant to 14 CFR, Part 61, conducted in flight simulators
to be approved for purposes of VA (Department of Veterans Affairs) administered education benefits when such training
is authorized by the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration). These regulations also provide for approval of solo
flight training for such education benefits purposes, as authorized by the Veterans Benefits Act of 1992. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On pages 49196 through 49199 of the

 Federal Register 

of September 22, 1993, there were published interim final regulations with a request for public comment. These regulations
amended 38 CFR part 21 in order to implement provisions of the Veterans Benefits Act of 1992 which affect flight training
and to provide for approval of flight training in flight simulators for VA educational benefit purposes. Interested
people were given 30 days to submit comments, suggestions or objections. VA received no comments, suggestions or
objections. Accordingly, these regulations are now final. 


To ensure that flight training would achieve the end of qualifying the individual for employment in the aviation industry,
VA regulation  21.4263 has long restricted approvable training in two ways: (1) The entity providing the training
must have a pilot school or provisional pilot school certificate issued by the FAA under part 141, 14 CFR ( 21.4263(g));
and (2) the training being offered must meet the FAA requirements of either Part 141, in the case of pilots, or part 63,
in the case of flight crew members other than pilots ( 21.4263(g)(3)(ii)). Thus, the individual is assured
of the quality of the training and its ability to enable him or her to meet FAA standards for an appropriate certificate
or rating in areas relevant to commercial aviation. 
For the reasons stated in the 

Federal Register

 on September 22, 1993, these amended regulations now also permit pilot flight training pursuant to 14 CFR part 61,
conducted in flight simulators to be approved for purposes of VA (Department of Veterans Affairs) administered education
benefits when such training is authorized by the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration).

The Veterans Benefits Act of 1992, Public Law 102-568, contains a provision which now allows eligible veterans
and servicemembers to receive educational assistance allowance for pursuing solo flight training. Therefore,
these amendments contain provisions governing such flight training. 
The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has certified that these amended regulations will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C.
601-612. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the amended regulations, therefore, are exempt from the initial and final
regulatory flexibility analyses requirements of sections 603 and 604. 
This certification can be made because those provisions governing solo flight training affect only individuals.
While the amended regulations governing flight training in a flight simulator will directly affect some small entities,
VA does not believe that they will affect a substantial number of them. Most of the schools or entities which now will
be able to seek approval are under the control of the major airlines. These airlines would not qualify as small entities.
Furthermore, the economic impact on the few small entities that would qualify to seek approval for additional training
would be positive since there may be additional veterans who would pursue the courses offered by those small entities.
VA does not think that this would be a significant economic impact since the number of veterans enrolling in any course
would probably be small. 
VA finds that the Administrative Procedures Act allows a retroactive effective date for these amended regulations.
The amended regulations governing flight training in flight simulators contain only liberalizing provisions which
relieve a restriction imposed on the approval of flight courses. 
Furthermore, the department is aware that although the regulations did not permit approval of courses offered pursuant
to part 61, 14 CFR, some courses have been approved due to a misunderstanding as to the nature of some of these courses
and some veterans have received educational assistance for pursuing them. Since, in these cases, FAA-approved training
of the kind covered by these regulations was provided based on administrative approval of the courses, VA believes
it appropriate that this promulgation of regulations also ratify such course approvals. Accordingly, VA is making
the amendments to   21.4263(g)(1), 21.4263(g)(4), 21.4263(g)(4)(i) and the new paragraph 21.4263(h)(1)(iii)
effective September 30, 1990, which is the same as the effective date for the earliest of these approvals. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs finds that good cause exists for making the amendments to remaining regulations,
like the provisions of law they implement, retroactively effective on October 1, 1992. 

It is necessary to implement these provisions of law as soon as possible. These provisions are intended to achieve
a benefit for the individual. The maximum benefits intended in the legislation will be achieved through prompt implementation.
Hence, a delayed effective date would be contrary to statutory design, would complicate administration of these
provisions of law; and might result in the denial of a benefit to someone who is entitled to it. 
These regulations have been reviewed by OMB (the Office of Management and Budget) under Executive Order 12866. 
The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance numbers for the programs affected by these amended regulations are 64.120,
64.124 and 12.609.

specifying each course the school is approved to offer under 14 CFR part 141. Thus, a military aero club, air carrier
or institution of higher learning with the proper certificate is a flight school. 


(ii) The entity is either a Flight Training Center or an Air Carrier which does not have a pilot school or provisional
pilot school certificate issued by the FAA under 14 CFR part 141, but pursuant to a Grant of Exemption letter issued
by the FAA, is permitted to offer pilot training by a flight simulator instead of by use of actual aircraft.

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 USEPA is approving a revision to the Minnesota State Implementation Plan (SIP) for new source review in nonattainment
areas, as proposed on February 23, 1994. This revision was submitted to meet longstanding requirements as well as
new requirements imposed by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. This revision consists of the State Rules 7005.3010
through 7005.3060, which incorporate by reference the new source review requirements specified in appendix S to
40 CFR part 51, ``Emission Offset Interpretive Ruling,'' except for the deletion of unacceptable exemptions included
in appendix S. This approval lifts the prior ban on permitting major sources and major modifications in Minnesota
nonattainment areas.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking


On February 23, 1994, at 59 FR 8578, USEPA proposed to approve Minnesota new source review regulations submitted on
August 5, 1992, and August 26, 1993. These submittals were intended to satisfy both the requirements predating the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and the new requirements those amendments impose. The discussion that follows summarizes
the notice of proposed rulemaking. Since no comments were received on this proposal, USEPA is today making final its
approval of these new source review submittals and removing the ban on construction of major new sources and major
modifications in Minnesota nonattainment areas.
The statutory requirements that apply to State regulations for new source review in nonattainment areas are set forth
at part D of title I of the Clean Air Act, particularly in sections 172(c)(5) and 173. Federal regulations developed
prior to enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 for nonattainment area new source review programs are set
forth at title 40 Code of Federal Regulations, part 51 (40 CFR part 51), particularly 40 CFR 51.165. The Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990 also establish assorted new requirements, for which preliminary guidance was published April
16, 1992 (57 FR 13498), and April 28, 1992 (57 FR 18070). For example, section 189(a)(1)(A) requires that permit programs
satisfying sections 172(c)(5) and 173 be submitted for fine particulate matter nonattainment areas.
The notice of proposed rulemaking provided a summarized history of Minnesota new source review submittals. None
of these submittals satisfied the specific requirements for permitting new and modified major sources in nonattainment
areas, and so Minnesota became subject to a prohibition against permitting major new sources and major modifications
in the State's nonattainment areas, as promulgated by USEPA on July 2, 1979 (44 FR 38583). 
Section 173 of the Act identifies four essential requirements that State new source permit regulations must impose
in nonattainment areas:



(1) New source emissions must be offset by equivalent or greater emission reductions in the area; 
(2) The new source must have the lowest achievable emission rate (LAER); 
(3) Other sources in the same State owned by the owner or operator of the new source must be in compliance or on a schedule
to achieve compliance with applicable regulations; and 
(4) The area must not be subject to a finding of failure to implement the SIP. 
The submittals being addressed in this rulemaking include State Rules 7005.3010 through 7005.3060 (``Offset Rule'').
These rules incorporate appendix S to 40 CFR part 51 into these State rules, modified in response to recommendations
by USEPA. In general, adoption of appendix S of 40 CFR part 51 into the State's regulations serves to impose the requirements
identified in section 173. Part IV. A. of appendix S provides multiple conditions for granting a permit, including
a requirement for lowest achievable emission rates (requirement 2 above), a requirement for compliance of commonly
owned sources (requirement 3 above), and a requirement for offsets (requirement 1 above). Although appendix S contains
no provision prohibiting permits in ``failure to implement'' areas, USEPA has adequate authority under section
113(a)(5) to take any necessary action to address permits that violate this prohibition. 
The adoption of appendix S by reference as a State rule fails to satisfy some permitting requirements under subpart
I of 40 CFR part 51. In particular, appendix S exempts certain source types and is insufficiently clear on some issues.
In accordance with a letter from USEPA dated May 17, 1991, Minnesota made various recommended rule revisions which
provide that the relevant appendix S exemptions do not apply in Minnesota. USEPA today finds this modified program
to satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR part 51.
As discussed in the notice of proposed rulemaking, USEPA has also reviewed whether the requirements enacted as part
of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 have been satisfied. As proposed, USEPA is today concluding that the Offset
Rule, in conjunction with previously approved permitting rules, satisfies these new requirements.
Minnesota also adopted significant revisions to its regulations on permit processing on August 24, 1993, which it
submitted for SIP rulemaking on November 23, 1993. The primary purposes of these regulations were to satisfy requirements
in title V of the Clean Air Act for a State operating permit program and to amend the new source permitting regulations
to provide an integrated set of permitting regulations. In developing these regulations, the State incorporated
language intended to address various issues USEPA had identified with respect to the prior permitting rules. These
issues are discussed in more detail in the notice of proposed rulemaking, and include concerns about permit expiration,
variances, and outdated references in the Memorandum of Understanding on public comment procedures.

1

 USEPA is not taking rulemaking action today on the submittal of November 23, 1993. Nevertheless, USEPA finds that
the issues discussed in the notice of proposed rulemaking are no longer of concern, in general because the revised
State rules prevent the relevant problems from arising.





As noted in the proposed rulemaking, USEPA is currently developing a rule to implement the changes under the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990 in the new source review provisions in parts C and D of title I of the Act. The Agency anticipates
that the final rule will be promulgated sometime during 1995. Upon promulgation of this final rule, USEPA will review
new source review SIPs to determine whether additional SIP revisions are necessary to satisfy the requirements of
the rule.
On February 15, 1994, at 59 FR 7218, USEPA concluded that particulate matter precursors do not contribute significantly
to violations of the particulate matter standard in Minnesota. Therefore, under section 189(e), new source review
for particulate matter precursors is not required in Minnesota's particulate matter nonattainment areas.


II. This Action


USEPA received no comments on its proposal to approve Minnesota's nonattainment area permitting regulations. Consequently,
USEPA continues to believe that the regulations submitted by Minnesota on August 5, 1992, and August 26, 1993, satisfy
the requirements under part D for a new source permitting program in nonattainment areas, and is approving this SIP
revision. 
Under the approved rules, permits for nonattainment area sources that satisfy the substantive requirements of the
Offset Rule (Rules 7005.3010 through 7005.3060) would be processed in accordance with permit processing provisions
in the Consolidated Permit Rules (Rules 7001.0010 through 7001.0210 and Rules 7001.1200 through 7001.1220). On
May 13, 1988 (53 FR 17033), USEPA approved the Consolidated Permit Rule as satisfying attainment area permitting
requirements but noted that nonattainment area permitting requirements were not met. Today's action finds the nonattainment
area permitting requirements met, removes the ban on construction of major new sources and major modifications in
Minnesota nonattainment areas, and imposes Minnesota's Consolidated Permit Rule and Offset Rule as federally enforceable
requirements for such new sources and modifications. Subsequent rulemaking will address the approvability of the
State permitting regulations submitted November 23, 1993.
The rules submitted by Minnesota were intended to address nonattainment area new source review requirements and
did not address visibility-related permitting requirements specified in 40 CFR 51.307. Therefore, USEPA is retaining
the provisions of 40 CFR 52.1236, which note the absence of approvable State regulations for visibility protection
and impose the federally promulgated regulations of 40 CFR 52.26 and 52.28.
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids USEPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. 

Union Electric Co.

 v. 

USEPA

, 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). 
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
This action makes final the action proposed at 59 FR 8578. As noted elsewhere in this document, USEPA received no adverse
public comment on the proposed action. As a result, the Regional Administrator has classified this action as a Table
Three action under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January 19, 1989, based on revised SIP processing
review tables approved by the Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's
memorandum to Regional Administrators). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
Two and Three SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866 for a period of 2
years. OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request
continued in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by June 27, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the
Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does
it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2).)

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is taking action to approve a requested revision to the
Indiana State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone. USEPA's action is based upon a revision request which was submitted
by the State to satisfy the requirements of the Clean Air Act (Act), which requires certain ozone nonattainment areas
to require specified gasoline dispensing facilities to install and operate Stage II vapor recovery equipment. The
subject areas established in the SIP revision are the Indiana portion of the Chicago ozone nonattainment area (Lake
and Porter Counties) and the Indiana portion of the Louisville, Kentucky ozone nonattainment area (Clark and Floyd
Counties). USEPA's action is being taken without prior proposal.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



I. Background/Summary of State Submittal



On February 25, 1994, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) submitted to USEPA Stage II Vapor
Recovery Rules: Amendments to 326 IAC 8-1-0.5 and 326 IAC 8-4-6 as requested revisions to the
Indiana SIP. The rules were adopted by the Indiana Air Pollution Control Board (IAPCB) on July 21, 1993, and were published
in the Indiana Register on December 1, 1993. The State submitted these rules to satisfy the Stage II vapor recovery
requirements of section 182(b)(3) of the Act. The SIP revision submitted by the State of Indiana sets out procedures
for the establishment of a Stage II Vapor Recovery Program in the ozone nonattainment counties of Lake, Porter, Clark,
and Floyd. The information presented below summaries the requested SIP revision and USEPA's action on it. A more detailed
analysis of the State's submittal is contained in USEPA's technical support documents dated March 23, 1993, and March
31, 1994, which are available from the Region 5 office listed above.

Indiana's regulations specify that Stage II vapor recovery systems are required at gasoline dispensing facilities
that dispense more than 10,000 gallons per month, and independent small business marketers of gasoline (ISBMG) that
dispense an average monthly volume of more than 50,000 gallons per month. Private fueling facilities such as government
and company fleet fueling facilities, as well as retailers, are subject to the Stage II requirements. The regulations
specify the use of California Air Resource Board (CARB) certified Stage II systems, which have been demonstrated
to achieve at least 95 percent control of Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions during the refueling of motor
vehicles. The rules also mandate that the proper installation and operation of such systems be achieved by requiring
the installed systems to be tested for proper installation and requiring the State to perform all necessary enforcement
of the rules.

The rules mandate the Stage II vapor recovery systems for nonexempt facilities be implemented pursuant to the following
phase-in schedule: (1) Facilities that commenced construction after November 15, 1990, must comply six months after
promulgation of the rules by the State; (2) facilities that commenced construction before November 15, 1990, and
dispense an average monthly volume of more than 100,000 gallons of motor fuel per month, must comply by one year after
promulgation of the rules by the State; and (3) all other facilities must comply two years after promulgation of the
rules by the State.



II. Review Criteria



The USEPA reviewed the submittal against the requirements of section 182(b)(3) of the Act, as interpreted in the General
Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (57 FR 13498, 13513 (April 16, 1992)),
and two USEPA documents entitled Technical Guidance-Stage II Vapor Recovery Systems for Control of Vehicle Refueling
Emissions at Gasoline Dispensing Facilities (Technical Guidance) and the Enforcement Guidance for Stage II Vehicle
Refueling Control Programs (Enforcement Guidance). Specifically, the following seven general criteria need to
be met for a Stage II vapor recovery regulation to be approvable by USEPA:

(1) Installation of Stage II Controls and Determination of Regulated Facilities



Facilities that dispense more than 10,000 gallons per month must install and operate Stage II controls. For gasoline
dispensing facilities that are owned and operated by an ISBMG, the State may establish a cut-point as high as 50,000
gallons per month. Section 324(c) of the Act establishes a definition of a ISBMG as a person engaged in the marketing
of gasoline who would be required to pay for the installation and operation of Stage II equipment. There are four exemptions
to this definition (i.e., four groups that will not be considered ISBMGs): (1) A refiner; (2) a person who controls,
is controlled by or is under common control with a refiner; (3) a person who otherwise is directly or indirectly affiliated
with a refiner or a person who controls, is controlled by or is under common control with a refiner (unless the sole affiliation
is by means of a supply contract or an agreement or contract to use trademark, trade name, service mark, or other identifying
symbol or name owned by such refiner or any such person); or (4) a person who receives less than 50 percent of this annual
income from refining or marketing of gasoline. In the General Preamble, USEPA indicated that the suggested method
for calculating the gallons per month dispensed by affected facilities is determined by calculating the average
volume of product dispensed per month for the 2-year period prior to the adoption of the rule by the State. (See General
Preamble, 57 FR at 13514.) The Enforcement Guidance suggests that if sufficient data is not available for a full 2-year
period, then the period should be extended to include a total of 24 months of activity, or the actual months of operation
during that 2-year period should be used to calculate the facility's average gallons per month. (See Enforcement
Guidance, Sec. 3.2.)



(2) Establishment of a Time Schedule for Installation of Stage II Control Equipment



Section 182(b)(3)(B) of the Act establishes three standard deadlines for the installation and application of Stage
II controls, after adoption by the State of the Stage II requirements. The phase-in schedule given in the Act is the
following: (a) 6 months after adoption for all facilities commencing construction after November 15, 1990; (b) 1
year after adoption for all facilities which dispense 100,000 gallons or more of gasoline per month; and (c) 2 years
after adoption for all other facilities required to be regulated. For ISBMGs, section 324(a) of the Act provides that
the phase in periods may be: (a) 33 percent of the facilities owned by an ISBMG by the end of the first year after the regulations
take effect; (b) 66 percent of such facilities by the end of the second year; and (c) 100 percent of such facilities after
the third year.



(3) System Certification



An approved system should be tested and certified so as to meet a minimum requirement of 95 percent emission reduction
efficiency. The USEPA believes that this efficiency rate has been demonstrated to be feasible. As stated in the General
Preamble, the States may achieve this by utilizing one of the following three alternatives: (a) A method tested and
approved by CARB past, current or future recognized testing methods, or (b) an equivalent testing program adopted
by the State, conducted by the Program Oversight Agency (POA) or by a third party recognized by the POA, and submitted
and approved by USEPA for incorporation in the SIP, or (c) a system approved by CARB. (See Enforcement Guidance, Sec.
4.2.)



(4) Facility Verification of the Proper Installation and Function of Stage II Vapor Control Systems



The General Preamble indicates in order for the State Stage II requirements to be enforceable, the State must require
the regulated facility to verify proper installation and function of the Stage II equipment. The Enforcement Guidance
specifies performing a Liquid Blockage Test which determines if there is an unacceptable low point in the piping,
and a Leak Test which measures the vapor tightness of the Stage II system. The Enforcement Guidance also states that
a facility should recertify the functions of the Stage II equipment as least every 5 years, or upon major system replacement
or facility modification (75 percent or more of the facility's Stage II equipment), whichever occurs first. (See
April 16, 1992 (57 FR 13514) General Preamble, and; Enforcement Guidance, Sec. 8.2.)



(5) Recordkeeping and Reporting



In the Enforcement Guidance, USEPA identifies various records that the State should require facilities to keep and
to make available upon request. The USEPA believes that these documents must be available in order to make the Stage
II requirement enforceable. These documents include: (a) A license/permit to install and operate the Stage II system;
(b) verification of passing functional tests after installation of equipment, this includes the Liquid Blockage
Test, Leak Test, and all shutoff/flow prohibiting devise testing; (c) a general station file containing initial
station information such as motor vehicle fuel throughput information; (d) an equipment maintenance and compliance
file log containing verification that proper maintenance has been conducted in accordance with manufacturer's
specifications and requirements; and (e) training certification files. (See Enforcement Guidance, Sec. 8.0.)



(6) Periodic Inspection of Regulated Facility



The State POA should conduct a minimum of 1 compliance inspection per facility per year with mandatory follow-up at
stations with violations. USEPA believes such inspections are necessary to ensure that facilities are complying
with the Stage II requirements. This is necessary not only for enforcement action but to notify sources that are violating
the Stage II requirements so they can make the necessary adjustments to come into compliance. The compliance inspection
should consist of a visual inspection of the required paperwork and Stage I and II equipment. In addition to the visual
inspection, a functional inspection to determine if the facility's Stage II equipment is functioning properly must
also be performed. (See Enforcement Guidance, Sec. 5.2(d).)



(7) Regulated Facility Compliance



The State is required to ensure regulated facility compliance with program requirements through enforcement mechanisms,
and a penalty schedule that establishes appropriate penalties for facilities violating the Stage II requirements.
(See Enforcement Guidance, Sec. 5.2(e).)

III. Results of USEPA Review



The USEPA reviewed the Indiana submittal to determine if criteria for approval have been met. The results of USEPA's
review are as follows:



(1) Installation of Stage II Controls and Determination of Regulated Facilities



Indiana's submittal mandates the requirement of Stage II vapor recovery systems on any gasoline dispensing facility
that dispenses a monthly average volume of 10,000 gallons or more, and on ISBMGs who dispense more than 50,000 gallons.
The submittal also includes a requirement that affected facilities be identified by calculating the average volume
of product dispensed per month for the 2-year period prior to adoption of the rule by the State. Monthly averages are
to include only those months when the facility was operating. The USEPA finds this acceptable because if fully addresses
the Federal requirement.



(2) Establishment of a Time Schedule for Installation of Stage II Control Equipment



The Act specifies that the time period for installation and operation of the Stage II equipment shall run from the State
adoption date of the Stage II rule. The Act defines adoption to mean the date the State adopts the requirements for installation
and operation of the Stage II equipment. For all facilities, these compliance dates, calculated from the time of State
adoption of the regulation, are: (1) 6 months for facilities for which construction began after November 15, 1990;
(2) 1 year for facilities that dispense greater than 100,000 gallons of gasoline per month; and (3) 2 years for all other
facilities. The Indiana Stage II rule time schedule sets compliance dates of June 1, 1994, December 1, 1994, and December
1, 1995, respectively for the above three deadlines based on the December 1, 1993, publication date of the rule in the
Indiana Register. The State has adopted this schedule for all affected facilities, including those owned or operated
by ISBMGs. Although Indiana adopted its regulations on July 21, 1993, USEPA believes it is appropriate to interpret
the adoption date to be December 1, 1993, under the limited circumstances presented in this submittal.

The USEPA is approving the submitted time table for the following reasons. First, the Act states that the adoption
date must be used to calculate the compliance schedule for Stage II implementation at facilities. In this case, USEPA
defines the adoption date to be the date after which a rule becomes effective in a State. Based on this definition of
adoption date USEPA accepts the December 1, 1993, rule publication date as the adoption date from which the compliance
schedule is calculated. Second, the compliance deadlines triggered by this date begin within the time schedule specified
by the Act. Third, remedying this deficiency by amending the compliance schedule would cause further delay in the
implementation of Stage II in Indiana. Finally, the Indiana rule otherwise fulfills the Stage II requirements and
USEPA believes it will provide substantial air quality benefits to the regulated areas. Therefore, USEPA believes
it is in the public interest to approve and make enforceable this requirement at the earliest time feasible. In the
limited circumstances above, USEPA believes that it is not inconsistent to interpret the adoption date to the December
1, 1993.



(3) System Certification



The adopted rule mandate that all Stage II vapor control systems used be certified by CARB to meet 95 percent emission
reduction efficiency. Use of CARB-certified systems is acceptable to USEPA. The USEPA has specified in its guidance
documents that it believes that CARB-approved Stage II systems meet the requirement of the Act with no additional
efficiency testing required. Therefore, USEPA finds the specified system certification in the Indiana submittal
acceptable.



(4) Installation of Stage II Vapor Control Systems



The Indiana rule mandates that proper tests be performed to verify proper installation and function of the Stage II
systems, and requires systems to be retested every five years, or upon major system replacement or modification.
The USEPA believes the testing procedures specified help make the rule enforceable and, therefore, are consistent
with the requirements of the Act.



(5) Recordkeeping and Reporting



The Indiana rule requires that the affected facilities submit a registration form of their Stage II equipment to IDEM
within forty-five days after the installation of the Stage II equipment. In addition, the rule requires that registration
material be kept onsite. It also requires that, at a minimum, the registration information includes: the facility
name and address, signature of owner or operator, the CARB Executive Order Number for the Stage II system used, number
of nozzles used, the monthly average volume of gasoline dispensed, and the location (including contact person's
name, address, and telephone number) of other records and reports required by the rule. Other records and reports
required by the rule to be kept on file by the owner or operator and which need to be made available to the POA upon request
include: proof that a certified Stage II system has been installed and tested to verify its performance according
to its specifications; records that show that proper maintenance has been conducted according to manufacturer specifications;
records that show time periods and duration of all malfunctions of the Stage II system; motor vehicle fuel throughput
information for each calendar month of the previous year; and proof of employee training certification. The USEPA
finds Indiana's recordkeeping and reporting requirements acceptable.

(6) Periodic Inspection Requirements


The IDEM has committed to adhere to the Enforcement Guidance that specifies annual inspections for the facilities
with mandatory follow-up at stations with violations or the development of an inspection schedule approved by USEPA
through IDEM's inspection program plan.



(7) Regulated Facility Compliance With Program Requirements



The Indian Code (IC 13-7-13-1, states that any person who violates any provision of this article,
IC 13-1-1, IC 13-1-3, or IC 13-1-11, or any regulation or standard adopted by one
(1) of the boards (i.e., Indiana Air Pollution Control Board), or who violates any determination, permit, or order
made or issued by the Commissioner (of IDEM) pursuant to this article, IC 13-1-1, or IC 13-1-3,
is liable for a civil penalty not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) per day of any violation. In that
this submittal is a regulation adopted by the IAPCB, a violation of which subjects the violator to penalties under
IC 13-7-13-1, the submittal is consistent with the policy established by USEPA in its Enforcement
Guidance. In addition, IDEM has submitted a civil penalty policy document which accounts for various factors in the
assessment of an appropriate civil penalty for noncompliance with IAPCB rules. Some factors accounted for include:
severity of the violation, intent, frequency of violations, and other factors.



IV. Rulemaking Action



The USEPA approves 326 IAC 8-1-0.5 and 8-4-6 as revisions to the Indiana ozone SIP because the
submittal meets all the criteria required for approvability, as cited above. The Stage II vapor recovery SIP revision
for the Lake, Porter, Clark, and Floyd Counties ozone nonattainment areas will be complete following this action.

The USEPA is approving this action without prior proposal because the USEPA views this as a noncontroversial revision
and anticipate no adverse comments. This action will be effective on June 27, 1994 unless, May 31, 1994 someone wishes
to submit adverse comments. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by
publishing two subsequent documents. One document will withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking
by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments are received, the public
is advised that this action will be effective on June 27, 1994.

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989, (54 FR 2214-2225). A revision to the SIP processing review tables was approved by the Acting
Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional
Administrators). A future document will inform the general public of these tables. Under the revised tables this
action remains classified as a Table 2. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2
and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years. USEPA
has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver
until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continued in effect under Executive Order 12866 which
superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq, 

USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids USEPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

U.S. E.P.A., 

427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).


Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by June 27, 1994. Filling a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review not does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The Federal Communications Commission is modifying a section of the Commission's Rules that implements the Freedom
of Information Act (FOIA) fee schedule. This modification pertains to the charge for recovery of the full, allowable
direct costs of searching for and reviewing records requested under the FOIA and the Commission's rules, unless such
fees are restricted or waived in accordance with the Commission's rules. The fees are being revised to correspond
to modifications in the rate of pay approved by Congress.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

The FCC is modifying 47 CFR 0.467(a) of the Commission's Rules. This rule pertains to the charges for searching and
reviewing records requested under the Freedom of Information (FOIA). The FOIA requires federal agencies to establish
a schedule of fees for the processing of requests for agency records in accordance with fee guidance issued by the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB). In 1987, OMB issued its Uniform Freedom of Information Act Fee Schedule and Guidelines.
However, because the FOIA requires that each agency's fees be based upon its direct costs of providing FOIA services,
OMB did not provide a unitary, government-wide schedule of fees. The Commission based its FOIA fee schedule on the
grade level of the employee who processes the request. Thus, the fee schedule was computed at a Step 5 of each grade level
based on the General Schedule effected January 1994. The instant revisions correspond to modifications in the rate
of pay recently approved by Congress. 



Regulatory Procedures



This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866 and has been determined not to be a ``significant rule'' since
it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. 

In addition, it has been determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities.

Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for species that 
comprise the deep-water species fishery by vessels using trawl 
gear in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary because the second seasonal bycatch allowance of Pacific
halibut apportioned to the deep-water species fishery in the GOA has been caught.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the GOA 
exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce 
according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the 
Gulf of Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery 
Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is 
governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 
and 672. 


An emergency interim rule (59 FR 6222, February 10, 1994) 
apportioned the Pacific halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limit for trawl gear into bycatch allowances and
seasonal apportionments thereof among fishery categories. In accordance with  672.20(f)(3)(iii), the deep-water
species fishery, which is defined at  672.20(f)(3)(ii)(B), was apportioned 300 mt of Pacific halibut PSC for
the second season, the period March 31, 1994, through June 30, 1994. 
The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, 
in accordance with  672.20(f)(3)(iv), that vessels participating 
in the trawl deep-water species fishery in the GOA have caught the second seasonal bycatch allowance of Pacific halibut
apportioned to that fishery. Therefore, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for each species and species group
that comprise the deep-water species fishery by vessels using trawl gear in the GOA. The species and species groups
that comprise the deep-water species fishery are: All rockfish of the genera 

Sebastes

 and 

Sebastolobus,

 Greenland turbot, Dover sole, Rex sole, arrowtooth flounder, and sablefish. This closure is effective from 12 noon,
A.l.t., April 22, 1994, until 12 noon, A.l.t., 
June 30, 1994.

Institutional Eligibility Under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as 
Amended; Eligibility of Foreign Medical Schools Under the Guaranteed Student Loan Program (GSLP) 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY

: Department of Education.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION

: Final regulations. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY

: The Secretary amends the regulations for Institutional Eligibility under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended
(HEA), and the regulations for Eligibility of Foreign Medical Schools under the Guaranteed Student Loan Program
(GSLP) to reflect changes made to the HEA by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992. The Secretary removes the latter
regulations from Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations, revises them, and adds them to the former regulations
as a new subpart E. 


The regulations revise the procedures and criteria under which a foreign institution establishes eligibility to
apply to participate in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) programs if the institution is comparable to an eligible
institution of higher education located in the United States.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Institutional Eligibility regulations contain requirements that apply to all postsecondary educational institutions
that seek initial or continued eligibility to apply to participate in the programs authorized by the HEA. 


On January 18, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for parts 600 and 601 in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 2714). The NPRM included a discussion of major issues surrounding the proposed changes that will not be repeated
here. The following list summarizes those issues and identifies the pages of the preamble to the NPRM on which a discussion
of those issues can be found: 
Purpose and scope in  600.51 (page 2714). 
Definitions contained in  600.52 (page 2714). 
Provisions for requesting an eligibility determination contained in  600.53 (pages 2714-2715). 
Criteria for determining the eligibility of a foreign institution contained in  600.54 (page 2715). 
Additional criteria for determining the eligibility of a foreign graduate medical school contained in  600.55

(pages 2715-2716).

Provisions governing the duration of eligibility determinations in  600.56 (page 2716).
 
These final regulations contain one significant difference from the NPRM. In  600.54, the Secretary has added
a requirement for a foreign institution to be a public or private nonprofit institution. 


Analysis of Comments and Changes 


In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 415 parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations.
Most comments were from persons connected with two foreign graduate medical schools and were nearly identical. An
analysis of the comments and of the changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM follows. Substantive
issues are discussed under the section of the regulations to which they pertain. 
Technical and other minor changes_and suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under applicable
statutory authority_are not addressed. 


Section 600.54 Criteria for Determining Whether a Foreign Institution is Eligible To Apply To Participate in the
FFEL Programs 




Comments: 

A commenter pointed out that section 481(a)(1) of the HEA requires a foreign institution to be comparable to an institution
of higher education as defined in section 1201(a) of the HEA, and that the definition in section 1201(a) requires an
institution to be a public or private nonprofit institution. The commenter suggested that this requirement be added
to the regulations.



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenter that a change is necessary to make clear that a for-profit institution is not
eligible under these regulations. 


Changes:

 Section 600.54 has been revised to require a foreign institution to be a public or private nonprofit educational institution.




Section 600.55 Additional Criteria for Determining Whether a Foreign Graduate Medical School is Eligible To Apply
To Participate in the FFEL Programs. 





Comments:

 Most commenters opposed the requirement that a training program for foreign medical students be approved by all medical
licensing boards and evaluating bodies whose views are considered relevant by the Secretary on the grounds that the
Secretary might rely on the judgments of inappropriate bodies. Some commenters were concerned that the Secretary
might seek the judgment of a State body over a program located in a different State, if the second State had no such approving
body. One commenter suggested that the Secretary require the views of boards and evaluating bodies only in those States
where such bodies exist. 



Discussion:

 One purpose of these regulations is to make certain that facilities, curriculum, equipment, and faculty are comparable
in quality to those of medical schools in the United States. The Secretary requires the assurance of that comparability
through appropriate impartial and qualified third parties. The Secretary does not consider it unreasonable for
an educational program or portion of a program located in a State to obtain the approval of an appropriate medical licensing
board or other evaluating body. Which licensing boards and evaluating bodies the Secretary considers relevant will
depend on the State in which the program is located, and the time that the application is filed among other relevant
factors. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 Most commenters opposed the requirement for an institution, rather than the Educational Commission for Foreign
Medical Graduates (ECFMG), to provide pass rate data on its students and graduates to the Secretary. One commenter
believed that the ECFMG would refuse to release data to institutions, thus effectively denying their eligibility.



Discussion:

 It is the responsibility of an institution seeking to participate in the FFEL programs to establish that it complies
with the requirements for eligibility for that participation. Accordingly, the institution must furnish the Secretary
with the necessary information for the Secretary to make a determination on the institution's compliance. Institutions
are urged to work with the ECFMG and their graduates to obtain the relevant data. 


Changes:

 None.

Comment:

 A few commenters opposed the requirement that a school's clinical training program be approved by a State as of January
1, 1992, and remain currently approved by that State. 
One commenter claimed that because few States approve clinical training programs for foreign medical schools, Congress
would not have intended to require that approval. 



Discussion:

 States can and do approve clinical training programs for foreign medical schools; thus, Congress specifically referred
to that approval in section 481(a)(2) of the HEA for programs approved as of January 1, 1992. The Congress made clear
throughout the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 the need for strict accountability of educational institutions
to States, accrediting agencies, and the Federal government. The Secretary would be remiss in his duty to exercise
responsible oversight of the administration of the FFEL programs if participating institutions were to be permitted
to obtain or maintain eligibility for clinical training programs that, although once approved by a State, lost such
approval. Further, approval of the clinical training program is among the criteria in the HEA used to demonstrate
comparability to institutions in the United States. A school that lost its State approval after January 1, 1992 fails
this criterion. 



Changes:

 None. 



Assessment of Educational Impact 



In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Secretary requested comments on whether the proposed regulations would
require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of
the United States. 

Based on the response to the proposed rules and its own review, the Department has determined that the regulations
in this document do not require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other
agency or authority of the United States.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1082, 1088) 


 600.55

Additional criteria for determining whether a foreign graduate medical school is eligible to apply to participate
in the FFEL programs. 


(a) The Secretary considers a foreign graduate medical school to be eligible to apply to participate in the FFEL programs
if, in addition to satisfying the criteria in  600.54, the school satisfies all of the following criteria: 
(1) The school provides, and in the normal course requires its students to complete, a program of clinical and classroom
medical instruction of not less that 32 months in length, that is supervised closely by members of the school's faculty
and that is provided either_ 
(i) Outside the United States, in facilities adequately equipped and staffed to afford students comprehensive clinical
and classroom medical instruction; or 
(ii) In the United States, through a training program for foreign medical students that has been approved by all medical
licensing boards and evaluating bodies whose views are considered relevant by the Secretary. 
(2) The school has graduated classes during each of the two twelve-month periods immediately preceding the date the
Secretary receives the school's request for an eligibility determination. 
(3) The school employs for the program described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section only those faculty members whose
academic credentials are the equivalent of credentials required of faculty members teaching the same or similar
courses at medical schools in the United States. 
(4)(i) The school has been approved by an accrediting 
body_ 
(A) That is legally authorized to evaluate the quality of graduate medical school educational programs and facilities
in the country where the school is located; and 
(B) Whose standards of accreditation of graduate medical schools_ 
(

1

) Have been evaluated by the advisory panel of medical experts established by the Secretary; and 
(

2

) Have been determined to be comparable to standards of accreditation applied to medical schools in the United States;
or 
(ii) The school is a public or private nonprofit educational institution that satisfies the requirements in  600.4(a)(5)(i).

(5)(i)(A) During the academic year preceding the year for which any of the school's students seeks an FFEL program
loan, at least 60 percent of those enrolled as full-time regular students in the school and at least 60 percent of the
school's most recent graduating class were persons who did not meet the citizenship and residency criteria contained
in 34 CFR 668.7(a)(4)(i) through (iii); and 
(B) At least 60 percent of the school's students and graduates who took any step of the examinations administered by

preceding the year for which any of the school's students seeks an FFEL program loan received passing scores on the
exams; or 
(ii) The school's clinical training program was approved by a State as of January 1, 1992, and is currently approved
by that State. 
(b) In performing the calculation required in paragraph (a)(5)(i)(B) of this section, a foreign graduate medical
school shall count as a graduate each person who graduated from the school during the three years preceding the year
for which the calculation is performed. 




(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1082, 1088) 


 600.56

Duration of eligibility determination. 


(a) The eligibility of a foreign institution under this subpart expires four years after the date of the Secretary's
determination that the institution is eligible to apply for participation, except that the Secretary may specify
a shorter period of eligibility. In the case of a foreign graduate medical school, continued eligibility is dependent
upon annual submission of the data and information required under  600.55(a)(5)(i), subject to the terms described
in  600.53(b). 
(b) A foreign institution that has been determined eligible loses its eligibility on the date that the institution
no longer meets any of the criteria in this subpart E. 
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of 34 CFR 668.25(c)(2), if a foreign institution loses its eligibility under
this subpart E, an otherwise eligible student, continuously enrolled at the institution before the loss of eligibility,
may receive an FFEL program loan for attendance at that institution for the academic year succeeding the academic
year in which that institution lost its eligibility, if the student actually received an FFEL program loan for attendance
at the institution for a period during which the institution was eligible under this subpart E.

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</USDEPT>


<USDEPT>34 CFR Part 668</USDEPT>






Student Assistance General Provisions


Agency: 

Department of Education.

 

Action: 

Final regulations.





Summary: 

The Secretary amends subpart E of the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations, 34 CFR part 668, Verification
of Student Aid Application Information, to implement technical revisions resulting from the Higher Education Amendments
of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-325) and the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-208) and to
reduce the administrative burden associated with verification requirements on applicants and institutions. These
regulations require institutions to have a system for verifying student aid application information reported by
applicants for use in calculating expected family contributions (EFCs) for the Federal Pell Grant, campus-based
(Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Work-Study (FWS), and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG)),
Federal Stafford Loan, Federal Direct Student Loan (FDSL), and Presidential Access Scholarship (PAS) programs.




Effective Date: 

These regulations take effect on July 1, 1994. When these regulations become effective, they will govern verification
of student aid application information for any Title IV, Higher Education Amendments (HEA) program assistance that
may be awarded to any student for award years beginning with 1994-95.



<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Subpart E of the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations (34 CFR part 668) governs the verification of
the information that is used to calculate an applicant's expected family contribution (EFC) as part of the determination
of an applicant's need for student financial assistance. Based on the need analysis formula established in statute,
the EFC is the amount that an applicant and the applicant's family can reasonably be expected to contribute towards
the applicant's cost of attendance at an institution of higher education.


The changes in these regulations result from a review of current policies and procedures and from recently enacted
legislation that renders certain provisions in the current regulations obsolete.


Summary of Changes


Sections 668.51 through 668.61 are amended to delete all references to the Income Contingent Loan (ICL) Program and
Quality Control Pilot Project. Program references throughout Subpart E have been changed to reflect the new names
of the Title IV, HEA programs.
Sections 668.52(b) and 668.54(a) are amended to delete the definition of Need Analysis Servicer, to delete references
to the certification of need analysis servicers, and to delete references to the 30 percent verification limitation.
Sections 668.54 through 668.56 are amended to include the use of an output document and institutional student information
reports (ISIRs) in conjunction with the reference to the Student Aid Report (SAR). Output documents and ISIRs will
also be used in conjunction with the reference to an SAR for applicants selected for verification under  668.54(a)(2).
Sections 668.56(a)(5)(i) (A) and (B) and 668.57(d)(2)(i) are deleted since the Department no longer participates
in a match with the Social Security Administration for these benefits.
The Secretary also amends  668.57(a) (2) and (3) to remove the quotation marks before and after ``IRS Listing
of Tax Account Information'' and to make the phrase lower case. This clarifies that the reference is to information
that is being requested from IRS that would be used to verify specific data elements, not a specific IRS form. Also,
this would accommodate new IRS forms that are continuously being developed through electronic technology to assist
tax filers.
Section 668.59 is amended to remove all references to the Pell Grant Index (PGI) and replace the reference with EFC,
and to add the new terms output document or ISIRs as they apply. This section is also being amended to delete the Zero
PGI Charts.
The regulations also delete the use of the Zero PGI Charts as a tolerance option for applicants who have undergone verification.
In the past, the charts have not been widely used and institutions can easily use another tolerance option such as the
recalculation of an applicant's EFC. The Department of Education provides the Electronic Needs Analysis System
(ENAS) to institutions at no cost. ENAS may be used for recalculating an applicant's EFC.



Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking 



In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the 
General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)) and 
the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is the 
practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the 
opportunity to comment on proposed regulations. However, the 
technical changes in these final regulations are a direct result 
of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, are purely technical, 
and do not establish substantive policy. Therefore, the 
Secretary has determined under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) that proposed 
rulemaking is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. 



Assessment of Educational Impact 



The Department has determined that the regulations in this 
document do not require transmission of information that is being 
gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of 
the United States.

Design Standards for Airplane Jacking and Tie-Down Provisions



<AGENCY>

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment to the airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes adds a new design standard for airplane
jacking and tie-down provisions. This amendment is needed to provide manufacturers with design standards for jacking
conditions and is intended to protect primary airplane structure during jacking operations and from gusty wind conditions
while tied down.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background



This amendment is based on Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) 90-3, which was published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 9, 1990 (55 FR 4790). The notice was predicated on a need to protect primary airplane structure from damage
during jacking operations and during gusty wind conditions.

Airplane jacking is achieved by either lifting on the airframe or on the landing gear. In some instances, the airplane
has either slipped off the jacks or been blown off during gusty wind conditions. Also, some transport category airplanes
have tie-down provisions to restrain the airplane during high wind conditions. Damage to primary structure could
result if the tie-down provisions were not designed to withstand likely wind gusts.

Most manufacturers of transport category airplanes provide information and instructions concerning jacking operations
in addition to providing appropriate jacking points on the airplane. However, currently there is no requirement
in the airworthiness standards for transport category airplane designs to account for jacking or tie-down loads.
In the absence of specific standards, some manufacturers have used jacking and tie-down criteria contained in military
specifications to design the airframe and landing gear of commercial transport category airplanes. Others, primarily
the manufacturers of smaller transport category airplanes, have requested design criteria for jacking and tie-down
loads.

While the FAA is not aware of any existing airplanes that are inadequately designed with respect to jacking and tie-down
provisions, it is conceivable that an airplane with inadequately designed jacking and tie-down provisions may be
certificated in the absence of specific regulatory requirements. Structural damage at the jacking or tie-down points
could pose an immediate hazard while the airplane is on the ground. Even if an airplane does not fall off the jacks, there
is the possibility that damage to primary structure could occur from the static loads applied at inadequately designed
jacking points. In addition, there is a danger that the damage could remain undetected and lead to a catastrophic structural
failure during a subsequent flight. Undetected damage from inadequately designed tie-down provisions poses a similar
hazard.

These concerns resulted in Notice 90-3 in which the FAA proposed to require transport category airplanes to
have suitable provisions for jacking. In essence, standards consistent with current industry practice were proposed
to provide protection of primary airplane structure from loads imposed during probable jacking conditions. As there
is no requirement for tie-down provisions, the FAA also proposed to adopt standards to provide protection of primary
airplane structure in the event such provisions are provided. This standard is also consistent with current industry
practice.

Interested persons have been given an opportunity to participate in this rulemaking and due consideration has been
given to all matters presented. Comments received in response to Notice 90-3 are discussed below.



Discussion of Comments



The proposed standards are based on established military and commercial airplane standards and on current industry
practice and therefore received general support from all commenters.

The European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) suggest the requirements of JAR 25.519 (Joint Airworthiness Requirements)
be adopted as  25.519 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), offering as justification the favorable service
history associated with the JAR.

The JAR standards differ from the proposals in Notice 90-3 in that the load factors used in establishing the vertical
and horizontal jacking forces are slightly less. The wind force used to establish the tie-down loads is also slightly
less. Although the JAR standard is less conservative than the proposed FAR standard, there is sufficient satisfactory
service experience based on the requirements of JAR 25.519 to justify its adoption as the basis for the FAR standard.
Additionally, some clarifying changes from the current JAR standard are made in order to define clearly the structures
to which the jacking load factors apply. The word ``surrounding'' is changed to ``local'' to differentiate between
local structure and the entire airplane structure. Also, since the maximum design weight, in this case, is the maximum
ramp weight, the rule is revised to avoid any confusion over the weight to use in analyzing the support structure. These
minor changes in the final rule will more fully harmonize the FAR and JAR requirements. The JAA also suggests that the
introduction of jacking requirements in  25.513 of the FAR, which corresponds with requirements in JAR 25.519,
could cause confusion. The FAA agrees, and for consistency with the JAR, the jacking requirement has been moved from
proposed  25.513 of the FAR to  25.519.

One commenter recommends that consideration be given to incorporating a design requirement to improve the airplane's
ability to maintain contact with the jack head. The FAA has determined that the high side load requirements for the
jack fittings achieves this objective and should provide ample protection against an airplane slipping off the jacks.

One commenter recommends the development of standards requiring the use of jacks when working on aircraft with known
landing gear problems. The commenter cites an instance in which an airplane that had made a gear up landing was parked
with the gear down in an unrepaired condition. Two pilots, while inspecting the airplane for damage, were crushed
when the gear collapsed. The FAA considers the concern expressed by the commenter to relate to maintenance or salvage
procedures. Since such procedures are not the subject of certification requirements, they are beyond the scope of
the notice.

One operator suggests that the regulation include a requirement for the manufacturer to provide specific jacking
requirements in the Structural Repair Manual and the Maintenance Manual, and that these requirements include specific
loads at each jack pad for various empty weights and center of gravity locations. The manufacturers generally do provide
jacking instructions, including jack pad load limits, in the maintenance and structural repair manuals which are
approved as part of the overall maintenance program. While the FAA does not consider it necessary to mandate where
the manufacturer places this information, the final rule has been revised to require that load limit information
must be provided.

Regulatory Evaluation



This section summarizes the full regulatory evaluation prepared by the FAA that provides more detailed estimates
of the economic consequences of this regulatory action. This summary and the full evaluation quantify, to the extent
practicable, estimated costs to the private sector, consumers, Federal, State and local governments, as well as
anticipated benefits.

Proposed changes to Federal regulations must undergo several economic analyses. First, Executive Order 12866 directs
that each Federal agency shall propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits
of the intended regulation justify its costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to
analyze the economic effect of regulatory changes on small entities. Third, the Office of Management and Budget directs
agencies to assess the effects of regulatory changes on international trade. In conducting these analyses, the FAA
has determined that this rule: (1) Will generate benefits that justify its costs and is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' as defined in the Executive Order, (2) is not significant as defined in Department of Transportation Regulatory
Policies and Procedures; (3) will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (4)
will not constitute a barrier to international trade. These analyses, available in the docket, are summarized below.



Benefits



The FAA is unaware of any existing airplanes that are inadequately designed with respect to jacking or tie-down provisions.
In the absence of specific regulatory standards, it is possible that an airplane with inadequate design standards
for jacking and tie-down could be certificated. Structural damage at the jacking or tie-down points of an inadequately
designed airplane could pose a hazard while the airplane is on the ground. More importantly, structural damage at
jacking or tie-down points could remain undetected and lead to catastrophic structural failure during a subsequent
flight. Transport category airplanes particularly larger airplanes, seldom need to be tied down for protection
from high winds. Nevertheless, reliance on inadequately designed tie-down provisions could also damage primary
structure.

The FAA is unable to document specific instances where the standards of this rule would have prevented damage to the
primary structure of transport category airplanes, primarily because it is assumed that existing airplanes are
properly designed with respect to jacking and tie-down provisions. However, the FAA considers that the potential
risk of jacking and tie-down accidents will be reduced for future airplane designs that might otherwise be built in
the absence of the consistent standards of this amendment. Significant but unquantified benefits could result from
reducing the risk of such incidents.



Costs



Essentially all manufacturers of transport category airplanes currently provide appropriate jacking points and
jacking instructions for their airplanes. In the absence of regulatory standards for jacking and tie-down provisions
on transport category airplanes, some manufacturers have used the jacking and tie-down criteria of military specifications
for designing the airframes and landing gears of commercial transport category airplanes. Others, primarily the
manufacturers of smaller transport category airplanes, have requested design criteria for jacking and tie-down
loads.

The FAA is not aware of any manufacturers who have not used either military specifications or other comparable criteria
for designing the airframe and landing gear. Since all large airplanes must be jacked periodically, reasonable and
prudent manufacturers have had little choice but to follow this course. Because this rule adopts standards that are
consistent with both current and expected industry practice, it is not expected to result in any significant compliance
costs.



Comparison of Costs and Benefits



The FAA is unaware of any existing airplanes that are inadequately designed with respect to jacking or tie-down provisions.
Since this rule adopts the standards that industry has largely followed, and would most likely continue to follow,
in the absence of this rule, no significant costs or benefits are expected.

In the absence of specific regulatory standards, it is possible that an inadequately designed airplane could be certificated.
In such a case, the benefits of reducing the potential risk of jacking and tie-down accidents would significantly
exceed any incremental costs of compliance. As such, the FAA considers this rule to be cost-beneficial.



Regulatory Flexibility Determination



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
and disproportionately burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires government agencies to review rules
which may have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.''

FAA Order 2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, establishes threshold cost values and small
entity size standards for complying with RFA review requirements in FAA rulemaking actions. This rule will directly
affect transport category airplane manufacturers that certify their airplanes under part 25. The size standard
for manufacturers of airplanes is 75 employees of fewer. Since no transport category airplane manufacturer meets
the standard, this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



International Trade Impact Assessment



This rule is not expected to have an adverse impact either on the trade opportunities of U.S. manufacturers of transport
category airplanes doing business abroad or on foreign airplane manufacturers doing business in the United States.
Since the certification rules are applicable to both foreign and domestic manufacturers selling airplanes in the
United States, there will be no competitive trade advantage to either.

Federalism Implications



The regulation adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this regulation will not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Conclusion



Because the regulation adopted herein is not expected to result in significant costs, the FAA has determined that
this final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. For the same reason and
because this is an issue that has not prompted a great deal of public concern, this final rule is not considered to be
significant as defined in Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979). In addition, since there are no small entities affected by this rulemaking, it is certified, under the criteria
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities. A copy of the regulatory evaluation prepared for this final rule may be examined
in the public docket or obtained from the person identified under the caption,

ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) amends the regulations contained in the Code of Federal Regulations to eliminate
premium, bonus, or other like payments from consideration in the calculation of the royalty price for crude oil in
Osage County, Oklahoma.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The purpose of this final rule is to amend 25 CFR 226.11(a)(2) to eliminate premium, bonus, or other like payments from
consideration in the calculation of the royalty price for crude oil in Osage County. 



Prior to amendment the regulations were the subject of administrative appeals by numerous oil producers over the
meaning of: ``and settlement shall be based on the highest of the bona fide selling price, posted or offered price by
a major purchaser (as defined in Sec. 226.1(h) of this Part) in Osage County, who purchases production from Osage oil
leases.'' The Bureau of Indian Affairs has interpreted that language to mean that when a higher price is offered and
paid for crude oil in Osage County, that price shall be used for royalty computation for all oil of the same quality sold
in the county. However, there is reason to believe that this interpretation has discouraged purchasers from offering
bonus prices. 

The Interior Board of Indian Appeals (IBIA) issued its decision in favor of the producers on February 5, 1993, in 

Okie Crude Co., et al. 

v. 

Muskogee Area Director, Bureau of Indian Affairs, 

IBIA 92-18-A, et al. The IBIA concluded that the then existent regulations required a producer to pay royalty
on the highest price available to that producer, whether or not that producer actually received that price. Prices
not available to a producer would not be used to calculate royalties due from that producer. This final rule eliminates
the language that caused the differences in interpretation that led to the appeals to the IBIA. 

This rule was published as a proposed rule on November 5, 1993 (58 FR 59142). The last day for public comment was January
4, 1994. No comments were received.

It is the consensus of the BIA and the Osage Tribal Council that this amendment to 25 CFR 226.11(a)(2) will create a positive
economic benefit in the form of increased royalty income to the Osage headright holders. This rule change removes
the existing disincentive to purchasers to remain in Osage County resulting from bonus payments paid to some producers
but not all. The producers in Osage County will now have incentive to receive bonus payments, which will increase mineral
activity in the Osage mineral estate. 

The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive
Order 12866, and therefore will not be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. In addition, the Department
of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of
small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.). The amendment may cause small producers
to pool their oil production in an effort to secure bonus or premium pay. However, under the amended rule they will not
be penalized for premium pay to other lessee/producers. 

In accordance with the Executive Order 12630, the Department has determined that this rule does not have significant
takings implications. 

In accordance with Executive Order No. 12612, the Department has determined that this rule does not have significant
federalism effects. 

The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these final regulations meet the applicable
standards provided in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. 

The Department of the Interior has determined that this final rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment and that no detailed statement is required pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969. 

The information collections contained in 25 CFR Part 226 are required by the Secretary , Department of the Interior,
and are necessary to comply with the requirements of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-102.
The Standard Form 424 and attachments prescribed by such circular are approved by OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.
(1982) and assigned approval number 0348-0006. These sections describe the types of information that would
satisfy the requirements of Circular A-102. The information will be utilized in leasing of Osage lands for oil
and gas mining. Response is mandatory.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment adds a new standard for electrical and electronic systems installed in transport category airplanes.
It is the result of increasing concern for the vulnerability of these systems to the indirect effects of lightning,
and is intended to enhance safety by providing specific lightning protection requirements for electrical and electronic
systems that perform essential or critical functions.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Background


This amendment is based on Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) No. 89-15, which was published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 30, 1989 (54 FR 23164).
As discussed in the notice, concern for the vulnerability of airplane electronic systems to the effects of lightning
has increased substantially over the past few years. The use of solid-state components in the design of electronic
control systems in airplanes has made such systems potentially susceptible to transient effects of induced electrical
current and voltage caused by a direct lightning strike to the airplane. These induced transient currents and voltages
can degrade electronic system performance by damaging components or upsetting system functions. Component damage
means a permanently altered electrical characteristic that can include dielectric breakdowns and effects from
heat in semiconductor junctions, resistors, and component interconnections. Function upset refers to an impairment
of system operation, either permanent or momentary (e.g., a change of digital or analog state), that includes logic
changes in computer and processing systems, electronic engine and flight controls, and power generating and distribution
systems.
Another factor that has contributed to this increased concern is the reduced electromagnetic shielding afforded
airplane electronic systems by advanced technology airframe materials. Some of these materials have no electrical
conductivity and lightning strikes often puncture them, resulting in extensive damage and allowing lightning to
attach to vulnerable electronic systems or components located within the airframe. Other materials, such as graphite-reinforced
composites, have some electrical conductivity. Voltages induced by lightning current that flows in airframe components
made of these composite materials are much higher than those in aluminum materials because the electrical resistance
of composites is higher; therefore, such composites provide much less protection to the circuits and electronic
systems in the airplane.
There are two sections in 14 CFR part 25 that specifically pertain to lightning protection: one for the airframe in
general ( 25.581), and the other for the fuel system ( 25.954). There are no regulations dealing specifically
with lightning protection of electrical and electronic systems. The advent of advanced electronic systems in airplane
designs submitted for FAA approval requires that additional consideration be given to protecting these systems
from the effects of lighting strikes. Although  25.581(a) (structures subpart) requires that an airplane
be protected against catastrophic effects of lighting, and  25.1309(a) states that required systems must
operate properly in all environmental conditions, it has been determined that the existing lightning protection
requirements are not adequate for advanced electronic systems.
In recent type certification programs involving advanced electronic systems, such as those used in the Airbus A320,
Boeing 747-400, and Douglas MD-11 airplanes, the FAA has adopted special conditions to provide an adequate
level of safety.
Since trends indicate that future airplane designs will incorporate similar systems, the FAA has determined that
a change in the design standards of part 25 is necessary.


Discussion of Comments


The following discussion summarizes the comments received from the public, industry, foreign authorities, and
manufacturers in response to Notice 89-15.
Several commenters request clarification as to what constitutes critical and essential functions.
The terms ``critical'' and ``essential'' originated when attempts were made to classify failure conditions in accordance
with  25.1309. This regulation requires that systems be designed so that the occurrence of any failure condition
that would prevent the continued safe flight and landing of the airplane is extremely improbable. The function affected
by such a failure condition is deemed ``critical.'' Additionally,  25.1309 requires that systems be designed
so that the occurrence of any other failure condition that would reduce the capability of the airplane or the ability
of the crew to cope with adverse operating conditions is improbable. The function affected by such a failure condition
is deemed ``essential.'' The combination of systems or system redundancy required to meet these reliability requirements
is determined by conducting a preliminary hazard analysis or criticality assessment. Examples of systems that perform
critical functions are full authority electronic engine controls, electronic primary flight controls, primary
flight displays, and electronic stability augmentation. Examples of systems that perform essential functions
are communications systems, navigation systems, and flight management systems.

One commenter considers the lightning protection requirements to be unclear when applied to individual subsystems
prior to installation in the airplane, and recommends that the relationship between the airframe manufacturer and
the subsystem supplier to clarified. The commenter contends that the proposed rule appears to suggest that all systems
that perform critical functions would be required to withstand the full direct strike currents, without taking into
account any reduction in these currents due to the shielding provided by the airframe.

As discussed in the NPRM, the purpose of the proposed regulation is to require lightning protection for electrical
and electronic systems that perform critical and essential functions when installed in an airplane. Protection
may be provided by the airplane structure, shielding of the wiring, and enclosures of the individual subsystems.
The level of protection needed for subsystems is generally specified by the airframe manufacturer. In the past, when
the airframe manufacturer did not specify the level of protection needed, Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics
(RTCA) Document DO-160, Section 22, ``Lightning Induced Transient Susceptibility,'' was used to provide
guidance. While Section 22 of DO-160 is incomplete, it is currently being revised to include the effects of multiple
burst and multiple stroke test waveforms so as to be in agreement with FAA Advisory Circular 20-136, ``Protection
of Aircraft Electrical/Electronic Systems Against the Indirect Effects of Lightning,'' dated March 5, 1990, and
Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE Committee Report AE4L-87-3, Revision B, dated January 1989. Until
the DO-160 revision has been completed, the test and analyses described in the advisory circular should be used
to qualify subsystems. The test waveforms presented in Appendix III of the advisory circular represent a severe natural
lightning environment, including the multiple stroke and multiple burst criteria, that is external to the airplane
and that may be used by certification purposes in accessing the induced effects of lightning. The equipment should
be protected to the appropriate test level, as specified in Appendix IV of the advisory circular, for the proposed
airplane installations so that the subsystems are able to continue to perform their intended functions after the
tests are conducted.

Two commenters suggest that the definitions of the terms ``critical'' and ``essential'' functions be removed from
the proposed rule and placed in 14 CFR part 1 of the FAR, Definitions and abbreviations.

The FAA does not concur with this suggestion. The terms ``critical'' and ``essential,'' as used in the proposed rule,
have a unique definition based on   25.1309 (b)(1) and (b)(2) that may be inappropriate when used in other
rules. Commenters have expressed confusion over the use of these terms; therefore, the definitions of ``critical''
and ``essential'' functions have been integrated into the wording of the rule so as not to require separate definitions.

One commenter suggests that the words ``contribute to or'' be removed from the definitions for critical and essential
functions given in proposed   25.1315 (c)(1) and (c)(2) because this terminology is undefined and can
be subject to broad interpretation.

The FAA does not concur. This terminology is consistent with that used in existing regulations and is generally understood
by the aviation industry. It is used in this rule to convey that although a failure by itself may not be catastrophic
or major, it may be a contributing factor when combinations of failures are considered. For example, a latent or undetected
failure could contribute to a hazardous failure condition when combined with one or more specific failures or events.
Also, systems that perform only non-essential functions could contribute to a failure condition involving an non-essential
or critical function.

The same commenter also suggests that the words ``significantly impact the safety,'' in proposed  25.1315(c)(2),
be changed to ``reduce the capability'' for consistency with  25.1309(b)(2).
The FAA concurs with this recommendation, and  25.1315(c)(2), now designated as  25.1315(b), has been
revised accordingly.
Several commenters request clarification as to exactly what is meant by the statement that critical functions are
``not affected'' by the lightning encounter.
The FAA concurs that clarification of ``not affected'' is needed; therefore, the final rule has been revised to read,
``not adversely affected'' in an attempt to convey this intent. Although the words ``not affected'' were used in the
proposed rule, the FAA did not intend that the requirement be rigidly applied. The intent of the regulation is to require
lightning protection for systems that perform critical functions to the extent that the critical functions are not


adversely

 affected by the lightning event. Determination of when functions are adversely affected would be made by the cognizant
FAA Aircraft Certification Office based on rational engineering judgment on a case-by-case evaluation of the specified
function and the ``effect'' presented. Literally applying a standard of ``no effect'' would not be reasonable. In
determining compliance with special conditions in past certification programs, the FAA has accepted upsets of a
minor nature that do not result in significant fluctuations of control surface position or engine thrust. Any effect
perceived by the flightcrew would need to be evaluated to ensure that it would not lead to a hazardous condition. For
example, some full authority digital engine control (FADEC) systems are designed with two fully redundant channels,
either of which can control the engine independently. In addition, the logic within the FADEC will monitor each channel
and, by design, switch channels if an anomaly appears on the selected channel. This does not necessarily mean that
the channel is no longer functional or has degraded, because if the backup channel were not functional, the selected
channel would continue in control. Therefore, it would not be considered an adverse effect if a channel transfer in
such a system occurred in accordance with its accepted design when the airplane is exposed to the lightning test waveforms.
However, additional tests may be required to demonstrate that neither channel would be adversely affected when tested
individually. For example, a mode change within a given channel that could result in the loss of a primary thrust setting
parameter, resulting in the possibility of a change in thrust level, would not be acceptable. Internal monitors that
indicate normal operation of critical systems must not be damaged by the effects of lightning.
Other examples of adversely affected critical functions are hazardously misleading primary flight information,
uncommanded flap motion and, of course, loss of primary flight controls in a fly-by-wire airplane.
Determination of adverse effects will be handled on a case-by-case basis subject to the explanation given above.
Perturbations or deviations that exceed tolerances agreed upon in the test plan must be reported to the FAA for evaluation.
The same commenters also suggest that adequate lightning protection is provided if the airplane is still capable
of continued safe flight and landing after the lightning encounter.
The FAA does not agree that the concept of continued safe flight and landing is sufficient. The FAA has concluded that
a higher level of safety is required for systems that perform critical functions when exposed to adverse environmental
conditions. This concept would be violated, for example, if engine failure from an expected environmental condition,
such as a lightning strike, were allowed because any environmental condition that may adversely affect an engine
design must be assumed to affect all the engines on the airplane. For this reason, engines, as installed, must be able
to tolerate these conditions without damage or serious loss of thrust. This same line of reasoning applies to other
systems that perform critical functions. Lightning strikes to airplanes are unpredictable as to their strength,
duration, and number. Therefore, continued safe flight and landing of the airplane after multiple lightning strikes
could not be assured unless systems that perform critical functions have a high degree of tolerance to the expected
lightning strike environment. This basic environmental requirement also applies to other environmental conditions,
such as icing, hail, heavy rain, bird flocks, etc.
One commenter proposes new wording for  25.1315(a) that would allow crew action to restore critical systems
that have been disrupted by lightning induced transients.
The FAA does not concur. Critical function disruption must be automatically restored after the lightning encounter.
Under certain flight conditions, such as during takeoff or landing in instrument meteorological conditions when
the crew workload is high, the crew may not be able to restore the critical function in time to prevent a catastrophic
even from occurring. The FAA allows crew action to restore systems that perform essential functions; however, systems
that perform critical functions must recover automatically.
The majority of commenters do not agree that the test waveforms should be contained in an appendix to part 25, as proposed
in the notice. They contend that this information should be presented in an advisory circular. Several commenters
believe that there will be additional adjustments to the description of the lightning environment as knowledge of
the phenomena increases, and that an advisory circular would be easier to revise than an appendix to the FAR. In addition,
they argue that the FAA should not be legally bound by the criteria in an appendix if a change to the description of the
environment is appropriate.
The FAA concurs that the proposed appendix should not be adopted. As noted by several commenters, the information
contained in the proposed appendix was taken from SAE Report AE4L-87-3, Revision A, entitled ``Protection
of Aircraft Electrical/Electronic Systems Against the Indirect Effects of Lightning,'' dated October 1988. After
the notice was published, the AE4L Committee added clarifications of the environment definition, including some
boundaries on pulse spacing in the multiple burst and multiple stroke environments. These have been incorporated
in Revision B of the SAE document issued in January 1989. Because of the potential for further adjustments in the environment
definition, and because use of the description of the environment set forth in the proposed Appendix J is only one means
of showing compliance with this rule, the FAA concurs that it would be more appropriate to present this information
in an advisory circular. This is also consistent with the FAA's practice of publishing technical guidance/procedures
for implementing a particular regulation in an advisory circular. As noted earlier, the idealized waveforms are
currently covered in AC 20-136. Accordingly, proposed Appendix J to part 25 has been removed from the final rule.
However, to provide guidelines as to what is involved in showing compliance with the rule, general criteria are added
to  25.1315 as paragraph (c). A detailed discussion of these criteria is provided in AC 20-136.
Two commenters consider the definition of the environment given in the proposed Appendix to be unrealistic and propose
several changes to the idealized test waveforms. 
The FAA does not concur that this definition is unrealistic. The FAA has worked closely with SAE Committee AE4L in developing
the idealized test waveforms that are presented in Revision B of Report AE4L-87-3. The FAA has adopted
these waveforms as acceptable representations of a severe natural lightning environment for certification purposes
and has included them in AC 20-136. The proposed changes submitted by the commenters have been forwarded to the
AE4L Committee for consideration. The FAA will consider appropriate changes to the definition of the waveforms in
the AC if the Committee recommends them.

Two commenters object to statements in the background and discussion of the NPRM that new generation systems and airframes
are more vulnerable to the indirect effects of lightning than previous designs.

The FAA agrees that new generation systems are not necessarily more vulnerable to the indirect effects of lightning
if proper design, shielding, and grounding techniques are used. However, the use of sensitive electronics that respond
to low level voltage commands makes these systems potentially more vulnerable if they are not properly designed and
shielded. Reduced electromagnetic shielding provided by nonmetallic airframe materials also raises the potential
for system interference from lightning. The intent of these new lightning protection requirements is to maintain
the level of safety that is inherent in the older airplane designs.

Two commenters point out that preamble statements are vital to defining logical, usable, and economically feasible
rules, and suggest that specific technologies, system architectures, and function susceptibility criteria must
be provided instead of generalities if the FAA desires to justify the rule on a sound technical basis.

The FAA does not concur. In order to avoid stifling innovation, the FAA specifies the required safety objective in
a regulation rather than dictating specific design details, whenever possible. In accordance with long-standing
certification practice, system technologies and architectures are proposed by the applicant, allowable function
susceptibility is determined on a case-by-case basis by the local cognizant FAA certification office using published
FAA policy and engineering judgment.

One commenter expresses concern that application of the proposed rule to existing airplanes could present problems
for supplemental type certification (STC) applicants when new systems are installed. Many airlines, for example,
do not have the capability to demonstrate compliance.

The FAA considers lightning to be an environmental condition that must be taken into consideration to assure confidence
of safe operation when a new system is installed in an airplane. Equipment manufacturers have historically used the
test procedures in RTCA Document DO-160 to qualify their equipment to environmental conditions. The capability
of the equipment to meet the tests described in this document establishes a minimum level of protection for system
components. Additional protection may be provided by the airframe materials, shielding of wire bundles, proper
equipment grounding, etc. In addition to bench tests, a determination should be made that systems that perform critical
and essential functions, as installed in a given airplane, are provided with adequate protection, including margins,
and that installation level testing and/or verified analysis is adequate. This determination is made by the cognizant
FAA Aircraft Certification Office, based on guidance contained in AC 20-136, and sound engineering judgment.
In addition, the FAA has issued special conditions for new systems in existing airplanes under the provisions of  21.101(b)(2).
The extent of review required for a system installed in existing airplanes will depend on the type of system, installation
considerations such as type of airplane, airframe materials (metallic or composite), service experience in ``similar''
airplanes, and other factors. These evaluations should be reviewed with the cognizant FAA Aircraft Certification
Office so that the FAA and the applicant can agree on a certification plan.

One commenter states that the proposed requirement for lightning protection of essential systems is not justified
and should not be adopted.

The FAA disagrees with this comment. Lightning encounters, even though infrequent , do occur. Therefore, a degree
of protection is required commensurate with the criticalness of the function that the system performs. Protection
requirements are much less stringent for systems that perform essential functions than for those that perform critical
functions. System components may be damaged as long as the function can be recovered after the lightning encounter.
The justification for imposing requirements for systems that perform essential functions is that loss of function
would unacceptably decrease the inherent level of safety of the airplane.

One commenter questions whether manufacturers would be responsible for testing and recertifying critical electronic
control systems now in service.

The new lightning protection requirements apply to systems that perform critical and essential functions of which
design approval is sought after the effective date of the rule. Recertificating in-service units is not required.
If an in-service problem that affects the safety of the airplane were discovered, an airworthiness directive would
be issued requiring corrective action.

One commenter does not consider that the imposition of additional lightning protection requirements on systems
of conventional design is justified if service history has shown that they are insensitive to lightning transients.

The FAA does not intend to impose additional lightning protections requirements on systems using standard designs
and installation that can be shown to have an inherent history of acceptability. It is FAA policy to accept similarity
with previously proven installation designs, simulated lightning tests, or acceptable analysis. Individual designs
should be reviewed by the cognizant FAA Aircraft Certification Office.

Several commenters disagree that the incremental cost of implementing the new rule will be zero. These comments and
the FAA's response are addressed in the Regulatory Evaluation discussion that follows.

Notice 89-15 proposed that the lightning protection standard be adopted as  25.1315 of the FAR. The paragraph
used for the final rule was changed to  25.1316 so that a future conflict could be avoided in the event the FAA determines
that JAR 25.1315, ``Negative Acceleration,'' should be adopted.

Regulatory Evaluation


This section summarizes the full regulatory evaluation prepared by the FAA that provides detailed estimates of the
economic consequences of this regulatory action. This summary and the full evaluation quantify, to the extent practicable,
estimated costs and anticipated benefits to the private sector, consumers, and Federal, state, and local governments.
Proposed changes to Federal regulations must undergo several economic analyses. First, Executive Order 12866 directs
that each Federal agency shall propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits
of the intended regulation justify its costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to
analyze the economic impact of regulatory changes on small entities. Finally, the Office of Management and Budget
directs agencies to assess the effects of regulatory changes on international trade. In conducting these analyses,
the FAA has determined that this rule: (1) will generate benefits that justify its costs and is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' as defined in the Executive Order; (2) is not significant as defined in Department of Transportation
Regulatory Policies and Procedures; (3) will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities; and (4) will not have a negative impact on international trade. These analyses, available in the docket,
are summarized below.


Costs


The costs of the rule will essentially equal the costs that would have been incurred by manufacturers in complying
with requirements imposed as special conditions in the absence of this rule. The new standards will be no more stringent
than those imposed through recent special conditions, which are consistent with FAA Advisory Circular 20-136,
``Protection of Aircraft Electrical/Electronic Systems Against the Indirect Effects of Lightning,'' dated March
1990, and SAE Committee Report AE4L-87-3, Revision B, dated January 1989. Given the novel design features
of advanced electronic systems and their susceptibility to lightning strikes, the FAA would have continued to require
adequate lightning protection for all new certifications through imposition of special conditions; consequently,
this rule imposes no new incremental costs.
Notwithstanding this cost perspective, the FAA has evaluated the costs of the rule apart from the existence of special
conditions, i.e., under the assumption that the reference level of costs prior to this rule is zero.
The relative costs of the final rule are summarized below for two type-certifications_a representative part 25 large
transport category airplane (i.e., air carrier), and a representative part 25 small transport category airplane
(i.e., a business or commuter jet).
Based on manufacturers' experiences with special condition requirement
