Brass Sheet and Strip From Sweden Affirmation of the Results of Redetermination Pursuant to Court Remand



<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On March 16, 1994, the United States Court of International Trade (CIT) affirmed the Department of Commerce's redetermination
on remand of the final results of the 1988-89 and the 1989-90 administrative reviews of the antidumping
duty order on brass sheet and strip from Sweden (57 FR 2706, January 23, 1992). 

Outokumpu Cooper Rolled Products AB and Outokumpu Copper (USA), Inc.

 v. 

United States

 (Slip Op. 94-45, March 16, 1994) (

Outokumpu

). The results covered the periods March 1, 1988 through February 28, 1989, and March 1, 1989 through February 28, 1990.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background



On August 12, 1993, the CIT in 

Outokumpu Copper Rolled Products AB and Outokumpu Copper (USA) Inc.

 v. 

United States,

 Slip Op. 93-155 (August 12, 1993), issued an order remanding to the Department the final results of the 1988-89
and 1989-90 administrative reviews of the antidumping duty order on brass sheet and strip from Sweden (57 FR
2706, January 23, 1992). On September 27, 1993, the Department submitted its redetermination on remand to the CIT.
On March 16, 1994, the CIT affirmed the Department's redetermination on remand (

Outokumpu

).

In its decision in 

Timken Co.

 v. 

United States,

 893 F. 2d 337 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (

Timken

), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1516a(e), the Department
must publish a notice of a court decision which is not ``in harmony'' with a Department determination, and must suspend
liquidation of entries pending a ``conclusive'' court decision. The CIT's decision in 

Outokumpu

 on March 16, 1994, which affirmed the Department's redetermination, constitutes a decision not in harmony with the
Department's affirmative final results. Publication of this notice fulfills the 

Timken

 requirement.

Accordingly, the Department will continue the suspension of liquidation of the subject merchandise. Further, absent
appeal, or, if appealed, upon a ``conclusive'' court decision affirming the CIT's opinion, the Department will amend
the final affirmative results of review of the antidumping duty order on brass sheet and strip from Sweden to reflect
the amended margins of the Department's redetermination on remand, which was affirmed by the CIT.

<DOCTITLE>Color Television Receivers From the Republic of Korea Amendment to Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative
Review</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Amendment to final results of antidumping duty administrative review.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On March 23, 1994, the Department of Commerce published in the 

Federal Register

 the final results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on color television receivers from the
Republic of Korea (59 FR 13700) covering seven manufacturers/exporters and the period April 1, 1991, through March
31, 1992.



Based on the correction of ministerial errors, we are amending the final results with respect to color television
receivers sold by one company, Daewoo Electronics Co., Ltd.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



On March 23, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 13700) the final results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on color television receivers
(CTVs) from the Republic of Korea (ROK) (49 FR 18336, April 30, 1984). The review covers seven manufacturers/exporters
and the period April 1, 1991, through March 31, 1992.

After publication of our final results, we received timely allegations of ministerial errors, pursuant to  353.28
of the Department's regulations, from the petitioners (the Independent Radionic Workers of America, the United
Electrical Workers of America, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the International Union of
Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers, AFL-CIO, and Industrial Union Department,
AFL-CIO), and one respondent, Daewoo Electronics Co., Ltd. (Daewoo). We have corrected the ministerial errors,
as discussed below, and we have amended the final results of review for Daewoo to reflect those corrections pursuant
to  353.28(c) of the Department's regulations.



Ministerial Errors



We have corrected the following ministerial errors:

1. In the computer program instructions for Daewoo's purchase price (PP) calculations, we had used an incorrect model
designation (``DTV-9234N''). We have changed this to the correct designation (``DTV9234N'').

2. In the exporter's sales price (ESP) final results computer program, we included the commission offset in the home
market tax adjustment calculation. However, in the PP final results computer program, we inadvertently failed to
include the commission offset in the home market tax adjustment calculation. We have corrected the equation by including
that offset in the PP final results computer program.

3. When comparing home market price, based on constructed value (CV), to United States Price (USP), we removed the
tax adjustment on the home market side. However, in both the PP and ESP computer programs, we inadvertently retained
the tax adjustment component in USP. We have corrected the calculated by removing the tax adjustment component from
USP.

<DOCNO> FR940428-2-00005 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940428-2-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

4. The Department intended to treat all pre-sale freight expenses as indirect selling expenses and did so in the PP
and ESP computer programs. However, in the CV calculation, we inadvertently omitted those pre-sale freight expenses.
We have corrected the computer instructions to reflect that change.

We do not agree with Daewoo's claim that the Department's treatment of all of its pre-sale movement expenses as indirect
expenses constitutes a clerical error as described in section 353.28(d). We believe this to be a methodological issue
and refer Daewoo to 

Ad Hoc Committee of AZ-NM-TX-FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement 

v. 

United States

, Slip Op. 93-1239 (Fed. Cir., January 5, 1994), which discusses the methodological treatment of these pre-sale
expenses.



Amended Final Results of Review



As a result of our corrections of ministerial errors, we have determined that a weighted-average margin of 0.90 percent
exists for Daewoo for the period April 1, 1991, through March 31, 1992.

The Department will issue appraisement and revised cash deposit instructions with regard to Daewoo directly to the
U.S. Customs Service. All other results of this administrative review remain the same as published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 23, 1994 (59 FR 13700).

These amended final results of administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(f) of the Tariff
Act and 19 CFR 353.28(c).

Guidelines for Nondiscretionary Financial Assistance 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is issuing guidelines to ensure that applications for
financial assistance under nondiscretionary assistance programs will be processed and approved or disapproved
within 75 days after submission of the application; and that applicants will be notified within 14 days after receipt
of an application whether or not the application is complete.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The authority for these guidelines is the NOAA Authorization Act of 1992, Public Law No. 102-567,  404,
15 U.S.C. 1539 (Supp. IV 1992), which directed that the Secretary develop, and after notice and after notice and opportunity
for comment, promulgate guidelines for processing nondiscretionary assistance awards within 75 days after submission
of the application to the responsible program office of NOAA. In the case of a program for which the recipient of a grant,
contract, or other financial assistance is specified by statute to be, or has customarily been, a State or an interstate
fishery commission, such financial assistance may be provided by the Secretary to that recipient on a sole-source
basis, notwithstanding any other provision of law. These final guidelines include revisions based on comments received
on draft guidelines published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 30, 1993 (58 FR 45487).




Comments and Changes to the Proposed Guidelines 


Following is a summary of the major comments, and a response to each comment. 


Concurrent Review





Comment: 

Concurrent review of applications to the National Marine Fisheries Service, as proposed in the draft guidelines,
would not be practical, because proposals are frequently modified by the program office prior to approval for funding.




Response: 

Since the program office frequently modifies proposals, concurrent review by the program office and the Grants Management
Divisions will not be provided. Instead, when a application is determined by the program office to be complete and
acceptable, the original application will be forwarded to the Grants Management Division as soon as the applicant
is notified (within 14 days after receipt), to permit prompt administrative review and issuance of an award within
75 days after submission. Since applications will not receive concurrent review, applications should be submitted
only to the appropriate program office. 



Clarifications 





Comment: 

The guidelines should define ``Complete application''. 



Response: 

``Complete application'' has been defined in the guidelines. 



Comment: 

Will applications be processed in 75 calendar days or work days? 



Response: 

The intent is to process award within 75 calendar days.



Applicability





Comment: 

The guidelines should apply to Fishery Management Councils and other applicants.



Response: 

The guidelines implement a law which defined the categories of applications to which it applies. This would not include
Fishery Management Councils or other applicants unless they fall within the definition established by section 404.



Budget Detail 





Comment: 

Less budget detail should be required for applications from States, Commissions, and Councils because they must
comply with Federally mandated accounting and fiscal procedures. 



Response: 

Our position is that we require only sufficient detail to carry out our responsibility to determine the adequacy and
reasonableness of proposed costs. 



Role of Grants Office





Comment: 

Is there duplication of functions between the program office and the grants office in reviewing grant applications?




Response: 

We do not believe there is duplication between program and grants office functions. The program office assures that
proposed project activities are technically sound and allowable under program regulations and that proposed costs
are adequate. The Grants Management Division assures that financial and administrative requirements are met, and
that costs are reasonable, allocable, and necessary.



Avilability of Funds





Comment: 

The National Marine Fisheries Service should notify applicants of the amount of funding available prior to submission
of applications. Another comment requested a specific time frame after funding authorizations become available,
within which applicants would be notified of the amount of funding available. 



Response: 

The National Marine Fisheries Service notifies applications as soon as possible after it determines how much will
be available for nondiscretionary awards. 



Paperwork Reduction 




Comment: 

Applicants with more than one award should be required to submit certain documents, such as audit and indirect cost
information, only once a year, instead of once per application. 


Response: 

To expedite processing, the Grants Management Division currently requires a copy of each document for each grant
file. We will keep this comment in mind for possible future implementation.

Guidelines for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Nondiscretionary Assistance



1. Definitions



``Complete application'' for a non-construction program means one that includes an original and two signed copies
of the following correctly completed documents: SF-424 ``Application for Federal Assistance'', SF-424A
``Budget Information Non-Construction Programs'', SF-424B ``Assurances_Non-Construction Programs'',
Form CD-511 ``Certifications Regarding Debarment, Suspension and Other Responsibility Matters; Drug-Free
Workplace Requirements; and Lobbying'', Statement of Work, and Detailed Budget and Budget Justification. It must
also include the following documents, if applicable; SF-LLL ``Disclosure of Lobbying Activities'', SF-LLLA
``Disclosure of Lobbying Activities (Continuation Sheet)'', and current Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement.
Administrative or program-related requirements for specific programs are published annually in program announcements,
application packages, or other documentation.

``Nondiscretionary assistance program'' means any NOAA program for providing financial assistance: (1) Under
which the amount of funding for, and the intended recipient of, the financial assistance is specified by Congress;
or (2) the recipients of which have customarily been a State or an interstate fishery commission.

Programs whose recipients have customarily been a State or an interstate fishery commission are:




Anadromous Fish Conservation Act Program (CFDA 11.405)

Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act of 1986 (CDFA 11.407)

Cooperative Fishery Statistics (CFDA 11.434)

Southeast Area Monitoring & Assessment Program (CFDA 11.435)

Columbia River Fisheries Development Program (CFDA 11.436)

West Coast Fisheries Data Program (CFDA 11.437)

Pacific Salmon Treaty Program (CFDA 11.438)

Marine Mammal Data Program (CFDA 11.439)

Alaska Salmon Enhancement (CFDA 11.458)




2. Notification of Applicant



A NOAA program office will notify eligible applicants for nondiscretionary assistance programs of application
requirements and deadlines. A complete and acceptable application must be submitted by the applicant to the appropriate
program office at least 75 days prior to the proposed effective date of the award. The applicant must write ``Nondiscretionary''
in block 8 of the Standard Form 424, Application for Federal Assistance, to identify applications subject to these
guidelines. Within 14 days after receipt of the application, the program office will notify the applicant in writing
whether the application is complete; if it is not, the notification will specify what additional material must be
provided before the application will be considered complete and processing initiated.



3. Processing of Application



Within 75 calendar days after a complete and acceptable application is received, the NOAA Grants Management Division
will notify the applicant of approval or disapproval of the application.



Classification



This notice of guidelines was not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866.
The Standard Forms 424, 424A, 424B and LLL have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the
Paperwork Reduction Act under OMB Control Nos. 0348-0043, 0348-0044, 0348-0040, and 0348-0046.
This notice does not contain policies with sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a federalism
assessment under E.O. 12612. The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Chief Counsel for
Advocacy of the Small Business Administration that these guidelines, if adopted, will not have a significant economical
impact on a substantial number of small entities because they specify only internal procedures for ensuring that
NOAA meets the deadlines established by section 404 of the NOAA Authorization Act.

Commissioner of Customs, Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229.





Dear Commissioner: 

Under the terms of section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854), and the Arrangement Regarding
International Trade in Textiles done at Geneva on December 20, 1973, as further extended on July 31, 1993; pursuant
to the Memorandum of Understanding dated April 1, 1994 between the Governments of the United States and Thailand;
and in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended, you are directed to prohibit,
effective on April 28, 1994, entry into the United States for consumption and withdrawal from warehouse for consumption
of cotton, wool, man-made fiber, silk blend and other vegetable fiber textiles and textile products in the following
categories, produced or manufactured in Thailand and exported during the twelve-month period beginning on January
1, 1994 and extending through December 31, 1994, in excess of the following levels of restraint:






Imports charged to these category limits, except Category 218, for the period January 1, 1993 through December 31,
1993 shall be charged against those levels of restraint to the extent of any unfilled balances. In the event the limits
established for that period have been exhausted by previous entries, such goods shall be subject to the levels set
forth in this directive.

Goods in Category 239 which are exported in excess of the 1993 Group II limit shall be charged to the 1994 limit for Category
239. In a subsequent directive, CITA will direct the Commissioner of Customs to deduct these charges from the 1994
limit for Category 239 and charge these same amounts to the 1994 Group II limit.

Import charges already made to Group II for Category 239 for the 1994 monitoring period (see directive dated December
2, 1993) shall be deducted from Group II and charged to the limit established in this directive for Category 239.

For goods exported and imported during the period January 1, 1994 through February 28, 1994, you are directed to charge
231,566 square meters to the limit established in this directive for Category 218.

The conversion factors for merged Categories 359-H/659-H and 638/639 are 11.5 and 12.96, respectively.

In carrying out the above directions, the Commissioner of Customs should construe entry into the United States for
consumption to include entry for consumption into the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that these actions fall within the foreign
affairs exception of the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1).

<DOCTITLE>Availability for Exclusive, Partially Exclusive or Nonexclusive Licensing of U.S. Patents Concerning the Control
of the Hardening of Cements and Binders</DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

U.S. Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station, DOD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability for licensing.







</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i), announcement is made of the availability of U.S. Patents 5,252,266 and
5,268,032 for licensing. These patents have been assigned to the United States of America as represented by the Secretary
of the Army, Washington, DC.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The patents cover techniques for controlling the hardening or setting reactions of binders or cements of the type
which require specific alkaline or acidic condition to initiate the reactions. The techniques described involve
mixing an alkali- or acid-reactive cement with an electrolyte to form a paste. An electric current is passed through
the paste to decompose the electrolyte and generate an activating agent. The techniques described allow the paste
to be handled and placed prior to the beginning of the setting reaction thereby avoiding the problems caused by short
setting times that can result in serious flaws in the finished product and/or damaging or clogging of the mixing equipment.
Further, because the activating agent is first generated at the electrode surface, the techniques are useful in casting
hollow products from the cements and binders mentioned because there is no need to rotate the mold. The mold can be fabricated
with one electrode in the center and the second electrode forming the outside of the mold. The acid or alkaline activator
can be generated on the outside edge of the paste. The paste in the center of the mold remains soft and can be removed.
Using this technique there is no need to rotate the mold to hold the paste out against the mold. The approach described
can be used with starting materials such as ground granulated blast-furnace slag and a sodium chloride solution.



Under the authority of section 11(a)(2) of the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-502) and section
207 of Title 35, United States Code, the Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers, Waterways Experiment Station
wishes to license the above United States Patents in an exclusive, partially exclusive or nonexclusive manner to
any party interested in using the technology described in the above mentioned patents.

Each interested party is requested to submit a proposal for an exclusive, partially exclusive or nonexclusive license.
The proposals for using this technology will be evaluated using the following criteria: royalty, technical capability,
size of business, and development plan.

<DOCTITLE>Intent To Repay to the Arizona State Department of Education Funds Recovered as a Result of a Final Audit Determination
</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent to award grantback funds.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Under section 459 of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA), 20 U.S.C. 1234h (1988), the U.S. Secretary of Education
(Secretary) intends to repay to the Arizona State Department of Education, the State educational agency (SEA), the
sum of $438,750, an amount that is 75 percent of the funds recovered by the U.S. Department of Education (Department)
under Chapter 2 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 (ECIA) as a result of a final audit determination
and settlement agreement. This notice describes the SEA's plans for the use of the repaid funds and the terms and conditions
under which the Secretary intends to make those funds available. The notice invites comments on the proposed grantback.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Background 


The Department recovered $585,000 from the SEA in response to claims arising from a special investigative audit conducted
by the Office of the Arizona Auditor General of the SEA's discretionary funding programs for the period January 1979
through June 1989. 
The claims primarily involved the SEA's administration and supervision of funds under Chapter 2 of the ECIA. Specifically,
the final audit determination of the Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education (Assistant Secretary)
found that official records, such as sole source procurement authorizations, vendor invoices, and receiving reports,
were falsified to circumvent internal control procedures. As a result of collusion between a former Deputy Superintendent
of the SEA and two vendors, Chapter 2 funds paid for consulting services that were never performed, educational materials
that did not exist, and other fraudulent schemes. Therefore, the Assistant Secretary demanded repayment of $777,745.46
to the Department for misspent funds. The SEA appealed the determination of the Assistant Secretary to the Office
of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ) on February 20, 1991. Subsequently, on July 23, 1993, while the case was pending,
the Department and the SEA executed a settlement agreement, wherein the SEA would repay $585,000 to the Department
in full settlement of the appeal. On October 22, 1993, the SEA repaid the full amount of $585,000 to the Department for
misspent funds under Chapter 2 of the ECIA. 


B. Authority for Awarding a Grantback 


Section 459(a) of GEPA, 20 U.S.C. 1234h(a), provides that, whenever the Secretary has recovered funds following
a final audit determination with respect to an applicable program, the Secretary may consider those funds to be additional
funds available for the program and may arrange to repay to the SEA or local educational agency (LEA) affected by that
determination an amount not to exceed 75 percent of the recovered funds. The Secretary may enter into this ``grantback''
arrangement if the Secretary determines that_ 
(1) The practices and procedures of the SEA or LEA that resulted in the audit determination have been corrected, and
the SEA or LEA is, in all other respects, in compliance with the requirements of the applicable program; 
(2) The SEA has submitted to the Secretary a plan for the use of the funds to be awarded under the grantback arrangement
that meets the requirements of the program and, to the extent possible, benefits the population that was affected
by the failure to comply or by the misexpenditures that resulted in the audit exception; and 
(3) Use of funds to be awarded under the grantback arrangement in accordance with the SEA's plan would serve to achieve
the purposes of the program under which the funds were originally granted. 


C. Plan for Use of Funds Awarded Under a Grantback Arrangement 


Pursuant to section 459(a)(2) of GEPA, the SEA has submitted a plan for use of the $438,750 in grantback funds under
Chapter 2 of Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA). 
The SEA proposes to use the grantback funds to supplement a portion of its Chapter 2 effective schools program, specifically
the Arizona Student Assessment Program (ASAP), by developing performance-based assessments tailored to the State's
Spanish-speaking pupils_many of whom are at risk and whose education entails higher costs. The grantback plan also
includes teacher and parent training related to the new assessments. 
One of ASAP's components prescribes a comprehensive performance-based assessment system with broad capabilities
for reporting test results. The SEA has designed performance assessments that effectively test student mastery
of the Arizona Essential Skills, Statewide academic standards, at grades 3, 8, and 12 in the areas of reading, writing,
and mathematics. These tests, known as ``Form A,'' are administered in both English and Spanish. However, the Riverside
Publishing Company has developed a ``Form B'' for testing one to two grade levels preceding ``Form A,'' and a ``Form
C'' that will test two to three grade levels preceding ``Form A.'' Presently, there are no Spanish versions of ``Form
B'' or ``Form C.'' Spanish versions are greatly needed because approximately one quarter of Arizona's student population
is from native Spanish-speaking backgrounds and nearly 9 percent are enrolled in bilingual education classes. Currently,
no legislative or State board mandate exists to obtain Spanish versions nor has a funding source to develop them been
identified. Under the grantback plan, Arizona would use the grantback funds to pay the Riverside Publishing Company
to produce Spanish editions of the tests called ``Forms B and C'' that would reflect appropriate cultural content.
Teachers would receive training in the use of ``Forms B and C'' and parent and community workshops would be held to inform
the public at large about ASAP initiatives and to invite participation.

D. The Secretary's Determination 


The Secretary has carefully reviewed the plan submitted by the SEA. Based upon that review, the Secretary has determined
that the conditions under section 459 of GEPA have been met. In particular, with respect to correcting the practices
that led to the audit determination, the SEA has demonstrated that its system of internal controls has been greatly
strengthened and that recently adopted policies and procedures governing the distribution of grant funds should
prevent recurrence of the fraudulent activities that precipitated this case. Arizona has also criminally prosecuted
the former Deputy Superintendent as well as the principal vendor involved in the scheme to misappropriate Chapter
2 funds. 
This determination is based upon the best information available to the Secretary at the present time. If this information
is not accurate or complete, the Secretary is not precluded from taking appropriate administrative action. In finding
that the conditions of section 459 of GEPA have been met, the Secretary makes no determination concerning any pending
audit recommendations or final audit determinations. 


E. Notice of the Secretary's Intent To Enter Into a Grantback Arrangement 


Section 459(d) of GEPA requires that, at least 30 days before entering into an arrangement to award funds under a grantback,
the Secretary must publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of intent to do so, and the terms and conditions under which the payment will be made. 
In accordance with section 459(d) of GEPA, notice is hereby given that the Secretary intends to make funds available
to the Arizona SEA under a grantback arrangement. The grantback award would be in the amount of $438,750, which is 75
percent of the Chapter 2 funds recovered by the Department as a result of the audit. 


F. Terms and Conditions Under Which Payments Under a Grantback Arrangement Would Be Made 


The SEA agrees to comply with the following terms and conditions under which payment under a grantback arrangement
would be made: 
(1) The funds awarded under the grantback must be spent in accordance with_ 
(a) All applicable statutory and regulatory requirements; 
(b) The plan that the SEA submitted and any amendments to the plan that are approved in advance by the Secretary; and

(c) The budget that was submitted with the plan and any amendments to the budget that are approved in advance by the Secretary.

(2) All funds received under the grantback arrangement must be obligated by September 30, 1996 in accordance with
section 459 (c) of GEPA. 
(3) The SEA will, not later than January 1, 1998, submit a report to the Secretary that_ 
(a) Indicates that the funds awarded under the grantback have been spent in accordance with the proposed plan and approved
budget; and 
(b) Describes the results and effectiveness of the project for which the funds were spent. 
(4) Separate accounting records must be maintained documenting the expenditures of funds awarded under the grantback
arrangement. 
(5) Before funds will be repaid pursuant to this notice, the SEA must repay to the Department any debts that become overdue
or enter into a repayment agreement for those debts.

Solicitation for Financial Assistance Applications; Electrochromic Window Technologies Program



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Energy.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of solicitation for financial assistance applications number DE-PS36-94GO10001.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), through the Electrochromic Window Technologies Program, announces its intention
to issue a competitive solicitation and make multiple (at least two (2)) awards to accelerate commercialization
of electrochromic window technologies. This action is subject to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, which can be
found in title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR part 600).




AVAILABILITY OF THE SOLICITATION:

 To obtain a copy of the solicitation once it is issued on or about May 12, 1994, write to the U.S. Department of Energy's
Golden Field Office, 1617 Cole Blvd, Golden, CO 80401, Attn: Mr. John Meeker, Contract Specialist. Only written requests
for the solicitation will be honored. For convenience, requests for the solicitation may be faxed to Mr. Meeker at
(303) 275-4790.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, is planning to assist in the funding
of the development and demonstration of an electrochromic window product that would be fully marketable within 4
years. Awards under the solicitation will be Cooperative Agreements administered in accordance with 10 CFR part
600, DOE's Financial Assistance Rules.



DOE is interested in promoting and supporting innovative system approaches to the development of electrochromic
windows for building applications. Electrochromic windows are expected to reduce energy and resource use, reduce
environmental impacts, increase affordability, improve quality, increase productivity in the U.S. building sector
and increase the competitiveness of the U.S. window industry. It is expected that multi-disciplinary teams would
be organized to respond to the solicitation. It is desired that each team have sufficient breadth to include all the
major types of companies involved in the manufacture and fabrication of electrochromic devices as well as commercial
building windows. Each team must provide the expertise and proven capability to conduct the necessary electrochromic
device development and window commercialization. Qualified prospective sources must demonstrate an electrochromic
material development capability, glass or plastic film coating capability and window fabrication capability.
The project is expected to be completed in three phases covering a four year period. The first phase, running for 1 to
1.5 years, will culminate with the production of several test specimens or prototypes. These specimens should be
sufficient in number and size (e.g., 30 sq. ft. of samples greater than 1.0 sq. ft. each) to conduct a thorough test and
evaluation of the technology, reasonably assuring success in phase 2. The second phase, running for 1.5 to 2 years,
will result in demonstration prototypes, which when produced in limited quantities, would be suitable for niche
markets. This Phase will require development of device manufacturing processes and market evaluation. Phase 3 will
address demonstration and deployment activities and will not be specifically defined in the resulting agreement.
However, Phase 3 will be subject to the commercial readiness of the electrochromic windows at the end of Phase 2 and
availability of DOE funds.

It is anticipated that requirements of the solicitation will include that:

(1) All teams or applicants in projects shall include at least one for-profit entity; and

(2) Projects selected shall require manufacture and reproduction substantially within the United States for any
invention or product that may result from the project.

In general, the solicitation will require cost sharing by applicants of at least 50% of the total project costs in order
to receive an award under the solicitation. The Phase 1 award minimum cost share is 25% though a higher level is desirable.
The level of cost sharing will be one criterion in selecting the winning teams. All participant cost sharing must come
from non-Federal funding sources. It is anticipated that total DOE funding in the amount of $1,200,000 will be available
for Phase 1 activities. It is anticipated that up to $5,000,000 of DOE funding will be available for Phase 2 activities.
All DOE funding, however, is subject to availability of appropriations.

The solicitation will be issued on or about May 12, 1994, and will contain detailed information on funding, cost sharing
requirements, eligibility, application preparation, and evaluation. Responses to the solicitation will be due
45 days after solicitation release. However, applications are encouraged to be submitted prior to the closing date.
All responsible sources are encouraged to submit an application and all applications will be considered.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Morgantown Energy Technology Center.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of a Research Opportunity Announcement (ROA).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The objective of this program is to support the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Office of Technology Development's
applied research efforts for the development of technologies having potential applications in the Environmental
Restoration and Waste Management (EM) program. This is the second ROA to be issued in support of that program. Technologies
which: Do not duplicate existing work; complement or enhance existing or planned work; and best serve the needs of
the EM program are desired. A proposed technology may be a device, process, material or method that improves DOE's
capabilities in the following areas: in situ remediation of contaminated sites; characterization, sensors and
monitoring; low-level mixed waste processing; efficient separations technology for radioactive wastes; robotics;
materials disposition technologies; improved engineered barriers for waste storage and disposal; and improved
waste forms. 



For the purpose of this program, ``applied research'' is the systematic application of knowledge toward the production
of useful devices, materials or methods, including design, development, and improvement of prototypes and processes
to meet specific requirements. Proposals for basic research are not desired under 
this ROA. 

It is not the purpose of this solicitation to support, and no proposal will be selected to conduct, support service
activities, conference or training activities, or for work who's primary purpose is the demonstration of existing
technologies.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



1. Identification number, authority for issuance, and title: 

a. DE-RO21-94MC31305. 

b. The use of broad agency announcements is authorized by the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 (CICA) (41 U.S.C.
259(b)(2)) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation at part 6.102(d)(2) as supplemented by the Department of Energy
Acquisition Regulation. 

c. Title of Research Opportunity Announcement: Applied Research and Development of Technologies For Environmental
Restoration and Waste Management II. 

d. Areas of Research in Which Contracts May be Awarded: 

1. In situ remediation. There is a need for innovative and improved in situ remediation methods for the cleanup of contaminated
soils and groundwater. In situ treatment refers to treatment of contaminated material with minimal, or no, excavation,
as well as any enhancement of contaminant removal from the subsurface. In situ remediation includes on-site treatment
of groundwater and soils. In situ containment refers to technologies which retard or eliminate contaminant migration
to the surrounding environment. The EM program has focused on three areas in which to develop in situ remediation technologies.
They are: (1) In situ containment, (2) in situ biological treatment and (3) physical/chemical in situ treatment.

2. Characterization, sensors and monitoring. Technologies for characterization and monitoring are required for
site clean-up and waste processing applications. There is a need for greater use of field-deployable methods and
devices including real-time monitoring of process streams to reduce dependency on laboratory analyses which are
costly and time consuming. In addition, techniques, including information management systems, are required that
can better elucidate the physical, hydrogeological and chemical properties of the subsurface while minimizing
or optimizing the use of boreholes. Finally, improved sensors are needed to better measure contaminants in varied,
hazardous environments. 

3. Low-level mixed waste processing. DOE has identified the need for the development of new technologies for reducing
current mixed (hazardous with a radioactive component) waste inventories. Low-level mixed waste is categorized
into the following generic descriptions: Aqueous liquid wastes, organic liquid wastes containing organic chemicals,
wet solid wastes, and dry solid wastes. 

Six treatment technology areas, ranging from front-end waste handling through the generation of a final waste form,
are identified for focusing applied research and development efforts. The treatment technology areas are: (1) Front-end
waste handling and feed preparation, (2) non-thermal waste treatment, including decontamination, recycling and
separation of suspended and dissolved materials, (3) mercury control, (4) waste destruction and stabilization,
(5) secondary destruction and off-gas treatment and (6) final waste forms. Processing low-level mixed wastes will
emphasize, where appropriate, use of methods to treat and/or separate the hazardous component to simplify the handling
and disposal of materials in subsequent steps. 

4. Efficient separations technology for radioactive wastes. Separations technologies are required to process
a wide spectrum of highly radioactive defense wastes. These wastes may include high-level wastes, low-level wastes,
transuranic wastes, and mixed wastes in all three categories. Highly radioactive defense wastes are anticipated
to be processed into waste forms suitable for disposal in deep geologic repositories. Innovative applications of
appropriate separation technologies will substantially decrease the volume of waste to be disposed of in repositories
resulting in significant cost savings. 

5. Robotics. Five areas have been identified within the EM program for development and application of advanced robotics
and automation technologies. These are: (1) The characterization and remediation of waste storage tanks, (2) the
characterization and remediation of buried waste sites, (3) the automation of contaminant analysis, (4) the decontamination
and decommissioning of inactive nuclear facilities, and (5) operations for waste handling. Advancements in the
development of robotics and automation technologies are needed in the areas of mechanical, control, and sensor systems.


6. Material disposition technology. Decontamination and decommissioning of surplus DOE facilities will result
in the need to dispose of concrete, metals, sludges, contaminated soil, chemicals, and hazardous and mixed wastes.
The implementation of recycling and reuse technologies is desired due to the great volumes and potential value of
the material that is present at these facilities. Volume reduction technologies are also needed to minimize the costs
associated with storage and disposal. 

7. Improved engineered barriers for waste and disposal. 
There is a need for improved engineered barriers, i.e, any man-made structures, devices or practices that enhance
the performance of a waste storage or disposal facility. Engineered barriers are required to contain wastes which
might otherwise release contaminants along air, surface water and/or groundwater pathways. Technology is needed
for the design, construction and performance assessment of improved engineered barriers relative to low-level
radioactive waste disposal and the interim storage of high-level radioactive wastes. 

8. Improved waste forms. 
Technologies producing improved waste forms for hazardous, radioactive and mixed wastes are desired. Waste forms
must meet certain performance requirements, including durability and resistance to leaching. Waste types for which
improved waste forms are desired are: low-level mixed wastes, incinerator ash and various special radioactive wastes
including spent nuclear fuels, calcine waste, cesium and strontium halides, and transuranic waste. In addition,
DOE is seeking performance assessment methodologies to rapidly and reliably determine the leachability and durability
of waste forms.

<DOCTITLE>Golden Field Office; Cooperative Agreement Award to Geothermal Education Office</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Energy.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of financial assistance award in response to a non-competitive financial assistance application.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2) is announcing
its intention to make a multi-year financial assistance award to the Geothermal Education Office to develop, publish
and distribute user-friendly information about geothermal energy.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This proposal was a solicited application. The work being done at the Geothermal Education Office is a continuation
of a program that was funded by DOE through a contract with Sandia National Laboratory. However, the Department believes
that the effort contemplated is more appropriate to be funded through a grant mechanism because the intent of the program
is to benefit the public through development and distribution of geothermal energy educational information to American
youth. Competition for this effort would have an adverse effect on continuity of these on-going activities.





The programmatic evaluation [see 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(ii)(D)] completed for this proposal resulted in a recommendation
to fund this application for the following reasons:



The proposed project will contribute to the DOE mission of ``* * * providing the scientific and educational
foundation, * * * necessary to achieve efficiency in energy use, diversity in energy sources, * * *.''
by developing, publishing and distributing user friendly information about geothermal energy. The target group
is Kindergarten through 12th Grade (K-12) teachers and students.


The objectives of the Geothermal Education Office (an educational non-profit organization) are to develop, publish
and distribute user-friendly information about geothermal energy. Its target group is K-12 teachers and students.
The Geothermal Education Office staff coordinates educational workshops and booths, does extensive mailings,
publishes in educational and geothermal industry newsletters, gives input to textbook and other publishers, works
on joint projects with other geothermal and energy education organizations, and attends appropriate geothermal
association meetings.


The probability of meeting the objectives listed below are very high, given that the Geothermal Education Office
has been successful in the past for similar endeavors.



The staff of the Geothermal Education Office is uniquely qualified to provide this service. Marilyn Nemzer, Director
of the Geothermal Education Office, has spent her career in education and has developed the support of other geothermal
organizations. At the 1993 Geothermal Resource Council Conference, Marilyn Nemzer, director of the Geothermal
Education Office, was honored by the Council for her efforts and accomplishments.



The Geothermal Education Office's facilities are fully capable of meeting their needs and the accomplishment of
the effort under this grant.



The budget proposed for the anticipated work was reviewed and is considered to be appropriate and adequate.


The major public benefit to be derived from this project is providing an educational background to the youth of the
United States as well as others who might be interested. Informing others about geothermal energy provides a positive
public outlook toward all renewable energies and energy efficient products and ideas.



Providing an educational foundation of Geothermal Energy fits comfortably within the program's direction and objectives.
The Geothermal Education Office has established an information network which is continually growing and is providing
educational material and hands-on projects. This experience further enhances the ability of the applicant to achieve
the public benefits to be derived from accomplishment of the objectives of this effort. The proposed effort is a continuation
of work currently being funded by DOE. Competition for this effort would have a significant adverse impact on the continuity
of the proposed activities.

<DOCTITLE>Golden Field Office; Grant Award to Howard University</DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Energy.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance award.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7, is announcing its
intention to award a grant to Howard University for continuing research efforts in support of the Biological and Chemical
Technologies Research (BCTR) program at DOE. The BCTR program seeks to improve operations and decrease energy use
in the chemical and petrochemical industries.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Howard University has been conducting research for a number of years to develop genetic engineering techniques to
enhance the capability of fungi/bacteria to degrade lignocellulose to simpler materials. Successful completion
of this research would advance the public goal of converting biomass to useful chemicals and other products. A detailed
understanding of the processes that control the reactivity and specificity of enzymatic reactions within the fungi/bacteria
will provide the knowledge needed to exploit these reactions for technological applications.





The proposed award will be an extension of work currently supported by the Department of Energy and constitutes an
integral part of the DOE program by further developing genetic engineering techniques to enhance the decomposition
of lignocellulose to simpler materials. This application represents a unique approach in this area and one in which
the applicant has the exclusive capacity to perform as required. DOE has performed a review in accordance with 10 CFR
600.7 and has determined that the activity to be funded is necessary to satisfactorily complete the current research
and that a noncompetitive award is duly justified. DOE funding for this grant is estimated at $150,000 and the anticipated
period of performance is twelve (12) months.

<DOCTITLE> Regional Roundtables on Climate Change Action Plan for Stabilizing Greenhouse Gas Emissions</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Department of Energy (DOE).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of roundtables.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. DOE is announcing the fourth and fifth in a series of regional roundtables to solicit comments and feedback
from stakeholders, which include state and local officials, utility representatives, industry representatives,
public interest groups and other interested parties on the 

Climate Change Action Plan,

 the Clinton Administration's blueprint for stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 19, 1993, President Clinton made a national commitment to stabilizing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
at 1990 levels by the year 2000. The blueprint for achieving this goal is known as the 

Climate Change Action Plan

 (CCAP), a volume of 46 emissions-reducing ``actions'' the U.S. will take during the remainder of the decade. The Plan
is founded on the principle that cost-effective energy efficiency programs provide energy cost reductions that
more than offset the investment to increase efficiency. The CCAP focuses on and accelerates the implementation of
the Energy Policy Act of 1992. As a result, the overall Plan is estimated to require no net increase in Federal funding
as it creates jobs, reduces home and business energy bills, and induces over $60 billion in new domestic investment.
The Department of Energy's (DOE's) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy has the responsibility for implementing
the renewable energy and energy efficiency actions in the President's plan. An executive summary of the Plan may be
obtained by calling DOE, (202) 586-7541. Several other Federal agencies and offices have important implementation
responsibilities for the remaining actions and for other aspects of the Plan. 



DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and the National Association of State Energy Officials will
conduct regional roundtables to solicit comments and feedback on the 

Climate Change Action Plan.

 
The purpose of the roundtables is to describe and solicit feedback on DOE's preliminary proposals to implement its
actions under the Plan. Rather than design individual implementation plans, however, DOE has examined its implementation
responsibilities from the standpoint of comprehensiveness, integration, and leverage. As a result, DOE has developed
an implementation approach that has the potential to integrate all CCAP activities, not only into DOE's programs,
but also into other energy efficiency activities and programs. 

Through these roundtables DOE hopes to begin soliciting input from a wide variety of stakeholders. The agency seeks
feedback on the comprehensive strategy as well as specifics of proposed implementation activities. Comments or
questions from the public may be submitted in person or in writing at the roundtable. Following the roundtable, written
comments or questions may be sent to the address listed above. For several of the actions, DOE presents several implementation
options rather than a single proposed implementation plan. In these instances, DOE seeks input that will help guide
our selection of one of these options. 

The roundtable format will provide a forum for representatives from state and local governments, utilities, industry,
public interest groups and other interested parties to provide comments. The roundtable format is sufficiently
flexible to allow participants to offer comments, either on specific actions or on the entire package, through the
use of breakout sessions for key groups of actions. All comments will be considered. Facilitators will be provided
for each session. A copy of a summary of the roundtable proceedings may be obtained by calling or writing to the address
listed above.

Cascade Power Co., Notice of Availability of Final Environmental Assessment


April 21, 1994.


In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR Part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 F.R. 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has
reviewed the application for a subsequent minor license for the existing Cascade Project, located on the Little River
in Transylvania County, North Carolina, near the city of Brevard, and has prepared a final Environmental Assessment
(EA) for the project. In the EA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the existing and potential future environmental
impacts of the project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate environmental protective
or enhancement measures, would not constitute a major federal action that would significantly affect quality of
the human environment.
Copies of the EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426.

<DOCTITLE>Central Maine Power Co.; Amendment to the Notice of Project Site Visits and Scoping Meetings</DOCTITLE>



April 21, 1994.



The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is reviewing the application for a new license for the continued
operation of the Gulf Island_Deer Rips Project on the Androscoggin River, Maine.

As part of the licensing proceedings for the Gulf Island_Deer Rips Project, the Commission issued a ``Notice of Intention
to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the Lower Androscoggin River, Conduct Project Site Visits, and
Hold Public Scoping Meetings'' on April 11, 1994. The Staff was informed by the Maine Department of Environmental
Protection that the agency scoping meeting scheduled for May 13, 1994, conflicted with a scheduled furlough day for
state employees in Maine.

Due to the above conflict, the morning scoping meeting, originally scheduled for May 13, 1994, will be held on May 12,
1994, from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m., at the Quality Inn, 1777 Washington Street, Auburn, Maine. The site visit for the Gulf Island_Deer
Rips Project will begin at 10:30 a.m. May 12, 1994, or immediately following the agency scoping meeting, at the Gulf
Island Powerhouse.

For further information, please contact Robert Bell, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Office of Hydropower
Licensing, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426 (Telephone 202-219-2806), or Allan Creamer

<DOCTITLE>Mojave Pipeline Co.; Amendment to Application</DOCTITLE>



April 21, 1994.



Take notice that on April 18, 1994, Mojave Pipeline Company (``Mojave'') filed in Docket No. CP93-258-003,
pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (``Act'') and Rule 215 of the Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (``Commission''), an amendment to its initial application for a certificate of public
convenience and necessity, filed March 17, 1993 and amended on November 8, 1993 in Docket CP93-258-000,
all as more fully set forth in the amendment to the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

On March 17, 1993, Mojave filed an application for an optional certificate of public convenience and necessity to
construct, install, and operate certain pipeline, compression and related facilities for the purpose of extending
its pipeline into central and northern California (the ``Northward Expansion''). An Amendment to that application
was filed on November 8, 1993. To facilitate the transportation of gas to these new markets, Mojave's application
also proposed to expand Mojave's existing mainline through the addition of looping and compression. Mojave requested
the Commission to issue a certificate prior to April, 1, 1994, in order to meet a projected in-service date of April
1, 1995.

In its initial application, Mojave submitted for Commission review two alternative designs for the Northward Expansion
facilities. Under the first alternative, ``Case 1'', Mojave proposed to construct a 475 Mmcf/d expansion on a stand-alone
basis, requiring the construction of new mainline and related facilities and additional looping on Mojave's existing
facilities, as well as a number of additional meter stations. Under the second alternative, ``Case 2'', Mojave's
proposed 475 Mmcf/d expansion would be built in conjunction with a proposed 475 Mmcf/d expansion would be built in
conjunction with a proposed expansion by Kern River Gas Transmission Company (``Kern River'') of 452 Mmcf/d. Kern
River's proposal is currently pending at Docket No. CP92-198-000.

Mojave states that the Amendment has two purposes. One is to identify 29 minor route modifications to the previously-proposed
Cases 1 and 2 that more specifically address environmental, cultural resource, engineering and/or right-of-way
matters. Mojave also states that 24 of these alternates constitute route revisions of approximately 1000 feet or
less and affect, in total, approximately 47.3 miles of its proposed pipeline route and do not result in changes to the
previously-filed cost estimate.

Mojave states that the second purpose is to present to the Commission for review, two alternative project designs
(Case 3 and Case 4) that incorporate recent developments in the Northern and Central California markets to be served
by the Northern Expansion. Mojave indicates that Case 3 consists 635.1 miles of pipeline of various diameters, related
facilities and 103,228 horsepower of compression at an estimated cost of $488,084,000 dollars while Case 4 consists
of 679 miles of pipeline of various diameters, related facilities and 92,728 horsepower of compression at and estimated
cost of $494,907,000 dollars. Cases 3 and 4 do not supersede the previously-filed alternation project designs.

Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should, on or before May 5,
1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a protest or motion to intervene
in accordance with the requirements of Rule 211 or 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211
or 385.214) and the Regulations Under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will
be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties
to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein
must file a petition to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.

Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application
if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter
finds that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene
is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of
such hearing will be duly given.

<DOCTITLE>Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation; Request Under Blanket Authorization </DOCTITLE>



April 15, 1994. 



Take notice that on April 14, 1994, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (TGPL), P.O. Box 1396, Houston, Texas
77251, filed in Docket No. CP94-355-000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.212 of the Commission's
Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.212) for authorization to construct and operate an additional
delivery point for service to Piedmont Natural Gas Company (Piedmont) in Rowan County, North Carolina, under TGPL's
blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-426-000 pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all
as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

TGPL proposes to add the delivery point on TGPL's 42-inch Main Line ``D'' in Rowan County in order to continue its existing
service to Piedmont, a transportation and storage customer of TGPL, during replacement of a 1.2 mile segment of TGPL's
Main Line ``A''. TGPL estimates that the construction cost would be $68,000. It is asserted that TGPL delivers up to
17,000 Mcf of natural gas per day to Piedmont, and that this volume would not be altered by the proposal. It is further
asserted that the deliveries are within Piedmont's existing entitlement from TGPL. It is stated that TGPL has sufficient
system delivery capability to accomplish deliveries at the proposed delivery point without detriment or disadvantage
to TGPL's other customers. It is explained that the addition of the proposed delivery point will have no effect on TGPL's
peak day deliveries and little or no impact on TGPL's annual deliveries. 

Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file
pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention
and pursuant to Section 157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request.
If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective
the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time
allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to
section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.

<DOCTITLE>Ozone Design Value Study of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Extension of comment period for draft report on the ``Clean Air Act Ozone Design Value Study''.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Section 183(g) of title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 requires the Administrator to conduct a study of whether
the methodology in use by the EPA, as of the date of enactment, for establishing a design value for ozone, provides a
reasonable indicator of the ozone air quality of ozone nonattainment areas. The EPA is directed to obtain public review
of the study report prior to submitting the report to Congress.



The focus of the Ozone Design Value Study is EPA's ozone design value methodology. A design value may be viewed intuitively
as a concentration value used to quantify the degree to which the level of an air quality standard has been exceeded.
With the wording of the ozone standard, the appropriate design value is the concentration with expected number of
exceedances equal to 1. These ozone design values were used to classify areas as marginal, moderate, serious, severe,
or extreme in accordance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.

This notice extends the period for public review and comment of the draft report of the ``Clean Air Act Ozone Design
Value Study'' from 30 days to 60 days.

Center (ERC) training grants totaling approximately $8,354,000 and ranging from approximately $400,000 to $800,000
with the average award being approximately $595,000. The following are the required characteristics of Educational
Resource Centers. 
An Occupational Safety and Health Educational Resource Center shall be an identifiable organizational unit within
the sponsoring organization and shall consist of the following characteristics: 

a. Cooperative arrangements with a medical school or teaching hospital (with an established program in preventive
or occupational medicine); with a school of nursing or its equivalent; with a school of public health or its equivalent;
and with a school of engineering or its equivalent. Other schools or departments with relevant disciplines and resources
shall be expected to be represented and contribute as appropriate to the conduct of the total program, e.g., epidemiology,
toxicology, biostatistics, environmental health, law, business administration, education. Specific mechanisms
to implement the cooperative arrangements between departments, schools/colleges, universities, etc., shall
be demonstrated in order to assure that the multidisciplinary training and education that is intended will be engendered.


b. A Center Director who possesses a demonstrated capacity for sustained productivity and leadership in occupational
health and safety education and training. The Director shall oversee the general operation of the Center Program
and shall, to the extent possible, directly participate in training activities. Provisions shall be made to employ
a Deputy Director who shall be responsible for managing the daily administrative duties of the Center and to increase
the Center Director's availability to ERC staff and to the public. At least one full-time equivalent effort shall
be demonstrated between the two positions. 

c. Program Directors who are full-time faculty and professional staff representing various disciplines and qualifications
relevant to occupational safety and health who are capable of planning, establishing, and carrying out or administering
training projects undertaken by the Center. Each academic core program as well as the continuing education and outreach
program shall have a Program Director. 

d. Faculty and staff with demonstrated training and research expertise, appropriate facilities and ongoing training
and research activities in occupational safety and health areas.

e. A program for conducting education and training of occupational physicians, occupational health nurses, industrial
hygienists, industrial hygiene engineers and occupational safety personnel. There shall be a minimum of five full-time
students in each of the core programs, with a goal of a minimum of 30 full-time students (total in all of core programs
together). It is most desirable for a Center to have the full range of core programs; however, a Center with three core
programs is eligible for support providing it is demonstrated that students will be exposed to the principles and
issues of all four core disciplines. Training may also be conducted in other allied occupational safety and health
disciplines, e.g., industrial toxicology, biostatistics and epidemiology, and ergonomics. Each core program
curriculum shall include courses from non-core categories as well as appropriate clinical rotations and field experiences
with public health and safety agencies and with labor-management health and safety groups. Where possible, field
experience shall involve students representing other disciplines in a manner similar to that used in team surveys
and other team approaches. 

f. A specific plan describing how trainees will be exposed to the principles of all other occupational safety and health
core and allied disciplines. Consortium Centers generally have geographic, policy and other barriers to achieving
this Center characteristic and, therefore, must give special, if not innovative, attention to thoroughly describing
the approach for fulfilling the multidisciplinary interaction between students. 

g. Demonstrated impact of the ERC on the curriculum taught by relevant medical specialties, including family practice,
internal medicine, dermatology, orthopaedics, pathology, radiology, neurology, perinatal medicine, psychiatry,
etc., and on the curriculum of other schools such as engineering, business, law and the medical school. 

h. An outreach program to interact with and help other institutions or agencies located within the region. Examples
of outreach activities might include activities such as: Interaction with other colleges and schools within the
ERC and with other universities or institutions in the region to integrate occupational safety and health principles
and concepts within existing curricula (e.g., Colleges of Business Administration, Engineering, Architecture,
Law, and Arts and Sciences); exchange of occupational safety and health faculty among regional educational institutions;
providing curriculum materials and consultation for curriculum/course development in other institutions; use
of a visiting faculty program to involve labor and management leaders; cooperative and collaborative arrangements
with professional societies, scientific associations, and boards of accreditation, certification, or licensure;
and presentation of awareness seminars to undergraduate and secondary educational institutions (e.g., high school
science fairs and career days) as well as to labor, management and community associations. 

i. A specific plan for preparing, distributing and conducting courses, seminars and workshops to provide short-term
and continuing education training courses for physicians, nurses, industrial hygienists, safety engineers and
other occupational safety and health professionals, paraprofessionals and technicians, including personnel
from labor-management health and safety committees, in the geographical region in which the Center is located. The
goal shall be that the training be made available to a minimum of 400 trainees/year representing all of the above categories
of personnel, on an approximate proportional basis with emphasis given to providing occupational safety and health
training to physicians in family practice, as well as industrial practice, industrial nurses, and safety engineers.
Where appropriate, it shall be professionally acceptable in that Continuing Education Units (as approved by appropriate
professional associations) may be awarded. These courses should be structured so that higher educational institutions,
public health and safety agencies, professional societies or other appropriate agencies can utilize them to provide
training at the local level to occupational health and safety personnel working in the workplace. Further, the Center
shall conduct periodic training needs assessments, shall develop a specific plan to meet these needs, and shall have
demonstrated capability for implementing such training directly and through other institutions or agencies in
the region. The Center should establish and maintain cooperative efforts with labor unions, government agencies,
and industry trade associations, where appropriate, thus serving as a regional resource for addressing the problems
of occupational safety and health that are faced by State and local governments, labor and management. 

j. A Board of Advisors or Consultants representing the user and affected population, including representatives
of labor, industry, government agencies, academic institutions and professional associations, shall be established
by the Center. The Board shall meet regularly to advise a Center Executive Committee and to provide periodic evaluation
of Center activities. The Executive Committee shall be composed of the Center Director and Deputy Director, academic
Program Directors, the Directors for Continuing Education and Outreach and others whom the Center Director may appoint
to assist in governing the internal affairs of the Center. 

k. A defined research plan for the purposes of establishing a research base within the core occupational safety and
health disciplines and within the ERC infrastructure as a whole, and for the training of researchers in occupational
safety and health. The plan will include how the Center intends to strengthen existing research training efforts,
and how it will expand these research activities to impact on other primarily clinically-oriented disciplines,
such as nursing and medicine. (In nursing, for example, the development of the nursing research area should be consistent
with national strategies outlined by professional nursing and occupational health nursing specialty groups to
enhance nursing research productivity and to increase the number of nurse researchers for the future.) Each ERC is
required to identify or develop a minimum of one, preferably more, areas of research focus related to work environment
problems. Consideration shall be given to, but not limited to, the top ten work-related diseases and injuries targeted
by CDC/NIOSH. In addition to the research and research training components, the plan will also include such items
as specific strategies for obtaining student and faculty funding, plans for renovating or acquiring facilities
and equipment, if appropriate, and a plan for developing research-oriented faculty. 

l. Evidence in obtaining support from other funds, including other Federal grants, support from States and other
public agencies, and support from the private sector including grants from foundations and corporate endowments,
chairs, and gifts. 

2. Approximately $247,000 of the available funds as specified in A.1. will be awarded to ERCs to support the development
of specialized educational programs in agricultural safety and health within the existing core disciplines of industrial
hygiene, occupational medicine, occupational health nursing, and occupational safety. Program support is available
for faculty and staff salaries, trainee costs, and other costs to educate professionals in agricultural safety and
health. 

3. To award approximately twenty-six non-competing continuation and thirteen competing continuation long-term
training project grants (TPG) totaling $2,068,000 and ranging from approximately $10,000 to $500,000, with the
average award being $53,000, to support academic programs in the fields of industrial hygiene, occupational health
nursing, occupational/industrial medicine, and occupational safety. The following are the types of occupational
safety and health training programs that are eligible for support. The awards are normally for training programs
of 1 academic year. They are intended to augment the scope, enrollment, and quality of training programs rather than
to replace funds already available for current operations. The types of training currently eligible for support
are: 

a. Graduate training for practice, teaching, and research careers in occupational safety and health. Priority will
be given to programs producing graduates in areas (i.e., disciplines such as occupational health nursing) of greatest
occupational safety and health need.

b. Undergraduate and other pre-baccalaureate training providing trainees with capabilities for positions in occupational
safety and health professions. 

c. Special technical or other programs for training of occupational safety and health technicians or specialists.


d. Special programs for development of occupational safety and health training curricula and educational materials,
including mechanisms for effectiveness testing and implementation. 

Awards will be made for a 1- to 5-year project period with an annual budget period. Funding estimates may vary and are
subject to change. Non-competing continuation awards within the approved project periods will be made on the basis
of satisfactory progress and the availability of funds. 

B. Approximately $1,050,000 of the total funds available will be awarded to ERCs to support the development and presentation
of continuing education and short courses and academic curricula for trainees and professionals engaged in the management
of hazardous substances. These funds are provided to NIOSH/CDC through an Interagency Agreement with the National
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences as authorized by section 209(b) of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization
Act (SARA) of 1986 (100 STAT. 1708-1710). The hazardous substance training (HST) funds are being used to supplement
previous hazardous substance continuing education grant support provided to the ERCs in FY 1984 and 1985 under the
authority of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980 as amended
by SARA for the ERC continuing education program. The hazardous substance academic training (HSAT) funds are being
used to supplement continuing industrial hygiene core program support to develop and offer academic curricula in
the hazardous substance field primarily for industrial hygiene trainees. Program support is available for faculty
and staff salaries, trainee costs, and other costs to provide training and education for occupational safety and
health and other professional personnel engaged in the evaluation, management, and handling of hazardous substances.
The policies regarding project periods also apply to these activities.

Revision to Chapter 2 of HUD Handbook 
on Occupancy Requirements of Subsidized 
Multifamily Housing Programs 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, HUD; and Office of the Assistant Secretary
for Housing_Federal Housing Commissioner, HUD.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The purpose of this notice is to advise the public, particularly housing managers, owners and residents of certain
HUD-assisted housing, that the Department has revised Chapter 2 of its Handbook entitled ``Occupancy Requirements
of Subsidized Multifamily Housing Programs'' (Handbook 4350.3, Chg-24) to address concerns raised by members
of the public about certain provisions of the Handbook relating to occupancy policies in housing for elderly (age
62 and over) persons. The supplementary information section of this notice provides additional information on the
changes made to Chapter 2 of the Handbook.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Department's Handbook 4350.3 on Occupancy Requirements of Subsidized Multifamily Housing Programs (the ``Handbook'')
provides guidance on the occupancy policies and procedures governing multifamily housing subsidized under the
following programs: the Section 221(d)(3) (Below Market Interest Rate) Program; the Rent Supplement Program; the
Section 236 Interest Reduction Program; the Rental Assistance Program; the Section 8 Loan Management Set-Aside
Program; the Section 8 Property Disposition Set-Aside Program; the Section 515/8 Farmers Home Administration Program;
and the Section 8 New Construction and Substantial Rehabilitation Program. 



Chapter 2 of the Handbook entitled ``Eligibility for Assistance; Eligibility for Admission, Marketing and Tenant
Selection'' addresses, among other things, the eligibility of elderly persons and persons with disabilities for
multifamily housing subsidized under the covered programs. Members of the public, including groups representing
persons with disabilities, have raised certain ``nondiscrimination'' issues with respect to those portions of
Sections 2-1 through 2-19 of Chapter 2 of the Handbook which relate to the identification of projects or
portions of projects that are for the exclusive use of elderly persons under the following programs: Sections 221(d)
(3) and (4), Section 231, and Section 236. 

To clarify the Department's position on these issues, the Department has revised Sections 2-1 through 2-19
of the Handbook. The Department believes that the revisions made to these sections provide clear and consistent direction
to housing providers and to the HUD Field Offices on the nondiscrimination issues raised by members of the public.


Because of the broad interest among housing managers, owners, residents, and other members of the public in the subject
matter addressed by Chapter 2, and to ensure wide dissemination of the Department's position on these issues, the
Department is taking the unusual step of publishing in the 

Federal Register

 its notice to the Field Offices on the revisions made to Chapter 2. The notice is attached as Appendix A to this document.


In publishing this notice, the Department also clarifies that Chapter 2 of the Handbook, and the revisions made to
Chapter 2, do not implement Subtitle D of Title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. Subtitle D addresses
the subject of ``Authority to Provide Preferences for Elderly Residents and Units for Disabled Residents in Certain
Section 8 Assisted Housing.'' The Department will be issuing an interim rule on Subtitle D of Title VI. 

Chapter 2 will remain in effect, as revised by the accompanying notice, pending the effective date of interim regulations
for Subtitle D. When interim regulations for Subtitle D have been issued, the Department intends to review Chapter
2 and to make any further revisions as may be appropriate.

Subject: Elderly Persons and Persons with Disabilities in Assisted Housing_Population Mix

 


Revisions to Chapter 2 of Handbook 4350.3, Chg-24, Occupancy Requirements of Subsidized Multifamily Housing
Programs, were issued by the Office of Housing on January 19, 1993. Sections 
2-1 through 2-19 of the Chapter have been questioned by a number of groups representing interested parties
on several grounds, including that the potential exclusion of persons with dis- abilities could violate the Fair
Housing Act and section 504 
of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act. The questioned sections of the Handbook relate to the identification of projects
or portions 
of projects for the exclusive use of elderly persons under the Sections 221(d) (3) and (4), 231 and 236 programs. 

Handbook guidance is necessary to insure clear and consistent direction to housing providers and to the Field, 
and the withdrawal of sections 2-1 through 2-19 of Chapter 2 could create further inconsistencies, confusion,
and a greater likelihood of discrimination. The Department, therefore, has determined that Chapter 2, sections
2-1 through 2-19 would 
remain in effect, as modified by this Notice, pending issuance 
of regulations implementing subtitle D of Title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. These changes
do not involve provisions of the handbook related to the Section 202 program. When the regulations implementing subtitle
D of Title VI are issued, the Department intends to review Chapter 2, making revisions where appropriate. 

In the interim, until handbook revisions consistent with this Notice are published, the Office of Housing and the
Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FH&EO) are issuing this Notice which provides the following clarifications
of Chapter 2: 

 It was not the intent of Chapter 2 to require owners of projects with units covered by the Sections 221, 231 and
236 programs to identify their projects or portions of their projects as exclusively elderly. Therefore, the deadline
for project identification (next application for a rent increase or June 1994, at the latest), as indicated in Figure
2-1, page 2-9, paragraph 3, is hereby deleted. Owners who have not already designated their project as
elderly (age 62 or over) housing may choose to identify the project as elderly housing at any time in the future (e.g.,
after publication of regulations implementing subtitle D of Title VI). 

 If an owner identifies the project as described in paragraph 2 of Figure 2.1 of Chapter 2, he or she is reminded
that the burden of proof supporting the identification of a project or portion of a project as elderly-only housing
remains with them, and they may be required to document that proof to HUD and/or another party at some future time. 

 The number of units which are constructed to be accessible to people with physical disabilities is not intended
to dictate any standard or cap on the number of units serving persons with disabilities. In addition, references to
the term ``mobility impaired'' are being deleted from Chapter 2; wherever that term was used, it should be replaced
by ``tenants needing the accessibility features of the units.'' 

 In Handbook 4350.3, Chg-24, Occupancy Requirements of Subsidized Multifamily Housing Programs, Chapter
2, Figure 2-1, page 2-8:

 


_Remove the text of the second Note, which reads: ``In some elderly projects, a percentage of the units have been designed
for households whose heads or spouse have mobility impairments, regardless of age. See paragraph 2-8c.'' 
_Replace that language with the second paragraph of the ``Note'' under Item No. 3, on page 2-9, which begins:
``Housing must be both designed and operated for the elderly.* * *''

 


These paragraphs were incorrectly placed when Chapter 2 was printed, and this change merely corrects that 
error. 

Project owners are also reminded that Chapter 2 includes 
the requirement to make reasonable accommodations to individuals with disabilities and other Civil Rights requirements
in addition to requirements under the National Housing Act.

<DOCTITLE>Intent To Prepare Resource Management Plan Amendment; Farmington District, NM</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bureau of Land Management, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent and invitation to participate in a plan amendment/environmental assessment to address the impacts
of implementing restrictions on off highway vehicle travel in the BLM's Farmington District, New Mexico.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The BLM will prepare a RMP plan amendment/environmental assessment for the purpose of addressing the impacts related
to imposing travel restrictions on off highway vehicle travel in the Farmington District. The travel restrictions
will apply to the entire Farmington District which occupies approximately three million acres of mixed land status
in the northwest quadrant of New Mexico. Within this area there are about 1.5 million acres of public land with significant
amounts of private, indian allotted, Navajo Tribal trust, state of New Mexico and lands withdrawn for the exclusive
use of Navajo Indians under Public Land Order 2198 and 1483.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Description of Proposed Planning Action: the proposed action is to amend the existing Farmington Resource Management
Plan for the purpose of implementing off highway vehicle travel restrictions on public lands within the Farmington
District.


Type of Issues Anticipated


1. The ability of industry personnel to conveniently and cost effectively access oil and gas wells may be impacted
due to the obliteration of some duplicate roads.
2. Enforcement of area limitations and road closures through installation of signs may be very difficult.
3. If benefits are expected to accrue to big game animals couldn't this be accomplished through means other than limiting
vehicle travel.
4. Visual resources have already been significantly altered in the Farmington District as a result of energy development.
Is it reasonable to assume that additional, similar development will have any more of a negative impact?
5. Off road vehicle enthusiasts may object to increasing the limited designation acreage.
6. How many miles of road will need to be closed by ripping and seeding, signing or gating?
7. Some people may object to the limited designation due to its impact on their ability to travel off road by vehicle
in search of firewood, pinyon nuts and livestock.
Criteria to Guide Development of the Planning Action: The planning criteria were identified to help guide the resolution
of the issues.


Non-Discretionary Criteria


1. The proposed action must comply with laws, executive orders and regulations.
2. The proposed action must be reasonable and achievable with available technology.


Discretionary Criteria


1. Evaluate and consider long term benefits to the public in relation to short term benefits.
As new information becomes available during the planning process or through public participation, additional criteria
may be developed for future guidance of this planning effort.
The Disciplines to be Represented on the Interdisciplinary Team: The planning amendment/environmental assessment
will be prepared by an interdisciplinary team consisting of a wildlife biologist, rangeland management specialist,
geologist, recreation planner, surface protection specialist and an environmental coordinator. A habitat management
specialist and a conservation officer with the New Mexico Department of Game & Fish will also be on the team to provide
additional wildlife input.


The Kind and Extent of Public Participation Activities To Be Provided


A press release will be sent to the local newspapers informing them of the proposed planning action.
Two public meetings will also be held to inform the public of the proposed action and solicit comments.


The Location and Availability of Documents Relevant to the Planning Process


Pertinent information is available at the BLM Office at 1235 Laplata Highway, Farmington, New Mexico 87401 and is
subject to public review on weekdays from 7:45 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.

<DOCTITLE>Availability of an Environmental Assessment and Receipt of an Application for a Permit To Allow Incidental Take of
the Endangered Stephens' Kangaroo Rat by John Laing Homes, Inc., Laguna Hills, CA</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice advises the public that John Laing Homes, Inc. (Applicant) has applied to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
(Service) for an incidental take permit pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as
amended (Act). The application has been assigned permit number PRT-788945. The requested permit would authorize
the incidental take of the endangered Stephens' kangaroo rat (

Dipodomys stephensi

) in the city of Corona, Riverside County, California. The proposed incidental take would occur as a result of grading
and construction activities in Stephens' kangaroo rat occupied habitat for a residential development (Tract 22579).



The Service also announces the availability of an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the proposed issuance of the
incidental take permit. This notice is provided pursuant to section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy
Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6).





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



Under section 9 of the Act, ``taking'' of Stephens' kangaroo rats, an endangered species, is prohibited. However,
the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered wildlife species if such taking is
incidental to, and not the purpose of, otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for endangered
species are in 50 CFR 17.22.

The Applicant proposes to implement a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) for the Stephens' kangaroo rat that will allow
clearing, grading and construction of a residential development (Tract 22579), in the city of Corona, Riverside
County, California. The permit would authorize the destruction of up to 10.4 acres of occupied Stephens' kangaroo
rat habitat, which is estimated to include approximately 15 Stephens' kangaroo rats. The permit would be in effect
for five years. The application includes an HCP and Implementation Agreement.

The Applicant proposes to mitigate for the incidental take prior to site disturbance by: (1) Acquiring 10.4 acres
of occupied Stephens' kangaroo rat habitat within a Stephens' kangaroo rat Study Area administered by the Riverside
County Habitat Conservation Agency (RCHCA) to be managed in perpetuity to benefit the Stephens' kangaroo rat; (2)
implementing this requirement by payment of $91,000 to the RCHCA for the habitat acquisition; (3) paying $9,100 to
the RCHCA for the long-term management of the acquired habitat; and (4) providing evidence confirming acquisition
of the habitat within 180 days of payment of the mitigation fee.

The EA considers the environmental consequences of five alternatives, including the proposed action and no-action
alternatives. The proposed action is the issuance of a permit under section 10(a) of the Act that would authorize removal
of 10.4 acres of Stephens' kangaroo rat habitat during the residential development. The proposed action would result
in minimizing incidental take by limitations on and monitoring of proposed construction activities. Mitigation
under proposed action would enhance Stephens' kangaroo rat conservation by the acquisition and management of 10.4
acres of occupied habitat to be managed for the Stephens' kangaroo rat. Under the no-action alternative, the project
would not occur and the permit would not be issued. The present habitat fragmentation and isolation due to off-road
vehicle use, surrounding development, and other on-site disturbances would remain under the no-action alternative,
and the Stephens' kangaroo rat population on the site likely would disappear in time. In addition, proposed funding
for acquisition of habitat within the RCHCA reserve areas would not be available. The third alternative is to completely
avoid occupied habitat on the project site. A fourth alternative is to trap and relocate Stephens' kangaroo rats as
a means of avoiding the killing or serious injury of the animals. The fifth alternative is to obtain a take allocation
from the city of Corona as a co-permittee to the existing RCHCA section 10(a) incidental take permit and HCP.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement and to hold scoping meetings.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) proposes to revise a draft environmental impact statement
(EIS) which analyzed the environmental impacts of the alternatives for rulemakings that would (1) define the term
Valid Existing Rights (VER), and (2) determine the degree, if any, to which subsidence resulting from underground
coal mining is subject to the prohibitions of section 522(e) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 2977
(SMCRA). OSM invites comments on the scope of the analysis and will hold scoping meetings upon request. OSM would like
to emphasize, however, the comments received on the previous draft EIS are being considered and need not be re-submitted.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

OSM proposes to revise the draft EIS that was made available to the public on April 19, 1991 (56 FR 16102). The draft EIS
analyzed the environmental impacts of the alternatives for a rulemaking that would (1) define the term VER, and (2)
determine the degree, if any, to which subsidence resulting from underground coal mining is subject to the prohibitions
of section 522(e) of SMCRA.



OSM had decided to issue a revised draft for two reasons. First, prior to the close of the comment period on the April
1991 draft EIS, OSM published a notice (56 FR 33170, July 18, 1991), which informed the pubic that, in response to an
inquiry from OSM, the Department of the Interior's Office of the Solicitor had recently revised the issue of whether
the prohibitions of section 522(e) of SMCRA apply to subsidence resulting from underground coal mining, and issue
a Memorandum Opinion (M-36971, July 10, 1991). The Solicitor's Memorandum Opinion concluded that the best
interpretation of SMCRA is that subsidence is not a surface coal mining operation subject to the prohibitions of section
522(e). The July 18, 1991 

Federal Register

 notice also stated that OSM had determined that existing regulations were consistent with the position and, therefore,
no further rulemaking on the issue was necessary. In an August 1, 1991 notice (56 FR 36843), extending the comment period
on the draft EIS, OSM informed the public that commenters should be aware that since the issuance of the draft EIS, the
issue of whether and to what degree subsidence is covered by the mining prohibitions set forth in section 522(e) of
SMCRA, had been resolved as a result of the Solicitor's Opinion and the July 18 1991 

Federal Register

 notice.

In September 1991, a lawsuit was filed against the Secretary, challenging the July 18, 1991 

Federal Register

 notice. On September 22, 1993, in 

National Wildlife Federation

 v. 

Babbitt,

 No. 91-2275, (D.D.C.), the court held that OSM's July 18, 1991 

Federal Register

 notice concerning the applicability of section 522(e) to subsidence was a legislative rule issued in violation of
the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The court remanded the matter to the Secretary for rulemaking in accordance
with the requirements of the APA. The court also noted for the record that OSM must either prepare an EIS or state on the
record the reasons why an EIS had not bee prepared.

OSM also intends to publish a new proposed rule defining VER.

Since both the VER rule and the rule on the applicability of 522(e) to subsidence relate to the scope of the prohibitions
of 522(e), and both rules have been previously addressed in a combined draft EIS on two occasions, OSM again intends
to issue a revised draft EIS addressing both rules.
The second reason for a revised draft EIS is that it will have the benefit of the many comments that were submitted on
the April 1991 draft EIS.


Previous Scoping Activity


OSM published a notice of intent to conduct rulemaking on the applicability of the prohibitions in section 522(e)
(4) and (5) to subsidence resulting from underground mining on April 3, 1985 (50 FR 13250). Subsequently, OSM published
a notice of intent to prepare an EIS to analyze the environmental impacts of the rulemaking on subsidence, as required
by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), on June 19, 1985 (50 FR 25473). Scoping meetings were then held in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on August 1, 1985; in St. Louis, Missouri, on August 6, 1985; and in Washington, DC, on August
9, 1985. OSM received written comments during that period also.
Based on the comments received, OSM decided to combine the environmental analysis of a rulemaking on VER with the analysis
of the rulemaking on subsidence. On January 22, 1987 (52 FR 2421), OSM published a notice of intent to (1) prepare an
EIS on those rulemakings, and (2) hold a scoping meeting to address public comments on February 6, 1987, in Washington,
DC. The public meeting was held to receive comments from interested persons on the specific alternatives evaluated
in the EIS and on the scope and significance of the issues to be analyzed. Federal agencies whose lands would be affected
also were invited to discuss data problems. Upon request, OSM held a second meeting on February 23, 1987, to hear comments
from environmental groups unable to attend the February 6, 1987 meeting. Again, OSM received written comments.
All written comments submitted as part of scoping for the EIS, as well as all testimony presented at the public meetings
on the EIS, were considered in the preparation of that draft EIS, which was published concurrently with a proposed
rule addressing both VER and subsidence on December 27, 1988. However, on July 21, 1989 (54 FR 30557), OSM withdrew
the proposed rule.
Subsequently, OSM made a decision to consider the VER rulemaking and the rulemaking on the applicability of section
522(e) to subsidence separately. At the same time, OSM decided to continue to include analysis of both rulemakings
in the same EIS due to the interrelated nature of their effects, and the draft EIS, entitled OSM-EIS-29,
was issued on April 19, 1991. The comment period on the draft EIS closed on October 16, 1991.
As a result of prior scoping meetings and the publication of the draft EIS, OSM has received numerous comments on both
the scope of the analysis and the alternatives considered in the draft EIS. However, the public is again invited to
submit comments on the scope of the analysis, the assumptions and scope of data relating to the analysis, and the issues
and alternatives to be analyzed in the revised draft EIS. OSM would like to emphasize that comments received on the
previous draft EIS are being considered and need not be re-submitted. OSM staff will be available to meet with interested
persons upon request to discuss the scope of the revised draft EIS. Since the meetings will be informal, OSM will not
be using a court reporter and would appreciate receiving, if possible, a written copy of the comments they intend to
present at the meeting.


Alternatives Considered


The alternatives considered in the April 1991 draft EIS are listed below. It is possible that the number of alternatives
actually considered in the revised draft EIS may be revised as a result of comments received during scoping, analysis
of comments received on previous drafts, further legal analysis, or further analysis by the Department. The public
is invited to submit any other alternatives that it believes are reasonable and should be considered.


VER Alternatives


For the definition of VER, the four alternatives considered were:


1. No Action


No Action means that OSM would not promulgate a rule defining VER and that OSM would continue to make VER determinations
consistent with existing law.


2. Good Faith All Permits Standard


The good faith all permits Standard (GFAP) would require any person seeking confirmation of VER to show that he had
made a good faith effort to obtain all permits before August 3, 1977, or before the date the land in question became subject
to the prohibitions of section 522(e). It is anticipated that few persons would be able to meet this test for determining
VER.


3. GFAP or Takings Standard


Under this alternative, VER would be found to exist if the person can demonstrate that he had made a good faith effort
to obtain all permits before August 3, 1977 (or before the date the land became subject to the prohibitions of section
522(e)), or if denial of VER would be projected to result in a compensable taking of property.


4. Ownership and Authority Standard


Under the Ownership and Authority (O&A) standard for VER, the person claiming VER for a surface coal mining operation
would have to demonstrate ownership of the coal and the authority to extract the coal by the method intended, as determined
by the laws of the State in which the property is located.


Subsidence Alternatives


There were five alternatives in the draft EIS for determining the degree, if any, to which subsidence resulting from
underground coal mining is subject to the prohibitions of section 522(e) of SMCRA. Because the Solicitor's Memorandum
Opinion M-36971 advised that the best reading of SMCRA is that the prohibitions of section 522(e) do not apply
to subsidence resulting from underground coal mining, OSM is considering this opinion and will consult further with
the Solicitor on this issue. OSM anticipates including in the revised draft EIS the five alternatives which were analyzed
in the April 1991 draft EIS.

<PARENT> FR940428-2-00044 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

OSM intends to ensure that, whatever rule is proposed and adopted, the impacts of that alternative will already have
been analyzed. Therefore, it would not be necessary to again undertake the time consuming and expensive task of preparing
another EIS. The alternatives in the April 1991 draft EIS were.



1. No Action




Under this alternative, OSM would not promulgate new rules to clarify whether subsidence is subject to the prohibitions
of section 522(e). The determination of the applicability of the prohibitions to subsidence would continue to be
made by OSM and the States pursuant to the applicable approved regulatory programs.



2. No Mining Standard




Underground extraction would be considered subject to the prohibitions of section 522(e). Because virtually all
underground mining may eventually result in subsidence, all underground extraction would be prohibited within
the 522(e) areas. Depending on the angle of draw and depth of seam characteristics, some extraction of coal outside
the protected areas might also be prohibited if it would be expected to cause subsidence within the protected areas.



3. No Subsidence Standard




Subsidence would be considered prohibited by section 522(e). Mining operations that would be expected to cause subsidence
within the section 522(e) areas in the reasonably foreseeable future would be subject to the prohibitions of section
522(e).



4. No Material Damage Standard




Subsidence that would be expected to cause material damage would be considered subject to the prohibitions of section
522(e). Unless an operator can demonstrate that underground mining would not reasonably be expected to result in
subsidence that causes material damage such as functional impairment to protected surface features, structures,
or facilities, underground mining would be prohibited in the section 522(e) areas.



5. Prohibitions Do Not Apply Standard




Subsidence would not be considered subject to the prohibitions of section 522(e). Restrictions set forth in section
515 of SMCRA and the implementing regulations in 30 CFR part 817 would still apply. Surface activities and facilities
related to underground coal mining would continue to be prohibited in the 522(e) areas.




Considerations




The proposed Federal actions would be programmatic national rulemaking that would clarify the meaning of statutory
prohibitions, but would neither allow nor prohibit mining in any site-specific case. Therefore, the analysis in
the revised draft EIS will be programmatic in nature rather than site-specific. OSM anticipates including a generic
discussion of the impacts that could be expected to result from various types of surface and underground coal mining
activities should they occur in each of the protected areas, 522(e)(1)-(5).

<DOCTITLE>Lodging of Partial Consent Decrees Pursuant to the Clean Air Act</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with Departmental policy, 28 CFR 50.7, notice is hereby given that a proposed partial consent decree
in 

United States 

v. 

New York City Board of Education, et al.,

 Civil Action No. 89-0856, was lodged on April 14, 1994 with the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of New York. Defendant New York City Board of Education (New York) owns and operates schools in the New York City metropolitan
area. New York contracted with Defendants Hollywood Commercial Renewals, Inc. (Hollywood) and A. Grgas Contracting,
Inc. (Grgas) to undertake renovation activities at schools in New York City. Hollywood and Grgas engaged in these
renovation activities but neither they nor New York notified the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of these
activities, in violation of the Clean Air Act (Act) and the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants
(NESHAPS) for asbestos. Under the terms of the proposed partial consent decree, Hollywood and Grgas will pay civil
penalties in the amounts of $3,500 and $1,500, respectively and agree to be enjoined from further violations of the
Act and the NESHAPS. 

The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, comments
relating to the proposed consent decree. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General for the Environment
and Natural Resources Division, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530, and should refer to

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Biweekly Notice; Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses Involving no Significant Hazards
Considerations </DOCTITLE>



I. Background 



Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended
(the Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new
provision of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately
effective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves
no significant hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing
from any person. 

This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from April 2, 1994, through
April 15, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on April 13, 1994 (59 FR 17591). 



Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed no Significant Hazards Consideration
Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing 



The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to room P-223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. 

By May 27, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: 

(1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; 

(2) The nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and 

(3) The possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition
should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes
to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend
the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled
in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. 

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 

If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to (Project Director): Petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition
was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee.

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified
in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection
at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the
local public document room for the particular facility involved.

Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Unit Nos. 1, 2, and 3, Maricopa County, Arizona 





Date of Amendment Requests:

 January 4, 1994. 



Description of Amendment Requests: 

The proposed amendment would change Technical Specification 3/4.2.3 Azimuthal Power Tilt and its associated bases.
The licensee proposed to change the Azimuthal Power Tilt limit from less than or equal to 10 percent to less than or equal
to 3 percent when the Core Operating Limit Supervisory System is out of service. 



Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensees have provided their analysis about the issue of no significant hazards
consideration, which is presented below:






Standard 1

_Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

Decreasing the COLSS [Core Operating Limit Supervisory System] out-of service Azimuthal Power Tilt Technical Specification
limit does not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The Technical Specification
operating limit is being conservatively reduced to conform to the assumptions used in the safety analysis. The reduced
operating limit requires a more uniform power distribution in the reactor core. The uniform power distribution may
reduce the consequences of an accident previously evaluated by not allowing regions in the core to operate at higher
power levels. 



Standard 2

_Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. 

The proposed amendment will result in an alarm setpoint change, but does not involve any equipment changes and will
not alter the manner in which the plant will be operated. For this reason, this amendment will not create the possibility
of an new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. The proposed operating range is smaller and
completely within the existing Technical Specification limits; thus, there are no mechanisms to create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated. 



Standard 3

_Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

The proposed amendment conservatively reduces the COLSS out-of-service Azimuthal Power Tilt Technical Specification
limit, thereby increasing the margin of safety. The proposed operating range is smaller and completely bounded by
the existing Technical Specification limits.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensees' analysis and, based on that review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant
hazards consideration.

Carolina Power & Light Company, et al., Docket No. 50-400, Shearon Harris 
Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, Wake and Chatham Counties, North Carolina 





Date of Amendment Request: 

March 25, 1994.



Description of Amendment Request: 

The amendment would revise Technical Specification 3/4.8.4.2, Motor Operated Valves Thermal Overload Protection,
with a more accurate description of the motor-operated valve (MOV) bypass configuration. 



Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 

This change is administrative in nature, providing a more accurate description of the MOV electrical supply configuration
related to the thermal overload bypass function. Therefore, the change in terminology would not increase the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 

The proposed change does not involve any modifications or additions to plant equipment and the design and operation
of the plant will not be affected. Therefore, the change in MOV thermal overload bypass function terminology would
not increase the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 

3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 

The proposed terminology change does not affect any parameters which relate to the margin of safety as defined in the
Technical Specifications or in the FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report]. Therefore, the proposed change does not
involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

and 2, Will County, Illinois 




Date of Application for Amendments: 

March 7, 1994, as supplemented on March 24, 1994. 


Description of Amendment Requests: 

The proposed amendment would change Technical Specification 4.6.1.2 by removing the specific schedules for 
containment integrated leak rate testing (CILRT) and specifying that the 
testing will be done in accordance with Appendix J to 10 CFR part 50. 


Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

 

A. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the 
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
The proposed change will allow flexibility in the scheduling for 
Type A tests in the 10-year service period while still meeting 
the requirements in 10 CFR 50 Appendix J. Additional flexibility 
is needed for plants using an 18-month fuel cycle to allow 
refueling outages and 10-year inservice testing intervals to 
coincide. For performance of the third Type A test at Byron, the 
change would allow an extension of four (4) months beyond the 
current maximum 50-month surveillance interval. The third test 
would be completed at the fifty-four (54) month interval for 
Byron Units 1 and 2. 
For Braidwood Units 1 and 2, an extension on the surveillance 
time interval will not be necessary to satisfy the requirements 
of Appendix J. The Braidwood Units have scheduled the third Type 
A test to be conducted with the 10-year Inservice Inspection. 
The results of the previous Type A leak tests show the overall 
leakage from the Byron containment buildings at very low levels. 
The extension of the Type A test by four months would not cause 
the consequences of a previously evaluated accident to increase. 
By continuing to conform to the requirements of 10 CFR 50 
Appendix J, the test frequency, methodology, and acceptance 
criteria for containment leakage remains the same. Therefore, 
there is no significant increase in the probability or the 
consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
B. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously 
evaluated. 
The proposed changes do not affect the design or operation of any 
system, structure or component in the plant. There are no 
changes to parameters governing plant operation and no new or 
different type of equipment will be installed. No new accident 
scenarios are created by the proposed change because the test 
frequency continues to meet the requirements of Appendix J of 10 
CFR part 50. There is no affect on containment structure, the 
penetrations, or the facility. The proposed change to the test 
schedule only provides flexibility in meeting the same 
requirement for three tests in a 10-year period. The testing 
method and bases have not changed. Therefore, operation of the 
units with this more flexible test schedule will not result in an 
accident previously not analyzed in the Updated Final Safety 
Analysis Report (UFSAR). The proposed changes do not impact the 
design bases of the containment and do not modify the response of 
the containment during a design basis accident. Therefore, the 
changes do not create the possibility of a new or different type 
of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
C. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety. 
The proposed changes do not affect the margin of safety for any 
Technical Specifications. The initial conditions and 
methodologies used in the accident analyses remain unchanged, 
therefore, the results of the accident analyses are not impacted. 
The proposed change to the schedule allows for additional 
flexibility in meeting the requirement for three tests in a 10-year period. Elimination of the specified time interval
for Type 
A testing would allow Byron Units 1 and 2 to extend the 
surveillance requirement of the third Type A test by four (4) 
months. This would exceed the existing maximum 50 month interval 
currently specified in Technical Specifications. The extension 
will allow performance of the Type A test to coincide with the 
seventh refueling outage, 10 year Inservice Inspection, and 
continue to meet the requirements of Appendix J to 10 CFR part 50. 
These proposed changes do not affect or change any limiting 
conditions for operation (LCO), or any other surveillance 
requirements in the Technical Specifications. 
The results of the previous Type A leak tests have shown that the 
overall leakage rates from the Byron containment buildings were 
at low levels. The latest test results for Units 1 and 2 were 
0.0175 weight percent per day and 0.0376 weight percent per day, 
respectively. The overall containment leakage rates have 
consistently remained well below the acceptance criteria for 
Byron Station Type A tests of 0.075 weight percent per day. The 
testing method, acceptance criteria, and bases for the 
surveillance requirement will not be changed by the proposed 
amendment. 
The present test performance margins, coupled with the Type B & C 
test program for monitoring and repairing individual leakage 
components provides justification for the proposed change. The 
Type B & C tests provide added assurance that the overall 
containment integrated leakage rates remain satisfactory. No 
significant leakage trends have been identified which threaten 
the overall containment leakage specifications. 
In summary, Commonwealth Edison concludes that this change does 
not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because 
the containment integritiy will be maintained. Testing in 
accordance with Appendix J requirements ensures confidence is 
containment intergity. The proposed Technical Specifications 
amendment will continue to require testing that is consistent 
with Appendix J requirements. Additionally, results from 
previous tests have shown acceptable low overall containment 
leakage rates. Extension of Type A testing for four months would 
not involve a signficant reduction in a margin of safety.

 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

 on July 8, 1992 (57 FR 30242), which changed the Technical Specifications  1.0, Definitions, to accommodate
a 24-month fuel cycle and which proposed the extension of the test intervals for specific surveillance tests. This
amendment proposes extending the surveillance intervals to 24 months for the following additional surveillance
tests:

 

(1) Analog Rod Position Indication. 
(2) Plant Noble Gas Activity Monitor (R-44). 
(3) Low Turbine Auto Stop Oil Pressure Reactor Trip. 
(4) 6.9 KV Undervoltage Relays. 
(5) Boric Acid Tank Level. 
(6) Vapor Containment Sump Discharge Flow and Temperature Channel. 
(7) Loss of Power Undervoltage and Degraded Voltage Relays. 
(8) Over-pressurization Protection System (OPS) and Control Rod 
Protection System (for use with Low Parasite [LOPAR] fuel) Trip. 
(9) Condenser Evacuation System Activity Monitor (R-45). 
(10) Service Water Inlet Temperature Monitoring Instrumentation. 
(11) Sampler Flow Rate Monitors. 
(12) Boric Acid Makeup Flow System. 
(13) Plant Vent Noble Gas Effluent Monitor (R-27).

 

The amendment also proposes to change the surveillance interval for 
the Refueling Water Storage Tank Level to quarterly and to change the trip 
setpoint for the Control Rod Protection System. The changes requested by 
the licensee are in accordance with Generic Letter 91-04, ``Changes in 
Technical Specification Surveillance Intervals to Accommodate a 24-Month 
Fuel Cycle.'' 


Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

 

[(1) Analog Rod Position Indication:] 
The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards 
consideration since: 
1. A significant increase in the probability or consequences of an 
accident previously evaluated will not occur. 
It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the 
analog rod position indication channel be changed from every 18 
months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). 
A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month 
operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis it 
has been concluded that none of the major error contributors are 
time dependent and that it can be reasonably expected that the 
channel will remain within calibration tolerance over a possible 
30 month operating cycle. In addition, the rod bottom bistable 
is subject to monthly testing which would detect any 
abnormalities in an extended operating cycle. Due to this 
monthly test and the acceptable past test history, it is 
concluded that the channel will continue to operate within 
tolerance over an extended operating cycle and will not 
contribute to a significant increase in the probability or 
consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any 
accident previously evaluated has not been created. 
The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased 
surveillance interval is not expected to affect the ability of 
the instrument channel to remain within calibration tolerance. 
Furthermore, the rod position indicator is used in normal 
operation only as an aid in control rod movement. Normally, very 
little control rod movement occurs during normal operation. 
Furthermore, it is not relied upon for accident prevention or 
accident mitigation. In accordance with existing Technical 
Specifications, normal operation can continue even if one channel 
is inoperable because alternate means (core instrumentation) 
exists to monitor rod position. The frequent monthly test tends 
to minimize the effect of a longer operating cycle for the rod 
position indication channel as any malfunction induced by time 
would be detected. Thus, it is concluded that the possibility of 
a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously 
evaluated has not been created. 
3. A significant reduction in a margin of safety is not involved. 
A statistical analysis of past calibration data has not 
identified any time dependent error contributors. Also, past 
test data indicates that the channel remains within calibration 
tolerance over the existing operating cycle. A longer operating 
cycle would increase the risk of drift, however accuracy is not a 
prime requirement for the RPI. Therefore, it is concluded that a 
longer operating cycle will not result in a significant reduction 
in a margin of safety. 
[(2) Plant Noble Gas Activity Monitor (R-44):] 
The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards 
consideration since: 
1. There is no significant increase in the probability or 
consequences of an accident. 
It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the 
Plant Noble Gas Activity Monitor (R-44) be changed from every 18 
months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). 
The function of R-44 is to respond to high activity levels during 
normal operation. 
The setpoint for R-44 is established sufficiently above the 
expected radioactivity level in the discharge stream to preclude 
false actions but sufficiently below the allowed discharge 
radioactivity concentration so that discharge in excess of 
permissible limits does not occur. Monitor readouts are not used 
for quantitative purposes, but are used to respond to relative 
changes in radioactivity concentration. 
There is limited data to support an unqualified extension of the 
surveillance interval. However, the instrument is checked for 
operability prior to release. Should the instrument be 
inoperable releases may continue provided grab sample analysis is 
performed. Since the monitor is subject to daily channel checks, 
monthly source checks, and quarterly functional channel tests, 
abnormal instrument behavior or inoperability would be detected 
permitting corrective actions during the extended surveillance 
interval. 
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any 
previously analyzed has not been created. 
Operability of the instrument is important rather than ability to 
maintain a specific setpoint. Operability of the instrument is 
verified prior to a planned discharge and this is independent of 
an extended surveillance cycle. 
3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.

<TEXT>
 

As the Technical Specifications permit pre-planned release even 
with an inoperable instrument, the margin of safety is not 
impacted by an extended surveillance interval provided that 
instrument operability is verified prior to release. This is 
also required by the Technical Specifications. 

[(3) Low Turbine Auto Stop Oil Pressure Reactor Trip:] 

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards 
consideration since: 

1. There is no significant increase in the probability or 
consequences of an accident. 
It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the Low 
Turbine Auto Stop Oil Pressure system be changed from every 18 
months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). 

No credit is taken for a reactor trip from a low turbine auto 
stop oil pressure signal resulting from a turbine trip. Rather, 
the safety analysis assumes this reactor trip does not occur 
during full load rejection until an overpower delta T condition 
causes a reactor trip. In addition, no credit is taken for this 
system for turbine missile protection. Therefore, extending the 
surveillance interval for this parameter has no impact upon the 
probability or consequences of an accident. 

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any 
previously analyzed has not been created. 

As no credit is taken in the safety analysis for this trip, the 
possibility of a new or different kind of accident has not been 
created by extending the surveillance interval. 

3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety. 

Past test results have not identified any failures. Therefore, 
pursuant to Generic Letter 91-04, it is reasonably expected that 
this system will continue to function in an acceptable manner 
over an extended operating cycle. 

[(4) 6.9 kv Undervoltage Relays:] 

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards 
consideration since: 

1. There is no significant increase in the probability or 
consequences of an accident. 

It is proposed that the calibration frequency for the 6.9 kv 
undervoltage channel be changed from every 18 months (+25%) to 
every 24 months (+25%). 

Quarterly testing of these relays is required by Technical 
Specifications. The data from the quarterly tests of the new 
relays will be used to assure that drift does not exceed 
projected values. The quarterly tests provide a means of 
maintaining calibration within specified values, virtually 
eliminating any impact upon safety from an extended operating 
cycle. 

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any 
previously analyzed has not been created. 

Because the quarterly tests assure that relay performance remains 
within specified limits, there is no possibility of creating a 
new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. 

3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety. 

The requirement for a channel functional test each quarter 
minimizes any potential impact upon safety due to an extended 
operating cycle. 

[(5) Boric Acid Tank Level:] 

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards 
consideration since: 

1. A significant increase in the probability or consequence of an 
accident previously evaluated will not occur. 

It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the 
Boric Acid Tank Level instrumentation be changed from every 18 
months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). 

A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month 
operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis it 
has been concluded that sufficient margin exists between the 
existing Technical Specification limit and the licensing basis 
Safety Analysis limit to accommodate the channel statistical 
error resulting from a 30 month operating cycle. The existing 
margin between the Technical Specification limit and the Safety 
Analysis limit provides assurance that plant protective actions 
will occur as required. It is therefore concluded that changing 
the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months 
(+25%) will not result in a significant increase in the 
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any 
accident previously evaluated has not been created. 

The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased 
surveillance interval will not result in a channel statistical 
allowance which exceeds the current margin between the existing 
Technical Specification limit and the Safety Analysis limit. 
Plant equipment, which will be set at (or more conservatively 
than) Technical Specification limits, will provide protective 
functions to assure that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. 
This will prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of 
accident from any previously evaluated from occurring. 

3. A significant reduction in a margin of safety is not involved. 

The above change in surveillance interval resulting from an 
increased operating cycle will not result in a channel 
statistical allowance which exceeds the margin which exists 
between the current Technical Specification limit and the 
licensing basis Safety Analysis limit. This margin, which is 
equivalent to the existing margin, is necessary to assure that 
protective safety functions will occur so that Safety Analysis 
limits are not exceeded. 

[(6) Vapor Containment Sump Discharge Flow and Temperature Channel:] 

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards 
consideration since: 

1. A significant increase in the probability or consequences of an 
accident previously evaluated will not occur. 

It is proposed that the calibration frequency for the VC sump 
discharge flow and temperature channel be changed from every 
18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). 

A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month 
operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis it 
has been concluded that sufficient margin exists between the 
existing Technical Specification and the licensing basis Safety 
Analysis to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting 
from a 30 month operating cycle. The existing margin between the 
Technical Specification and the Safety Analysis provides 
assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required. 
It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval 
from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not result in a 
significant increase in the probability or consequences of an 
accident previously evaluated. 

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any 
accident previously evaluated has not been created. 

The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased 
surveillance interval will not result in a channel statistical 
allowance which exceeds the current margin between the existing 
Technical Specification and the Safety Analysis. Plant 
equipment, which will be set at (or more conservatively than) 
Technical Specification limits, will provide protective functions 
to assure that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. This 
will prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of 
accident from any previously evaluated from occurring.

3. A significant reduction in a margin of safety is not involved. 

The above change in surveillance interval resulting from an 
increased operating cycle will not result in a channel 
statistical allowance which exceeds the margin which exists 
between the current Technical Specification and the licensing 
basis Safety Analysis. This margin, which is equivalent to the 
existing margin, is necessary to assure that protective safety 
functions will occur so that Safety Analysis limits are not 
exceeded. 

[(7) Loss of Power Undervoltage and Degraded Voltage Relays:] 

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards 
consideration since: 

1. There is no significant increase in the probability or 
consequences of an accident. 

The Technical Specifications specify that the Loss of Power 
(undervoltage and degraded voltage) relays be calibrated and 
tested at a refueling interval; that the undervoltage alarm be 
calibrated at a refueling interval, and that the undervoltage 
(station blackout) input to Auxiliary Feedwater be calibrated at 
refueling intervals. It is proposed that the surveillance 
frequency be revised from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%). 

All of the undervoltage and station blackout relays were found to 
be within specification at each of the refueling outage 
calibration periods. 

Since the old relays have been replaced with relays from a 
different manufacturer whose drift characteristics are expected 
to be superior, extending the surveillance interval by several 
months will not significantly increase the probability or 
consequences of an accident. 

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any 
previously analyzed has not been created. 

Past test results provide reasonable assurance that the relays 
will perform in an acceptable manner for an extended operating 
cycle. With the installation of the new relays, whose 
performance will surpass the old relays, it is concluded that the 
plant will perform within its design basis for an extended 
operating cycle. Therefore, the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not 
been created. 

3. There has been no significant reduction in the margin of safety. 

Since the new relays will surpass the performance of the old 
relays, there is reasonable assurance that a significant 
reduction in the margin of safety has not resulted from an 
extended operating cycle. 

[(8) Over-pressurization Protection System (OPS) and Control Rod 
Protection System (for use with Low Parasite (LOPAR) fuel) Trip:] 

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards 
consideration since: 

1. A significant increase in the probability or consequences of an 
accident previously evaluated will not occur. 

It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the 
Over-pressurization protection system and the LOPAR trip system 
be changed from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). 
This necessitates a change in the LOPAR Technical Specification 
trip setpoint from 350 
 F to 381 
 F. 

A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month 
operating cycle has been performed based upon historical test 
data. Based on this analysis, a change to the Technical 
Specifications is required. Sufficient margin exists between the 
Safety Analysis limit and the proposed Technical Specification 
limit to accommodate projected channel uncertainty over a 30 
month operating cycle. A statistical basis exists to assure that 
protective action will occur to prevent Safety Analysis limits 
from being exceeded. Thus, there will not be a significant 
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident 
previously evaluated. 

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously 
evaluated has not been created. 

Based upon a statistical analysis of past historical test data it 
has been demonstrated that reasonable assurance exists to 
conclude that Safety Analysis limits will not be exceeded over a 
30 month operating cycle. The proposed Technical Specification 
limits provide margin with respect to the Safety Analysis limits 
and confidence that appropriate plant protective response will be 
provided to prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of 
accident from that previously evaluated from being created. 

3. A significant reduction in a margin of safety is not involved. 

The proposed changes to the Technical Specification limits are 
being made to assure that the previously established margin 
remains the same between plant protective function set points and 
Safety Analysis limits. This margin is based upon an evaluation 
of past historical test data and analytical methods for 
projecting instrument channel uncertainty over a 30 month 
operating cycle. It is therefore concluded that the existing 
margin of safety has been preserved. 

[(9) Condenser Evacuation System Activity Monitor (R-45):] 

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards 
consideration since: 

1. There is no significant increase in the probability or 
consequences of an accident. 

It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the 
Condenser Evacuation System Noble Gas Activity Monitor (R-45) be 
changed from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). 

Since this radiation monitor is relatively new a degree of 
uncertainty is introduced by extending the surveillance interval 
by several months. However, the setpoint for automatic diversion 
is set some what conservatively. It is established sufficiently 
high to avoid spurious actuations and yet sufficiently low so 
that diversion and alarm can occur should a step increase in 
radioactivity level occur. Under these circumstances 
considerable departure from the setpoint can be accommodated and 
the monitor will still perform its intended safety function. 
Continued monitor operability is important and malfunction would 
be detected by monthly checks during the extended operating 
cycle. Thus, despite the introduction of a new monitor, the 
capability of R-45 to tolerate drift in addition to monthly 
operator checks, leads to the conclusion that an extended 
operating cycle will not result in a significant increase in the 
probability or consequences of an accident. 

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any 
previously analyzed has not been created. 

Monthly checks would identify abnormal operating characteristics, 
should the instrument fail to perform its intended function. In 
the event of tube rupture with a reactor coolant system 
radioactivity concentration corresponding to 1% defective fuel, 
the resultant site boundary dose would be within 10 CFR [part] 20 
limits should the monitor fail to perform its function (as 
discussed in FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report]). In addition, 
alternate means of alarms to indicate a tube rupture event are 
available. Thus, the possibility of a new or different kind of 
accident has not been created. 

3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety. 

Although this monitor is not necessary to mitigate releases below 
regulatory limits, it does provide the earliest of a steam 
generator tube leak. In this regard, continued instrument 
operation is important. Continued instrument operability would 
be verified by the monthly checks in an extended operating cycle.

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards 
consideration since: 
1. A significant increase in the probability or consequences of an 
accident previously evaluated will not occur. 
It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the 
Service Water Inlet Temperature Monitoring Instrumentation be 
changed from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). 
A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month 
operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis it 
has been concluded that sufficient margin exists between the 
existing Technical Specification and the licensing basis Safety 
Analysis to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting 
from a 30 month operating cycle. The existing margin between the 
Technical Specification and the Safety Analysis provides 
assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required. 
It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval 
from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not result in a 
significant increase in the probability or consequences of an 
accident previously evaluated. 
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any 
accident previously evaluated has not been created. 

The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased 
surveillance interval will not result in a channel statistical 
allowance which exceeds the current margin between the existing 
Technical Specification and the Safety Analysis. Plant 
equipment, which will be set at (or more conservatively than) 
Technical Specification limits, will provide protective functions 
to assure that Safety Analyses are not exceeded. This will 
prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of accident 
from any previously evaluated from occurring. 
3. A significant reduction in a margin of safety is not involved. 
The above change in surveillance interval resulting from an 
increased operating cycle will not result in a channel 
statistical allowance which exceeds the existing margin between 
the current Technical Specification and the licensing basis 
Safety Analysis. This margin, which is equivalent to the 
existing margin, is necessary to assure that the protective 
safety functions occur and that the Safety Analysis limits are 
not exceeded. 
[(11) Sampler Flow Rate Monitor:] 
1. There is no significant increase in the probability or 
consequences of an accident. 
It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the 
Sample Flow Rate Monitors be changed from every 18 months (+25%) 
to every 24 months (+25%). 
The flow rate monitors are used to estimate the total volume of 
air passed through filters. There is no setpoint or safety 
function served by these monitors. A high level of radioactivity 
in the discharge stream is detected by R-43 and/or R-44. 
Insofar as discharge via the unit vent is permissible with the 
monitors inoperable, extension of the surveillance interval will 
have no impact upon safety. 
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any 
previously analyzed has not been created. 
As the nuclear safety function is provided by other monitors in 
the event of high radioactivity levels in the discharge stream, 
extension of the surveillance interval will have no impact upon 
the creation of a new or different kind of accident. 
3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety. 
These flow monitors are utilized to determine the total air flow 
through filters for computational purposes. As adequate measures 
(other monitors) exist to prevent the possibility of discharging 
radioactivity in excess of applicable limits, there is virtually 
no impact upon safety incurred by extending the surveillance 
interval. 
[(12) Boric Acid Makeup Flow System:] 
The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards 
consideration since: 
1. A significant increase in the probability or consequences of an 
accident previously evaluated will not occur. 
It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the 
Boric Acid Makeup Flow System be revised from every 18 months 
(+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). A statistical analysis of 
channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle has been 
performed. Based upon this analysis it has been concluded that 
sufficient margin exists between the existing Technical 
Specification limit and the licensing basis Safety Analysis limit 
to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting from a 30 
month operating cycle. The existing margin between the Technical 
Specification limit and the Safety Analysis limit provides 
assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required. 
It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval 
from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not result in a 
significant increase in the probability or consequences of an 
accident previously evaluated.

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any 
accident previously evaluated has not been created. 

The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased 
surveillance interval will not result in a channel statistical 
allowance which exceeds the current margin between the existing 
Technical Specification limit and the Safety Analysis limit. 
Plant equipment, which will be set at (or more conservatively 
than) Technical Specification limits, will provide protective 
functions to assure that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. 
This will prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of 
accident from any previously evaluated from occurring. 

3. A significant reduction in a margin of safety is not involved. 
The above change in surveillance interval resulting from an 
increased operating cycle will not result in a channel 
statistical allowance which exceeds the margin which exists 
between the current Technical Specification limit and the 
licensing basis Safety Analysis limit. This margin, which is 
equivalent to the existing margin, is necessary to assure that 
protective safety functions will occur so that Safety Analysis 
limits are not exceeded. 

[(13) Plant Vent Noble Gas Effluent Monitor (R-27):] 

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards 
consideration since: 

1. There is no significant increase in the probability or 
consequences of an accident. 

It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the 
Plant Vent Noble Gas Effluent Monitor (R-27) be changed from 
every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). 

R-27 is a high range noble gas monitor intended for use after an 
accident to provide information about the magnitude of 
radioactive releases. It serves no purpose during normal 
operation. It provides no function to prevent or mitigate an 
accident but does provide a role in assessing the consequences of 
an accident. As the monitor is a high range monitor, an estimate 
of the magnitude of release rather than accuracy is important. 
Accordingly, continued operability of the instrument during an 
extended operating cycle is more important than the device 
exhibiting minimal drift characteristics. Malfunction of the 
instrument would be detected by the shift checks and functional 
tests performed during the extended operating cycle. 

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any 
previously analyzed has not been created. 

Since the monitor provides no preventive or mitigating action in 
the event of an accident, no new or different type of accident 
has been created by extending the operating cycle. In terms of 
post accident assessment capability, alternate means exist to 
assess offsite releases in the event of failure of this 
instrument. 

3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety. 

Since the instrument provides no safety function and alternate 
means exist for post accident assessment purposes, there will be 
no impact on safety due to an extended period between 
calibrations. 

[(14) Refueling Water Storage Tank Level:] 

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards 
consideration since: 

1. A significant increase in the probability or consequences of an 
accident previously evaluated will not occur. 

It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the 
RWST instrumentation be changed from every 18 months (+25%) to 
quarterly (once every 3 months). 

A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 3 month 
surveillance has been performed. Based upon this analysis it has 
been concluded that sufficient margin exists between the existing 
Technical Specification limit and the licensing basis Safety 
Analysis limit to accommodate the channel statistical error 
resulting from a 3 month quarterly surveillance. The existing 
margin between the Technical Specification limit and the Safety 
Analysis limit provides assurance that plant protective actions 
will occur as required. It is therefore concluded that changing 
the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to quarterly will 
not result in a significant increase in the probability or 
consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any 
accident previously evaluated has not been created. 

The proposed change in surveillance interval will result in a 
channel statistical allowance which provides the necessary margin 
between the existing Technical Specification limit and the Safety 
Analysis limit. Plant equipment, which will be set at (or more 
conservatively than) Technical Specification limits, will provide 
protective functions to assure that Safety Analysis limits are 
not exceeded. This will prevent the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any previously evaluated from 
occurring. 

3. A significant reduction in a margin of safety is not involved. 

The above change in surveillance interval will result in a 
channel statistical allowance which is necessary between the 
current Technical Specification limit and the licensing basis 
Safety Analysis limit. This margin is necessary to assure that 
protective safety functions will occur so that Safety Analysis 
limits are not exceeded.




 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. 
Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request 
involves no significant hazards consideration.

Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




Increase in Boron Concentration Limit for the Spent Fuel Storage Pool (Standby Makeup Pump Water Supply)



The required spent fuel storage pool minimum boron concentration was increased from 2000 ppm to 2175 ppm during Modes
1-3.

The proposed revision is conservative, and is required only to maintain consistency between the boron concentration
of the spent fuel storage pool and the boron concentration of the RWST [refueling water storage tank] during Modes
1-3 operation. Therefore, there will be no adverse impact upon the probability or consequences of any previously
analyzed accident.

Likewise, the proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident, since no new failure
modes are identified.

Finally, no negative impact upon any safety margin is created since the proposed change is conservative.



Increase in Boron Concentration Limits for the RCS and Refueling Canal in Mode 6



The increase in the required RCS and refueling canal minimum boron concentration was added only to maintain consistency
between the boron concentration of the RCS and refueling canal and the RWST in Mode 6.

The change in boron concentration limits for the RCS and refueling canal will not increase the probability of an accident
since no accident initiators are involved with this change. Since the change is conservative, the consequences of
an accident previously evaluated will not be increased. The increase in the boron concentration limit for the RCS
and refueling canal in Mode 6 adds further margin to the initial conditions assumed for the boron dilution accident
in the safety analysis. Therefore, the consequences of the boron dilution accident previously evaluated will not
be increased.

The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated will not be created since this
change is bounded by previously evaluated accidents and does not introduce any new failure modes.

This change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety since the analyses performed demonstrate
that the limits imposed meet all accident analysis and design basis requirements.



Addition of Two Reload Related Topical Reports



This change is administrative in nature and adds two previously approved topical reports to the list of methodologies
used to determine core operating limits. The change will have no impact upon either the probability or consequences
of a previously analyzed accident. The methodologies described in the topical reports have been previously reviewed
and approved by the NRC. Also, no new accident possibilities are created, since this is an administrative change.
Finally, no impact upon any safety margin is created, since the change is administrative in nature and the described
topical reports have received full NRC approval.



Correction of Errors in Nomenclature and Removal of Obsolete Footnotes



These changes are also administrative in nature and are intended to correct miscellaneous errors and obsolete references.
As such, the changes will have no impact upon either the probability or consequences of any previously analyzed accidents,
will not create the possibility of any new accident scenarios, and will not impact any safety margins.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

 March 23, 1994.



Description of Amendment Request:

 The proposed amendments would revise Technical Specification (TS) 6.9.2, ``Core Operating Limits Report,'' to
include a reference to a Duke Power Company (DPC) Topical Report describing an analytical method for determining
the core operating limits.

Specifically, the amendments would add: ``(4) DPC-NE-1004A, Nuclear Design Methodology Using CASMO-3/SIMULATE-3P,
November 1992,'' to TS 6.9.2.



Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination:

 The NRC staff reviewed Topical Report DPC-NE-1004A and concluded in a Safety Evaluation Report dated
November 23, 1992, that the described nuclear design methodology is acceptable for performing reload analyses for
the DPC B&W 177-assembly cores in the Oconee units. The addition of this approved nuclear design methodology
to those referenced in TS 6.9.2 provides an alternative method for determining core operating limits such that all
applicable limits (e.g., fuel thermal mechanical limits, core thermal hydraulic limits, ECCS limits, nuclear limits
such as shutdown margin, and transient and accident analysis limits) of the safety analysis are met. Therefore, the
proposed change to the TS (1) does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated, (2) does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident than previously evaluated,
and (3) does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

Duke Power Company (Duke) has made the determination that this amendment request involves a No Significant Hazards
Consideration by applying the standards established in 10 CFR 50.92. This ensures that operation of the facility
in accordance with the proposed amendment would not:




(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated:

Each accident analysis addressed within the Oconee Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) has been examined with respect
to this amendment request. The Technical Specifications will continue to require operation within the bounds of
the cycle-specific parameter limits. The cycle-specific parameter limits will be calculated using NRC approved
methodology. The proposed amendment is simply an administrative change to update the list of NRC approved methods
in Technical Specification 6.9.2. Therefore, the probability of any Design Basis Accident (DBA) is not affected
by this change, nor are the consequences of a DBA affected by this change. This is because the addition of an NRC approved
reference to Technical Specification 6.9.2 is not considered to be an initiator or contributor to any accident analysis
addressed in the Oconee FSAR.

(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any kind previously evaluated:

Operation of ONS [Oconee Nuclear Station] in accordance with these Technical Specifications will not create any
failure modes not bounded by previously evaluated accidents. Consequently, this change will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any kind of accident previously evaluated.

(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety:

The Technical Specifications will continue to require operation within the bounds of the cycle-specific parameter
limits. Duke will continue to calculate the cycle-specific parameter limits using NRC approved methodology. In
addition, each future reload will require a 10 CFR 50.59 safety review to ensure that operation of the unit within the
cycle-specific limits will not involve a reduction in a margin of safety. Therefore, no margins of safety are affected
by the addition of an NRC approved methodology to Technical Specification 6.9.2.




Based on the staff's analysis and its review of the licensee's analysis, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of Amendment Request:

 March 18, 1994.



Description of Amendment Request: 

The proposed amendments would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.3.3.6, Accident Monitoring Instrumentation,
TS 3/4.6.4.1, Hydrogen Monitors, and their associated bases to incorporate the technical substance of Specification
3.3.3 from NUREG-1431, Revision O (Standard Technical Specifications) for the Westinghouse Owners Group.



Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




1.The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. The proposed changes affect instrumentation that would be used to assess the condition of the plant during
and following an accident. As such, the changes can have no effect on the probability of any accident previously evaluated
since this instrumentation has no bearing on initiating events. The proposed changes will continue to ensure the
capability to monitor plant conditions during and following an accident by requiring redundancy or diversity and
timely corrective action in the event of inoperable instrumentation. Therefore, the proposed changes will not significantly
increase the consequences of any accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The proposed changes affect the operability and action requirements for the post accident monitoring
instrumentation system. Accordingly, the proposed changes do not involve any change to the configuration or method
of operation of any plant equipment, and no new failure modes have been defined for any plant system or component nor
has any new limiting failure been identified as a result of the proposed changes. Therefore, the proposed changes
do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety. The intent of the existing TS requirements is 
to ensure the capability to monitor the plant condition during 
and following an accident so that the operators will have the 
information necessary to monitor and evaluate the course of the 
event and take any necessary action. Under the proposed changes 
this capability will be maintained by ensuring redundancy or 
diversity and by requiring timely corrective action in the event 
of inoperable instrumentation. In addition, the proposed changes 
would avoid unnecessary plant shutdowns by specifying an 
appropriate level of action in response to inoperable 
instrumentation. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve 
a significant reduction in a margin of safety.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Generating Station, Ocean County, New Jersey 





Date of Amendment Request: 

April 6, 1994. 


Description of Amendment Request: 

The proposed amendment changes the 
Technical Specifications to eliminate the main steam line radiation 
monitor(s) (MSLRMs) reactor scram and isolation functions of the MSLRMs 
currently contained in Tables 3.1.-1 and 4.1-1 of the Technical 
Specifications and the associated Bases statements. This action follows 
the recommendations of the BWR Owners Group (BWROG) in their Safety 
Evaluation, NEDO-31400A, previously approved by the NRC Staff on May 15, 
1991 by letter to the BWROG. Following is a brief description of the 
proposed changes: 

Tech. Spec. 3.1, ``Protective Instrumentation'' Bases is revised to 
delete reference to the paragraph describing the Main Steam Line (MSL) 
radiation monitoring functions for indication of excessive fuel failure and 
initiation of a reactor scram and MSL isolation. 

Tech. Spec. Table 3.1.1., ``Protective Instrumentation Requirements - A. Reactor Scram Functions,'' is revised
to delete line Item No. 7 - ``High 
Radiation in Main Steam Line Tunnel.'' 

Tech. Spec. Table 3.1.1., ``Protective Instrumentation Requirements - B. Reactor Isolation Functions,'' is revised
to delete line Item No. 6 - ``High Radiation in Main Steam Line Tunnel.'' 

Tech. Spec. Table 3.1.1., ``Protective Instrumentation Requirements - L. Condenser Vacuum Pump Isolation Function,''
is revised to delete line 
Item No. 1 - ``High Radiation in Main Steam Line Tunnel.'' 

Tech. Spec. Table 4.1.1., ``Minimum Check, Calibration and Test 
Frequency For Protective Instrumentation,'' is revised to delete 
Instrumentation Channel No. 13 - ``High Radiation in Main Steam Line.'' 



Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:




1. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed 
amendment would not involve a significant increase in the 
probability of occurrence or the consequences of an accident 
previously evaluated. 

The objective of the MSLRMs is to provide early indication of 
gross fuel failure. The monitors provide an alarm function, and 
signals that lead to a scram function and [main steam isolation 
valve] MSIV isolation functions. The basis for the MSIV 
isolation on an MSL high radiation signal is to reduce the 
quantity of fission products transported from the reactor vessel 
to the condenser in the event of gross fuel failure. No [design 
basis accident] DBA takes credit for a reactor scram resulting 
from an MSL high radiation signal. 

The proposed change removes all trip functions of the MSLRMs. 
The only modification attendant to this change is the removal of 
contacts derived from the MSLRM logic to the reactor scram, 
reactor isolation and offgas system isolation initiation logic. 
This change does not affect the operation of any equipment having 
the potential to cause a [control rod drop accident] CRDA. 
Therefore, the probability of a CRDA is not increased or in any 
way affected by the proposed change. 

However, the CRDA analysis does take credit for MSIV isolation. 
As discussed above, assuming no MSIV isolation in the event of a 
CRDA, the offsite radiation doses will remain a small fraction of 
the 10 CFR part 100 Reactor Site Criteria. 

2. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed 
amendment would not create the possibility of a new or different 
kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 

The function of an MSLRM trip is to detect abnormal fission 
product release and isolate the steam lines, thereby stopping the 
transport of fission products from the reactor to the main 
condenser. No credit is taken for the reactor scram function due 
to the action of these monitors on high radiation in the MSLs in 
any design basis accident. Removing the MSLRMs MSL isolation 
trip and its subsequent reactor scram will not affect the 
operation of other equipment or systems necessary for the 
prevention or mitigation of accidents. 

3. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed 
amendment would not involve a significant reduction in a margin 
of safety. 

Eliminating the MSLRM trip functions as analyzed in NEDO-31400A 
will result in a potential increase in the margin of safety 
because of: 

a. Improvement in the availability of the main condenser for 
decay heat removal; and, 

b. Elimination of inadvertent reactor scrams and challenges to 
safety systems. 

Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the 
proposed changes will not result in a reduction of safety margin.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Indiana Michigan Power Company, Docket No. 50-316, Donald C. Cook Nuclear 
Plant, Unit No. 2, Berrien County, Michigan 





Date of Amendment Request: 

March 9, 1994 



Description of Amendment Request: 

The proposed amendment would modify the Technical Specification to allow a one time exemption from certain Appendix
J testing. This exemption would extend the interval for Type B and C 
testing until the Unit 2 refueling outage currently scheduled for August 
1994. 



Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




As stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c), a proposed change does not involve a 
significant hazards consideration if the change does not (1) involve a 
significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident 
previously evaluated, or (2) the change does not create the 
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident 
previously evaluated, or (3) the change does not involve a significant 
reduction in a margin of safety. 



Criterion 1 



The limiting conditions for operation involving containment integrity 
are not altered by this proposed change. The surveillance requirement 
concerning the Type B and C leak rate test is slightly relaxed by the 
proposed change. The function of the components affected by this 
surveillance are to ensure containment integrity. Delaying the 
surveillance approximately two months would not change the probability 
of an accident. Our significant improvement in Type B and C leak rate 
test results, low anticipated leak rate for the next surveillance, 
aggressive corrective actions taken, and excellent ILRT [integrated 
leak rate test] results indicate there is no reason to believe that 
delaying the Type B and C leak rate tests approximately two months 
will cause serious deterioration to these components. Furthermore, 
similar requests by utilities to extend the surveillance beyond two 
years have already been found acceptable by the NRC. Therefore, it is 
concluded that the proposed amendment does not involve a significant 
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously 
evaluated. 



Criterion 2 



No changes to the limiting conditions for operation for containment 
integrity are proposed as part of this amendment request. The 
proposed change does not involve any physical changes to the plant or 
any changes to plant operations. Thus, the proposed change does not 
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any 
accident previously evaluated. 



Criterion 3 



The intent of the Type B and C leak rate surveillance is to ensure 
that containment integrity does not significantly deteriorate. This 
is established by measuring a total leak rate of less than 0.60 L

a

. 
Our significant improvement in Type B and C leak rate tests results, 
aggressive corrective actions taken, and excellent ILRT results 
indicate there is no reason to believe that delaying the Type B and C 
leak rate tests approximately two months will cause serious 
deterioration to these components. The ``As Found'' trend of the leak 
rates over the past three surveillances indicate that the leak rate 
for the next surveillance will be below the Appendix J leak rate 
acceptance criteria. Therefore, it is concluded that the proposed 
amendment does not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 3, New London County, Connecticut 





Date of Amendment Request: 

March 23, 1994.



Description of Amendment Request: 

The licensee proposed to modify 
Technical Specification Table 3.7-6, Area Temperature Monitoring, by 
creating two zones for the main steam valve building (MSVB) and increasing 
the maximum normal excursion (MNE) temperature limit for this area from 
120 
 F to 140 
 F. 



Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




The proposed change does not involve an SHC [significant hazards 
consideration] because the change would not: 
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences 
of an accident previously evaluated. 


The increase of the MNE temperature from 120 
 F to 140 
 F for the 
main steam valve building has been evaluated. The equipment in 
the building has been shown to be qualified for continuous 
operation at 140oF. The effect of this temperature change has 
decreased slightly the qualified life of the components in the 
building. For those components with a qualified life of less 
than 40 years, they will be replaced as a scheduled maintenance 
item. 


An engineering review of the MSLB profile for this building was 
conducted and it was concluded that those components required to 
operate post accident, will continue to perform their safety 
function. Therefore, since the equipment will continue to 
operate as designed both during normal conditions and subsequent 
to a MSLB, the probability or consequences of an accident 
previously evaluated is not increased. 


2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident 
from any previously analyzed. 


The effect of increasing the MNE temperature to 140 
 F has been 
evaluated and judged acceptable. The possible failure of the 
equipment in this building due to the increase in temperature is 
no more likely than it was before, since the equipment has been 
shown to be qualified to 140 
 F. Failure of any equipment in this 
building at the new temperature will not create any new accidents 
or consequences that were not considered previously. 


Finally, since there are no changes in the way the plant is 
operated, there is no possibility of an accident of a new or 
different type than previously evaluated due to the proposed 
change. 


3. Involve a significant reduction in margin of safety. 


The proposed change increases the MNE temperature within the 
MSVB. The equipment in the building has been reviewed to ensure 
operability. There is a slight decrease in the qualified life, 
but this was anticipated and scheduled previously and any such 
replacement of equipment will continue as a maintenance item. A 
review of the MSLB profile was performed for this area and it was 
shown that the required equipment will continue to operate as 
required.





The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Description of Amendment Request: 

The proposed amendment would include the use of integral fuel burnable absorbers as a method of controlling core 
excess reactivity and maintaining the core power distribution within 
acceptable peaking limitations. 




Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination: 

As 
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
issue of no significant hazards consideration. The NRC staff has reviewed 
the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The 
staff's review is presented below: 


1. The proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in the 
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 


Any fuel containing integral burnable absorbers will be analyzed using 
NRC approved methods and acceptance criteria prior to being loaded into 
Maine Yankee's reactor vessel core. Verification of adequate shutdown 
margin is performed during low power physics testing after each refueling. 
In addition, core physics monitoring is required during power operation by 
Technical Specifications sections 3.10, ``CEA Group, Power Distribution, 
Moderator Temperature Coefficient Limits and Coolant Conditions,'' and 3.15 
``Reactivity Anomalies.'' Such testing and monitoring ensures adequate 
margin exists to accommodate the anticipated transients and accidents 
postulated in Maine Yankee's Final Safety Analysis Report. 


The licensee therefore concludes that implementation of the proposed 
change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or 
consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 


2. The proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 


A determination of compliance with approved acceptance criteria is 
made for every Maine Yankee fuel reload prior to loading fuel. The use of 
approved methodologies and acceptance criteria ensure that new or different 
accidents will not be created by the use of integral fuel burnable 
absorbers. 


The licensee therefore concludes that implementation of the proposed 
change will not create any or new or different kind of accident from any 
accident previously evaluated. 


3. The proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety. 


The safety evaluation performed for each core reload ensures that the 
core design meets appropriate acceptance criteria. Because these criteria 
remain unchanged as approved by the NRC, the margin of safety remains the 
same. 


The licensee therefore concludes that implementation of the proposed 
change would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 


Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine 
that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Northern States Power Company, Docket No. 50-263, Monticello Nuclear 
Generating Plant, Wright County, Minnesota 







Date of Amendment Request: 

January 26, 1994.








Description of Amendment Request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications and associated Bases to reflect the fact that the

main steam isolation valves can now be tested at a pressure of greater than 
or equal to P

a

 (42 psig) thereby eliminating the need for the previously 
granted exemption to certain Appendix J testing requirements. The 
exemption would no longer be necessary because of improvements in testing 
technology. 




Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:







a. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 


The proposed amendment is limited to changes to the surveillance 
testing requirements (test pressure and allowable leakage criteria) 
applicable to the main steam line isolation valves. The proposed 
criteria are equivalent to the current criteria with respect to 
monitoring main steam isolation valve performance to ensure that 
leakage past the valves would be within acceptable limits under 
accident conditions. This surveillance test is performed while the 
plant is in a cold shutdown condition at a time when the main steam 
isolation valves are not required to be operable. Performance of the 
test itself is not an input or consideration in any accident 
previously evaluated, thus the proposed change will not increase the 
probability of any such accident occurring. 


The proposed amendment will not adversely affect the function, 
operation, or reliability of the valves, nor will it diminish the 
capability of the valves to perform as required during an accident. 
There will be no increase in post accident off-site or on-site 
radiation dose, since the adjusted leakage limit is consistent with 
inputs previously established for the dose analyses. The proposed 
amendment is consistent with regulatory requirements (10 CFR Part 50, 
Appendix J) and guidance (TER-C5257-30) that has been previously 
reviewed by the NRC and found to be acceptable. Therefore, the 
amendment will not increase the consequences of any accident 
previously evaluated.

b. The proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. 
The proposed amendment does not involve any modification to plant 
equipment or operating procedures, nor will it introduce any new main 
steam isolation valve failure modes that have not been previously 
considered. The proposed amendment is limited to a change in the 
surveillance test pressure & acceptance criteria used to leak test the 
valves. This test is performed while the plant is in a cold shutdown 
condition at a time when the valves are not required to be operable. 
We therefore conclude the proposed changes will not create the 
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident 
previously analyzed. 
c. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in 
the margin of safety.
The proposed amendment will result in the main steam isolation valves 
being subjected to the maximum pressure (P

a

, 42 psig) calculated to 
occur under worst case accident conditions, and will therefore provide 
a more realistic and challenging test of valve performance under those 
conditions. The leakage rate criteria for the test has been adjusted 
upward to be commensurate with the higher test pressure, but this does 
not represent any increase in actual leakage under accident 
conditions. On-site and off-site dose analyses will not be affected. 
The proposed amendment does not involve any change in operability 
requirements or limiting conditions for operation beyond the 
replacement of the old test pressure & acceptance criteria with 
equivalent criteria consistent with 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, 
NUREG-1433, and TER-C5257-30. Based on these considerations, we 
conclude the proposed amendment will not involve a significant

Date of Application for Amendment: 

April 6, 1994.


Description of Amendment Request: 

The amendment would reflect the 
incorporation of the end-of-cycle Minimum Critical Power Ratio 
Recirculation Pump Trip (MCPR-RPT) system and the replacement of the 
Reactor Recirculation System (RRS) Motor Generator (M-G) Sets with solid 
state adjustable speed drives (ASDs). 


Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 




(1) The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in 
the probability or consequences of any accident previously 
evaluated. 
The addition of the end-of-cycle MCPR-RPT System, which utilizes 
ASDs, will not have a significant increase in the probability or 
consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
The end-of-cycle MCPR-RPT System has been designed to appropriate 
standards and specifications to ensure that the ability of the 
plant to mitigate the effects of accidents is maintained. 
Additionally, the MCPR-RPT System has been analyzed such that no 
new accident initiators will be created such that the probability 
of an accident previously evaluated will not increase. 
No new challenges to the reactor coolant pressure boundary will 
result from the incorporation of the end-of-cycle MCPR-RPT System 
which could result in an increase in the consequences of an 
accident. All engineered safety features will function as 
described in the PBAPS UFSAR [Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station 
Updated Final Safety Analysis Report] in order to mitigate the 
consequences of accidents previously evaluated in the PBAPS 
UFSAR. Additionally, all fission product barriers and safety 
margins will be maintained.

(2) The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 
The end-of-cycle MCPR-RPT System, which utilizes ASDs, has been 
designed to appropriate standards and specification to ensure 
that no new sequence of events or failure modes will occur such 
that a transient event will escalate into a new or different type 
of accident. 
The software used in the digital system of the ASDs is not 
subject to the verification and validation requirements discussed 
in the NRC memorandum dated July 1, 1991, from A. C. Thadoni 
[sic] [Thadani] (NRC) to S. A. Varga (NRC) and B. A. Bolger [sic] 
[Boger] (NRC), because this equipment is neither safety-related 
nor important to safety. There is no software used in the trip 
circuit of the end-of-cycle MCPR-RPT System, except for the ASDs. 
Additionally, the design of the modification will assure that the 
new equipment EM emissions will not cause inadvertent operation 
of existing plant equipment and that harmonic filters have been 
incorporated to minimize electrical noise on the 13kV input power 
buses. 
(3) The proposed change does not result in a significant reduction in 
the margin of safety. 
The incorporation of the end-of-cycle MCPR-RPT System, which 
utilizes ASDs, will not result in a reduction in the margin of 
safety. All safety margins will be maintained. 
The end-of-cycle MCPR-RPT System will aid in protecting the 
integrity of the fuel barrier by tripping the recirculation pumps 
early in the pressurization phase of the load rejection with no 
bypass event, the turbine trip with no bypass event, and the 
feedwater controller failure_maximum demand event. The early 
tripping of the recirculation pumps will introduce negative void 
reactivity thus reducing reactor power and maintaining safety 
margins. The end-of-cycle MCPR-RPT System will ensure CPR safety 
margins which protect fuel barrier integrity. 
General Electric has performed a qualitative assessment of 
transients that would be impacted as a result of replacing the M-G Sets with ASDs. General Electric concluded
that the faster 
coastdown of the recirculation pumps during a Loss of Coolant 
Accident (LOCA) due to the removal of the M-G Set inertia may 
slightly increase the peak clad temperature during this event. 
This increase is expected to be less than 50
 F. The small 
increase will not exceed the 2200
 F peak cladding temperature 
regulatory limit. No design or safety limit will be exceeded. 
The replacement of the M-G Sets with the ASDs will not impact the 
recirculation flow controller failure_increase flow transient. 
The UFSAR analysis assumes a 25%/sec rate of increase. The ASD 
control system will include rate limiters that prevent a pump 
speed increase greater than 25%/sec in the event of a failure. 
Thus, the consequences of this transient remain bounded and 
safety margins will be maintained. 
The ASDs will also allow a ``soft start'' of the recirculation 
pumps with the recirculation discharge valves closed prior to 
pump start and a gradual increase in pump speed. This results in 
a gradual change in core flow. Thus, the response to a startup 
of an idle recirculation pump remains bounded by the transient 
analysis and safety margins will be maintained in the transient 
analyses. 
Changes to the fire protection equipment will still maintain the 
capability to shutdown the plant in the event of a fire. 




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the

Description of Amendment Request: 

The proposed Technical Specifications (TS) changes relocate the TS fire protection requirements to the Updated
Final Safety Analysis Report.


Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
The proposed changes are administrative in nature and are consistent with the guidance provided in NRC GL's [Generic
Letters] 86-10 and 88-12. They do not affect the initial conditions or precursors assumed in the Updated
Final Safety Analysis Report Section 14. These changes do not decrease the effectiveness of equipment relied upon
to mitigate the previously evaluated accidents.
Therefore, there is no increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
The proposed changes do not make any physical changes to the plant or changes to operating procedures. Therefore,
implementation of the proposed changes will not affect the design function or configuration of any component or introduce
any new operating scenarios or failure modes or accident initiation.
Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated.
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
The proposed changes are administrative in nature and are consistent with the guidance provided in NRC GL's 86-10
and 88-12. The proposed changes do not adversely affect the assumptions or sequence of events used in any accident
analysis.
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a reduction in any margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of

Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Salem County, New Jersey




Date of Amendment Request: 

January 21, 1994.


Description of Amendment Request: 

These amendments would revise Technical Specifications 3.8.2.3 for both Salem Unit 1 and Salem Unit 2 to include the
battery acceptance criteria, corresponding allowed outage times and additional surveillance requirements recommended
in NUREG-1431, Standard Technical Specifications_Westinghouse Plants.
TS 3.8.2.4 ``125 Volt D.C. Distribution_Shutdown'' would also be indirectly affected by these changes because it
refers to the surveillance requirements of TS 4.8.2.3.2 to demonstrate the battery and chargers Operable.
In addition, Salem Unit 1 TS 3.8.2.3 Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) would be revised to define the specific
battery charger required for each train. Salem Unit 1 TS 3.8.2.3 Action Statement would also be revised to restrict
the use of the backup battery charger to a period not to exceed 7 days.
Additionally, the Unit 1 action statement for an inoperable 125 volt DC bus would be modified to add the requirement
that the bus also be energized.


Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
The proposed changes do not alter plant configuration or operation. The proposed changes do not invalidate any of
the parameters assumed in the plants UFSAR Design Basis Accident or Transient Analyses. The proposed changes provide
additional guidance to be used to ensure operability of the safety related batteries. New surveillance requirements
and specific battery cell parameters offer improved monitoring of the battery status. The new guidance and surveillance
requirements are consistent with the recommendations of NUREG-1431, Standard Technical Specifications_Westinghouse
Plants, and current industry recommendations.
The changes to the Unit 1 LCO and corresponding Action Statement restrict the use of the backup battery charger, thereby
limiting the amount of time that one AC Vital bus is allowed to power the chargers of more than one DC train. This change
brings the TS for both Units into agreement and results in a more conservative Unit 1 TS.
Therefore, the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated are not increased by the proposed
change.
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
The proposed changes do not introduce any design or physical configuration changes to the facility or change the method
by which any safety-related system performs its function. The proposed changes are consistent with the recommendations
of NUREG-1431, Standard Technical Specifications_Westinghouse Plants. Therefore, the proposed changes
will not increase the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously identified.

3. Does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
The proposed changes do not alter the manner in which safety limits or limiting safety system setpoints are determined.
The new cell parameter table and additional surveillance requirements provide improved means to monitor and evaluate
overall battery performance. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in any margin
of safety.

C. Summer Nuclear Station, Unit No. 1, Fairfield County, South Carolina




Date of Amendment Request: 

October 29, 1993.


Description of Amendment Request: 

The licensee is preparing to replace the currently installed steam generators with new model Delta 75 steam generators
(SGs). The new steam generators will be larger than those currently installed. The physical changes to the plant and
the accident reanalyses needed to support those changes will necessitate increasing the maximum tested charging/safety
injection pump flow rate from 680 gallons per minute to 700 gallons per minute.


Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



(1) Operation of VCSNS [Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Station] in accordance with the proposed license amendment does
not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
Implementation of the [Delta] 75 SGs and revised operating conditions do not contribute to the initiation of any accident
evaluated in the FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report]. Supporting factors are as follows:



_The [Delta] 75 SG is designed in accordance with ASME [American Society of Mechanical Engineers] Code Section III,
1986 edition [sic] and other applicable federal, state, and local laws, codes and regulations and meets the original
interfaces for the Model D3 SGs with exception that provisions for a larger blowdown nozzle have been made and the feedwater
inlet nozzle is located in the upper shell.
_All NSSS [nuclear steam supply system] components (i.e., reactor vessel, RC Pumps, pressurizer, CRDM's [control
rod drive mechanisms], [Delta] 75 SGs, and RCS piping) are compatible with the revised operating conditions. Their
structural integrity is maintained during all proposed plant conditions through compliance with the ASME code.
_Fluid and auxiliary systems which are important to safety, including the CHG/SI [charging and safety injection]
system with maximum pump flows up to 700 gpm, are not adversely impacted and will continue to perform their design function.
_Overall plant performance and operation are not significantly altered by the proposed changes.



Therefore, since the reactor coolant pressure boundary integrity and system functions are not adversely impacted,
the probability of occurrence of an accident evaluated in the VCSNS FSAR will be no greater than the original design
basis of the plant.
An extensive analysis has been performed to evaluate the consequences of the following accident types currently
evaluated in the VCSNS FSAR:



_Non-LOCA [non-loss-of-coolant accident]
_Large Break and Small Break LOCA
_Steam Generator Tube Rupture



With the [Delta] 75 SGs and revised operating conditions, the calculated results (i.e., DNBR [departure from nucleate
boiling ratio], Primary and Secondary System Pressure, Peak Clad Temperature, Metal Water Reaction, Challenge
to Long Term Cooling, Environmental Conditions Inside and Outside Containment, etc.) for the accidents are similar
to those currently reported in the VCSNS FSAR. Select results (i.e., Containment Pressure during a Steam Line Break,
Minimum DNBR for Rod Withdrawal from Subcritical, etc.) are slightly more limiting than those reported in the current
FSAR due to the use of the assumed operating conditions with the new [Delta] 75 SGs, and in some cases, use of an uprated
core power of 2900 MWt. However, in all cases, the calculated results do not challenge the integrity of the primary/secondary/containment
pressure boundary and remain within the regulatory acceptance criteria applied to VCSNS's current licensing basis.
The assumptions utilized in the radiological evaluations, described in Section 3.7, are thus appropriate and are
judged to provide a conservative estimate of the radiological consequences during accident conditions. Given that
calculated radiological consequences are not significantly higher than current FSAR results and remain well within
10CFR100 limits, it is concluded that the consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the FSAR are not increased.
(2) The proposed license amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
The [Delta] 75 SGs, revised operating conditions, and higher allowable CHG/SI pump flows will not introduce any new
accident initiator mechanisms. Structural integrity of the RCS is maintained during all plant conditions through
compliance with the ASME code. No new failure modes or limiting single failures have been identified. Design requirements
of auxiliary systems are met with the RSGs [Replacement Steam Generators]. Since the safety and design requirements
continue to be met and the integrity of the reactor coolant system pressure boundary is not challenged, no new accident
scenarios have been created. Therefore, the types of accidents defined in the FSAR continue to represent the credible
spectrum of events to be analyzed which determine safe plant operation.
(3) The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Although the [Delta] 75 SGs, revised operating conditions, 
and higher allowable CHG/SI pump flows will require changes 
to the VCSNS Technical Specifications, it will not 
invalidate the LOCA, non-LOCA, or SGTR [steam generator tube 
rupture] conclusions presented in the FSAR accident 
analyses. For all the FSAR non-LOCA transients, the DNB 
design basis, primary and secondary pressure limits, and 
dose limits continue to be met. The LOCA peak cladding 
temperatures remain below the limits specified in 
10 CFR 50.46. The calculated doses resulting from a SGTR 
event will continue to remain within a small fraction of the 
10 CFR 100 permissible releases. Environmental conditions 
associated with High Energy Line Break (HELB) both inside 
and outside containment have been evaluated. 

The containment design pressure will not be violated as a result 
of the HELB. Equipment qualification will be updated, as 
necessary, to reflect the revised conditions resulting from HELB. 
The margin of safety with respect to primary pressure boundary is 
provided, in part, by the safety factors included in the ASME 
Code. Since the components remain in compliance with the codes 
and standards in effect when VCSNS was originally licensed (with 
the exception of the [Delta] 75 RSGs which use the 1986 ASME Code 
Section III Edition), the margin of safety is not reduced. Thus, 
there is no reduction in the margin of safety as defined in the 
bases of the VCSNS Technical Specifications. 







The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

No. 1, Lake County, Ohio 





Date of Amendment Request: 

March 12, 1993.



Description of Amendment Request: 

The proposed amendment would revise 
Technical Specification Table 3.3.7.1-1, to clarify the actions to be taken 
if the control room ventilation radiation monitor is not operable. 



Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 

1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the 
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

The proposed change clarifies Technical Specification 3.3.7.1, 
``Radiation Monitoring Instrumentation'' by revising Action 72 (for an 
inoperable Control Room Ventilation Radiation Monitor) to remove 
several inconsistencies between it and Action 3.7.2.b.2 of the Control 
Room Emergency Recirculation System Specification. Revised Action 72 
simply makes the two Specifications more consistent by incorporating 
alternative compensatory measures that the operators may take after 
the Control Room Ventilation Radiation Monitor has been inoperable for 
more than seven days. The proposed Action would retain the choice of 
initiating at least one train of the Control Room Emergency 
Recirculation System, while providing a second option to take which 
would depend on the current Operational Condition. In Operational 
Conditions 4, 5 and * * * the current Specification 3.3.7.1 Action 72 
does not contain the provisions of the Control Room Emergency 
Recirculation System Action 3.7.2.b.2 which directs the Operators to 
suspend performance of Core Alterations, handling of irradiated fuel 
and operations with a potential for draining the reactor vessel 
instead of initiating the Control Room Emergency Recirculation System. 
This inconsistency between the two specifications has caused 
compliance difficulties; therefore, the proposed Action adds this 
alternative. Also, in Operational Conditions 1, 2 and 3 a shutdown 
provision is being added. The other changes are editorial, in order 
to clarify the applicability of the proposed alternative compensatory 
measures, to be consistent with PNPP-specific terminology, and to be 
more consistent with Action b of Specification 3.7.2. 

In summary, there is no change in the probability or consequences of 
any accident since the revision of Specification 3.3.7.1 Action 72 is 
simply proposed in order to achieve consistency with the current 
Action 3.7.2.b.2. Incorporation of the already approved 3.7.2.b.2 
compensatory measures to suspend possible radiation accident 
initiating activities provides an alternative which would actually 
reduce the probability of occurrence of a previously analyzed 
accident, and would have no adverse effect on accident consequences. 
None of the proposed changes to the clarified action, including the 
editorial changes, involves a change to the design of the plant, nor 
the operational characteristics of any plant system, nor the 
procedures by which the Operators run the plant. 

2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 

No design changes are being made that would create a new type of 
accident or malfunction, and the methods and manner of plant operation 
remains unchanged. The proposed revisions to Action 72 will remove 
several inconsistencies between the two Specifications by providing 
consistent actions within the Radiation Monitoring Instrumentation 
Specification with those currently existing in the Control Room 
Emergency Recirculation System Specification and provide an additional 
shutdown requirement in Operational Conditions 1, 2 and 3. The other 
changes to Action 72 are editorial, and therefore cannot affect 
accident initiation parameters. The instrument to which Action 72 
applies (the Control Room Ventilation Radiation Monitor (Noble Gas)) 
simply serves as a supporting instrumentation channel for the Control 
Room Emergency Recirculation System, therefore no new or different 
kind of accident can be created. 

3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety. 

The proposed change to Specification 3.3.7.1 Action 72 simply makes 
the two Specifications more consistent by making the Action for a 
supporting instrumentation channel, the Control Room Ventilation 
Radiation Monitor (Noble Gas), more consistent with those of the 
supported system Specification, the Control Room Emergency 
Recirculation System. A shutdown requirement is also being added if 
the operators should choose not to initiate the supported system in 
Operational Conditions 1, 2, and 3. Since the Actions of the two 
Specifications will now correspond, the margin of safety as currently 
exists today for the governing Specification (the Control Room 
Emergency Recirculation System Specification) is maintained and the 
proposed changes do not therefore reduce the margin of safety. 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Date of Amendment Request: 

March 18, 1994.



Description of Amendment Request: 

The proposed amendment would revise TS 2.1.2 (Reactor Core), TS 2.2.1 (Reactor Protection System Setpoints), Bases
2.1.1 and 2.1.2 (Reactor Core), Bases 2.2.1 (Reactor Protection System Instrumentation Setpoints), TS 3.2.2 and

Core Operating Limits Report. 



Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below, indicating that the proposed changes would: 





1a. Not involve a significant increase in the probability of an 
accident previously evaluated because no accident 
initiators, assumptions or probabilities are affected by the 
proposed relocation of cycle-specific core operating limits 
to the Core Operating Limits Report. 

1b. Not involve a significant increase in the consequences of an 
accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes do not 
affect any equipment, accident conditions, or assumptions which 
could lead to a significant increase in radiological 
consequences. 

2a. Not create the possibility of a new kind of accident from any 
accident previously evaluated because no new accident initiators 
are introduced by these proposed changes. 

2b. Not create the possibility of a different kind of accident from 
any accident previously evaluated because no different accident 
initiators are introduced by these proposed changes. 

3. Not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because 
the proposed changes only relocate cycle-specific core operating 
limits to the Core Operating Limits Report; they do not allow 
less conservative operating limits. The analytical methods to be 
used in the determination of cycle-specific core operating limits 
are previously approved by the NRC. The same margin of safety 
provided in the current Technical Specifications will continue to 
be maintained. 






The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are

1a. Not involve a significant increase in the probability of an 
accident previously evaluated because no change is being made to 
any accident initiator. Automatic actuation of the PORV is not 
assumed to mitigate the consequences of a design basis accident 
as described in Chapter 15 of the USAR. The proposed changes 
will continue to ensure the PORV and block valves are available 
to perform their functions when required to do so. Therefore, it 
can be concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a 
significant increase in the probability of an accident previously 
evaluated. 

1b. Not involve a significant increase in the consequences of an 
accident previously evaluated because the proposed changes do not 
invalidate accident conditions or assumptions used in evaluating 
the radiological consequences of an accident. 

2a. Not create the possibility of a new kind of accident from any 
accident previously evaluated because the proposed changes do not 
delete any function previously provided by the PORV nor has the 
possibility of inadvertent opening been increased. No new types 
of failures or accident initiators are introduced by the proposed 
changes. 

2b. Not create the possibility of a different kind of accident from 
any accident previously evaluated because no new failure modes 
have been defined for any plant system or component important to 
safety, nor has any new limiting single failure been identified 
as a result of the proposed changes. No different accident 
initiators or failure mechanisms are introduced by the proposed 
changes. 

3. Not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because 
the proposed changes continue to ensure the availability of the 
PORV and block valve when called upon to perform their function 
and will not impact any safety analysis assumptions. 




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

TU Electric Company, Docket Nos. 50-445 and 50-446, Comanche Peak Steam 
Electric Station, Units 1 and 2, Somervell County, Texas 





Date of Amendment Request:

 February 14, 1994.



Brief Description of Amendments:

 The proposed amendment would revise the 
Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station (CPSES) Units 1 and 2 technical 
specifications to increase the Unit 2 boron concentration for the refueling 
water storage tank (RWST) and the emergency core cooling system (ECCS) 
accumulators to support Unit 2 operation with extended fuel cycles. These 
changes are applicable to Unit 2 only and are identical to those previously 
approved for Unit 1. 



Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The NRC staff's review
is presented below: 

1. The proposed change would not increase the probability or 
consequences of a previously evaluated accident. 

The proposed changes are related to the boron concentration in the 
RWST and ECCS accumulators. This increased concentration does not 
constitute a change expected to increase the probability of a previously 
evaluated accident. The means by which the proposed changes might result 
in increased radiological consequences of various accidents are discussed 
below.

<TEXT>
 

The higher boron concentration may result in increased probability of 
equipment failure following an accident due to in-containment or in-process 
equipment being exposed to a more severe post-accident environment. The 
general chemical properties of the slightly higher boron concentration 
fluid indicates no mechanism that would result in an appreciable increase 
in the component failure rate. While the corrosive nature of the fluid 
will increase, this increase will be only minimal. Thus, there is no 
significant increase in the consequences of any accident due to an increase 
in the probability of equipment failure. 

The changes in containment spray and sump solution pH may change the 
radioisotope removal and partition characteristics. While some relevant 
characteristics are affected, the resulting limiting coefficient values 
associated with the pH changes are bounded by the values used in the design 
calculations for CPSES. Thus, no adverse impact of the radiological 
consequences arising from this mechanism has been identified. 

The impact of the containment spray, with a lower pH, upon the 
combustible gas production rate was also evaluated. No mechanism for 
increased combustible gas production was identified. 

The higher boron concentration could have an adverse impact on the 
inadvertent actuation of the ECCS event. Although the timing of the 
sequence of events may be affected, the departure from nucleate boiling 
ratio continues to increase from its initial value throughout the event. 
On the basis of its review of this event, the licensee has identified no 
changes in the event probability or consequences; however, the continued 
validity of this conclusion will be reconfirmed by the licensee on a cycle-specific basis. 

2. The proposed change would not create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 

The proposed change only changes the allowable boron concentration. 
No new or different accident sequences have been identified. Furthermore, 
the licensee has reviewed the heat tracing requirements and determined that 
there are no additional requirements resulting from the boron concentration 
increase. There are no previously unconsidered failure mechanisms. 

3. The proposed change would not involve a significant reduction in 
the margin of safety. 

The decrease in the containment spray and sump solution pH could be 
expected to result in higher airborne iodine concentrations. The accident 
source terms could be impacted by variations in the iodine spray removal 
and partition factors. A comparison of the coefficients for the minimum 
equilibrium containment sump solution pH to those used in the CPSES design 
analyses indicated that the expected coefficient values would remain 
bounded by the values used in the previous analyses. Thus, no significant 
reduction in the margin of safety has been identified. 

Based on this review, it appears that the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) 
are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
request for amendments involves no significant hazards consideration.

Electric Station, Units 1 and 2, Somervell County, Texas 





Date of Amendment Request: 

February 14, 1994.



Brief Description of Amendments:

 The proposed amendment will revise the 
Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station, Units 1 and 2, technical 
specifications to be consistent with the new 10 CFR part 20. 



Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination:

 As 
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 




1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the 
probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident. 

The proposed revisions to the liquid and gaseous effluent release 
limits will not change the type or amount of effluent released 
nor will there be an increase in individual or cumulative dose. 
The changes will result in levels of radioactive materials in 
effluents being maintained ALARA [as low as reasonably 
achievable] and comply with 10 CFR 50.36a and 10 CFR 50 Appendix I. 
The change to the high radiation area dose measurement distance 
will ensure that high radiation areas are conservatively posted 
per 10 CFR 20.1601(a)(1) and provide controls to minimize 
individual dose. The changes do not impact the operation or 
design of any plant structure, system or component. Other 
proposed changes are administrative only. Therefore, the 
proposed changes do not involve an increase in the probability 
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously 
evaluated. 

The proposed changes do not affect the plant design or operation 
nor do they result in a change to the configuration of any 
equipment. No change is proposed that will change the type or 
quantity of effluents released off site or change the source 
terms available for release. Therefore, the proposed changes do 
not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident 
from any previously evaluated.

3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety. 

The proposed changes do not change the type or increase the amount of effluents released offsite. No change in the methodology
used to control radioactive waste or radiological environmental monitoring is proposed. Control of radioactive
effluents and effluent monitor setpoints will be based on current dose to the public limitations. Under the proposed
change, high 
radiation area measurements are more conservative and will not result in an increase in individual or cumulative
occupational radiation exposures. Compliance with the limits of the revised 10 CFR 20.1301 will be demonstrated
by operating within the limits of 10 CFR 50, Appendix I and 40 CFR 190. Therefore, these changes do not reduce the margin
of safety. 




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Electric Station, Units 1 and 2, Somervell County, Texas 





Date of Amendment Request:

 February 14, 1994.



Brief Description of Amendments:

 The proposed amendment would revise the Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station Units 1 and 2 technical specifications
by reducing the frequency of reports for radiological effluents from semiannual to annual, and change the due date
from within 60 days after 
January 1 and July 1 to prior to May 1. 



Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 




1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the 
probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident. 

The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. The amendment involves only changes of reporting frequency and due date requirements for
radiological effluent release reporting. These changes are administrative in nature and do not affect safe operation
of the plant; therefore, accident probabilities or consequences are unaffected. 

2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 

The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The proposed amendment is administrative in nature and does not involve any changes to plant design of
configuration. For this reason, it will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. 

3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 

The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed amendment only
changes the reporting frequency and due date requirements for radiological effluent release reporting. The reporting
requirements for radiological effluent releases are administrative changes: therefore, there is not a significant
reduction in the margin of 
safety. 




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to
determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Virginia Electric and Power Company, Docket Nos. 50-338 and 50-339, North 
Anna Power Station, Units No. 1 and No. 2, Louisa County, Virginia 





Date of Amendment Request:

 March 30, 1994.



Description of Amendment Request:

 The proposed changes would revise the North Anna Power Station, Units No. 1 and No. 2 (NA-1&2) Technical

Specifications (TS). Specifically, the proposed changes would revise the High Head Safety Injection (HHSI) flow
balance surveillance requirements by removing specific numerical values. The numerical values would be replaced
with broader requirements to ensure that the HHSI flow rates meet the loss 
of coolant accident (LOCA) analysis acceptance criteria and pump runout limits. The NA-1&2 TS 4.5.2.h
requires a surveillance test of the HHSI 
system following the completion of any modification to the Emergency Core 
Cooling System (ECCS) subsystems that could alter the subsystem flow 
characteristics. The current surveillance criteria specify values for the 
sum of the injection line flow rates, excluding the highest flow rate, and 
the total pump flow rate. These correspond to requirements for the safety 
analysis flow input and the HHSI pump runout limit, respectively. 

The HHSI test acceptance criteria in the current TS are very narrow 
because of the various system physical and technical constraints that need 
to be considered in the flow balance testing. These acceptance criteria 
may also be more restrictive than required by either the LOCA analysis or 
the actual pump runout requirements. For example, the LOCA analysis 
contains input conservatisms that could be used to offset a reduction in 
the required HHSI flow while still meeting the 10 CFR 50.46 LOCA acceptance 
criteria. The proposed TS changes would permit the use of additional 
available margin, while maintaining a strong technical linkage between the 
measured system performance and the safety analysis. Although these 
proposed TS changes remove the numerical values from TS 4.5.2.h, neither 
the methodology nor the acceptance criteria for LOCA analysis are affected. 



Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 




Specifically, operation of North Anna Power Station in accordance with 
the proposed Technical Specification changes will not: 

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences 
of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed Technical Specification changes continue to require that with
one HHSI pump running, the sum of the flows through the two lowest branch lines shall be [greater than or equal to] the
minimum HHSI flow required by the safety analysis and that the total HHSI pump flow rate shall be [less than or equal
to] the evaluated HHSI pump 
runout limit. 

Likewise, the consequences of the accidents previously evaluated will not increase as a result of the proposed Technical
Specification changes. The system performance will remain bounded by the safety analysis for all postulated conditions.
The safety analysis will continue to be performed and evaluated in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.59
and 10 CFR 50.46. 

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident or 
malfunction from any previously evaluated. The proposed Technical Specification changes will not affect the capability
of the HHSI System to perform its intended function. The proposed Technical Specification changes are bounded by
the existing safety analysis and do not involve operation of plant equipment in a different manner from which it was
designed to operate. 

Since a new failure mode is not created, a new or different type of accident or malfunction is not created. 

3. Involve a reduction in a margin of safety. The system performance will continue to bound the flow rates specified
in the safety analysis, therefore safety margins are not reduced.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. 
Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request 
involves no significant hazards consideration.

Date of Application for Amendment: 

December 28, 1993.



Brief Description of Amendment: 

The amendment clarifies Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.5.D.4. Amendment No. 179 to the TS added LCO 3.5.D.4
to permit hydrostatic and leakage testing at temperatures up to 300 
 F 
without requiring certain equipment, including the automatic 
depressurization system (ADS), to be operable. However, LCO 3.5.D.4 can be 
mistakenly interpreted to require the ADS be operable at temperatures less 
than 212 
 F. Requiring the ADS to be operable during hydrostatic and 
leakage testing with temperatures below 212 
 F was clearly not the intent 
of Amendment No. 179. The amendment clarifies LCO 3.5.D.4 to resolve this 
concern and is considered an administrative change.

<DOCTITLE>Abnormal Occurrences for Fourth Quarter CY 1993 Dissemination of Information</DOCTITLE>



Section 208 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, requires NRC to disseminate information on abnormal
occurrences (i.e., unscheduled incidents or events that the Commission determines are significant from the standpoint
of public health and safety). During the fourth quarter of CY 1993, the following incidents at NRC licensees were determined
to be abnormal occurrences (AOs) and are described below, together with the remedial actions taken. The events are
also being included in NUREG-0090, Vol. 16, No. 4, (``Report to Congress on Abnormal Occurrences: October-December
1993''). This report will be available at NRC's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington,
DC 20555 about three weeks after the publication date of this

Medical Branchytherapy Misadministration at Washington University Medical School in St. Louis, Missouri



One of the AO reporting guidelines notes that a therapeutic dose that results in any part of the body receiving unscheduled
radiation can be considered an abnormal occurrence.


Date and Place

_January 7, 1993 and February 26, 1993; Washington University Medical School; St. Louis, Missouri.




Nature and Probable Consequences

_On January 7, 1993, a Nucletron Micro-Selectron low-dose-rate (LDR) remote afterloader unit ejected a radioactive
source without being programmed to do so and without a guide tube and applicator attached to the channel. The unguided
source lay at an approximate distance of 3 centimeters (cm) (1.2 inches [in] from the nearest skin surface for approximately
5 minutes. The licensee estimated that less than 0.1 centigray (cGy) (0.1 rad) of additional dose was delivered to
the skin surface.


On February 26, 1993, a very similar incident occurred at the same facility. The incident involved a different patient
and the same remote afterloader unit. The device again ejected the same strength and type of radioactive source without
being programmed to do so. However, in this case, the source lay near the patient's leg for approximately 60 to 75 minutes,
at an approximate distance of 5 cm (2 in) from the nearest skin surface. The licensee estimated the additional dose
to the patient's leg to be approximately 3.5 cGy (3.5 rad).


In both cases, the treatment of each patient was completed on another LDR remote afterloader unit in another room of
the medical center.




Cause or Causes

_After the first incident on January 7, 1993, a manufacturer service engineer, who studied the device malfunction,
was unable to identify the cause of the failure during his repair visit. The licensee's staff subsequently tested
the device for 20 hours without discovering the cause of the failure, and concluded that the device was acceptable
for use. This decision was based on the fact that they could not reproduce the malfunction. The remote afterloader
was put back into service. On February 26, 1993, the device failed again when a second unprogrammed source was ejected
by the afterloader. After this incident, which resulted in the second misadministration, the manufacturer provided
a different field engineer who correctly diagnosed the problem as a failure in an operational amplifier.


A previous recommendation made by the manufacturer to store unused sources in the auxiliary storage safe, instead
of the remote afterloader's mobile storage container, may have contributed to the incident. The second field engineer
indicated that some of the safety features which prevent sources from being erroneously ejected were not in effect
or were not monitored by the device for the unprogrammed channels containing the unused sources.



Actions Taken To Prevent a Recurrence






Licensee

_The licensee informed the NRC that use of the two Micro-Selectron-LDR remote afterloader units will be discontinued
and a new model LDR afterloader will be installed. NRC has also asked the licensee to address the manufacturer's recommendation
for storing the sources and the removal of some of the safety features, and any resulting corrective actions.




NRC

_The vendor has now revised the device's operating software to monitor and generate error messages and audible alarms
for unprogrammed (unused) channels. The NRC has sent a letter to the licensee identifying the two events as misadministrations
and requesting that the licensee ensure the required notifications to the referring physicians and patients have
been made. (Letter from Roy J. Caniano, Chief, Nuclear Materials Safety Branch, NRC Region III, to Robert J. Hickok,
Assistant Vice President for Medical Affairs, Washington University Medical School, forwarding inspection reports
No. 030-02271/93001, 030-31205/93001, 030-15101/93001, Docket No. 030/02271, 030-31205
and 030/15101, License No. 24-00167-11, dated January 12, 1994.)


During an NRC safety inspection conducted from November 15 to 18, 1993, the inspectors focused on these two incidents
in addition to other inspection areas. The results of this inspection are still under review.

93-12 

Medical Brachytherapy Misadministration at Mercy Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania



One of the AO reporting guidelines notes that a therapeutic dose that results in any part of the body receiving unscheduled
radiation can be considered an abnormal occurrence.

Date and Place_

October 15, 1993; Mercy Hospital; Scranton, Pennsylvania.



Nature and Probable Consequences_

On October 15, 1993, Mercy Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania, notified NRC Region I of a therapeutic misadministration
involving a Nucletron Micro-Selectron high dose rate (HDR) remote afterloader which occurred at the facility on
April 23, 1993. The licensee identified this misadministration during a review of the past treatment records.

A patient was scheduled to receive brachytherapy treatment to the apex of her vagina in three fractions using a Nucletron
Micro Selectron HDR remote afterloader. The prescribed dose was 500 centigray (cGy) (500 rad) for each fraction and
the use of a ring applicator was specified. On April 13, 1993, the patient was administered the first fractional treatment.
After an examination of the patient following the first treatment, the physician revised the written directive and
prescribed a change from the ring applicator to a standard vaginal cylindrical applicator for the remaining two treatments.
On April 23, 1993, during the administration of the second treatment, the therapist erroneously entered the catheter
length of 920 millimeter (mm) (36.2 inch) into the treatment computer instead of the intended 992 mm (39.1 inch). The
physician failed to identify this error during his review of the treatment parameters prior to the initiation of the
treatment.

As a result of this erroneous entry, a majority of the treatment dose was administered to an unintended region near
the opening of the vagina, and the intended site received an underdose differing from the prescribed dose by more than
20 percent. The physician stated that no adverse clinical effects are expected as a result of the underdose to the target
site because this treatment was intended to administer a booster radiation dose. The oncologist also stated that
the patient is not expected to experience any adverse effects as a result of the 500 cGy (500 rad) overexposure to the
wrong treatment site misadministration. The NRC medical consultant, in his report to Region I, also stated a similar
opinion (that it is unlikely the patient will suffer any adverse effects from the misadministration).

The third fraction of the treatment was administered to the patient on April 29, 1993, as prescribed.

The referring physician and the patient have been notified. The licensee submitted a written report of the misadministration
to NRC Region I on October 29, 1993.



Cause or Causes_

The therapist did not enter the correct catheter length during initial setup for the second treatment. The licensee
followed established procedures; however, the procedure did not require verification of all parameters at the time
of the second check prior to each treatment.



Actions Taken to Prevent Occurrence





Licensee_

The licensee has instituted a requirement that a medical physicist also review the final treatment plan prior to initiating
the treatment. The treatment parameters for all brachytherapy (HDR) treatments will be transferred electronically
to the magnetic card directly from the simulator. The output of this card will be reviewed by the medical physicist
and the oncologist before the initiation of the treatment.



NRC_

Region I conducted a special inspection at Mercy Hospital on October 19, 1993. Inspection Report No. 030-02983/93-001,
issued November 5, 1993, identified two apparent violations:

(1) Failure to require supervised individual to follow written quality management procedures (QMP) 10 CFR 35.25(a)(2);

(2) Failure to include policies and procedures in the QMP to meet the objective that each administration is in accordance
with the written directive 10 CFR 35.32(a) After receipt and review of the medical consultant's report, Region I issued
a Notice of Violation to the licensee on February 9, 1994, classifying the two violations at Severity Level IV in accordance
with the NRC Enforcement Policy.

An NRC medical consultant has been retained to review this misadministration. The medical consultant's report was
received by Region I on February 3, 1994. (The medical consultant's report is filed in Docket No. 030-02983 in
the Region I Materials License Docket Room. Inspection Report No. 030-02983/93-001 issued November
5, 1993, and the February 9, 1994, Notice of Violation are in the PDR.) The medical consultant questioned the licensee
concerning its identification of a radiation oncologist as the referring physician. After discussion with the NRC's
medical consultant, the licensee identified the patient's physician as the primary referring physician and then
agreed to notify the physician. Following a review of the medical consultant's report, Region I confirmed in a telephone
conversation that the licensee had contacted the patient's physician regarding the misadministration. The licensee
stated that both referring physicians have been notified of this misadministration. The radiation oncologist had
discussed the misadministration with the patient on October 21, 1993.

radiation can be considered an abnormal occurrence.

Date and Place_

July 1, 1993; Mountainside Hospital; Montclair, New Jersey.



Nature and Probable Consequences

_On December 1, 1993, during a routine inspection, NRC identified a therapeutic misadministration involving a high-dose-rate
(HDR) remote afterloader, which occurred at Mountainside Hospital in Montclair, New Jersey, on July 1, 1993. NRC
identified the misadministration while reviewing the licensee's Radiation Safety Committee (RSC) meeting minutes
for 1993.

On July 1, 1993, a patient was scheduled to receive the last of three brachytherapy treatments to the right mainstem
bronchus. Each fraction was to deliver 750 centigray (cGy) (750 rad) to the target using a Nucletron Mitro-Selectron
HDR remote afterloader and an intrabronchial catheter. During the July 1, 1993 treatment, the radiation oncologist
mistakenly connected the catheter to the HDR afterloader with a 750 mm (29.5 inch) transfer tube instead of a short
connector. This prevented the source from entering the intrabronchial catheter, and while delivering a negligible
dose to the tumor, the face, the lenses of the eyes, the thyroid, and the whole body of the patient received unscheduled
exposure.

The source strength at the time of the incident was 161,000 megabecquerel (4.35 curie) of iridium-192 and the exposure
time was 445.5 seconds. Following the reconstruction of the incident by the licensee, the surface does to the lens
of the left eye was determined by the licensee to be 1.97 cGy (1.97 rad), the does to the chin (the closest surface of the
body) was 4.56 cGy (4.56 rad), and the dose to the thyroid was 3.07 cGy (3.07 rad). The physician identified the error
upon termination of the treatment and wrote a memorandum about the incident to the hospital's physicist and radiation
safety officer (RSO).

The physician mistakenly determined that the incident was not a misadministration, and so advised the RSO. The RSO,
relying on the physician's judgment, did not notify NRC and filed the report in the RSC minutes folder. The radiation
oncologist decided against making up the missed third fraction of therapy.

On December 3, 1993, NRC notified the licensee by telephone that the event constituted a misadministration and the
licensee notified the NRC Operations Center the same day. The licensee's written report of the misadministration,
dated December 13, 1993, was received in the 
NRC Region I office on December 17, 1993.

After review of the report, Region I called the licensee to determine if the referring physician and the patient were
notified of the misadministration. The licensee forwarded a copy of a letter dated December 20, 1993, from the radiation
oncologist to the referring physician confirming a December 6, 1993, telephone conversation in which the referring
physician was informed of the misadministration. The letter indicated that the referring physician did not feel
it would be in the patient's best interest to be notified of the misadministration.

NRC contracted a medical consultant to determine the significance of the misadministration to the patient. The medical
consultant's report was received by Region I on February 3, 1994. The consultant's calculations of doses to the lens
of the left eye, the chin, and the thyroid of the patient agreed with the licensee's estimates, based on the strength
of the source, the time of exposure and the distances of the source from the patient. The consultant concluded that
the patient would not suffer any adverse effects from the misadministration. The medical consultant also determined
that the oncologist failed to notify the patient of the misadministration because he did not fully understand the
requirements of 10 CFR 35.33(a)(3). After discussions with the consultant, the referring physician agreed to inform
the patient of the misadministration.



Cause or Causes

_An error by the attending physician in connecting the catheter to the HDR remote afterloader, and the failure of the
console operator to recognize the faulty connection were the direct causes of the event. Both individuals relied
on the treatment computer to indicate any problems with the therapy setup. The computer on a Nucletron HDR is not designed
to alert the user to an incorrect connection of a longer transfer tube.

In addition, the medical consultant's report indicates that the second individual observing the transfer tube connection
during each treatment setup was a different console operator. Since the console operator in attendance during the
third treatment had not been present during the prior treatments, he/she was unaware of the intended setup.



Actions Taken to Prevent Occurrence






Licensee

_The licensee arranged for additional training by Nucletron on July 30, 1993. The training was attended by both HDR
remote afterloader units authorized users and by three technologist-console operators.



NRC

_NRC is reviewing the licensee's December 17, 1993 misadministration report and the findings of the December 1, 1993
NRC inspection. An NRC medical consultant was retained to review the misadministration.

The medical consultant's report dated February 1, 1994, was received by the NRC Region I office on February 3, 1994.
(The medical consultant's report will be placed in the file for Docket No. 03-02470 located in the Region I Materials
License Docket Room. An inspection report will be issued to the licensee by February 18, 1994, and will be available
in the PDR.) In addition to the comment made in the above sections, the consultant indicated that if the licensee had
required a medical physicist to be present during every setup and treatment as recommended in NRC Bulletin 93-01,
it is likely that this misadministration would not have occurred. In the consultant's opinion, a medical physicist
would have been more likely to have noticed the human error in the setup of the third HDR treatment. An enforcement conference
has been scheduled.

Exposure to a Nursing Infant at Queen's Hospital in Honolulu, Hawaii



One of the AO reporting guidelines notes that a moderate exposure to, or release of, radioactive material licensed
by or otherwise regulated by the Commission can be considered an abnormal occurrence.

Date and Place

_December 2, 1991; Queen's Medical Center; Honolulu, Hawaii.



Nature and Probable Consequences_

On October 25, 1993, during a routine safety inspection, a Region V inspector discovered an unreported unscheduled
exposure to the thyroid of a 9-month-old nursing infant. On December 2, 1991, a patient was administered 0.56 megabecquerel
(15 microcuries) of iodine-131 for a diagnostic scan. Although the patient noted on a hospital form that she was breastfeeding,
the technologist failed to notice this notation until the patient returned for a scan the following day. The patient
was informed of the oversight by the licensee and was instructed to stop breastfeeding. The authorized user and the
referring physician were also notified on December 3, 1991.

The licensee's Radiation Safety Officer calculated the infant's absorbed thyroid dose to be approximately 250 millisievert
(mSv) (25 rem) based on information obtained during the uptake scan of the mother 6 hours after the administration.

The NRC retained a medical consultant to evaluate the circumstances of this misadministration. The consultant estimated
the dose to the infant's thyroid to be between 160 to 650 mSv (16 to 65 rem). The medical consultant concluded that the
infant is not likely to experience any adverse effects as a result of this misadministration.



Cause or Causes

_Failure of a supervised technologist to adequately review the hospital form used to inform the hospital staff that
a patient is pregnant or breastfeeding as he/she was instructed by the authorized user.



Actions Taken to Prevent Recurrence





Licensee

_The screening procedure used to inform the hospital staff that a patient is pregnant or breastfeeding was incorporated
into the clinical procedure manual. It was reviewed by each of the technologists, and it will be reviewed by all new
technologists upon being hired. It will also be reviewed annually during a radiation safety training course.



NRC_

NRC conducted inspections on September 28 and October 25-27, 1993. The December 2, 1991 misadministration
was noted and reviewed during these inspections. A number of violations were identified as a result of these inspections
and escalated enforcement actions are being considered. An NRC medical consultant was also retained to review the
case.

Nature and Probable Consequences

_A patient was being treated for lung cancer. The treatment included performing an iridium-192 therapeutic implant.
The prescribed treatment dose was 6000 rad to the patient's lung. On November 10, 1993, a catheter was surgically implanted
in the patient. Iridium-192 seeds, contained in a ribbon, were inserted into the catheter.
Following normal licensee procedure, the physicist requested that the attending nurse order a ``stat'' chest x-ray
in order to verify source position. The ``stat'' radiograph was completed and two hours later upon review of the film,
the seed positions could not be visualized. Two additional radiographs using different techniques were done. In
the second radiograph, completed one hour later, the seeds were located in the patient's throat. The ribbon was removed
and the physician successfully reinserted the ribbon to the proper location. Another radiograph was done to verify
the source location. The treatment time was recalculated to deliver the total original intended dose and the treatment
was completed without further difficulty.
The sources were in the improper location for about three hours, delivering an estimated dose to the larynx area of
about 282 centigray (282 rad). An NRC medical consultant evaluated the medical aspects of the brachytherapy misadministration
and concluded that the dose to the larynx and surrounding area is not clinically significant.
The physician verbally notified the patient of the misadministration following the successful reinsertion of the
source ribbon. A written report was provided to the patient on November 15 1993.


Cause or Causes

_The immediate cause of the misadministration was an apparent crimp in the catheter which resulted in the seeds not
being placed correctly. The seeds were blocked by the crimp at the level of the patient's larynx.
An inexperienced radiation therapy technician implanted the source. During interviews, the physician stated that
it would be difficult for an inexperienced person to know the difference between a properly seated ribbon and when
ribbon insertion was impeded by a crimp in the catheter.


Actions Taken To Prevent Recurrence




Licensee

_The licensee's plan for preventing recurrence of the misadministration included:
(1) Formalizing the dosimetrist's ``rule of practice'' regarding comparison of the ribbon and catheter lengths
prior to source implantation in order to ensure that the ribbon is properly seated;
(2) Providing training to all radiation therapy technologists and each medical physicist in the new procedure;
(3) Requiring that the authorized user physically implant source ribbons;
(4) Requiring that each radiation therapy technologist receive hands on training and instruction in source implantation;
and 
(5) Requiring that the ``stat'' post-insertion radiograph be hand carried to the prescribing physician for evaluation
as soon as possible to determine proper source placement.


NRC

_A special safety inspection was conducted by NRC Region III on January 19, 1994 to review the circumstances surrounding
this misadministration. An NRC medical consultant was also retained to review this case. Based on the results of the
special inspection, NRC identified an apparent violation that is being considered for escalated enforcement action.
(Letter from W.L. Axelson, Director, Division of Radiation Safety and Safeguards, NRC Region III, to Dan Sylvester,
Vice President for Professional Services, Good Samaritan Hospital, forwarded inspection report No. 030-30954/94001,
Docket No. 030-30954, License No. 34-16725-02, dated February 11, 1994.)


93-16 

Medical Brachytherapy Misadministration at Marquette General Hospital in Marquette, Michigan


One of the AO reporting guidelines notes that a therapeutic dose that results in any part of the body receiving unscheduled
radiation can be considered an abnormal occurrence.
Date and Place

_November 17-19, 1993; Marquette General Hospital, Marquette, Michigan.


Nature and Probable Consequences

_On November 17, 1993, a patient was undergoing a brachytherapy procedure using cesium-137 sealed sources placed
in a treatment device (catheter) inserted into the patient's uterus. When the catheter was removed on November 19,
it was observed that it was too short to have been fully inserted into the uterine cavity. The three sources in the catheter
had actually been in the patient's vagina instead of the uterus.
The case was evaluated by an NRC medical consultant who concluded that the lower vagina received a radiation dose of
2,700 centigray (2,700 rad) when it would not have received a significant dose if the treatment had been performed
as planned. The medical consultant concluded that the radiation doses to the vagina would not be expected to cause
any acute or long term effects because the vaginal tissue is extraordinarily tolerant of radiation. This placement
error did not result in additional exposure to other organs.
The intended treatment area received about 50 percent of the intended dose. Subsequently, the patient received an
additional dose to the uterus to complete the prescribed treatment. The licensee informed the patient of the treatment
error.


Cause or Causes

_The hospital routinely uses two lengths of catheters for brachytherapy treatments, a shorter catheter for vaginal
procedures and a longer one for uterine procedures. The medical physicist inadvertently placed the cesium-137 sources
in the shorter (vaginal) catheter instead of the required long catheter for the uterin procedure prescribed.


Actions Taken To Prevent a Recurrence




Licensee

_The hospital has revised its procedures to include added precautions for assuring the correct length catheter is
used in each brachytherapy procedure.


NRC

_The NRC conducted a special inspection beginning November 29, 1993, to review the circumstances surrounding the
misadministration. No violations of NRC regulations were identified, but the licensee was directed to review its
Quality Management Program to determine what modifications were needed to prevent similar misadministrations
in the future. The NRC also retained a medical consultant to evaluate this case.

<DOCTITLE>Entergy Operations, Inc.; Partial Denial of Amendment to Facility Operating License and Opportunity for Hearing</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has partially denied a request by Entergy Operations. Inc.,
(licensee) for an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF-6 issued to the licensee for operation of
the Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit 2, located in Pope County, Arkansas. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of this amendment
was published in the 

Federal Register 

on September 1, 1993 (58 FR 46230). 
The purpose of the licensee's amendment request was to revise the Technical Specifications (TSs) to remove the cycle-specific
variables from the TSs and control them under a new document called the Core Operating Limits Report (COLR), in accordance
with Generic Letter (GL) 88-16. In addition, the proposed amendment would also revise the definition of shutdown
margin in TS 1.13.
The NRC staff has concluded that the licensee's request concerning the shutdown margin (SDM) definition, which is
not related to GL 88-16, is denied since it does not accurately define the starting point for shutdown margin.
The licensee was notified of the Commission's partial denial of the proposed change by a letter dated * * *
By May 27, 1994, the licensee may demand a hearing with respect to the partial denial described above. Any person whose
interest may be affected by this proceeding may file a written petition for leave to intervene.

A request for hearing or petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the
Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555 by the above date.
A copy of any petitions should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Nicholas S. Reynolds, Esquire, Winston and Strawn, 1400 L Street NW., Washington, DC
20005-3502, attorney for the licensee.
For further details with respect to this action, see: (1) The application for amendment dated July 22, 1993, as supplemented
by letter dated October 20, 1993, and (2) the Commission's letter to the licensee dated * * *
These documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,

<USDEPT>PACIFIC NORTHWEST ELECTRIC POWER AND CONSERVATION PLANNING COUNCIL</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program </DOCTITLE>



April 15, 1994. 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council (Northwest Power Planning Council). 


 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Proposed Amendments to the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program (mainstem passage survival hypotheses).



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to the Pacific Electric Power and Conservation Act (the Northwest Power Act, 16 U.S.C. section 839, et seq.)
the Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council (Council) has proposed amendments to the
Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program (program). The amendments propose to establish hypotheses regarding
the relationship between river flows, velocity, transportation, and the survival of anadromous fish in the mainstem
of the Columbia and Snake Rivers. Copies of the proposed amendments are now available, and comments are solicited.



 


BACKGROUND: 

The proposed amendments are intended to facilitate investigation of the relationship between flow, water velocity
and fish survival and the efficacy of smolt transportation. After the conclusion of this rulemaking process, the
Council will consider the need for further actions to reduce mortalities to anadromous fish in the mainstem. The current
rulemaking process, however, is not intended to predetermine any decisions made in the later, summer rulemaking.



 


OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMENT: 

The Council will receive written comment on the proposed amendments through 5 p.m. Pacific time, May 25, 1994. Comments
should be clearly marked ``Mainstem Hypothesis Comments,'' and submitted to the Council's Public Affairs Division,
851 S.W. Sixth Avenue, Suite 1100, Portland, Oregon 97204. After the close of comment, the Council may initiate further
consultations, or reopen the record for further written comment. The Council expects to make a final decision in this
rulemaking process in June, 1994. HEARINGS: The Council is in the process of scheduling hearings in the four Northwest
states. Please call the Council's public affairs division for information on the schedule and location for hearings,
and watch for further information in the Council's newsletter, Update. To reserve a time to testify at a hearing, please
call Ms. Judi Hertz at 1-800-222-3355 (if calling from Idaho, Montana or Washington), 1-800-452-2324
(if calling from Oregon), or 222-5161 (if calling from the Portland area). 



Please contact the Council's Public Affairs Division to reserve a time to testify. Witnesses should be prepared to
summarize briefly, rather than read, any written statement they wish to enter into the record.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock
Exchange, Inc., Relating to the Modification of Trading Hours for the EUROTOP 100 Index



April 20, 1994.



On March 7, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to amend Amex Rule 1 to modify the trading hours for the Exchange's EUROTOP 100 Index (``E-100'').






The proposed rule change was published for comment in the 

Federal Register

 on March 21, 1994.
 No comments were received on the proposed rule change. This order approves the proposal.





In October 1992, the Exchange began trading standardized options on the E-100. The E-100 measures the
collective performance of the most actively traded stocks on Europe's major stock exchanges. This broad-based index
is calculated continuously from 5 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (11 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Central European time).
The Exchange's trading hours for options on the E-100 are from 8:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. (New York time). The one hour
earlier opening was adopted in order to attract European investors as well as to conform more closely with trading
hours for futures contracts on the E-100 traded at the New York Commodity Exchange (``COMEX''), which begins
trading at 7:30 a.m. (New York time).

However, in the aftermath of the bombing of the World Trade Center in February 1993, the COMEX curtailed trading hours
for all of its products and has continued to cease trading the E-100 futures contract at 11:30 a.m. (New York time),
since such time corresponds with the cessation of trading of the underlying component securities in the European
markets.
 The Exchange has proposed to modify the trading hours for its E-100 options to cease trading at 11:30 a.m. as well,
since these hours will correspond more closely to the current trading hours for E-100 futures contract at the
COMEX.





The Exchange believes that its current trading hours for E-100 options expose both the specialists and market
makers to undue risk after both the underlying component securities and the E-100 futures contract have stopped
trading, since they are unable to hedge their market risk effectively.

The Exchange will give its membership two weeks notice of the change in E-100 trading hours. An information circular
advising the membership of the new closing time of 11:30 a.m. will be sent by facsimile to the Exchange's contracts
at the major options firms, mailed to recipients of the Exchange's options related information circulars, and made
available to subscribers of the Options News Network.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section
6(b)(5),
 in that the proposal is designed to facilitate transactions in securities and to protect investors and the public
interest. Specifically, the Commission believes that the continuation of trading in options on the E-100 after
trading in the E-100 futures contract has ended may place undue risks on Amex specialists and market makers in
light of their inability to hedge their option positions effectively with the E-100 futures contract during
that time. The Commission also believes that the Exchange's commitment to provide two weeks advance notice of the
change in the E-100 options trading hours, as well as the manner in which such notice will be circulated, will
ensure that all market participants are aware of the reduced trading hours, and as such will serve to protect investors
and the public interest. Therefore, the Commission concludes that modifying the closing time for options on the E-100
from 4:30 p.m. to 11:30 a.m., to correspond the E-100 option trading hours more closely with the trading hours
for the E-100 futures contract on the COMEX, will facilitate transactions in securities, remove impediments
to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market, and, generally, protect investors and the public interest.





The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

, in recognition of the fact that the closing time for the E-100 futures contract already had been changed to 11:30
a.m. as of March 1, 1993. Given the potential risks to which specialists and market makers have been exposed since the
reduction of the E-100 futures trading hours, the Commission believes that accelerating approval of the proposed
rule change will help to minimize such risks, and thus promote just and equitable principles of trade and perfect the
mechanism of a free and open market. In addition, the original proposal was published for the full 21-day comment period,
and no comments were received. As a result, the Commission finds good cause for accelerating approval of the proposed
rule change.



It is therefore ordered,

 pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-Amex-94-07) is approved on an accelerated basis. 






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.,
Relating to the Maintenance by Members of Certain Written Policies and Procedures</DOCTITLE>



April 20, 1994.



On December 20, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act''),
 and rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposal to amend Exchange Rule 4.18, ``Prevention of Misuse of Material, Nonpublic Information,'' to provide
that a CBOE member who is a lessor of a membership and is not registered, not required to register, as a broker-dealer
under section 15 of the Act, is not subject to the requirements of Exchange Rule 4.18 concerning the establishment,
maintenance, and enforcement of written policies and procedures respecting the misuse of material, non-public
information.








The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33425 (January 5, 1994),
59 FR 1573. No comments were received on the proposed rule change.

Currently, CBOE Rule 4.18 requires every CBOE member to ``establish, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed, taking into consideration the nature of such member's business, to prevent the misuse, in violation
of the Act and Exchange Rules, of material, nonpublic information by such member or persons associated with such member.''
The CBOE proposes to amend Exchange Rule 4.18 to provide that a member who is a lessor of a membership, and who is not registered
as a broker-dealer or required to be registered, and who performs no other function in respect of the membership is
not subject to the requirements of Exchange Rule 4.18 concerning the establishment, maintenance, and enforcement
of written policies and procedures respecting the misuse of material, non-public information. The Exchange believes
that lessor members that do not conduct any securities business in respect of their membership, and, as a result, are
not required to register as broker-dealers under Section 15 of the Act, should not be subject to the written policy
and procedure requirements of Exchange Rule 4.18. Accordingly, the CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rule 4.18 to clarify
that members who perform no function in respect to their membership except as lessors, and that are not otherwise required
to register as broker-dealers under the Act, do not have to establish, maintain or enforce written policies and procedures
precluding the misuse of non-public information.

The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of section 6(b)(5) of the Act, in particular, in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles
of trade and to protect investors and the public interest by eliminating unnecessary costs and burdens without impairing
the CBOE's capacity to meet the requirements of the Act.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section
6(b)(5)
 in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect investors and the public interest.
The Commission believes that the proposal will benefit CBOE members who are lessors of memberships and who are not
registered or required to register as broker-dealers under the Act by eliminating the costs and burdens of establishing
the procedures required under CBOE Rule 4.18. The Commission agrees with the CBOE's assertion that lessor members
who do not conduct any securities business in respect of their membership and who are not required to register as broker-dealers
under the Act should not be subject to the requirements of Exchange Rule 4.18, which are meaningful only to an ongoing
securities business. Because such lessor members, unlike other members involved in the securities business, are
not likely to receive material, nonpublic information from their limited role as a lessor of a CBOE membership, the
Commission believes that the CBOE's proposal is a reasonable effort by the Exchange to eliminate an unnecessary burden
for lessor members.





In addition, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the existing language of CBOE Rule 4.18,
which requires members to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies ``taking into consideration the nature
of such member's business. . . .'' Since CBOE Rule 4.18 is intended to require members to adopt procedures
to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information, it is consistent with CBOE Rule 4.18 for the CBOE to exempt
from the rule's requirements lessor members who are not involved in the securities business.

At the same time, the CBOE's proposal should not compromise the effectiveness of Exchange Rule 4.18. Specifically,
the Commission notes that the exemption from the requirements of Exchange Rule 4.18 applies solely to lessor members
who are not registered, or required to register, as broker-dealers under the Act. If a member is required to register
as a broker-dealer, then he must immediately establish the procedures required under CBOE Rule 4.18.








It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act
 that the proposed rule change (SR-CBOE-93-58) is approved.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating
to Health Care Portfolio Market Index Target-Term Securities


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 notice is hereby given that on April 12, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items
I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The Exchange proposes to list for trading Market Index Target-Term Securities (``MITTS''),
 the return on which is based upon a portfolio of securities of U.S. companies in the health care industry (``Health
Care Portfolio''), Initially, the Health Care Portfolio will contain the securities of 22 health care companies
that are traded in the United States on the NYSE or are National Market System securities traded through the facilities
of the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System (``NASDAQ'').






II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in the Item IV below. The NYSE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and
C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


Pursuant to the listing criteria set forth in Section 703.19 of the Exchange's Listed Company Manual (``Manual''),
the Exchange proposes to list and trade MITTS. MITTS are securities that entitle the holder to receive from the issuer
upon maturity an amount based upon the change in the market value of a stock index or portfolio, provided that a minimum
amount (90% of the principal amount) will be repaid. The Exchange is submitting the proposed rule change specifically
to enable the Exchange to list for trading MITTS on the Health Care Portfolio (``Health Care Portfolio MITTS'') issued
by Merrill Lynch.
Health Care Portfolio MITTS will allow investors to combine protection of a substantial portion of the principal
amount of the MITTS with the potential additional payments based on a portfolio of securities of selected health care
companies. The Health Care Portfolio MITTS will provide that at least 90% of the principal amount thereof will be repaid
at maturity.

<PARENT> FR940428-2-00058 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Security 


Health Care Portfolio MITTS will entitle the owner at maturity to receive an amount based upon the percentage change
between the ``Original Portfolio Value'' and the ``Ending Average Portfolio Value,'' subject to a minimum repayment
amount. The ``Original Portfolio Value'' is the value of the Health Care Portfolio on the date on which the issuer prices
the Health Care Portfolio MITTS issue for the initial offering to the public. The ``Ending Average Portfolio Value''
is the average of the values of the Health Care Portfolio at the end of the five calendar quarters preceding the expiration
of the Health Care Portfolio MITTS on December 31, 1999.
 The Ending Average Portfolio Value will be used in calculating the amount owners will receive upon maturity.
 






If the market value of the portfolio has declined, the owner will receive not less than a specified percentage of the
principal amount of the security. (For instance, if the market value of the portfolio used to calculate the amount
payable at maturity has declined more than 10%, the owners of the Health Care Portfolio MITTS will receive 90% of the
principal amount of the securities.) The payment at maturity is based on changes in the value of the portfolio, but
does not reflect the payment of dividends on the securities that comprise the portfolio. 

As with other MITTS, Health Care Portfolio MITTS may not be redeemed prior to maturity and are not callable by the issuer.
Owners may sell the security on the Exchange. The Exchange anticipates that the trading value of the security in the
secondary market will depend in large part on the value of the Health Care Portfolio and also on other factors, including
the level of interest rates, the volatility of the value of the Health Care Portfolio, the time remaining to maturity,
dividend rates, and the creditworthiness of the issuer. 

The Exchange will only list for trading Health Care Portfolio MITTS issues that have at least one million outstanding
securities, at least 400 owners, a minimum life of one year and at least a $4 million market value, and that otherwise
comply with the Exchange's initial listing criteria. In addition, the Exchange will monitor each issue to verify
that it complies with the Exchange's continued listing criteria.
 





Merrill Lynch will deposit registered securities representing Health Care Portfolio MITTS with its depository,
the Depository Trust Company (``DTC''), so as to permit book-entry settlement of transactions by participants in
DTC. 



The Portfolio 



The Health Care Portfolio consists of the common stock of 22 highly capitalized health care companies. The common
stock of the 22 companies initially will be equally weighted within the portfolio on the pricing date. The public float
(i.e., the market price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding) of the 22 companies differ significantly
(from a high of $28 billion (Bristol Meyers Squibb Co.) to a low of $285 million (Horizon Healthcare Corp.)), as do the
market prices of their common stock (from a high of $84.625 (United Healthcare Corporation) to a low of $15.375 (Beverly
Enterprises, Inc.)).

<PARENT> FR940428-2-00058 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The common stock of 19 of the 22 component companies is listed on the Exchange. The common stock of the other three component
companies is traded through NASDAQ. At the outset, the common stock of each of the companies represented in the Health
Care Portfolio will have equal representation. That is, the common stock of each company included in the portfolio
shall be assigned a multiplier on the pricing date such that all component companies represent an equal percentage
of the value of the entire portfolio on such date. The multiplier indicates the number of shares of common stock (or
fraction of one share) included in the calculation of the portfolio. Thus, each of the 22 companies represented shall
represent 4.545% of the total portfolio on the pricing date.
The multipliers assigned to the component companies will be adjusted for certain events such as stock splits, reverse
stock splits, or stock dividends, and the value of the component securities will also be adjusted for certain events
including a liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency, merger, or consolidation involving the issuer of the underlying
shares. For example, if the issuer of the shares underlying a component company has been subject to a merger or a consolidation
and is not the surviving entity, then a value for such common stock will be determined at the time such issuer is merged
or consolidated and will equal the last available market price for such common stock and that value will be constant
for the remaining term of the Health Care Portfolio MITTS.





Based upon the reported prices of the common stock, a Merrill Lynch affiliate or an independent third party will calculate
the value of the Health Care Portfolio on at least a daily basis and make those values available to investors.


The Issuer


The Exchange has determined that the issuer of the Health Care Portfolio MITTS, Merrill Lynch, meets the listing criteria
set forth in Section 703.19 of the Manual. The Exchange states that Merrill Lynch is an Exchange-listed company in
good standing and has sufficient assets to justify the issuance of MITTS offerings of the size contemplated by the
proposed rule change.
The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and with section
6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote
just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market
and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The NYSE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others


No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:
(A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or
(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-NYSE-94-14
and should be submitted by May 19, 1994.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule
Change Relating to Exclusion of Class Action Claims From Arbitration</DOCTITLE>



April 20, 1994.



On November 4, 1993, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(1)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
, and rule 19b-4 thereunder.
 The proposal amends section 12 of the NASD Code of Arbitration Procedure
 (``Code'') by barring any NASD member or its associated persons from seeking to enforce an agreement to arbitrate
against another member or associated person if that member or associated person has initiated in court a putative
class action or is a member of a putative or certified class. The prohibition would extend to all claims encompassed
by the class action.







Notice of the proposed rule change, together with the substance of the proposal, was provided by issuance of a Commission
release (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33506, February 9, 1994) and by publication in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 7282, February 15, 1994). No comment letters were received. This order approves the proposed rule change.

Section 12(d)(3) of the Code currently bars members or associated persons from seeking to enforce an agreement to
arbitrate against a customer where the customer has initiated in court a putative class action or is a member of a putative
or certified class with respect to any claims encompassed by the class action. The section, however, omits specific
reference to claims filed by associated persons against members and claims filed by members against other members.
As a result, some respondents have argued that class actions encompassing such claimants can be submitted to arbitration
under the Code. The NASD determined that the original intent of the section was to exclude class action claims by associated
persons, including employment-related claims, and other industry class actions from arbitration, as well as customer-related
class actions. Accordingly, the NASD proposed to amend section 12(d)(3) of the Code to clarify that the prohibition
in the provision is total and encompasses class actions in which a member or an associated person may be the subject
of a class action.

The amendment to section 12(d)(3) of the Code adds references to ``other member and person associated with a member''
to clarify that the prohibition against seeking to enforce an agreement to arbitrate applies not only to class actions
in which a claimant is a customer, but to class actions in which an associated person or a member is a party.






The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD and, in particular, the requirements of section 15A(b)(6) of the Act.
 Section 15A(b)(6) requires, 

inter alia,

 that the NASD's rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, promote just and equitable principles
of trade, and protect investors and the public interest. Over the years of the evolution of class action litigation,
the courts have developed the procedures and expertise for managing class actions. Duplication of the often complex
procedural safeguards necessary for these lawsuits is unnecessary. The Commission also believes that access to
the courts for class action litigation should be preserved for associated persons and member firms as well as for investors
and that the rule change approved herein provides a sound procedure for the management of class actions. The proposed
rule change also should prevent wasteful litigation over the possible applicability of agreements to arbitrate
between members or between a member and a person associated with a member notwithstanding the exclusion of class action
claims from NASD arbitration. Based on the above, the Commission believes that the rule change herein approved should
promote the efficient resolution of these class action disputes. For these reasons, and for the reasons stated above,
the Commission believes that the proposed rule change satisfies the requirements of section 15A(b)(6) of the Act.







It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the instant rule change be, and hereby is, approved.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12).

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Proposed Rule Change by National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Relating
to Non-member Access to SelectNet</DOCTITLE>



April 20, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on March 31, 1994 the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described
in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.







I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The NASD is proposing two modifications to the operation of SelectNet, the system designed to facilitate communication,
negotiation and execution of orders between NASD member firms. The first such modification will provide real-time
access to non-members to view all ``broadcast'' orders in SelectNet immediately as they are entered. The second modification
provides for the transmission of such orders solely on an anonymous basis through the service.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The Nasdaq Stock Market is proposing modifications to the operations of the SelectNet service that would permit access
by non-members who are subscribers to the Nasdaq Workstation Level 2 service to view broadcast orders immediately
as they are entered into the service. SelectNet is the service operated by The Nasdaq Stock Market that permits NASD
member firms to enter buy or sell orders in Nasdaq securities into the system, direct those orders to a single market
maker (preferenced orders) or broadcast the order to all market makers in the security. Originally implemented in
its predecessor form in 1988 as the Order Confirmation Transaction service,
 the primary function of that service was to offer an automated alternative to the telephone as a method of contacting
market makers in times of market stress. To this end, order entry firms could direct or preference an order to buy or
sell a Nasdaq security to a single market maker in the issue. When the service was enhanced and renamed SelectNet in
1990,
 the broadcast feature was added to permit a wider dissemination of orders to all market makers in an issue. In addition,
the redesigned system allowed market makers in a subject security to send a broadcast order to all member firms that
had designated that security in their SelectNet ``watch file,''
 whether the firm was a market maker or not. In 1992, the service was expanded to add pre-opening and after-hours sessions,
 so that today SelectNet is available for members to negotiate and execute orders from 9 a.m. until 5:15 p.m. Eastern
Time.










The Nasdaq Stock Market operates SelectNet to provide investors and members with an automated system to facilitate
communication of trading interest between members, negotiation of orders with the possibility of price improvement
with automated, locked-in executions, and dissemination of last sale reports to the tape. In addition, SelectNet
retains the original functionality of the service as a replacement for one-on-one communication between members,
especially in times of market stress. Since its enhancement in December 1990, the service has grown in popularity
with members and traffic has increased significantly_from an average of 3,000 transactions and 6 million shares
daily in the first half of 1991 to over 11,000 transactions and more than 16 million shares daily in the last quarter
of 1993. As the system's usage has increased, institutions and other non-members have expressed a desire to see the
orders broadcast within the service. The NASD believes that it is now appropriate to disclose SelectNet broadcast
orders to non-member Nasdaq Workstation Level 2 subscribers, in order to render the orders in the system more transparent
to investors.

An important facet of the Division of Market Regulation's 

Market 2000

 study was increasing transparency in SelectNet by making SelectNet orders more visible for investors.
 The Division recommended that the NASD examine how to improve access to information regarding orders entered into
SelectNet, consistent with goals of increased transparency. Specifically, the Division stated that expanded dissemination
of SelectNet information is essential for providing data to investors regarding the prices at which investors and
dealers are willing to transact business in a particular security.
 Accordingly, this rule proposal directly responds to one of the Division's key suggestions designed to improve the
transparency of orders broadcast through the SelectNet service.

Because of the additional non-member constituencies that will be able to view all broadcast orders, the NASD is also
proposing to modify its order-entry procedure for SelectNet to ensure that broadcast orders are entered into and
displayed through SelectNet anonymously. This feature is proposed for two reasons: To preserve incentives for dealers
to continue to make markets that add liquidity to the market and to avoid conditioning the market in one direction or
another by orders identified with particular market makers or order entry firms. First, the NASD believes that it
is very important to retain incentives for market makers to participate in the market. Market makers put quotes in
the Nasdaq system as a form of advertisement that they stand ready and willing to transact business at their quoted
prices and sizes. There are obligations that accrue to those market makers, however, the NASD and the SEC require market
makers to be firm for their quotes and to participate in order execution systems. Enabling order entry firms to advertise
buy and sell interest freely, with no concomitant market maker obligations, by attaching their names to SelectNet
orders so that anyone with a Workstation would be able to contact the entity directly by telephone, would eviscerate
the positive attributes of being a market maker with a quote in the Nasdaq system.
Second, allowing market makers (or order entry firms) to put their names on broadcast orders might condition or influence
the market in a security by advertising the buying or selling power of the member firm. For example, if a broker/dealer
that is considered a lead market maker or a major institutional block positioner in a security was interested in buying
shares in the stock, it might broadcast a sell order in SelectNet, identify its name on the order, and cause the market
to react to the sell interest and the power of the firm's name. Accordingly, other market makers in the stock might react
to the sell interest by dropping their bids and the lead market maker would be able to buy stock at a lower price than would
otherwise have been the case, simply because it was advertising its name, or conditioning the market. Indeed, similar
conditioning effects might be caused by an firm, order entry firm or market maker, by entering orders that are quickly
canceled without actual trading interest by the entry firm. Accordingly, the NASD proposes that member firms enter
all broadcast orders anonymously.
Although orders must be entered on an anonymous basis, once two firms are in negotiation over the terms of the broadcast
order, the order entry firm may of course identify itself to the contra side.
 The information on SelectNet broadcast orders will be made available to members and non-member subscribers in the
Nasdaq Workstation Level 2 service. This proposal is intended to avoid conditioning the market with orders that might
be canceled at any time without actual trading interest by the order entry firm.




Accordingly, the Nasdaq Stock Market is proposing modifications to SelectNet to permit non-member, viewing access,
to all SelectNet broadcast orders immediately as the orders are entered into the system; and to require all broadcast
orders to be entered and disseminated on an anonymous basis.
The NASD believes the proposed rule change is consistent with sections 15A(b)(6) and 11A(a)(1)(C) of the Act and is
a particularly timely and germane response to the recommendations contained in the

 Market 2000

 study. Section 15A(b)(6) requires that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and
coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to,
and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open
market and a national market system and in general to protect investors and the public interest. Section 11A(a)(1)(C)
finds that it is in the public interest to, among other things, assure the availability to brokers, dealers, and investors
of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities and economically efficient execution
of securities transactions. The SelectNet service has served as an alternative to the telephone in times of market
stress and as a system to broadcast orders to market makers for economically efficient negotiations and executions.
By permitting non-members to view those broadcast orders, the NASD is removing impediments to transparency of market
information and is facilitating transactions for those non-members who will now be able to see all broadcast orders
in the service and timely arrange for the execution of such orders by a member. Although the orders in SelectNet do not
represent quotations or trades reports, which are customarily disseminated to the public by Nasdaq, the NASD believes
that the information is valuable to investors and market participants and should be transparent and disseminated
to non-members.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The NASD believes that the proposed rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or
appropriate in furtherance of purposed of the Act.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others


The issue of non-member access to SelectNet has been the topic of careful, in depth discussion of many different committees
of the NASD and its subsidiaries for the past two years. Discussions have fully aired the concerns of members with permitting
disclosure to non-members of order information in an NASD-operated order negotiation system. While the constituencies
agreed to open up SelectNet to non-members, differing degrees of non-member access were considered and debated.
Some members recommended allowing non-member access to SelectNet following a short interval for market makers to
interact with orders in the system. Non-members advocated immediate dissemination of SelectNet broadcast orders.
All concurred that the original functionality of SelectNet as an alternative to the telephone should be preserved.
After extensive venting of germane issues in numerous committees of members and non-members, a consensus position
was achieved recommending Board approval of immediate non-member access to SelectNet broadcast orders. The Board
received two comment letters on the proposal, one from the Investment Company Institute (``ICI'') advocating approval
of the proposal and another from the Security Traders Association (``STA'') recommending disapproval. The ICI argued
that in order for mutual funds and other institutions to be able to fulfill their fiduciary obligations it was vital
that they be given access to all relevant market information. The STA took the opposite position and stated that since
SelectNet was developed as a private means for market makers to communicate with each other and negotiate orders,
it was not appropriate to make these private business communications available to customers. The STA also argued
that the vocal institutional proponents of access to SelectNet are customers of NASD member firms and that there must
be a separation between members, non-members and their customers without jeopardizing the customers' entitlement
to best execution. The STA also predicted that non-member access to SelectNet might result in greater volatility,
wider spreads and less liquidity because non-members may not demonstrate the same ethical standards with which members
are required to abide. The NASD Board considered these arguments carefully. The SelectNet service retains its capacity
for private communication between members in that the preferencing functions have not been modified or opened up
to non-member access. In addition, the NASD Board concluded that displaying SelectNet orders to all investors who
subscribe to Nasdaq Level II service would increase the efficiency of the market and enhance their ability to monitor
the quality of executions they receive. Moreover, the Board concluded that there is no basis to assume that greater
transparency of order information to investors will result in wider spreads or less liquidity; indeed, historically
the opposite has proven to be the case. Accordingly, the Board approved non-member access to SelectNet broadcast
orders in the interests of enhanced transparency of order information and more open market operations.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the NASD consents, the Commission will:
A. By order approve such proposed rule change, or
B. Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principle office
of the NASD. All submissions should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by May 19, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change To Adopt Interpretation
and Policy to Exchange Rule Relating to the Filing of a Uniform Termination Notice for Securities Industry Registration</DOCTITLE>



April 21, 1994.



I. Introduction



On December 23, 1993, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to adopt Interpretation and Policy .03 to CHX Rule 3, Article VI relating to the filing of a Uniform
Termination Notice for Securities Industry Registration (``Form U-5''). On January 21, 1994, the CHX submitted
to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change.








The proposed rule change, together with Amendment No. 1, was noticed for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release
No. 33499 (January 21, 1994), 59 FR 4127 (January 28, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves
the proposed rule change, including Amendment No. 1.



II. Description of the Proposal



The Exchange is adopting Interpretation and Policy .03 to CHX Rule 3, Article VI relating to the filing of a Form U-5
following the termination of a person associated with a member.
 The new Interpretation and Policy requires members for which the Exchange is the Designated Examining Authority
(``DEA'') to notify the Exchange of the discharge or termination of any person associated with the member by submitting
to the Exchange a Form U-5 within 30 days of such termination date. In addition, the new Interpretation and Policy
requires similar notification by other member organizations with respect to their associated registered persons
active on the Exchange trading floor.
 Finally, the Interpretation and Policy requires members to provide a copy of the notice to the person whose association
has been terminated.

The Exchange stated that requiring the submission of a Form U-5 would allow the Exchange to more precisely monitor
the authority of registered persons to act on behalf of member firms and monitor the reasons for termination. The Exchange
believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, which provides, in pertinent
part, that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and practices, and, in general, protect investors and the public interest.



III. Discussion



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act.
 Section 6(b)(5) requires that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade,
to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of
a free and open market, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.





The Commission believes that requiring members to report to the Exchange on Form U-5 following the termination
of an associated person is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest by assisting the Exchange
in its oversight of industry personnel. The requirement for prompt submission of notices of termination should provide
the Exchange with more accurate and timely reporting of information necessary for effective monitoring of personnel
on the Exchange floor and other persons associated with members where the CHX is the DEA. The timely submission of this
Form U-5 information should assist the Exchange in monitoring the continuous entry, movement, and departure
of individuals associated with an Exchange member, as well as changes in their employment histories and the reasons
for the termination. Such information will be useful to the Exchange in carrying out its responsibilities as DEA for
members. This information also will be useful to the Exchange with respect to members where the CHX is not the DEA, but
where registered associated persons of the member are active on the Exchange trading floor, by disclosing the reasons
for the termination of various floor personnel and ensuring that the CHX has prompt notification of the termination.

The Commission believes that the new provision that requires a member to provide a copy of the notice to the terminated
person would allow such terminated person an opportunity to review the statements made on the Form U-5, which
in turn, should help ensure the accuracy and completeness of the statements made on the Form.



It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to section 19(b)((2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-CHX-93-33) is approved.







For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Notice of Filing and Order Granting
Accelerated Temporary Approval of Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Quotation Linkage With the London Stock Exchange</DOCTITLE>


April 21, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on April 12, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described
in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



On October 2, 1987, the Commission issued an order approving operation of a market information linkage between the
NASD and the London Stock Exchange (``LSE'') (formerly, the International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and
the Republic of Ireland) for a pilot term of two years.
 This experimental linkage supports an interchange of quotation information (``linkage information'') on about
740 securities (``linkage securities''); of that total, each marketplace has designated approximately half as
its ``pilot group'' of linkage securities. NASD and LSE members that function as market makers in one or more of a subset
of linkage securities that are quoted in both the Nasdaq and LSE dealer systems (``common issues'') are entitled to
access linkage information without paying a separate charge to receive it. Operation of the linkage in this fashion
comports with the terms of the Commission's October 1987 Order. Most recently, the Commission authorized an extension
of this pilot linkage through May 5, 1994, by approving File No. SR-NASD-93-55.







Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Act and Rule 19b-4 thereunder, the NASD hereby files this proposed rule change
to obtain Commission approval for continuation of the NASD/LSE pilot linkage through October 31, 1994.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The purpose of this rule filing is to obtain an extension of the Commission's interim approval of the NASD/LSE linkage
through October 31, 1994. Absent an extension, authorization for the linkage will expire as of May 5, 1994.

For some time now, the sponsors of this linkage have considered various possibilities for its future development
in meeting the needs of the international investment community. Both markets have also launched major initiatives
to migrate their core processing and communications facilities to state-of-the-art technologies that will yield
operational efficiencies and enhanced capacity. In this connection, the LSE has notified the NASD that the progression
of the LSE's technology migration will foreclose continued operation of the NASD/LSE linkage after October 31, 1994.
Accordingly, the NASD is requesting that the Commission extend its interim approval of the NASD/LSE linkage through
October 31, 1994. The NASD does not anticipate further extension beyond that date.

The NASD submits that the statutory basis for the NASD/LSE pilot linkage and the requested extension thereof, are
contained in Sections 11A(a)(1) (B) and (C) and 15A(b)(6) of the Act. Subsections (B) and (C) of Section 11A(a)(1)
set forth the Congressional goals of achieving more efficient and effective market operations, the availability
of information with respect to quotations for securities and the execution of investor orders in the best market through
the application of new data processing and communications techniques. Section 15A(b)(6) requires, among other
things, that the rules of the NASD be designed to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating,
clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, and
to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market. The NASD believes that the requested extension
of the linkage's temporary authorization is fully consistent with the policy goals reflected in these statutory
provisions.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



In its original release announcing interim approval of the NASD/LSE pilot linkage, the Commission referenced certain
competitive concerns raised by Instinet Corporation (``Instinet'') through counsel.
 In response, the NASD, after consultation with the LSE, made a good faith effort to address those concerns by narrowing
the universe of firms and terminals permitted access to linkage information at no cost. Those changes were reflected
in File No. SR-NASD-87-20, which the Commission approved by issuing the October 1987 Order. With
respect to File No. SR-NASD-89-44 (which resulted in extension of the linkage's authorization
until December 1, 1990), the NASD also submitted statistical and cost information relative to its participation
in the pilot project. Given that the NASD/LSE linkage will be terminated on or shortly before October 31, 1994, the
NASD believes that the instant rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.





C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



Written comments were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The NASD requested that the Commission find good cause for approving this proposed rule change prior to the 30th day
following publication of notice of the filing in the 

Federal Register, 

and, in any event, by May 5, 1994, the expiration of the linkage's present authorization. The NASD believes that the
requested extension of the pilot period is fully consistent with the statutory provisions and policy goals referenced
in Section II of this Rule 19b-4 filing. Moreover, the NASD argued the additional time will enable the sponsoring markets
to effect an orderly termination of this experimental project. Under the circumstances, the Commission finds that
allowing the NASD/LSE linkage to cease abruptly would be counterproductive.


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD and, in particular, the requirements of Sections 11A(a)(1) (B) and
(C) and 15A(b)(6), and the rules and regulations thereunder.


The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the 30th day after the date of publication
of notice of filing thereof. Accelerated approval will avoid an unnecessary interruption of the pilot linkage while
allowing the NASD and LSE to provide for an orderly termination of this experimental program in the final quarter of
1994.
 
Accordingly, under these circumstances, the Commission believes the NASD/LSE linkage should be permitted to continue
operating, without a hiatus, for a brief period sufficient to bridge the migration to new technologies being developed
by the sponsoring markets.





IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the NASD. All submissions should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by May 19, 1994.




It is therefore ordered,

 pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change be, and hereby is, approved for an additional
period, inclusive of October 31, 1994.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.,
Relating to Enhanced Parity Split for Specialists.</DOCTITLE>



April 20, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on February 28, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III
below, which Items have been prepared by the Phlx. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on
the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Phlx, pursuant to Rule 19b-4 of the Act, proposes a one-year pilot program to permit Phlx equity option specialists
to receive an enhanced participation in parity trades based upon certain conditions and subject to a review procedure.
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the Phlx, and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Phlx has prepared summaries, set forth in section (A), (B), and
(C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



Phlx Rules 119 and 120, generally, and Phlx Rule 1014(g), specifically, direct members in the establishment of priority
and parity of orders on the options floor. These rules provide that when bids/offers are made simultaneously, or when
it is impossible to determine clearly the order of time in which they were made, all such bids/offers shall be on parity,
and as such shall be shared equally. This equal sharing of parity trades among a specialist and Registered Options
Traders (``ROTs'') has served the Exchange well in a market structure where certain options classes are listed exclusively
on the Phlx. Because all newly listed options classes are subject to multiple listing and all currently listed ones
are or will become so eligible, the current parity participation rule has come under review.

The Exchange represents that while ROTs provide critical liquidity to the market making process at the Phlx, under
the Phlx's specialist system, the role of the specialist is to provide leadership, liquidity, and continuity, and
satisfy market making obligations in multiply listed options classes, particularly at the incipiency of competition
for a multiply traded issue. For the options classes that will be eligible for multiple listing, the Exchange represents
that specialists have also taken on a larger market making obligation in order to accommodate customers in the hope
of garnering critical loyalty that will lead to sustained order flow whether the class is or is not ever actually multiply
traded.

Furthermore, the Exchange has identified the need to attract new specialist units and retain and encourage current
specialists units to vigorously trade existing options classes as well as to aggressively seek and apply for newly
allocated classes. The Phlx understands that many if not most specialist units, are seeking, or at least have the capability
to seek, specialist privileges or the equivalent lead market making status for any particular multiply listed options
class on any national securities exchange. Therefore, the Phlx is sensitive to the need to afford its specialist units
parity split treatment at least comparable to the programs existing on other national securities exchanges which
list options and compete for specialist capital and market making talent. Specifically, in order to address these
factors, the Exchange has determined to implement this one-year pilot program to increase the specialist's participation
in certain trades where the specialist is on parity with ROTs.

As a point of clarification, the Exchange states that this proposed rule change will operate in tandem with another
proposal submitted by the Exchange that is pending Commission approval.
 The Exchange represents that the proposal contained in File No. SR-Phlx-93-29 would provide a different
variant of enhanced specialist parity participation applicable only to new specialist units in newly allocated
equity options classes for a six-month period (subject to one six-month extension). If File No. SR-Phlx-93-29
is approved (in addition to the present filing), new specialists in new issues could opt for the enhanced parity split
treatment proposed in this filing at the point in time that the enhanced treatment granted under File No. SR-Phlx-93-29
terminates. As long as a specialist is a ``New Unit'' (as defined in File No. SR-Phlx-93-29), the
specialist is not eligible for the enhanced parity split proposed herein for any new issue of options traded by that
specialist.

If approved, Rule 1014(g)(i) will entitle the specialist to an enhanced participation on parity trades by being counted
as two crowd participants in certain circumstances (``enhanced parity split participation''). First, the contra
side order must be for more than five contracts. Secondly, the enhanced participation may not disadvantage a customer
order that is also on parity.

Third, the enhanced specialist participation will not be applicable to all option classes. It will be applicable
for all option classes that are listed after the rule becomes effective and for 50% of each specialist unit's listed
issues at the time the rule becomes effective. In this regard, each specialist's registered issues will be divided
into quartiles based on the most recent quarterly customer contract volume. The specialist will be able to choose
half of his issues in each volume quartile rounded so that the aggregate number chosen does not exceed 50% of the total
number of issues in all four quartiles. The specialist will be required to submit this list to the Allocation, Evaluation
and Securities Committee (``AES Committee'') for its review and approval. This list, once submitted and approved
by the AES Committee, will be in effect for the entire one-year period of the pilot program.

The Phlx also proposes to adopt Phlx Rule 509 to empower the AES Committee to oversee each specialist's performance
with respect to the enhanced participation privilege. A standing subcommittee of the AES Committee entitled the
``Quality of Markets Subcommittee'' (``Subcommittee'') will be created to review each specialist's performance
on a quarterly basis to assure that four conditions are being satisfied by a specialist who receives the benefit of
the enhanced parity splits in his trading crowd. First, the specialist must demonstrate that he is the lead market
maker in the trading crowd measured by his transacting more contracts in an option class than any ROT in that issue over
the review period.

The second criterion authorizes the Subcommittee to review whether the specialist has provided the Phlx with adequate
market share in options which are multiply traded. In this respect, the Subcommittee will determine whether the Phlx
has transacted at least 10% of the aggregate customer volume in an issue that is traded by all five options exchange,
at least 15% where four exchanges trade the issue, at least 20% where three exchanges trade the issue, and at least 25%
where only one other exchange trades the issue. Although this is a measure of the total customer volume executed on
the Exchange rather than solely by the specialist, in the competition for multiply traded issues, the Exchange believes
the specialist is a key party responsible for marketing the issue to upstairs firms, updating markets, and maintaining
the limit order book. A specialist who performs these functions will, the Exchange believes, assist the Exchange
in increasing order flow.

The third criterion is one that is already in place. Rule 515 specifies that an option specialist unit must attain at
least a score of five on its quarterly specialist evaluation. A specialist who does not receive a five on his evaluation
may be considered to have performed adequately enough to maintain his specialist privileges under Rule 515, but may
lose his enhanced participation privileges under proposed Rule 509 until he increases his score.

The final criterion authorizes the Subcommittee to consider whether a pattern of weakness has been demonstrated
by such things as frequent floor official rulings with respect to any particular options class or crowd and/or by written
customer complaints being received by the Exchange or Subcommittee regarding the specialist in any particular options
class.

If the Subcommittee determines that a specialist has failed to adhere to one or more of the four standards or any issue
receiving enhanced parity split participation, the Subcommittee must make a preliminary finding that the specialist
should lose the enhanced participation privilege in that issue. The specialist will be notified of this finding and
will be required to appear before the Subcommittee within five business days. At such meeting, the specialist bears
the burden of overcoming the presumption of substandard performance. For example, a specialist might be able to overcome
this presumption in the case where he has transacted less contracts than one ROT in his trading crowd during the review
period. In this case, if the specialist can demonstrate that one large block trade occurred during the review period
but for which that specialist would have been the lead market maker, the Subcommittee may determine that the specialist
does not deserve to lose the enhanced participation privilege.




Any decision of the Subcommittee must be in writing and must be delivered to the specialist on the next business day
following the Subcommittee meeting at which the decision was made. A decision to revoke the privilege will be effective
on the next business day after receipt of the decision by the specialist. A specialist who has lost the privilege may
reapply for it at the Subcommittee's next scheduled review and the specialist may be granted reinstatement if the
Subcommittee finds that the condition which initially caused the revocation of the enhanced participation privilege
has been cured and that no other problems exist.




The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6 of the Act in general, and with section
6(b)(5),
 in particular, in that it is designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and
a national market system, promote just and equitable principles of trade, and protect investors and the public interest.





(B) 

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition





The Phlx does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.




(C) 

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others





The Exchange represents that two comment letters were received from Exchange members
 and considered at the September 8, 1993 Exchange Board of Governors (``Board'') meeting. Generally, the Phlx states
that the authors of the comment letters asserted that the proposed rule may be a disincentive to market makers to compete
and add liquidity to the marketplace. According to the Exchange, the letters expressed a concern that there was no
evidence that this enhanced participation would benefit the Exchange and the public. One commenter recommended
a yearly review procedure and an on-going performance standard (both of which have been included in the proposal approved
by the Board). Another argument raised related to the procedure for choosing which 50% of a specialist's options would
be eligible for the enhanced participation. There was a concern that if the top 50% of the most active issues were subject
to the rule, over 90% of the total Exchange volume would be subject to the enhanced specialist participation. The Exchange
believes this concern has been addressed by adopting the quartile approach.






III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register 

or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(A) by order approve such proposed rule change, or

(B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 522, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the Phlx. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Phlx-94-12
and should be submitted by May 19, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating
to Restructuring Companies Portfolio Market Index Target-Term Securities</DOCTITLE>



April 20, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 Notice is hereby given that on April 12, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items
I, II, and III below, which items have been prepared by the Exchange. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 






I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Exchange proposes to list for trading Market Index Target-Term Securities (``MITTS''),
 the return on which is based upon a portfolio of securities of U.S. companies that have restructured or are in the process
of restructuring (``Restructuring Companies Portfolio''). Initially, the Restructuring Companies Portfolio
will contain the securities of 17 restructuring companies that are traded in the United States on the NYSE or are National
Market System securities traded through the facilities of the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotation System (``NASDAQ'').
 






II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NYSE has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C
below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. 



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



Pursuant to the listing criteria set forth in Section 703.19 of the Exchange's Listed Company Manual (``Manual''),
the Exchange proposes to list and trade MITTS. MITTS are securities that entitle the holder to receive from the issuer
upon maturity an amount based upon the change in the market value of a stock index or portfolio, provided that a minimum
amount (90% of the principal amount) will be repaid. The Exchange is submitting the proposed rule change specifically
to enable the Exchange to list for trading MITTS on the Restructuring Companies Portfolio (``Restructuring Companies
Portfolio MITTS'') issued by Merrill Lynch.

Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will allow investors to combine protection of a substantial portion of
the principal amount of the MITTS with potential additional payments based on a portfolio of securities of selected
restructuring companies. The Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will provide that at least 90% of the principal
amount thereof will be repaid at maturity.

<DOCNO> FR940428-2-00137 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940428-2-00064 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Security



Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will entitle the owner at maturity to receive an amount based upon the percentage
change between the ``Original Portfolio Value'' and the ``Ending Average Portfolio Value,'' subject to a minimum
repayment amount. The ``Original Portfolio Value'' is the value of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio on the
date on which the issuer prices the Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS issue for the initial offering to the
public. The ``Ending Average Portfolio Value'' is the average of the values of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio
at the end of the five calendar quarters preceding the expiration of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS
on December 31, 1999.
 The Ending Average Portfolio Value will be used in calculating the amount owners will receive upon maturity.
 






If the market value of the portfolio has declined, the owner will receive not less than a specified percentage of the
principal amount of the security. (For instance, if the market value of the portfolio used to calculate the amount
payable at maturity has declined more than 10%, the owners of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will receive
90% of the principal amount of the securities.) The payment at maturity is based on changes in the value of the portfolio,
but does not reflect the payment of dividends on the securities that comprise the portfolio.

As with other MITTS, Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS may not be redeemed prior to maturity and are not callable
by the issuer. Owners may sell the security on the Exchange. The Exchange anticipates that the trading value of the
security in the secondary market will depend in large part on the value of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio and
also on other factors, including the level of interest rates, the volatility of the value of the Restructuring Companies
Portfolio, the time remaining to maturity, dividend rates, and the creditworthiness of the issuer. 

The Exchange will only list for trading Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS issues that have at least one million
outstanding securities, at least 400 owners, a minimum life of one year and at least a $4 million market value, and that
otherwise comply with the Exchange's initial listing criteria. In addition, the Exchange will monitor each issue
to verify that it complies with the Exchange's continued listing criteria.






Merrill Lynch will deposit registered securities representing Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS with its
depository, the Depository Trust Company (``DTC''), so as to permit book-entry settlement of transactions by participants
in DTC. 



The Portfolio



The Restructuring Companies Portfolio consists of the common stock of 17 highly capitalized ``restructuring companies.''
Restructuring companies are companies that are generally perceived to have recently experienced declines in earnings
as compared to historical levels and/or other adverse developments which have required some form of restructuring
by such companies. Such restructuring may include reducing the company's work force, writing off obsolete or unused
plant and equipment, retiring debt, and investing in more efficient means of production.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940428-2-00138 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940428-2-00064 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Among the companies whose shares compose the Restructuring Companies Portfolio are companies at various stages
of the restructuring process; some have completed their intended restructuring, others are currently in the process
of restructuring, and others are perceived to be beginning such a process. The term ``restructuring'' does not refer
to any particular legal definition. The companies in the Restructuring Companies Portfolio are not specific to any
industry segment and include a wide array of industry sectors such as retailing, computer manufacturing, transportation,
the manufacture of consumer goods, and financial services.

The common stock of the 17 companies initially will be equally weighted within the portfolio on the pricing date. The
public float (

i.e.

, the market price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding) of the 17 companies differ significantly (from
a high of $44 billion (General Motors Corp.) to a low of $328 million (Arkla, Inc.)), as do the market prices of their
common stock (from a high $128.375 (UAL Corporation) to a low of $7.625 (Arkla, Inc.)).








The common stock of 16 and 17 component companies is listed on the Exchange. The common stock of the other component
company is traded through NASDAQ. At the outset, the common stock of each of the companies represented in the Restructuring
Companies Portfolio will have equal representation. That is, the common stock of each company included in the portfolio
shall be assigned a multiplier on the pricing date such that all component companies represent an equal percentage
of the value of the entire portfolio on such date. The multiplier indicates the number of shares of common stock (or
fraction of one share) included in the calculation of the portfolio. Thus, each of the 17 companies represented shall
represent 5.88% of the total portfolio on the pricing date.

The multiplier assigned to the component companies will be adjusted for certain events such as stock splits, reverse
stock splits, or stock dividends, and the value of the component securities will also be adjusted for certain events
including a liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency, merger, or consolidation involving the issuer of the underlying
shares. For example, if the issuer of the shares underlying a component company has been subject to a merger or a consolidation
and is not the surviving entity, then a value for such common stock will be determined at the time issuer is merged or
consolidated and will equal the last available market price for such common stock and that value will be constant for
the remaining term of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS.

<TEXT>
 

Based the reported prices of the common stock, a Merrill Lynch affiliate or an independent third party will calculate
the value of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio on at least a daily basis and make those values available to investors.


The Issuer


The Exchange has determined that the issuer of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS, Merrill Lynch, meets
the listing criteria set forth in Section 703.19 of the Manual. The Exchange states that Merrill Lynch is an Exchange-listed
company in good standing and has sufficient assets to justify the issuance of MITTS offerings of the size contemplated
by the proposed rule change.
The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and with Section
6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote
just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market
and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The NYSE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others


No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register 

or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:
(A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or 
(B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-NYSE-94-15
and should be submitted by May 19, 1994.

Narrative Statement for the Department of Transportation, Office of the Secretary 



The Office of the Secretary of Transportation proposes to amend and redesignate the record system, DOT/OST 018, Identification
Media Record System, as DOT/ALL 9, Identification Media Record System, to reflect the inclusion of all identification
media systems and records maintained for control and accountability of identification media issued to Department
of Transportation (DOT) employees, former employees, and contractors for agencies within the DOT. The purpose of
this Notice is to revise the system to include security badges utilized within DOT and also update storage systems
to include computer and/or electronically stored information. 

The changes include amendments to: System number; system location; categories or records in the system; routine
uses of records maintained in the system, including categories of users and the purposes of such uses; and system managers.
Since this proposal amends an existing record system in a way that does not increase the total scope of the original
system, the probable effects of this proposal on the privacy interests of the general public is minimal. 

A description of the steps taken to safeguard these records is given under the appropriate heading of the 

Federal Register

 system of records notice. 

The purpose of this report is to comply with the Office of Management and Budget Circular, A-130, Appendix I,
dated June 25, 1993.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of workshop.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will be cosponsoring a workshop on the unified command
and Incident Command System on May 20, 1994, in Alexandria, Virginia. The workshop will address issues relating to
the unified command and Incident Command System and their use in oil and hazardous substance spill response. This
notice announces the date, time and location of the workshop.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background Information



The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (40 CFR Part 300), required to be prepared and
published by the President under 33 U.S.C. 1321(d), designated the U.S. Coast Guard and EPA as On-Scene Coordinators
(OSCs) for response to oil and hazardous substance spills. The Coast Guard is the designated OSC for coastal zone response;
EPA is the designated OSC for the inland zone. Regulations issued by several agencies, including the Coast Guard,
EPA and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), govern response efforts to oil and hazardous substance
spills.

OSHA regulations, ``Rules for Hazardous Waste Operations'' (29 CFR 1910.120), require the implementation of an
Incident Command System to effectively control and manage operations at an emergency site. The coverage of these
regulations includes cleanup operations involving oil and hazardous substances. Revisions to the National Oil
and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan currently being considered include language describing the
national response management structure as a ``unified command triangle'', where the OSC, a state-designated representative
and a responsible party representative work together to achieve an effective and efficient response. This unified
command response management structure is intended to meet OSHA requirements for an Incident Command System.


There are several firefighting-based Incident Command Systems currently in use by local fire fighters around the
country that are providing conflicting information as to the correct way to plan for spill response. This has caused
confusion for oil and hazardous substance spill response planners attempting to develop an effective response structure.


A number of On-Scene Coordinators, in guiding the Area Committees in the development of their Area Contingency Plans
for pollution response, are attempting to develop a detailed response structure. Many are looking at the possibility
of incorporating one of the firefighting-based Incident Command Systems into the response structure outlined in
their Area Contingency Plans. Area Committees have raised questions regarding the best system for oil and hazardous
substance spill response, or even whether use of these systems is appropriate. With increasing questions being raised,
the Coast Guard and EPA decided to hold a public workshop to discuss the various issues relating to the unified command
and Incident Command System and how they relate to oil and hazardous substance spill response.


Workshop Format and Schedule



The workshop format will consist of a presentation by the Coast Guard and EPA on the national response management structure
as outlined in the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan. This will be followed by a question
and answer period and open discussion of the various issues relating to the unified command and Incident Command System
as they relate to oil and hazardous substance spill response.

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Import Prohibitions on Wildlife Specimens and Products of Taiwan Pursuant to the Pelly Amendment; Request
for Public Comment</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the United States Trade Representative.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Presidential determination to prohibit the importation of wildlife specimens and products of Taiwan pursuant
to section 8 of the Fisherman's Protective Act of 1967 (22 U.S.C. 1978) (the ``Pelly Amendment''); request for public
comment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The President has determined to apply import prohibitions against Taiwan pursuant to section 8 of the Fishermen's
Protective Act of 1967 (22 U.S.C. 1978)(the ``Pelly Amendment'') in response to Taiwan's failure to undertake sufficient
actions to stop illegal trade in internationally recognized endangered species. The President has proposed to apply
the import prohibitions against wildlife specimens and products of Taiwan. The Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC)
seeks public comment concerning the proposed action, in particular the specific product coverage of the import prohibitions.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On November 8, 1993, the President reported to the Congress pursuant to section 8(b) of the Fishermen's Protective
Act of 1967 (22 U.S.C. 1978)b)) (the ``Pelly Amendment'') on the issue of trade by the People's Republic of China (PRC)
and Taiwan in rhinoceros and tiger parts and products. The report followed the certification by the Secretary of the
Interior that this trade was diminishing the effectiveness of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Five rhinoceros species and the tiger are listed in Appendix I of CITES, which
means that the species are threatened with extinction and no trade for primarily commercial purposes is allowed.





The President reported that although ``recent actions by the PRC and Taiwan show that some progress has been made in
addressing their rhinoceros and tiger trade, the record demonstrates that they still fall far short of the international
conservation standards of CITES.'' The President suggested actions that the PRC and Taiwan could take that would
demonstrate their commitment to the elimination of the trade and stated that the United States is prepared, through
close dialogue and technical aid, to assist them in their efforts. However, the report concluded that, if measurable,
verifiable and substantial progress were not made by March 1994, import prohibitions will be necessary, as recommended
by the CIGES Standing Committee at its September 1993 meeting.

The suggested actions in the November 8 report, based on criteria established by CITES for adequate legislative measures
and enforcement that effectively eliminates the trade, were further amplified in letters dated December 21, 1993,
to the Chairman of the Council of Agriculture and the Minister of Economic Affairs in Taipei from the Secretary of the
Interior, and by CITES and U.S. delegation visits to the PRC and Taiwan in January, February and March 1994. However,
at its March 1994 meeting, the CITES Standing Committee noted the progress made by the PRC while pointing out that further
actions are still needed. With respect to Taiwan, CITES expressed ``concern that the actions agreed by the authorities
in Taiwan, * * * towards meeting the minimum requirements have not yet been implemented.''

Although Taiwan has made efforts to address the problem, as a result of the lack of sufficient progress in the key areas
identified in the November 8 report, the President decided to direct the Secretary of the Treasury, working with the
Secretary of the Interior, to prohibit the bringing or the importation into the United States of wildlife specimens
and products of Taiwan, and that the precise products subject to the import prohibition will be determined after viewing
public comments received. 

While the Pelly Amendment provides the authority to impose a greater level of import prohibitions, this level was
deemed appropriate at this time. The situation in Taiwan will continue to be reviewed and U.S. authorities will continue
to try to assist Taiwan in effecting meaningful results in the effort to eliminate the illegal trade. The import prohibitions,
once imposed, will remain in effect until the President determines that sufficient progress has been made by Taiwan
in securing significant reductions in the illegal commerce in the species, taking into account relevant findings
of the CITES Standing Committee. 

The products eligible for the import prohibitions were chosen based on the CITES Standing Committee recommendation,
and cover wildlife specimens, parts and products thereof, that are products of Taiwan and are defined below. All imports
from Taiwan which are eligible products will be prohibited unless otherwise indicated upon completion of the review
of public comments. In making the determination of final product coverage, public comments submitted in accordance
with the requirements set forth below will be considered. 

It is expected that a final notice of the wildlife and wildlife products subject to the import prohibitions will be
published in the 

Federal Register

 within approximately two weeks of the close of the public comment period, and that the import prohibitions will apply
to wildlife and their parts and products exported from Taiwan beginning ten days after the date of publication of the
final notice. 



Public Comment Requirements for Submission 



The TPSC invites all interested persons to provide written comments concerning the proposed action, specifically
regarding economic and environmental effects of the proposed import prohibitions, including: 

(1) The appropriateness of prohibiting the importation of any particular product; 

(2) The degree to which prohibiting the importation of any particular product might have an adverse effect upon U.S.
consumers of the product; and 

(3) Additional actions, not limited to trade restrictions, that would help bring about an end to illegal trade in these
endangered species. 

Comments must be filed in English and provided in ten copies to: Carolyn Frank, Secretary, Trade Policy Staff committee,
Office of the United States Trade Representative, 600 17th Street, NW., room 414, Washington, DC 20506. 

Submissions will be available for public inspection by appointment with the staff of the USTR Public Reading Room,
except for confidential business information exempt from public inspection in accordance with 15 CFR 2003.6. Confidential
business information must be clearly marked ``Business Confidential'' at the top of the cover letter or page and each
succeeding page in each of the 10 copies, and must be accompanied by a nonconfidential summary of the confidential
information. The nonconfidential summary will be placed in the file that is open to public inspection. 



Product Coverage 



Import prohibitions will apply to ``wildlife specimens and parts and products'' of Taiwan. For purposes of this action,
the term ``wildlife specimens and parts and products'' includes ``fish or wildlife'' or products of ``fish or wildlife''
as defined in the ``Lacey Act'' (16 U.S.C. 3371); 

 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940428-2-00145 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940428-2-00067 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The term ``fish or wildlife'' means any wild animal, whether alive or dead, including without limitation any wild
mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian, fish, mollusk, crustacean, arthropod, coelenterate, or other invertebrate,
whether or not bred, hatched, or born in captivity, and includes any part, product, egg, or offspring thereof.




The wildlife and wildlife parts and products covered by this definition are those whose importation, exportation
and transportation is governed by regulations administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service at 50 CFR part 14. These
items are those for which a Fish and Wildlife Declaration is required (Form 3-177, ``Declaration for Importation
or Exportation of Fish or Wildlife'').

For purposes of this action, ``plants, alive or dead, and their products'' will not be covered, nor will ``shellfish
and fishery products imported for human or animal consumption,'' as they are exempted from the wildlife importation
and declaration requirements by 50 CFR 14.21.

An analysis of wildlife and its parts and products of Taiwan falling within the above definition, using import records
compiled by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from completed Forms 3-177 indicate the total declared value
of wildlife imports from Taiwan was approximately $22 million in 1992, the most recent year for which these data are
available. The major categories of wildlife and wildlife parts and products imported from Taiwan include:




(1) Reptile leather shoes, handbags, etc.

(2) Jewelry made from coral, mussel shells and bone:

(3) Edible frogs' legs;

(4) Live goldfish and tropical fish for the aquarium trade; and

(5) Bird feathers, down, and specimens.




Although an exhaustive listing of the tariff headings of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS)
corresponding to the Lacey Act definition is not available, the Department of Interior (Fish and Wildlife Service)
is able to provide indicative information to interested parties. Since the HTS and Lacey Act definitions do not correspond,
even indicative listings of HTS item numbers must be examined carefully in light of the Lacey Act definition to obtain
an accurate assessment of product coverage.

Notices of final NPDES general permits_MAG250000, MEG250000, and NHG250000.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Regional Administrator of Region I is issuing final National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
general permits for non-contact cooling water discharges to certain waters of the States of Maine, Massachusetts,
and New Hampshire. These general NPDES permits establish notice of intent (NOI) requirements, effluent limitations,
standards, prohibitions and management practices for facilities with discharges authorized by the permit.


Owners and/or operators of facilities discharging non-contact cooling water will be required to submit to EPA, Region
I, a notice of intent to be covered by the appropriate general permit 

within 180 days of the effective date

 of this permit and will receive a written notification from EPA of permit coverage and authorization to discharge
under one of the general permits.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


I. Introduction



The Regional Administrator of Region I is issuing final general permits for non-contact cooling water discharges
to certain waters of the States of Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.


This notice contains 

two

 sets of appendices. Appendix A summarizes EPA's response to major comments received on the draft general permits
published on September 15, 1992 (57 FR 42572). Appendix B contains the final general NPDES permits including Part
II, Standard Conditions.



II. Coverage of General Permits




Section 301(a) of the Clean Water Act (the Act) provides that the discharge of pollutants is unlawful except in accordance
with a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit unless such a discharge is otherwise authorized
by the Act. Although such permits to date have generally been issued to individual discharges in Region I, EPA's regulations
authorize the issuance of ``general permits'' to categories of discharges (See 40 CFR 122.28 (48 FR 14146, April 1,
1983)). EPA may issue a single, general permit to a category of point sources located within the same geographic area
whose permits warrant similar pollution control measures.



The Director of an NPDES permit program is authorized to issue a general permit if there are a number of point sources
operating in a geographic area that:

1. Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations;

2. Discharge the same types of wastes;

3. Require the same effluent limitations or operating conditions;

4. Require the same or similar monitoring requirements; and

5. In the opinion of the Regional Administrator, are more appropriately controlled under a general permit than under
individual permits.

Violations of a condition of a general permit constitutes a violation of the Clean Water Act and subjects the discharger
to the penalties in Section 309 of the Act.

Any owner or operator authorized by a general permit may be excluded from coverage of a general permit by applying for
an individual permit. This request may be made by submitting a NPDES permit application together with reasons supporting
the request no later than 90 days after publication by EPA of the final general permit in the 

Federal Register.

 The Director may require any person authorized by a general permit to apply for and obtain an individual permit. Any
interested person may petition the Director to take this action. However, individual permits will not be issued for
sources discharging non-contact cooling water covered by these general permits unless it can be clearly demonstrated
that inclusion under the general permit is inappropriate.

<PARENT> FR940428-2-00072 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Director may consider the issuance of individual permits when:
1. The discharger is not in compliance with the terms and conditions of the general permit;
2. A change has occurred in the availability of demonstrated technology or practices for the control or abatement
of pollutants applicable to the point source;
3. Effluent limitations guidelines are subsequently promulgated for the point sources covered by the general NPDES
permit;
4. A Water Quality Management plan containing requirements applicable to such point sources is approved; or
5. Circumstances have changed since the time of the request to be covered so that the discharger is no longer appropriately
controlled under the general permit, or either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized
discharge is necessary;
6. The discharge(s) is a significant contributor of pollution.
In accordance with 40 CFR 122.28(b)(3)(iv), the applicability of the general permit is automatically terminated
on the effective date of the individual permit.


III. Description of Non-Contact Cooling Water Discharges


The proposed general permits are for: (1) Massachusetts operators of any facilities with non-contact cooling water
discharges; (2) Maine operators of facilities with non-contact cooling water discharges; (3) New Hampshire operators
of any facilities with non-contact cooling water discharges.
Non-contact cooling water is water used to reduce temperature which does not come into direct contact with any raw
material, intermediate product, waste product (other than heat) or finished product. Non-contact cooling water
discharges are similar in composition even though they are not generated by a single industrial category or point
source.
The similarity of the discharges has prompted EPA to prepare this general permit. When issued, this permit will enable
facilities to maintain compliance with the Act and will extend environmental and regulatory controls to a large number
of discharges and reduce some permit backlog. The issuance of this general permit for the geographic areas described
below is warranted by the similarity of (a) environmental conditions, (b) State regulatory requirements applicable
to the discharges and receiving waters, and (c) technology employed.
In the State of Maine there are 271 industrial applicants or permittees. It is estimated that 12 of the industries that
have direct discharges to the waters of the State are strictly non-contact cooling water. In the State of New Hampshire
there are 178 industrial applications or permittees. It is estimated that over 30 of the industries that have direct
discharges to the waters of the State are strictly non-contact cooling water. In the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
there are 651 industrial applicants or permittees. It is estimated that over 200 of the industries that have direct
discharges to the waters of the State are strictly non-contact cooling water.


IV. Conditions of the General NPDES Permit


A. Geographic Areas




Maine

 (Permit No. MEG250000). All of the discharges to be authorized by the general NPDES permit for dischargers located
in the State of Maine are into all waters of the State unless otherwise restricted by Title 38, Article 4-A, Water
Classification Program (or as revised).


Massachusetts

 (Permit No. MAG250000). All of the discharges to be authorized by the general NPDES permit for dischargers in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts are into all waters of the Commonwealth unless otherwise restricted by the Massachusetts Surface
Water Quality Standards, 314 CMR 4.00 (or as revised), including 314 CMR 4.04(3) Protection of Outstanding Resource
Waters.


New Hampshire

 (Permit No. NHG250000). All of the discharges to be authorized by the general NPDES permit for dischargers in the State
of New Hampshire are into all waters of the State of New Hampshire unless otherwise restricted by the State Water Quality
Standards, New Hampshire RSA 485-A:8 (or as revised).


B. Notification by Permittees


Operators of facilities whose discharge, or discharges, are non-contact cooling water and whose facilities are
located in the geographic areas described in Part IV.A. above may submit to the Regional Administrator, Region I,
a notice of intent to be covered by the appropriate general permit within 180 days of the effective date of the general
permit. This written notification must include the owner's or operator's legal name and address; the facility name
and address; the number and type of facilities to be covered; the facility location(s); a topographic map (or other
map if a topographic map is not available) indicating the facility location(s); the name(s) of the receiving waters
into which discharge will occur; a determination as to whether or not the facility discharge will adversely affect
a listed or proposed to be listed endangered or threatened species or its critical habitat (See Part E.); and in the
State of Maine, only, a special list of water treatment chemicals used by the facility.
Facilities located in Massachusetts or New Hampshire that intend to be covered under this general permit must also
submit a formal certification with the notice of intent that no chemical additives are used in their non-contact cooling
water systems.
Each facility must also certify that the discharge consists solely of non-contact cooling water, no other waste stream
discharges will be permitted under this general permit.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940428-2-00152 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940428-2-00072 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Each facility must also submit a copy of the notice of intent to each State authority as appropriate (see individual
state permits for appropriate authority and address).

The facilities authorized to discharge under the final general permit will receive written notification from EPA,
Region I, with State concurrence. Failure to submit to EPA, Region I, a notice of intent to be covered and/or failure
to receive from EPA written notification of permit coverage means that the facility is not authorized to discharge
under this general permit.



c. Effluent Limitations



1. Statutory Requirements



The Clean Water Act (the Act) prohibits the discharge of pollutants to waters of the United States without a National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit unless such a discharge is otherwise authorized by the Act.
The NPDES Permit is the mechanism used to implement technology and water quality based effluent limitations and other
requirements including monitoring and reporting. The NPDES permit was developed in accordance with various statutory
and regulatory authorities establised pursuant to the Act. The regulations governing the EPA NPDES Permit program
are generally found at 40 CFR parts 122, 124, 125 and 136.

EPA is required to consider technology and water quality requirements when developing permit limits. 40 CFR part
125 Subpart A sets the criteria and standards that EPA must use to determine which technology-based requirements,
requirements under Section 301(b) of the Act and/or requirements established on a case-by-case basis under section
402(a)(1) of the Act, should be included in the permit.

The Clean Water Act requires that all discharges, at a minimum, must meet effluent limitations based on the technological
capability of dischargers to control pollutants in their discharge. Section 301(b)(1)(A) of the Act requires the
application of Best Practicable Control Technology Currently Available (BPT) with the statutory deadline for compliance
being July 1, 1977, unless otherwise authorized by the Act. Section 301(b)(2) of the Act requires the application
of Best Conventional Control Technology (BCT) for conventional pollutants, and Best Available Technology Economically
Achievable (BAT) for non-conventional and toxic pollutants. The compliance deadline for BCT and BAT is as expeditiously
as practicable but in no case later than three years after the date such limitations are promulgated and in no case later
than March 31, 1989.



2. Technology-Based Effluent Limitations



EPA has not promulgated National Effluent Guidelines for non-contact cooling water discharges. For a category where
Guidelines have been promulgated, such as steam electric generating stations (see 40 CFR part 423), the issuance
of an individual permit for the discharges would be more appropriate (See 40 CFR 122.28(b)(3)(i)(C)). Therefore,
as provided in section 402(a)(1) of the Act, EPA has determined to issue this general permit utilizing best professional
judgement (BPJ) to meet the above stated criteria for BAT/BCT described in section 304(b) of the Act. 
The pH has been defined as a conventional pollutant. A review of the BCT regulations reveals the test cost is inappropriate
because: (1) The pH is not adjusted as nothing but heat is added to the discharge and no chemical addition, unless approved
by the State of Maine, or treatment is provided, and (2) pH, even though it is a conventional pollutant, is not measured
in pounds as the other conventional pollutants. 



3. Water Quality Based Effluent Limitations 



Under Section 301(b)(1)(C) of the Act discharges are subject to effluent limitations based on water quality standards
and to the conditions of State certification under section 401 of the Act. Receiving stream requirements are established
according to numerical and narrative standards adopted under state and/or federal law for each stream use classification.
The CWA requires that EPA obtain State certification which states that all water quality standards will be satisfied.
Regulations governing State certification are set forth in 40 CFR  124.53 and 124.55. 

Section 101(a)(3) of the Act specifically prohibits the discharge of toxic pollutants in toxic amounts. The States
of Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire have similar narrative criteria in their water quality regulations (See
Maine Title 38, Article 4-A, section 420 and section 464.4.A.(4); Massachusetts 314 CMR 4.05(5)(e); and New
Hampshire Part Env-Ws 432.02(c)(4)) that prohibits such discharges. The permit does not allow for the addition of
materials or chemicals in amounts which would produce a toxic effect to any aquatic life. Nevertheless, toxic effects
may still occur as a result of toxic source water or due to dissolution of the piping in the cooling water systems. 


Non-contact cooling water discharges do not contain or come in contact with raw materials, intermediate products,
finished products, or process wastes. Therefore, it could be assumed that the discharges do not contain toxic or hazardous
pollutants or oil and grease. However, based on the previous statement regarding potential source water toxicity,
these discharges may violate water quality criteria established for toxic or hazardous pollutants in which case
an individual permit would be required. 

Water quality standards applicable to non-contact cooling water discharges covered by this general permit include
pH and temperature. EPA has reviewed the water quality standards for pH and temperature of each of the States and has
incorporated the appropriate effluent limitations into each permit.

4. Antidegradation Provisions 



The conditions of the permit reflect the goal of the CWA and EPA to achieve and maintain water quality standards. The
environmental regulations pertaining to the State Antidegradation Policies which protect the State's surface
waters from falling below State standards for water quality are found in the following provisions: Maine Title 38,
Article 4-A, Section 464.4.F.; Massachusetts Water Quality Standards 314 CMR 4.04 Antidegradation Provisions;
and New Hampshire policy RSA 485-A:8, VI Part Env-Ws 437.01 and Env-Ws 437.02. 

This general permit will not apply to any new or increased discharge unless it can be determined that such discharges
will result in insignificant effects to the receiving waters. This determination shall be made in accordance with
the appropriate State Antidegradation Policies. 


D. Monitoring and Reporting Requirements 




Effluent limitations and monitoring requirements which are included in the general permit describe the requirements
to be imposed on the facilities to be covered. 

Facilities covered by the final general permits will be required to submit to EPA, Region I, and the appropriate State
authority, a Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR) containing effluent data. The frequency of reporting is determined
in accordance with each State's provisions (see the individual State permits). 


The monitoring requirements have been established to yield data representative of the discharge under authority
of Section 308(a) of the Act and 40 CFR  122.41(j), 122.44(i) and 122.48, and as certified by the State. 


E. Endangered Species 



Non-contact cooling water discharges that may adversely affect a listed or proposed to be listed endangered or threatened
species or its critical habitat are not authorized under this general permit without the written approval of the Fish
and Wildlife Service and/or the National Marine Fisheries Service. 


The Fish and Wildlife Service has indicated that the dwarf wedge mussel 

(Alasmidonta heterodon), 

a Federally listed endangered species, occurs in a stretch of the Connecticut River from Lebanon, New Hampshire to
Weathersfield Bow, Vermont, in the Ashuelot River in Keene, New Hampshire, and historically from a number of rivers
in Massachusetts. Any facility whose discharge may adversely effect the mussel or any other threatened or endangered
species or its habitat is required to contact the Fish and Wildlife Service at the following address in order to make
a formal determination: United States Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, 400 Ralph Pill Marketplace,
22 Bridge Street, Concord, New Hampshire 03301-4901.

The National Marine Fisheries Service has indicated that the endangered shortnose sturgeon 

(Acipenser brevirostrum) 

inhabits certain sections of the Penobscot, Kennebec and Androscoggin Rivers in Maine, and the Merrimack and Connecticut
Rivers in Massachusetts. Any facility whose discharge may adversely effect the sturgeon or any other threatened
or endangered species or its habitat is required to contact the National Marine Fisheries Service at the following
address: 

United States Department of Commerce, 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 
National Marine Fisheries Service, 
Habitat and Protected Resources Division, 
One Blackburn Drive, 
Gloucester, Massachusetts 01930-2298.

<DOCNO> FR940428-2-00154 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940428-2-00072 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The remaining conditions of the permit are based on the NPDES regulations 40 CFR parts 122 through 125 and consist primarily
of management requirements common to all permits. 


V. State (401) Certification 


Section 401 of the CWA provides that no Federal license or permit, including NPDES permits, to conduct any activity
that may result in any discharge into navigable waters shall be granted until the State in which the discharge originates
certifies that the discharge will comply with the applicable provisions of sections 301, 302, 303, 306, and 307 of
the CWA. The section 401 certification process has been completed for all States covered by today's general permit.
The following summary indicates where additional permit requirements have been added as a result of the certification
process. 
The following changes apply to all States. Part III (Part I.B.1. in the draft permit) 

Description of Non-Contact Cooling Water Discharges 

has been changed to include non-contact cooling water instead of just cooling water in the description. Part IV.A.
(Part II.A. in the draft) 

Geographic Areas 

has been changed to include specific reference to all state water quality standards which would apply to the discharges
covered under the permit. Part IV.B. (Part II.B. in the draft) 

Notification by Permittees 

has been modified to include specific State requirements (see final permit). 
Massachusetts: see Appendix B, Massachusetts General Permit. Under Part I.A.1. (Appendix A., Number 1, Part I.A.1.
in the draft) the State has included a provision for the flow requirements in the final permit. The provision allows
for a discharge flow of greater than 1 MGD to be covered under the general permit on a case by case basis as determined
by the State (see footnote in final permit). The discharge limitations for pH have been modified to include the requirements
specific to each water classification type (see Part I.A.i. or j. in the final permit). LC

50 

& C-NOEC, the testing requirements for whole effluent toxicity (WET), have been changed. WET testing will only
be required upon request by EPA and/or the State (see Part I.A.1.k. of the final permit). Parts I.A.1.b, c, d & e
have been added to the final permit, these provisions are specific to the temperature exceedence allowances in accordance
with the State water quality standards. Any requirements referring to Class C or SC water bodies found in the draft
general permit have been deleted since there are no Class C or SC segments in the State. 
New Hampshire: see Appendix B, New Hampshire General Permit. Under Part I.A.1. (Appendix A., Section c., Part I.A.1.
in the draft) the temperature limit and designation for a warm water fishery have been added under Part I.A.1.a. The
reference for pH has been changed to include specific State permit conditions (see Part I.B. of the final permit).
LC

50 

& C-NOEC, the testing requirements for whole effluent toxicity (WET), have been changed. WET testing will only
be required upon request by EPA and/or the State (see Part I.A.1.f. of the final permit). 


VI. Administrative Aspects 


A. Request To Be Covered 


A facility is not covered by any of these general permits until it meets the following requirements. First, it must
send a notice of intent to EPA and the appropriate State indicating it meets the requirements of the permit and wants
to be covered. And second, it must be notified in writing by EPA that it is covered by this general permit. 
Any facility operating under an effective individual NPDES permit may request that the individual permit be revoked
and that coverage under the general permit granted, as outlined in 40 CFR 122.28(b)(3)(v). If EPA grants coverage
under the general permit, EPA will so notify the facility and revoke the individual permit. 
Facilities with expired individual permits that have been administratively continued in accordance with  122.6
may apply for coverage under this general permit. When coverage is granted the expired individual permit automatically
will cease being in effect. 


B. The Coastal Zone Management Act 


The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), 16 U.S.C.   1451 

et seq., 

and its implementing regulations [15 CFR Part 930] require that any federally licensed activity affecting the coastal
zone with an approved Coastal Zone Management Program (CZMP) be determined to be consistent with the CZMP. EPA, Region
I, has determined that these general NPDES permits are consistent with the CZMP. EPA has received consistency from
the Massachusetts, Maine, and New Hampshire coastal zone agencies for a determination that these three permits are
consistent with their respective State policies. 


C. The Endangered Species Act 


EPA Region I has concluded that the existing discharges that obtain coverage under this general NPDES permit will
not affect or jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or adversely affect its
critical habitat. EPA has submitted a ``no-effect'' determination to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National
Marine Fisheries Service to confirm this conclusion. 


D. Environmental Impact Statement Requirements 


The general permits do not authorize the construction of any water resources project or the impoundment of any water
body or have any effect on historical property, and are not major Federal activities needing preparation of any Environmental
Impact Statement. Therefore, the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, 16 U.S.C.   1273 

et seq.

, the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, 16 U.S.C   470 

et seq.

, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, 16 U.S.C.   661 

et seq.

, and the National Environmental Policy Act, 33 U.S.C.   4321 

et seq.

, do not apply to the issuance of these general NPDES permits.

VII. Other Legal Requirements 


A. Economic Impact (Executive Order 12291) 


EPA has reviewed the effect of Executive Order 12291 on this draft general permit and has determined that it is not a
major rule under that order. This regulation was submitted previously to the Office of Management and Budget for review
as required by Executive Order 12291. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action from the review
requirements of Executive Order 12291 pursuant to section 8(b) of that Order. 


B. Paperwork Reduction Act 


EPA has reviewed the requirements imposed on regulated facilities by these draft general NPDES permits under the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C.   3501 

et seq. 

The information collection requirements of these draft permits have already been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget under submissions made for the NPDES permit program under the provisions of the Clean Water Act. No comments
from the Office of Management and Budget or the public were received on the information collection requirements in
these permits. 


C. The Regulatory Flexibility Act 


After review of the facts presented in the notice printed above, I hereby certify, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C.
 605(b), that these permits do not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Moreover,
the draft permits will reduce a significant administrative burden on regulated sources.

Appendix A_Summary of Responses to Public Comments on the September 15, 1992, Draft General Permits 


One commenter expressed concern that the general permits eliminate all effective water treatment programs for non-contact
cooling systems and that the permits surmised that additives used to control biological growth (biocides) are inherently
toxic to aquatic life. The commenter suggested that EPA more fully review all the technical aspects of operating and
maintaining cooling tower systems before issuing the permit. 
As stated in the permit, the purpose of general permits is to extend environmental and regulatory controls to a large
number of discharges and reduce some permit backlog. It is a mechanism through which the Region can properly regulate
many of the minor non-contact cooling water discharges, it can provide quick coverage to a large number facilities.
Time and resources do not allow for individual review of each of the facilities cooling water systems and the types
of additives used. If a facility wishes it may apply for an individual permit which can address this issue separately.

One commenter from New Hampshire expressed concern regarding the pH requirements for the permit, the commenter was
concerned that excursions of pH caused by precipitation or intake water are not allowed. 
The final permit requirements for New Hampshire do allow for pH excursions due to natural causes as part of the State
Surface Water Quality Regulations (see the New Hampshire general permit, Part B, State Permit Conditions). 


Appendix B_Final General Permits Under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). 




Note: 

The following three general NPDES permits have been combined for purposes of this 

Federal Register

. Parts I.A. and I.B. of the permits are specific for each state. Parts I.C. and I.D. are common to all three permits.



Massachusetts General Permit, Permit No. MAG250000 


In compliance with the provisions of the Federal Clean Water Act, as amended, (33 U.S.C.   1251 et seq.;
the ``CWA''), and the Massachusetts Clean Waters in Massachusetts, which discharge solely non-contact cooling

Standards, 314 CMR 4.00 et seq.; are authorized to discharge to all waters, unless otherwise restricted, in accordance
with effluent limitations, monitoring requirements and other conditions set forth herein. 
This permit shall become effective when issued. 
This permit and the authorization to discharge expire at midnight, five years from the effective date of the 

Federal Register

 publication. 
Operators of facilities within the general permit area who fail to notify the Director of their intent to be covered
by this general permit and receive written notification of permit coverage, or those who are denied by the Director
are not authorized under this general permit to discharge from those facilities to the receiving waters or areas named.

Part I


A. Effluent Limitations and Monitoring Requirements


1. During the period beginning on the effective date and lasting through expiration, the permittee is authorized
to discharge from each outfall of non-contact cooling water (as defined in Paragraph I.A.1.f. below) into fresh and
marine water.
a. Such discharges shall be limited and monitored by the permittee as specified below:




b. The pH shall not be less than 6.0 standard units nor greater than 8.5 standard units and shall be monitored monthly
with 4 grabs, reporting maximum values (see I.A.1.i. below).
c. There shall be no discharge of floating solids or visible foam in other than trace amounts.
d. The effluent limitations are based on the State water quality standards and certified by the State.
e. Samples taken in compliance with the monitoring requirements specified above shall be taken at the point of discharge.
f. Definitions:


Non-contact cooling water 

is water used to reduce temperature which does not come into direct contact with any raw material, intermediate product,
waste product or finished product.


Non-toxic water treatment additives 

are chemicals used in cooling water system primarily to control corrosion or prevent deposition of scale forming
materials which do not exhibit any residual toxic effect on the receiving waters.

g. Discharge Temperature and Volume 


The temperature and volume of the discharge shall not exceed 120 
 F and 3.0 millions gallons per day (MGD). The acceptability of the total or combined non-contact cooling waters
from each facility must be determined using the graph on Figure 1. The intersection of the maximum effluent temperature
and the dilution ratio shall be in the ``acceptable'' range shown on Figure 1, titled ``Effluent Temperature/Dilution
Graph'' for coverage by the General Permit Program. If the intersection falls within the ``non-acceptable'' area,
the facility must be covered by the individual NPDES Permit, not the General Permit Program. 
The effluent temperature is the maximum daily temperature. The dilution factor is the sum of the 7Q10 low stream flow
at the facility site and the daily maximum effluent flow divided by the daily maximum effluent flow. For facilities
with multiple outfalls, the daily maximum effluent flow shall be the sum of the flow from all outfalls. 



h. Water Treatment Additives 


Non-toxic water treatment additives are allowed in non-contact cooling water systems. The State of Maine will review
each identified chemical to determine its acceptability. Additives used to control biological growth in such cooling
systems are prohibited due to their inherent toxicity to aquatic life. 

Residual chlorine discharges resulting from the use of potable water supplies will be exempt from this provision.


The following water treatment additive biological and chemical data must be supplied in the letter of intent to be
covered by this general permit: 

(1) Name and manufacture of each additive used, 

(2) Maximum and average daily quantity of each additive used on a monthly basis, and 

(3) The vendor's reported aquatic toxicity of additive (NOAEL and/or LC

50

 in % for typically acceptable aquatic test organisms) 

All substitutions to the accepted water treatment chemicals must be approved by the State prior to their usage. 



i. pH Control 



The pH of the effluent shall be between 6.0 to 8.5 standard units (s.u.) unless the sole cause of excursion below 6.0
s.u. is due to precipitation or the low pH of the influent water. 



j. Total Residual Chlorine 


Potable water supply sources used for cooling water supply shall not contain Total Residual Chlorine (TRC) at concentration
levels that induce a toxic impact upon aquatic life within the receiving waters. The instream waste concentration
of TRC based on the ratio of the effluent flow stream flow to the 7Q10 low flow of the stream shall be less than the appropriate
water quality criteria for the receiving waterway.

The permittee must comply with all conditions of this permit. Any permit noncompliance constitutes a violation of
the Clean Water Act and is grounds for enforcement action; for permit termination, revocation and reissuance, or
modification; or for denial of a permit renewal application. 

a. The permittee shall comply with effluent standards or 
prohibitions established under Section 307(a) of the CWA for toxic pollutants and with standards for sewage sludge
use or disposal established under Section 405(d) of the CWA within the time provided in the regulations that establish
these standards or prohibitions, even if the permit has not yet been modified to incorporate the requirement. 

b. The CWA provides that any person who violates Sections 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, 318, or 405 of the CWA or any permit
condition or limitation implementing any of such sections in a permit issued under Section 402, or any requirement
imposed in a pretreatment program approved under Sections 402(a)(3) or 402(b)(8) of the CWA is subject to a civil penalty
not to exceed $25,000 per day for each violation. Any person who 

negligently 

violates such requirements is subject to a fine of not less than $2,500 nor more than $25,000 per day of violation, or
by imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or both. Any person who 

knowingly 

violates such requirements is subject to a fine of not less than $5,000 nor more than $50,000 per day of violation, or
by imprisonment for not more than 3 years, or both. Note: See 40 CFR  122.41(a)(2) for additional enforcement
criteria. 

c. Any person may be assessed an administrative penalty by the Administrator for violating Sections 301, 302, 306,
307, 308, 318, or 405 of the CWA, or any permit condition or limitation implementing any of such sections in a permit
issued under Section 402 of the CWA. Administrative penalties for Class I violations are not to exceed $10,000 per
violation, with the maximum amount of any Class I penalty assessed not to exceed $25,000. Penalties for Class II violations
are not to exceed $10,000 per day for each day during which the violation continues, with the maximum amount of any Class
II penalty not to exceed $125,000. 



2. Permit Actions 



This permit may be modified, revoked and reissued, or terminated for cause. The filing of a request by the permittee
for a permit modification, revocation and reissuance, or termination, or a notification of planned changes or anticipated
noncompliance does not stay any permit condition. 



3. Duty To Provide Information
 


The permittee shall furnish to the Regional Administrator, within a reasonable time, any information which the Regional
Administrator may request to determine whether cause exists for modifying, revoking and reissuing, or terminating
this permit, or to determine compliance with this permit. The permittee shall also furnish to the Regional Administrator,
upon request, copies of records required to be kept by this permit. 



4. Reopener Clause 



The Regional Administrator reserves the right to make appropriate revisions to this permit in order to establish
any appropriate effluent limitations, schedules of compliance, or other provisions which may be authorized under
the CWA in order to bring all discharges into compliance with the CWA. 



5. Oil and Hazardous Substance Liability 



Nothing in this permit shall be construed to preclude the institution of any legal action or relieve the permittee
from any responsibilities, liabilities, or penalties to which the permittee is or may be subject under Section 311
of the CWA, or Section 106 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA).




6. Property Rights 



The issuance of this permit does not convey any property rights of any sort, nor any exclusive privileges. 




7. Confidentiality of Information 



a. In accordance with 40 CFR Part 2, any information submitted to EPA pursuant to these regulations may be claimed as
confidential by the submitter. Any such claim must be asserted at the time of submission in the manner prescribed on
the application form or instructions or, in the case of other submissions, by stamping the words ``confidential business
information'' on each page containing such information. If no claim is made at the time of submission, 

EPA may make the information available to the public without further notice.

 If a claim is asserted, the information will be treated in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR Part 2 (Public Information).


b. Claims of confidentiality for the following information 

will 

be denied:

If the permittee wishes to continue an activity regulated by this permit after its expiration date, the permittee
must apply for and obtain a new permit. The permittee shall submit a new application at least 180 days before the expiration
date of the existing permit, unless permission for a later date has been granted by the Regional Administrator. (The
Regional Administrator shall not grant permission for applications to be submitted later than the expiration date
of the existing permit.) 


9. State Authorities 



Nothing in Part 122, 123, or 124 precludes more stringent State regulation of any activity covered by these regulations,
whether or not under an approved State program. 


10. Other Laws 


The issuance of a permit does not authorize any injury to persons or property or invasion of other private rights, nor
does it relieve the permittee of its obligation to comply with any other applicable Federal, State, and local laws
and regulations. 



Section B. Operation and Maintenance of Pollution Controls 


1. Proper Operation and Maintenance 


The permittee shall at all times properly operate and maintain all facilities and systems of treatment and control
(and related appurtenances) which are installed or used by the permittee to achieve compliance with the conditions
of this permit and with the requirements of storm water pollution prevention plans. Proper operation and maintenance
also includes adequate laboratory controls and appropriate quality assurance procedures. This provision requires
the operation of back-up or auxiliary facilities or similar systems only when the operation is necessary to achieve
compliance with the conditions of the permit. 



2. Need To Halt or Reduce Not a Defense 


It shall not be a defense for a permittee in an enforcement 
action that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with
the conditions of this permit. 


3. Duty To Mitigate 


The permittee shall take all reasonable steps to minimize or prevent any discharge or sludge use or disposal in violation
of this permit which has a reasonable likelihood of adversely affecting human health or the environment.

4. Bypass 


a. 

Definitions. 
(1) ``Bypass'' means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a treatment facility. 
(2) ``Severe property damage'' means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities
which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably
be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays
in production. 

b. Bypass not exceeding limitations.

 The permittee may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause effluent limitations to be exceeded, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions
of Paragraphs B.4.c and 4.d of this section. 
c. 

Notice. 
(1) Anticipated bypass. 
If the permittee knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice, if possible at least ten days
before the date of the bypass. 
(2) Unanticipated bypass. 
The permittee shall submit notice of an unanticipated bypass as required in Paragraph D.1.e (24-hour notice). 
d. Prohibition of bypass. 
(1) Bypass is prohibited, and the Regional Administrator may take enforcement action against a permittee for bypass,
unless: 
(a) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
(b) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention
of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied
if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent
a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
(c)(i) The permittee submitted notices as required under Paragraph 4.c of this section. 
(ii) The Regional Administrator may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the
Regional Administrator determines that it will meet the three conditions listed above in Paragraph 4.d of this section.




5. Upset 


a. Definition.

 ``Upset'' means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary non-compliance with technology-based
permit effluent limitations because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the permittee. An upset does not
include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
b. 

Effect of an upset. 

An upset constitutes an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with such technology-based permit
effluent limitations if the requirements of Paragraph B.5.c of this section are met. No determination made during
administrative review of claims that noncompliance was caused by upset, and before an action for noncompliance,
is final administrative action subject to judicial review. 

c. 

Conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset. 

A permittee who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed,
contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 

(1) An upset occurred and that the permittee can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 

(2) The permitted facility was at the time being properly operated; 
(3) The permittee submitted notice of the upset as required in Paragraphs D.1.a and 1.e (24-hour notice); and 

(4) The permittee complied with any remedial measures required under B.3. above.

d. 

Burden of proof

. In any enforcement proceeding the permittee seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset has the burden of proof.




Section C. Monitoring and Records 



1. Monitoring and Records 


a. Samples and measurements taken for the purpose of monitoring shall be representative of the monitored activity.

b. Except for records of monitoring information required by this permit related to the permittee's sewage sludge
use and disposal activities, which shall be retained for a period of at least five years (or longer as required by 40
CFR Part 503), the permittee shall retain records of all monitoring information, including all calibration and maintenance
records and all original strip chart recordings for continuous monitoring instrumentation, copies of all reports
required by this permit, and records of all data used to complete the application for this permit, for a period of at
least 3 years from the date of the sample, measurement, report or application 

except for the information concerning storm water discharges which must be retained for a total of 6 years. 

This retention period may be extended by request of the Regional Administrator at any time. 
c. Records of monitoring information shall include: 
(1) The date, exact place, and time of sampling or measurements; 
(2) The individual(s) who performed the sampling or measurements; 
(3) The date(s) analyses were performed;

(5) The analytical techniques or methods used; and 
(6) The results of such analyses. 
d. Monitoring results must be conducted according to test procedures approved under 40 CFR Part 136 or, in the case
of sludge use or disposal, approved under 40 CFR Part 136 unless otherwise specified in 40 CFR Part 503, unless other
test procedures have been specified in the permit. 
e. The Clean Water Act provides that any person who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring
device or method required to be maintained under this permit shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more
than $10,000, or by imprisonment for not more than 2 years, or both. If a conviction of a person is for a violation committed
after a first conviction of such person under this paragraph, punishment is a fine of not more than $20,000 per day of
violation, or by imprisonment of not more than 4 years, or both. 


2. Inspection and Entry 


The permittee shall allow the Regional Administrator, or an authorized representative (including an authorized
contractor acting as a representative of the Administrator), upon presentation of credentials and other documents
as may be required by law, to: 
a. Enter upon the permittee's premises where a regulated facility or activity is located or conducted, or where records
must be kept under the conditions of this permit;

be provided orally within 24 hours from the time the permittee becomes aware of the circumstances. 

A written submission shall also be provided within 5 days of the time the permittee becomes aware of the circumstances.
The written submission shall contain a description of the noncompliance and its cause; the period of noncompliance,
including exact dates and times, and if the noncompliance has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected
to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the noncompliance. 

(2) The following shall be included as information which must be reported within 24 hours under this paragraph. 

(a) Any unanticipated bypass which exceeds any effluent limitation in the permit. (See  122.41(g).) 

(b) Any upset which exceeds any effluent limitation in the permit. 

(c) Violation of a maximum daily discharge limitation for any of the pollutants listed by the Regional Administrator
in the permit to be reported within 24 hours. (See  122.44(g).)

drilling rig that commences the discharge of pollutants after August 13, 1979, at a ``site'' under EPA's permitting
jurisdiction for which it is not covered by an individual or general permit and which is located in an area determined
by the Regional Administrator in the issuance of a final permit to be an area of biological concern. In determining
whether an area is an area of biological concern, the Regional Administrator shall consider the factors specified
in 40 CFR Sections   125.122.(a)(1) through (10). 

An offshore or coastal mobile exploratory drilling rig or coastal mobile developmental drilling rig will be considered
a ``new discharger'' only for the duration of its discharge in an area of biological concern. 



New source 

means any building, structure, facility, or installation from which there is or may be a ``discharge of pollutants,''

Hearing Concerning Application To Modify the Final Cancellation 
Order for Pesticide Products Containing EBDCs 


 
 

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 

 
 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Hearing. 
 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On December 1, 1993 the Agency received a request from 
Elf Atochem and Griffin Corporations to amend labels of certain 
pesticide products which contain the active ingredients of mancozeb 
or maneb and which were affected by the final EBDC Cancellation 
Order and to modify the final EBDC Cancellation Order to allow all 
EBDC registrants to modify their end use product label(s) in the 
same manner that Atochem and Griffin have proposed to amend theirs. 
The proposed amendment seeks to allow the use of more than one EBDC 
active ingredient per crop per season. It also seeks to allow for 
a single application per crop per season for seed treatment in 
addition to any foliar uses for products which have a registered 
seed treatment use for the particular crop. The proposed 
amendments would not change the current maximum allowable amount of 
EBDCs. 
 


Under subpart D of 40 CFR Part 164, this submission constitutes a 
petition to modify the final cancellation order concerning EBDC 
products. Such a petition may not be granted without a formal 
adjudicatory hearing. EPA has concluded that the submissions by 
Atochem and Griffin, if substantiated in a hearing, may provide a 
basis for modification of the order canceling EBDC products. This 
Notice (1) announces that EPA has decided to hold a hearing regarding the petition to modify that order as it applies
to the use of more than one EBDC 
active ingredient per crop per season and the allowance of a single 
application for seed treatment per crop per season (in addition to 
foliar applications) on crops which have registered seed treatment 
uses, (2) specifies the issues of fact and law to be considered at 
that hearing, and (3) establishes a schedule for the hearing. 
 

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On March 2, 1992, the Administrator issued a Notice of Intent to Cancel (NOITC) and Conclusion of the EBDC Special Review
which announced EPA's intent to cancel registrations and to deny applications for registration for all pesticide
products containing 
EBDCs as an active ingredient unless the registrations/applications 
complied with the terms and conditions of that Notice. As a result 
of the Notice, 11 uses were canceled and use restrictions were 
placed on the remaining 45 uses. One requirement was that, to 
avoid cancellation, all EBDC labels and product registrations 
bearing agricultural uses must be amended to include the following 
label statement: ``If this product is used on a crop, no other 
product containing a different EBDC active ingredient may be used 
on the same crop during the same growing season.'' This requirement 
prohibits the use of more than one EBDC active ingredient per crop 
per season. 
 


I. The Submissions 
 


On December 1, 1993 the Agency received evidentiary submissions 
from Elf Atochem and Griffin Corporations in support of their 
requests: (1) To amend labels of seven EBDC pesticide products which 
were subject to the Cancellation Order and which contain the active 
ingredients of mancozeb or maneb (Manex

TM

, Maneb 75DF, Maneb 80, 
Maneb Plus Zinc F4, Penncozeb, Penncozeb DF and Pro-Tex) and (2) 
that the Agency modify the final EBDC Cancellation Order to allow 
all other EBDC registrants to modify their EBDC end use product 
label(s) in the same manner that Atochem and Griffin have proposed 
to amend theirs. Subsequently, additional related correspondence 
was submitted by Atochem and Griffin on December 30, 1993 and 
January 12, 1994 to supplement the original proposal. 
 
The current label language required by the Cancellation Order 
prohibits the use of more than one EBDC (maneb, mancozeb, or 
metiram) on a given crop during a growing season. The petitioners 
request that more than one EBDC active ingredient be allowed to be 
used per crop per season. Under their proposal, when all products 
being used have the same maximum poundage (maximum application rate 
times the maximum number of allowed applications) the total amount 
used must not exceed the maximum label poundage, or when the 
products being used have different maximum poundages, the total 
amount used must not exceed the lowest maximum poundage. 
Additionally, allowance for a single seed treatment in addition to 
foliar applications where there is a registered use for seed 
treatment is requested. 
 
 
In their request, Atochem and Griffin are asking that EPA modify 
the Cancellation Notice and Order as noted below so that any EBDC 
registrant may amend their labels accordingly. The request also 
includes applications to amend labels of seven mancozeb and maneb 
products. 
 
One of the elements of the Cancellation Notice and Order was a 
label requirement which reads ``If this product is used on a crop, 
no other product containing a different EBDC active ingredient may 
be used on the same crop during the same growing season.'' This 
current language prevents the use of more than one EBDC active 
ingredient per crop per season. The registrants are proposing to 
replace that language with the following language: 
 





Foliar applications.

 Where EBDC products used allow the same maximum poundage of active ingredient per acre per season: 
 



If more than one product containing an EBDC active ingredient 
(maneb, mancozeb, or metiram) is used on a crop during the same 
growing season and the EBDC products used allow the same maximum 
poundage of active ingredient per acre per season, then the total 
poundage of all such EBDC products used must not exceed any of the 
specified individual EBDC product maximum seasonal poundage of 
active ingredient allowed per acre. 
 




Where EBDC products used allow different maximum poundage of active 
ingredient per acre per season: 
 



If more than one product containing an EBDC active ingredient is 
used on a crop during the same growing season and the EBDC products 
used allow different maximum poundage of active ingredient per acre 
per season, then the total poundage of all such EBDC products used 
must not exceed the lowest specified individual EBDC product 
maximum seasonal poundage of active ingredient allowed per acre. 



 



Seed Treatment

 



In addition to the maximum number of foliar applications permitted by the formula stated above, a single application
for seed treatment may be made on crops which have registered seed treatment uses. 



 
 

The language proposed by the registrants allows the use of more 
than one EBDC active ingredient per crop per season, specifies 
formulas to follow for maximum poundage allowed when different 
EBDCs are used, and allows for a single seed treatment per crop per 
season in addition to the foliar applications where the crop has a 
registered seed treatment use. 
 


II. Regulatory History 
 


On March 2, 1992, the Administrator issued a Notice of Intent to 
Cancel (NOITC) and Conclusion of the EBDC Special Review which 
announced EPA's intent to cancel registrations and to deny 
applications for registration for all pesticide products containing 
EBDCs as an active ingredient unless the registrations/applications 
complied with the terms and conditions of that Notice. The 
decision to issue that order was based on the determination that 
use of EBDCs without such modified terms and conditions would 
result in unreasonable adverse effects to humans or the 
environment. More specifically, 11 uses were canceled and use 
restrictions placed on the remaining 45 uses. The information and 
analysis upon which that determination was based is set forth in 
detail in the text of the March 2, 1992 NOITC (57 FR 7484). 
 
The NOITC contained a requirement that, to avoid cancellation, all 
EBDC labels and product registrations bearing agricultural uses 
must be amended to include the following label statement: ``If this 
product is used on a crop, no other product containing a different 
EBDC active ingredient may be used on the same crop during the same 
growing season.'' This requirement prohibits the use of more than 
one EBDC active ingredient per crop per season. Although the 
reason for this requirement was not stated in the Notice, the 
Agency's decision to limit EBDC application as such was to avoid 
the potential overuse of EBDC's through active ingredient 
switching. The decision was not based on specific risk concerns or 
on the risk calculations underlying the Agency's EBDC regulatory 
decision. 
 
Subsequent to the NOITC becoming an effective order of 
cancellation, the Agency received a request for a subpart D 
hearing, the evidentiary submissions and associated correspondence 
from Elf Atochem and Griffin Corporations, the details of which are 
delineated above. The Agency received supporting letters from the 
Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association and the National Potato 
Council. The language proposed would replace a label requirement 
specified in the Cancellation Notice and Order which allows the use 
of only one EBDC per crop per season and prohibits certain seed 
treatment applications. 
 


III. Statutory and Regulatory Background 
 


A. Standards for Maintaining a Registration 
 


Before a pesticide product may be lawfully sold or distributed in 
either intrastate or interstate commerce, the product must be 
registered by the Environmental Protection Agency. FIFRA section 
3(a) and 12(a)(1)(A). A registration is a license allowing a 
pesticide product to be sold and distributed for specified uses in 
accordance with specified use instructions, precautions, and other 
terms and conditions. A pesticide product may be registered or 
remain registered only if it performs its intended pesticidal 
function without causing ``unreasonable adverse effects on the 
environment'' FIFRA section 3(c)(5). ``Unreasonable adverse effects 
on the environment'' is defined as ``any unreasonable risk to man or 
the environment, taking into account the economic, social, and 
environmental costs and benefits of the use of the pesticide.'' 
FIFRA section 2(b). The burden to demonstrate that a pesticide 
product satisfies the criteria for registration is on the 
proponents of initial or continued registration. 

Industrial Union 
Dept. v. American Petroleum Institute

, 448 U.S. 607, 653 n.61 
(1980); 

Environmental Defense Fund v. Environmental Protection 
Agency

, 510 F.2d 1292, 1297, 1302 (D.C. Cir. 1975). 
 
Under FIFRA section 6, the Agency may issue a notice of intent to 
cancel the registration of a pesticide product whenever it is 
determined that the product no longer satisfies the statutory 
criteria for registration. The Agency may specify particular 
modifications in the terms and conditions of registration, such as 
deletion of particular uses or revisions of labeling, as an 
alternative to cancellation. If a hearing is requested by an 
adversely affected person, the final order concerning cancellation 
of the product is not issued until after a formal administrative 
hearing. 
 


B. Subpart D Proceedings 
 


When the Agency receives an application to permit use of a 
pesticide in a manner inconsistent with a prior cancellation 
decision, that application constitutes a petition to the 
Administrator to modify the final cancellation order. Because of 
the opportunity for a notice and a formal adjudicatory hearing 
which precedes entry of a final cancellation order concerning a 
pesticide product, EPA has determined that such an order should not 
be modified or rescinded without affording interested parties a 
similar notice and opportunity for hearing concerning such 
modification or rescission. The procedures governing all 
applications to modify or reverse a previous final cancellation 
order are set forth in subpart D of 40 CFR part 164, 40 CFR 164.130 
through 164.133. 
 
When all opportunities for hearing and review with respect to an 
Agency decision to cancel a pesticide product have either been 
exercised or waived, and a final cancellation order has been 
entered, the Agency is entitled to rely on the finality of the 
order and the validity of the evidentiary rationale supporting it. 
Applicants seeking modification of a final order should not be 
afforded a new adjudicatory hearing concerning the same matters 
which were considered or could have been considered during a prior 
hearing. Thus, 40 CFR 164.131(a) provides that the Administrator 
will grant a hearing to modify a prior final cancellation order 
when she finds that: 
(1) The applicant has presented substantial new evidence which may 
materially affect the prior cancellation order and which was not 
available to the Administrator at the time he/she made his/her 
final cancellation determination and, (2) such evidence could not, through the exercise of due diligence, have been
discovered by the parties to the cancellation proceeding prior to the issuance of the final order. 
 
In deciding whether or not to initiate a hearing, the Administrator 
does not need to determine that the evidence submitted by the 
petitioner would in fact justify modification of the prior order. 
Rather, a decision to initiate a hearing means only that the 
Administrator has determined that the evidence submitted, if 
substantiated on the record in the hearing, may ``materially affect'' 
the evidentiary rationale upon which the prior order was based. On 
the other hand, if the evidence submitted, even if substantiated on 
the record, would be unlikely to provide a basis for modification 
of the prior order, then a hearing would serve no purpose. 
 
If the Administrator determines that a petitioner has met the 
criteria for a subpart D hearing, the Administrator then publishes 
a notice in the 

Federal Register

 setting forth the determination, 
the rationale for that determination, a description of the issues 
of fact and law to be adjudicated in the hearing, and a schedule 
for the hearing. The purpose of the hearing is to determine 
whether: (1) Substantial new evidence exists and (2) such 
substantial new evidence requires reversal or modification of the 
existing cancellation order. For purposes of any decision in the 
hearing, those portions of the substantive rationale for the 
existing order concerning which the petitioner did not submit 
substantial new evidence are assumed to be correct. Thus, the 
scope of any subpart D hearing is intrinsically narrower than the 
proceeding which was held or could have been held concerning the 
order to be modified. 
 
In a subpart D hearing, as in a cancellation hearing, the 
Administrative Law Judge transmits a recommended decision to the 
Administrator, who then issues a final decision retaining, 
modifying, or reversing the existing order. 
 


IV. Analysis of the EBDC Request for Subpart D Hearing 
 


A. Risk Issues 
 


Atochem and Griffin have not submitted any new information which 
would affect the validity of the Agency's analysis of the toxicity 
of EBDCs or the methodology used by the Agency to estimate exposure 
to EBDCs. The petitioners assert that the proposed language does 
not increase the individual or seasonal application limits and 
provides equivalent protection in terms of limiting exposure while 
addressing the Agency's concerns about multiple EBDC use and having 
the added advantage of being more easily understood. The 
petitioners further assert that the decision to restrict EBDC use 
as per the restrictive language of the NOITC was not based on 
specific risk concerns but on concerns of exceeding maximum amount 
of product allowed per crop per season. 
 
As mentioned in unit II above, the March 2, 1992 NOITC, which 
contained the requirement which would prevent the use of more than 
one EBDC active ingredient per crop per season, did not provide a 
risk/benefit rationale for the specific application prohibitions at 
issue here. The Agency's thinking at that time
