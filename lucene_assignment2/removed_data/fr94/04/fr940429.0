MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION BOARD







Practices and Procedures



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Merit Systems Protection Board.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Merit Systems Protection Board is amending its practices and procedures to allow administrative judges to retain
jurisdiction over cases after the issuance of an initial decision for the purpose of vacating the initial decision
to accept a settlement agreement into the record. This change will allow the parties to enter into the record a settlement
agreement reached after the issuance of the initial decision without filing a petition for review with the full Board.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The amended regulation provides administrative judges the authority to accept settlement agreements into the record
after the issuance of the initial decision but before full Board consideration. This allows the parties to enter into
the record a settlement agreement reached after the issuance of the initial decision without filing a petition for
review thus facilitating the settlement of cases. This amendment does not change the current time limits prescribed
in 5 CFR 1201.113 for determining the finality of a Board decision or for filing a petition for review. 




The Board is publishing this rule as a final rule pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 1204(h).



List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 1201



Administrative practice and procedure, Government employees.




Accordingly, the Merit Systems Protection Board amends 5 CFR part 1201 as follows:



PART 1201_[AMENDED]



1. The authority citation for part 1201 continues to read as follows:

2. Section 1201.112 is revised to read as follows:



1201.112 

Jurisdiction of judge.



(a) After issuing the initial decision, the judge will retain jurisdiction over a case only to the extent necessary
to:


(1) Correct the transcript, when one is obtained;

(2) Rule on motions for exception to the requirement that a party seeking a transcript must pay for it;

(3) Rule on a request by the appellant for attorney fees;

(4) Process any petition for enforcement filed under subpart F of this part;

(5) Vacate an initial decision before that decision becomes final under  1201.113 in order to accept a settlement
agreement into the record.

Airworthiness Directives; Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe 125-1000A and Hawker 1000 Series Airplanes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Raytheon Corporate Jets Model
BAe 125-1000A and Hawker 1000 series airplanes. This action requires inspections of the thrust reverser system
for integrity, and correction of any discrepancy found. This amendment is prompted by a report that there is a possibility
of failure of the drive links (or attachments) on the thrust reversers of these airplanes due to the single link design
concept of the thrust reverser link and lock system. This condition, if not corrected, could result in inadvertent
deployment of a thrust reverser during flight. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent a significant
reduction in the controllability of the airplane due to an in-flight deployment of a thrust reverser.

 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe 125-1000A and Hawker
1000 series airplanes. The CAA advises that the manufacturer of the thrust reversers on these airplanes has conducted
a reassessment of the failure modes and effects analysis for the thrust reverser system, and has provided to the airplane
manufacturer additional recommendations for repetitive inspection intervals of the system. Results of that reassessment
revealed that failure of the drive links (or attachments) on the thrust reversers can occur due to the single link design
concept of the thrust reverser link and lock system. This condition, if not corrected, can result in inadvertent deployment
of a thrust reverser during flight, which could result in a significant reduction in the controllability of the airplane





Raytheon Corporate Jets, Inc., has issued Service Bulletin SB 78-12, dated January 24, 1994, that describes
procedures for a detailed visual inspection of the thrust reverser drive mechanism to detect wear and abrasion and
to ensure the security of the attachment of the actuator to its drive links, of the drive links to the thrust reverser
structure, and of the ends of the drive link and link hinges. The service bulletin also describes procedures for repetitive
inspections of the thrust reverser system for structural integrity. Accomplishment of these inspections will ensure
the continued structural integrity of the thrust reverser system. The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory.


This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of  21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.



Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent deployment of a thrust reverser in flight
and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane. This AD requires repetitive inspections of the thrust reverser
system for integrity, and correction of any discrepancy found. The inspections are required to be accomplished in
accordance with the service bulletin described previously. Correction of any discrepancy found is required to be
accomplished in accordance with procedures described in the airplane maintenance manual. 

This is considered interim action. The airplane manufacturer currently is developing a secondary locking feature
on the thrust reverser doors. Once this modification is developed, approved, and available, the FAA may consider
further rulemaking to require its installation. 


Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 



Comments Invited 



Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption 

ADDRESSES.

 All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 


Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-33-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Airworthiness Directives; SAAB Aircraft Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B 
Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain SAAB Model SAAB SF340A and
SAAB 340B airplanes. This action requires installation of a placard in the cockpit that informs the flight crew of
the prohibition against moving the power levers below ``flight idle'' (beta mode) when the airplane is airborne.
This amendment is prompted by an incident during which a Model SAAB 340B airplane, that was in ``beta mode'' for a short
duration during descent, lost all engine power. The action specified in this AD is intended to prevent engine overspeed
and the resultant loss of engine power. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Recently, the FAA has received a report that a SAAB Model SAAB 340B airplane lost all engine power during descent. In
this incident, the flight crew managed to land the airplane with no turbine power. However, the airplane ran off the
end of the runway and sustained damage in the process. The flight data recorder from this airplane revealed that the
power levers were set below ``flight idle'' (beta mode) for approximately eight seconds during the airplane's descent
from 9,200 feet 
altitude. Further, the FAA has received reports of other incidents in which operators of Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB
340B airplanes have selected ``beta mode'' either inadvertently or intentionally during flight. 


The FAA has determined that if the flight crew moves the power levels below ``flight idle'' (beta mode) when the airplane
is airborne, the propeller will go into a low pitch angle and the propeller speed may increase uncontrollably. This
condition, if not corrected, could result in engine overspeed and the resultant loss of engine power. 
SAAB Aircraft has issued Service Bulletin 340-76-033, dated March 31, 1994, that describes procedures
for installation of a placard in the cockpit of certain Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B airplanes. The placard informs
the flight crew of the prohibition against moving the power levers below ``flight idle'' (beta mode) when the airplane
is airborne. 
These airplane models are manufactured in Sweden and are type certificated for operation in the United States under
the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. The FAA has reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products
of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent engine overspeed and the resultant loss
of engine power. This AD requires installation of a placard in the cockpit of certain SAAB Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB
340B airplanes. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.

This is considered to be interim action until final action is identified, at which time the FAA may consider further
rulemaking. 
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 


Comments Invited 


Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons

ADDRESSES

. All communications received on 
or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received.
Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the
effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed. 
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, 
environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted
will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested
persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in
the Rules Docket. 
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments

Revocation of Restricted Area R-6707; Queets, WA 


<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action removes Restricted Area R-6707, Queets, WA. A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) review of
annual utilization data for R-6707 revealed that the area is no longer required for its designated purpose.
The Department of the Navy subsequently submitted a proposal to remove the restricted area. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
The Rule 



This amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations revokes Restricted Area R-6707, Queets, WA. An
FAA review of the annual utilization reports revealed that this area received limited use in the past year. After reviewing
its operational requirements, the Department of the Navy submitted a proposal to disestablish the area. This action
returns restricted airspace to public use; therefore, I find that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)
are unnecessary because this action is a minor technical amendment in which the public would not be particularly interested.
Section 73.67 of part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished in FAA Order 7400.8A dated March 3, 1993.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 



Environmental Review 
 


In accordance with FAA Order 1050.1D, ``Policies and Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts,'' this
action is not subject to environmental assessments and procedures.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Adoption of interim rule as final.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule adopts as final, the changes to Recreational Vessel Fee regulations which were published as an interim final
rule on February 17, 1993. The interim final rule changed the length categories of recreational vessels subject to
the recreational vessel fee (RVF) for calendar years 1993 and 1994, as required by the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries
Enforcement Act of 1992. This final rule also removes Lake Roosevelt, WA, from the listing of specific waters where
the Coast Guard has a presence.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Drafting Information



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Mr. Carlton Perry, Project Manager, Auxiliary, Boating,
and Consumer Affairs Division, and C.G. Green, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel.



Regulatory History



On February 17, 1993, the Coast Guard published an interim final rule entitled ``Recreational Vessel Fees'' in the


Federal Register

 (58 FR 8884). The rule was made effective on October 1, 1992, to coincide with the effective date of the statutory revisions
in section 501 of the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-582). A delay in amending
the existing regulations could have resulted in vessel owners or operators paying a fee which was no longer required.
The Coast Guard received one letter commenting on the interim final rule; it supported the announced phaseout of the
fees. No public hearing was requested and none was held. On March 17, 1994 (59 FR 12549), the Coast Guard published a
technical amendment to restore text in the CFR mistakenly removed by the interim final rule.



Background and Purpose



The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 amended section 2110 of title 46, United States Code, to require the
Secretary of Transportation to establish a fee or charge for recreational vessels and to collect it annually in fiscal
years (FY) 1991 through 1995 from the vessel owner or operator.

Section 501 of the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act, enacted October 16, 1992, amends 46 U.S.C. 2110(b)(1)
to limit collection of the annual fee to fiscal years 1993 and 1994, to reduce the number of recreational vessels subject
to the annual fee by limiting the vessel length categories partially in fiscal year 1993 and even more in 1994, and to
rescind the fee in fiscal year 1995.

This rule adopts the interim final rule, as corrected. 

This rule also removes Lake Roosevelt (WA) as a specific body of water on which the fee applies. Lake Roosevelt (WA)
was originally listed in  1.30-1(e) due to an actual Coast Guard presence for maintaining aids to navigation.
The Coast Guard entered into a memorandum of agreement transferring maintenance of the aids to navigation on Lake
Washington to the National Park Service in January 1993. With this transfer, the Coast Guard no longer has an actual
presence on Lake Roosevelt and the fees should no longer apply on the Lake. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice
of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) was not published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective
in less than 30 days after 

Federal Register

 publication. Publishing an NPRM and delaying its effective date would be contrary to the public interest to relieve
owners or operators of vessels on Lake Washington no longer subject to the fees from unnecessarily paying the fees.

Assessment



This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the Regulatory Policies and Procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26,1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this rulemaking to be so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation is unnecessary.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et. seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider the economic impact on small entities of a rule for which a general notice of rulemaking
is required. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632). Since this rule applies only to recreational vessels, the Coast Guard has determined that this rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This rulemaking reduces the collection-of-information requirements approved by the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). The subpart number is 33 CFR 1.30 and the corresponding OMB approval number is OMB Control Number 2115-0588.



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has
determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment.



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under paragraph 2.B.2 of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A ``Categorical
Exclusion Determination'' is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under

Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; Small Disadvantaged Business, Historically Black Colleges
and Universities, and Minority Institutions 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Defense (DoD).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim rule with request for public comments.







</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Defense has issued an interim rule amending the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement
to revise the definitions for historically black colleges (HBCUs) and universities and minority institutions (MIs).
The rule also revises the requirement for an offeror to qualify as small disadvantaged business, HBCU, or MI both at
time of submission of the offer and at time of award by eliminating the requirement to qualify at time of award.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 





A. Background 




Subsections 811(a) and (b), of the FY 1994 Defense Authorization Act (Pub. L. 103-160) revise the definitions
for historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) and minority institutions (MI) in 10 U.S.C. 2323(a)(1)(B)
and (C). Subsection 811(c) eliminates the requirement for an entity that is seeking a DoD contract and represents
itself as small disadvantaged business, HBCU, or MI to maintain its status as such entity at the time of award. 


The Director, Defense Procurement, issued Departmental Letter 94-06, April 21, 1994, to implement Subsections
811(a), (b) and (c). 



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 




The interim rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601

 et seq. 

The sole purpose of this rule is to implement statutory revisions. The impact, if any, would benefit small entities,
because the requirement for retaining status as a small disadvantaged business, historically black college or university,
or minority institution, at time of award is deleted. Comments from small entities concerning the affected DFARS
subparts will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite DFARS
Case 94-610 in correspondence. 




C. Paperwork Reduction Act 




The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the revisions in this rulemaking notice do not contain and/or affect
information collection requirements which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq. 




D. Determination to Issue an Interim Rule 




A determination has been made under the authority of the Secretary of Defense to issue this rule as an interim rule.
Urgent and compelling reasons exist to promulgate this rule before affording the public an opportunity to comment.
This action is necessary because Subsections 811(a), (b), and (c) became effective upon enactment of the Fiscal Year
1994 Defense Authorization Act (Pub. L. 103-160), on November 30, 1993. However, pursuant to Public Law 98-577
and Federal Acquisition Regulation 1.501, public comments received in response to this interim rule will be considered
in formulating the final rule.

Hazardous Materials Transportation; Registration and Fee Assessment Program



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of filing requirements.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Hazardous Materials Registration Program will enter Registration Year 1994-95 on July 1, 1994. Persons
who transport or offer for transportation certain hazardous materials are required to annually file a registration
statement and pay a fee to the Department of Transportation. Persons who registered for the 1993-94 Registration
Year will be mailed a Registration Statement form and informational brochure in April.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The purpose of this notice is to advise persons who transport or offer for transportation certain hazardous materials
of an annual requirement to register with the Department of Transportation. A Final Rule implementing this requirement
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 9, 1992 (57 FR 30620-30633), a clarification on July 28, 1992 (57 FR 33416-33417), editorial revisions
on August 21, 1992 (57 FR 37900-37902), a formal interpretation of the terms ``offeror'' and ``transporter''
on October 28, 1992 (57 FR 48739-48741), and an amendment to the regulation on March 5, 1993 (58 FR 12543-12545).
Each person, as defined by the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, who engages in any of the specified activities
relating to the transportation of hazardous materials is required to register annually with the Department of Transportation
and pay a fee. Proceeds are used to fund grants to State, local, and Indian tribal governments for emergency response
planning and training. The regulations implementing this program are in Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, Sections
107.601-107.620.




The persons affected by this rule include those who offer or transport in commerce any of the following materials:

A. Any highway route-controlled quantity of a Class 7 (radioactive) material;

B. More than 25 kilograms (55 pounds) of a Division 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 (explosive) material in a motor vehicle, rail car,
or freight container;

C. More than one liter (1.06 quarts) per package of a material extremely toxic by inhalation (Division 2.3, Hazard
Zone A, or Division 6.1, Packing Group I, Hazard Zone A);

D. A hazardous material in a bulk packaging having a capacity equal to or greater than 13,248 liters (3,500 gallons)
for liquids or gases or more than 13.24 cubic meters (468 cubic feet) for solids; or

E. A shipment, in other than a bulk packaging, of 2,268 kilograms (5,000 pounds) gross weight or more of a class of hazardous
materials for which placarding of a vehicle, rail car, or freight container is required for that class.

The 1993-94 registration year ends on June 30, 1994. The 1994-95 Registration Year will begin on July 1,
1994, and end on June 30, 1995. Any person who engages in any of the specified activities during that period must file
a Registration Statement and pay the associated fee of $300.00 before July 1, 1994, or before engaging in any of the
activities, whichever is later. All persons who registered for the 1993-94 Registration Year will be mailed
a Registration Statement form and an informational brochure in May 1994. Others wishing to obtain the form and any
other information relating to this program should contact the program number given above.

RSPA is now accepting 1994-95 registrations. The Registration Statement has not been revised for the 1994-95
Registration Year. Registrants should file a registration statement and pay the associated fee in advance of July
1, 1994, in order to ensure that a 1994-95 Registration Number has been provided by that date to comply with the
recordkeeping requirements, including the requirement that the number be made available on board each truck and
truck tractor (not including trailers and semi-trailers) used to transport hazardous materials subject to the registration
requirements. A Certificate of Registration is generally mailed within three weeks of RSPA's receipt of a Registration
Statement.

Persons who engage in any of the specified activities during a Registration Year are required to register for that
year. Persons who engaged in these activities during Registration Year 1992-93 (September 16, 1992, through
June 30, 1993) or 1993-94 (July 1, 1993, through June 30, 1994) and have not filed a registration statement and
paid the associated fee of $300.00 for each year for which registration is required should contact RSPA to obtain the
required form (DOT F 5800.2). Persons who fail to register for any registration year in which they engaged in such activities
are subject to civil penalties for each day a covered function is performed. The legal obligation to register for a
year in which any of the specified activities was conducted does not end with the registration year. Registration
after the completion of a registration year may also involve the imposition of a late fee and interest in addition to
a civil penalty.

For the 1994-95 Registration Year, RSPA has entered into an agreement with the Public Utilities Commission
of Ohio (PUCO) to test an alternative procedure for filing the Federal Registration Statement for motor carriers
who are also subject to the State of Ohio's registration program. Ohio Revised Code Section 4905.80 requires that
motor carriers transporting in or through Ohio hazardous materials that must be placarded, require the display of
vehicle markings, or must be manifested register with PUCO.

Motor carriers who are subject to the Federal 1994-95 Hazardous Materials Registration requirement, may elect
to submit a completed Federal Registration Statement DOT Form F 5800.2, through PUCO together with the associated
fee of $300.00 payable to the U.S. Department of Transportation. This option for the submittal of the Federal registration
documents through PUCO is being offered to certain motor carriers to demonstrate if this procedure is more cost-effective
or otherwise less burdensome to industry and government. Since this procedure is optional, a motor carrier subject
to Ohio's registration requirement may elect to register in the Federal program directly with the U.S. Department
of Transportation, as specified in 49 CFR 107.616. However, PUCO has agreed to verify that all motor carriers required
to register with PUCO are registered with DOT if they are subject to the Federal registration requirements.

A motor carrier subject to both the Federal and PUCO registration requirements who elects to register in the Federal
program through PUCO may obtain the required Federal and Ohio forms and related information by contacting the Public
Utilities Commission of Ohio, Transportation Department, Hazardous Materials Division, 180 East Broad Street,
5th Floor, Columbus, OH 43215-3793, telephone 614-466-7232.

On April 1, 1994 (59 FR 15602-15605), RSPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, in which it proposed several
additional requirements that may affect persons currently subject to the registration requirements. New provisions
proposed in this notice include: (1) A requirement that shippers verify that carriers are registered before using
their services and that carriers verify that shippers are registered before accepting a shipment from them; (2) a
requirement that vessel operators carry proof of registration on each vessel subject to the registration requirement;
and (3) a two-year extension (until July 1, 1996) in the delay in implementation of the registration requirement for
foreign offerors of hazardous materials. Persons subject to the registration requirements are advised to watch
for further developments in this rulemaking action.

Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska; Groundfish Fishery of the 
Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues final regulations to change requirements for observer coverage of the groundfish fisheries in the Gulf
of Alaska (GOA) and the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to improve
management of the groundfish fisheries off Alaska. The intended effect of this action is to increase observer coverage
of the groundfish harvests and to promote the fishery management objectives of the Fishery Management Plan (FMP)
for Groundfish of the GOA and the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Fishing for groundfish by vessels in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the GOA and the BSAI is managed by the Secretary
of Commerce (Secretary) according to the FMP for Groundfish of the GOA and the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the
BSAI. The FMPs were prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery
Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) and are implemented by regulations governing the U.S. groundfish
fisheries at 50 CFR parts 620, 672, and 675.

Amendments 13 and 18 to the groundfish FMPs for the BSAI and GOA, respectively, authorize a comprehensive domestic
fishery observer program. An Observer Plan to implement the program was prepared by the Secretary in consultation
with the Council and issued by NMFS, effective February 7, 1990 (55 FR 4839, 
February 12, 1990). At its December 1992 meeting, the Council reviewed draft changes to the Observer Plan that were
developed by NMFS and a Council-Appointed Industry Oversight Committee. The Council recommended that NMFS make
the draft changes and initiate a rulemaking to implement them. 
A proposed rule to implement the Council's recommendation was published in the 

Federal Register

 October 28, 1993 (58 FR 57979). Comments on the proposed rule were invited through November 29, 1993. Two letters of
comments were received and are summarized in the ``Response to Comments'' section of this preamble. 
After reviewing the reasons for the draft changes to the Observer Plan and the comments on the proposed rule to implement
them, NMFS has determined that this action is necessary for fishery conservation and management and implements the
following changes to the Observer Plan and its implementing regulations at   672.27 and 675.25. 



(1) Change the definition of a ``fishing trip'' and base observer coverage requirements on a new definition of ``fishing
days'' instead of ``fishing trip days''. ``Fishing day'' is defined as a 24-hour period from 0001 Alaska local time
(A.l.t.) through 2400 A.l.t. during which fishing gear is retrieved and groundfish, as defined at 50 CFR 672.2 and
675.2, are retained for further processing. 
(2) Increase observer coverage on vessels equal to or greater than 60 feet (ft)(18.3 m) in length overall (LOA) but
less than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA during each calendar quarter, so that vessels in this size category are required to carry
an observer 30 percent of the fishing days in each calendar quarter in which the vessels participate for more than 3
fishing days in a directed fishery for groundfish. Each vessel required to carry an observer during a calendar quarter
must carry an observer during at least one fishing trip for each of the following fisheries in which the vessel participates:
Pollock, Pacific cod, sablefish, rockfish, flatfish, and other species of groundfish. 
(3) Increase observer coverage of vessels using hook-and-line gear in the Eastern Regulatory Area of the GOA by requiring
operators of catcher/processor and catcher vessels using hook-and-line gear that participate in a directed fishery
for groundfish to carry a NMFS-certified observer during at least one fishing trip in the Eastern Regulatory Area
during each calendar quarter that they participate in a directed fishery for groundfish in this area;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940429-0-00016 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940429-0-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(4) Revise observer coverage requirements for vessels using pot gear to participate in a directed fishery for groundfish,
so that each vessel using pot gear that is equal to or greater than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA is required to carry an observer during
at least 30 percent of its fishing days during each calendar quarter in which it participates for more than 3 days in
a directed groundfish pot gear fishery; and

(5) Revise the conflict of interest standards for NMFS-certified observers and observer contractors. Revisions
include: (1) Placing restrictions on observers who were employed in the observed fishery within the preceding 12
months; and (2) prohibiting observer contractors from assigning observers in response to requests for or against
a specific individual or a specific gender, race, creed, or age of individual.




The intent of these measures is to increase observer coverage of the groundfish harvests and to promote the fishery
management objectives of the FMPs. Further descriptions of, and reasons for, these measures are contained in the
preamble to the proposed rule (58 FR 57979, October 28, 1993).

With the exception of  672.27(c)(1)(iii)(F), the effective date of the final rule is July 1, 1994. This date
coincides with the beginning of the third calendar quarter and will facilitate the implementation of new quarterly
observer coverage requirements by reducing confusion that would result from a mid-quarter effective date. Section
672.27(c)(1)(iii)(F) reduces observer coverage requirements for vessels 125 ft LOA or longer fishing for groundfish
with pot gear, and thus, provides relief to vessel operators in this category. Therefore, NMFS has determined that
the effective date for this section should not be delayed until July 1, 1994. The effective date for  672.27(c)(1)(iii)(F)
is May 31, 1994.



Changes in the Final Rule From the Proposed Rule



This final rule includes three changes from the proposed rule. These changes are described as follows:

First, technical changes are made to   672.27 and 675.25 to include minor editorial revisions and metric
equivalents for specified lengths of vessels that require different levels of observer coverage.

Second,  672.27(c)(1)(v)(C) is amended to clarify that a catcher vessel delivering groundfish to a shoreside
processor or to a mothership in Alaska State waters during a weekly reporting period will be assigned to a fishery category
based on the retained catch composition of all groundfish delivered to processors during that weekly reporting period
and reported on Alaska Department of Fish and Game fish tickets.

Finally, the Observer Plan is corrected by removing from Attachment 3 (Standards of Observer Conduct) an inappropriate
reference to title 15 CFR subtitle A, part O, of the U.S. Department of Commerce Regulations. These regulations pertained
to standards of conduct for employees of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Certified observers are not NMFS employees
and therefore cannot be held to these standards. The Observer Plan continues to require certified observers to comply
with the conflict of interest standards and general standards of behavior set out in Attachments 3 and 4 of the amended
Plan.

Two letters were received within the comment period that ended November 29, 1993. A summary of comments and NMFS's
responses follow.



Comment 1. 

The proposed action bases observer coverage on fishing days instead of fishing trip days and increases observer coverage
on vessels equal to or greater than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA but less than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA. This action would increase the
financial burden on the catcher boat fleet, particularly on those vessels delivering to shoreside facilities that
are required to have observer coverage. This results in an inequitable impact on the catcher boat fleet and further
aggravates the disproportionate effect of the Observer Program on catcher vessels. Given these effects, implementation
of measures to increase observer coverage should be delayed until after the North Pacific Fisheries Research Plan
is effective.

Response. 

NMFS acknowledges that the proposed rule would increase observer costs for vessels equal to or greater than 60 ft (18.3
m) LOA but less than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA that use trawl or hook-and-line gear to participate in a directed fishery for
Alaska groundfish. Larger vessels currently are required to have an observer on board at all times and are not affected
by the proposed change in coverage requirements. The increased observer coverage for vessels equal to or greater
than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA but less than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA is necessary to obtain more adequate information on which the
groundfish fisheries are managed, including better estimates of groundfish catch, discard amounts, and prohibited
species bycatch rates. Delay of regulatory action to increase observer coverage until the North Pacific Fisheries
Research Plan is effective would neglect identified data requirements necessary for effective management of the
Alaska groundfish fisheries.



Comment 2. 

The increased financial burden to the small boat fleet that will ensue from increased observer coverage is out of proportion
to the benefits that might result, particularly if NMFS continues to use observer data primarily as a basis for fishery
closures or enforcement, rather than for more effective fishery management.



Response. 

NMFS's primary responsibility for inseason management of the groundfish resource is to monitor groundfish harvests
and prohibited species bycatch rates, so that when a groundfish total allowable catch (TAC) or a prohibited species
bycatch allowance is reached, fishery closures can be implemented to prevent specified TACs or bycatch allowances
from being exceeded.

Existing observer coverage requirements established for vessels equal to or greater than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA but less
than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA were determined by the Council and its 

ad hoc

 Observer Committee to be inadequate to meet data needs for effective monitoring of groundfish and prohibited species
catch amounts by this segment of the groundfish fleet. NMFS concurs in this determination and has approved the Council's
recommended increase in observer coverage for vessels equal to or greater than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA but less than 125 ft
(38.1 m) LOA. The increase is intended to improve the level of observer coverage from this size class of vessel without
imposing costs that are disproportionate to the benefits that are anticipated to result from better inseason management
of the groundfish fisheries.

Use of observer data is not limited to inseason management of the fisheries and compliance monitoring of regulatory
programs. Observer data also are used to assess the status of fishery resources and as a basis for assessment and development
of management measures. NMFS has released certain observer data to the public under the Freedom of Information Act
for purposes of independent industry analyses of prohibited species bycatch rates and operational factors that
may reduce bycatch rates of these species. Additional observer data may be disclosed to support industry initiatives
to reduce prohibited species bycatch rates under a proposed rule published in the 

Federal Register

 January 19, 1994 (59 FR 2817). These Federal and private initiatives to use observer data for more effective fishery
management will be enhanced to the extent that more observer data are collected from vessels under 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA
as set out in this final rule.



Comment 3. 

The purpose and intent of the proposed rule to correct problems encountered by NMFS in administering observer coverage
on vessels equal to or greater than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA but less than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA are supported. However, given the
direction in which the fishery management process is progressing, 30 percent coverage for these vessels likely is
inadequate; 100 percent observer coverage on all vessels capable of carrying an observer should be considered.



Response. 

One hundred percent observer coverage on vessels equal to or greater than 60 ft LOA but less than 125 ft LOA has been required
for particular fisheries for specified areas and limited time periods to meet special management needs (59 FR 3000,
January 20, 1994, as modified at 59 FR 4009, January 28, 1994, and 59 FR 15346, April l, 1994). However, the additional
costs associated with 100 percent observer coverage on all vessels in the groundfish fishery under 125 ft LOA in all
areas at all times would impose disproportionate costs on this sector of the groundfish fleet and, therefore, are
not now justified under the current open access groundfish management program. NMFS will continue to assess the need
for increased observer coverage to meet special resource or fishery management needs.



Comment 4. 

Despite support for the proposed action, concerns remain about the ability of vessels to manipulate observer coverage
in certain fisheries and/or in certain areas where prohibited species bycatch rates may be higher. To address these
concerns, the final rule should be amended to require a vessel equal to or greater than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA but less than
125 ft (38.1 m) LOA to carry an observer for 30 percent of the days it engages in any particular fishery during any calendar
quarter in which it meets the threshold (3-day) minimum requirement on a fishery-by-fishery basis.



Response. 

The final rule limits the manipulation of observer coverage by decreasing the number of fishing days in a quarter that
trigger observer coverage requirements, basing coverage requirements on fishing days rather than fishing trip
days, and requiring observation of at least one trip for each fishery that a vessel participates in during a quarter.
These measures should reduce the potential for manipulation of observer coverage and increase the amount of observer
data available for the management of specific fisheries. Nonetheless, an opportunity still exists for a vessel operator
to manipulate observer coverage to reduce or increase coverage in different fisheries.

The EA/RIR/FRFA prepared for this action considered an alternative for increased observer coverage similar to the
one presented in Comment 4. The alternative was more stringent and could provide more observer data of certain fisheries
relative to the preferred alternative implemented under this final rule. However, this alternative was not adopted
by the Council for several reasons. First, concerns were expressed that some fishermen would have difficulties complying
with 30 percent observer coverage in each fishery because fishermen would need to be aware of and plan for the target
fishery each trip and keep track of the exact number of fishing days by fishery. Second, 30 percent coverage by fishery
would be relatively more expensive for a vessel in the 60-125 ft (18.3 m-38.1 m) LOA category to comply with
relative to the preferred alternative. Last, compliance monitoring would be more difficult and associated enforcement
costs would be increased relative to the preferred alternative under the final rule due to calculations to check 30
percent observer coverage by fishery. 



Comment 5. 

The proposed action to increase coverage of the longline fisheries in the eastern GOA is inadequate for two reasons.
First, the proposed action is subject to manipulation. Second, the overall level of reliable observer-generated
data from the hook-and-line gear fleet in the eastern GOA is deplorable. To respond to these inadequacies, the final
rule should require all vessels in the 60-125 ft (18.3-38.1 m) LOA category that use hook-and-line gear
to carry observers a minimum of 30 percent of the fishing days they operate in the eastern GOA during any particular
calendar quarter on a fishery-by-fishery basis. Furthermore, NMFS should make a concerted effort to place observers
on vessels under 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA so that data can be gathered about the operating characteristics of the small boat
fleet that accounts for most of the hook-and-line harvest in the eastern GOA. 



Response. 

The alternative coverage requirements suggested in Comment 5 for longline vessels in the eastern GOA was considered
by the Council, but not adopted for reasons similar to those presented in the response to Comment 4. 

The Council considered lowering the size limit for vessels required to carry observers to vessels less than 60 ft (18.3
m) LOA. The Council did not adopt this alternative because of increased costs to industry and increased chance of injury
to an observer or crew on small vessels because of limited working space and accommodations. Under the current Observer
Plan, NMFS has determined that implementation of changes to the observer coverage requirements for vessels under
60 ft (18.3 m) LOA would require separate regulatory action. Furthermore, staffing and budget constraints prevent
NMFS from placing employees onboard small vessels to serve as observers. Given these regulatory and practical constraints,
observer coverage requirements for the small boat fleet would best be pursued under the North Pacific Fisheries Research
Plan, which is pending approval and implementation by the Secretary. 



Comment 6. 

The proposed action to lower observer coverage on vessels using pot gear is premature and not supported as long as observer
data generated from the pot gear fisheries are used for allocative purposes. Data used to support allocative measures
should be based on comparable levels of observer coverage. Therefore, observer coverage on vessels using pot gear
should remain unchanged until an individual vessel quota system is implemented that will effectively address resource
allocation issues. 



Response. 

Since the implementation of the domestic observer program in 1990, observer data collected onboard pot gear vessels
participating in a directed fishery for groundfish consistently indicate that relatively low levels of prohibited
species bycatch mortality are associated with these operations. The Council recommended that NMFS reduce the observer
coverage requirements for pot vessels equal to or greater than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA from 100 percent to 30 percent because
of the very low bycatch mortality associated with these operations and the Council's expressed policy to encourage
selective fishing practices that typically experience low prohibited species bycatch mortality rates. Under the
final rule, the resulting levels of observer coverage of vessels using pot gear will assure the collection of sufficient
observer data to identify any changes in assumed bycatch mortality rates and other factors that may affect future
resource allocation issues.

Classification 



The FRFA prepared for this rule concluded that it could have significant effects on a substantial number of small entities
(i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions with limited resources).
A copy of the EA/RIR/FRFA prepared for this action is available (see 

ADDRESSES

). 

This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.

Observers. 



(a) 

Observer Plan. 

The operator of a fishing vessel subject to 50 CFR parts 672 and 675, and the manager of a shoreside processing facility
that receives groundfish from a vessel subject to 50 CFR parts 672 and 675, must comply with the Observer Plan. * * *


(b) 

Purpose. 

The purpose of this section is to allow observers to collect Alaska fisheries data deemed by the Regional Director
to be necessary and appropriate for research, management, and compliance monitoring of fisheries for groundfish,
as defined at  672.2 and  675.2 of this chapter, or for other purposes consistent with the Marine Mammal
Protection Act. 

(c) * * * 

(1) * * * 
(ii) * * * 

(D) 

Fishing trip

 means the time period that starts on the day when fishing gear is first deployed and ends on the day the vessel offloads
groundfish, returns to an Alaskan port, or leaves the EEZ off Alaska and adjacent waters of the State of Alaska, and
during which one or more fishing days, as defined in this section, occur. 

(E) 

Fishing day

 means a 24-hour period, from 0001 A.l.t. through 2400 A.l.t., in which fishing gear is retrieved and groundfish, defined
at  672.2 or  675.2 of this chapter, are retained. Days during which a vessel only delivers unsorted codends
to a processor are not fishing days. 

(iii) * * * 

(C) A catcher/processor or catcher vessel 125 feet (38.1 meters) in length overall or longer must carry a NMFS-certified
observer at all times while fishing for groundfish, except for a vessel fishing for groundfish with pot gear as provided
for in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(F) of this section. 
(D) A catcher/processor or catcher vessel equal to or greater than 60 feet (18.3 meters) length overall but less than
125 feet (38.1 meters) length overall must carry a NMFS-certified observer during at least 30 percent of its fishing
days in each calendar quarter in which the vessel participates for more than 3 fishing days in a directed fishery for
groundfish. Each vessel that participates for more than 3 fishing days in a directed fishery for groundfish in a calendar
quarter must carry a NMFS-certified observer during at least one fishing trip during that calendar quarter for each
of the groundfish fishery categories defined under paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(A) through (F) of this section in which
the vessel participates. 

(E) A catcher/processor or catcher vessel fishing with hook-and-line gear that is required to carry an observer under
paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(D) of this section must carry a NMFS-certified observer during at least one fishing trip in
the Eastern Regulatory Area of the Gulf of Alaska during each calendar quarter in which the vessel participates in
a directed fishery for groundfish in the Eastern Regulatory Area. 

(F) A catcher/processor or catcher vessel equal to or greater than 60 feet (18.3 meters) length overall fishing with
pot gear must carry a NMFS-certified observer during at least 30 percent of its fishing days in each calendar quarter
in which the vessel participates for more than 3 fishing days in a directed fishery for groundfish. Each vessel that
participates for more than 3 fishing days in a directed fishery for groundfish using pot gear must carry a NMFS-certified
observer during at least one fishing trip during a calendar quarter for each of the groundfish fishery categories
defined under paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(A) through (F) of this section in which it participates.

(F) 

Other species fishery. 

Fishing that results in a retained amount of groundfish, during any weekly reporting period, that does not qualify
as a pollock, Pacific cod, sablefish, rockfish, or flatfish fishery as defined under paragraphs (c)(1)(iv) (A) through
(c)(1)(iv)(E) of this section. 

(v) 

Assignment of vessels to fisheries. 

During any weekly reporting period, the retained catch composition of groundfish species or species groups of a vessel
for which a TAC has been specified under  672.20 or  675.20 of this chapter, in round-weight equivalents,
will determine to which of the fishery categories listed under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) (A) through (F) of this section
the vessel is assigned. 


(A) A catcher/processor vessel will be assigned to fishery categories at the end of each weekly reporting period based
on the round-weight equivalent of the retained groundfish catch composition included in the weekly production report
for the vessel submitted to the Regional Director under  672.5(c)(2) or  675.5(c)(2) of this chapter.


(B) A catcher vessel that delivers to mothership processors in Federal waters during a weekly reporting period will
be assigned to fishery categories based on the round-weight equivalent of the retained groundfish catch composition
included in the weekly production report for the mothership submitted to the Regional Director for that week under
 672.5(c)(2) or  675.5(c)(2) of this chapter.

(C) A catcher vessel that delivers groundfish to shoreside processors or to mothership processors in Alaska State
waters during a weekly reporting period will be assigned to a fishery category based on the round-weight equivalent
of the groundfish delivered to processors during that weekly reporting period and reported on one or more Alaska Department
of Fish and Game fish ticket or tickets as required under Alaska State regulations at A.S. 16.05.690.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document is the joint final rule for the supportive services component of the Congregate Housing Services Program,
which is authorized by section 802 of the National Affordable Housing Act and section 604 of the Housing and Community
Development Act of 1992. The program provides assistance in the form of supportive services to the frail elderly,
persons with disabilities, and temporarily disabled persons for the purpose of preventing premature or unnecessary
institutionalization and encouraging deinstitutionalization. The joint interim rule for the supportive services
component of the program was published on December 8, 1992 (57 FR 58042).

I. Introduction



The Congregate Housing Services Demonstration Program was first established by the Congregate Housing Services
Act of 1978 (42 U.S.C. 8001). It provided congregate housing and coordinated supportive services for elderly disabled
and non-elderly disabled individuals to allow them to maintain their independence and avoid costly and unnecessary
institutionalization. Congress appropriated funds for fiscal years 1979 through 1982, to remain available until
expended. Since then, Congress has appropriated funds annually to continue the grantees funded. The Congregate
Housing Services Program was implemented through the HUD Congregate Housing Services Handbook (4640.1). 

On November 28, 1990, the National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 8011) (NAHA) was enacted. In section 802, Congress
specifically directed the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA)
through the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) to jointly implement regulations to carry out the Congregate Housing
Services Program (CHSP). Section 802 provides for congregate services which are minimally necessary to prevent
premature or unnecessary institutionalization of frail elderly persons, persons with disabilities regardless
of whether a person is elderly, or temporarily disabled persons living in eligible housing for the elderly.

HUD and FmHA shall enter into grants with States, units of general local government, Indian tribes, PHAs, IHAs, and
local nonprofit housing sponsors, to provide congregate services. An IHA, PHA, and local non-profit housing sponsor
can enter into grants only on behalf of its project. States, units of general local government and Indian tribes may
enter into grants on behalf of for profit or not for profit owners of eligible housing. Each grant agreement shall be
made for a term of five years and shall be renewable (subject to the availability of funds) at the expiration of the term
by the Secretary concerned. The CHSP funds will provide for not more than 40 percent of the cost of providing the congregate
services program; at least 50 percent of the total cost will come from the grantee or third party organization, and
at least 10 percent from the program participant (up to a maximum of 20% of the participant's adjusted income). Program
participant fees may be waived by the Secretary concerned for eligible residents without income. In instances where
a waiver is granted, the grantee and the Secretary concerned will share the deficit on a 50/50 basis. 
The grantee will develop a supportive services plan and a case management process as part of the application. Supportive
services include meals, transportation, personal care (which may include dressing, bathing, and toileting), housekeeping,
chore assistance, non-medical counseling, group and socialization activities, non-medical supervision, wellness
programs, preventive health screening, monitoring of medication consistent with State law, personal emergency
response systems, and other requested supportive services if approved by the Secretary concerned. 
Under NAHA, eligible housing projects that were receiving assistance under the Congregate Housing Services Act
of 1978 on November 28, 1990 shall continue to receive priority for assistance funded under that Act. These grantees
will receive priority for assistance under this section after the expiration of the term of the grant. Each grantee
shall maintain, for the six-year transition period, the same dollar amount of its annual contributions in support
of the activities eligible for assistance under this section equal to the amount contributed for such activities
in the year ending on November 28, 1990. The grantee's contribution shall be equal to no less than the amount of the eligible
owner's annual contribution plus any inflationary increases allowed by the Secretary concerned. At the end of six
years, each grantee must meet the requirements of the new Congregate program. 
On October 28, 1992, the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (HCDA of 1992) was enacted (Public Law 102-550).
Sections 604 and 672 of the HCDA of 1992 amended section 802 of NAHA. Section 604 amended section 802(i)(1)(B)(i) of
NAHA by increasing from three to six years the period of time that grantees funded under the Congregate Housing Services
Act of 1978 would be exempt from the requirement to provide 50% matching funds upon expiration of the term of the grant.
It also increased the three-year requirement for maintenance of funds contributed by the grantee to six years. Section
672 of the HCDA of 1992, amended section 802(d)(4) of NAHA by requiring that service coordinators be trained in the
aging process, elder services, disability services, eligibility for and procedures of Federal and applicable State
entitlement programs, legal liability issues relating to providing service coordination, drug and alcohol use
and abuse by the elderly, and mental health issues.
On December 8, 1992, HUD and FmHA published a joint interim rule and invited the public to comment on it for consideration
in drafting the final joint common rule. The public was also invited to comment and provide suggestions concerning
the implementation of the retrofitting and renovation components of the Congregate Housing Services Program. The
joint final rule responds to public comments on the joint interim rule.
The FmHA and HUD are promulgating identical regulations applicable to the Congregate Housing Services Program.
Since the regulations are identical, the text of the regulations is set out only once at the end of the common preamble.
The part heading, table of contents, and authority citation for the regulations as they will appear in each CFR title
follow the text of the final common rule. The entire text of the regulations as they will appear in each CFR title follows
the text of the final common rule. The entire text of the regulation will appear in the respective parts of the Code of
Federal Regulations of both FmHA and HUD. 


II. Public Comments


HUD received 9 comments on the December 8, 1992, joint interim rule. The comments were from governmental entities,
public housing agencies (PHAs), nonprofit organizations, HUD field offices and advocacy groups for the aging.


General




Comment: 

One comment was directed to the overall program with the commenter stating that the language in the rule was too complex
and that the number of repetitions was ``dumbfounding''. The commenter stated that he would like to see a ``simple
and common English explanation of how employment will impact an elderly individual's Section 8 or 236 rent subsidy,
medicare premiums and 551 payments. The commenter also indicated that he would like to see a concise list of the duties
of a service coordinator.

 HUD and FmHA response: 

The CHSP does not set income limits for the section 8 program or for the Section 236 program. The CHSP also does not set
requirements regarding medicaid and section 551. The regulations concerning the definition of income and income
limits for participants in the section 8 program can be found at 24 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Part 813. The CHSP
interim rule has been simplified in the final version of the rule. Section 

XXX

.220 of both the interim common rule and this final rule list the duties of the service coordinator.


Comment: 

One commenter stated the rule appears to discriminate against the housing authority that has not been able to accumulate
unrestricted funds sufficient to purchase services, and that many housing authorities already have in place (prior
to 1992 and 1993), eligible housing for the elderly already adapted for use with frail elderly and persons with disabilities
for the purpose of preventing unnecessary institutionalization, without having grant funds available to them under
the Congregate Housing Service Program. This commenter also indicated that the interim common rule clearly contradicts
the intent and spirit of the statute.


HUD and FmHA response: 

Section 802(i)(1)(A)(i) of the National Affordable Housing Act requires that the cost for services under the CHSP
be shared between the Secretary concerned and the grantee. The grantee or other third party shall provide 50% of the
cost of providing the CHSP; the Secretary concerned shall provide no more than 40% of the cost of providing CHSP; and
fees from the program participant shall provide at least 10% of the cost. HUD and FmHA recognize that there are many
projects that already had supportive services programs in existence prior to the implementation of this CHSP and
therefore, cannot use existing services as match for the CHSP. In accordance with the statutory requirement, only
new or expanded services can be used as match. The matching funds provided by the grantee must cover at least 50% of the
cost of providing supportive services under the CHSP. The rule is consistent with the statutory purpose which is to
provide new or expanded supportive services in federally assisted housing to prevent premature institutionalization
in a manner that respects the dignity of the elderly and persons with disabilities and the cost sharing requirements
of the program.


Comment: 

One commenter stated that the interim joint rule does not require applicants to address transition to other service
programs in the event of cessation of CHSP funding. The commenter suggested that the rule include a provision which
would provide that requests for grant application include a plan for the continuation of necessary services or transition
to other service providers in the event CHSP funds are no longer available.


HUD and FmHA response: 

While HUD and FmHA share the commenter's concern for a commitment from the applicant to continue to provide services
in the event funds are no longer appropriated for this program, it was agreed not to impose any additional paperwork
or commitments upon the applicant. Applicants are experiencing difficulties obtaining matching funds and it was
agreed that requiring the grantees to factor in funds for continuation or transition to other service providers five
years in advance would be too burdensome.


Comment: 

The commenter stated that the interim rule should be amended to permit applicants to request CHSP funding for multiple
projects. 


HUD and FmHA response: 

The rule does not contain application requirements. The application requirements are set forth in the Notice of Funding
Availability (NOFA) for the CHSP. The NOFA announces the availability of funds and sets forth the application requirements.
HUD and FmHA will publish a new NOFA announcing the availability of funding and the application requirements. The
commenter's suggestion will be considered in drafting the NOFA for fiscal year 1994. 


Comment: 

One commenter states that  

XXX

. 205(f) should spell out whether the Grants Officer will be a field, regional or headquarters employee.


HUD and FmHA response: 

The Grants Officer responsibility and the responsible office will be explained in the CHSP notice and handbook.


Cost Distribution




Comment: 

One commenter states that the regulation should be amended to allow the 10% of the total program costs that are required
to be generated by participants' fees to be generated by participants' fees, contributions, or the cost-sharing
that is already required by an existing program eligible for match rather than just through participant fees. The
commenter states that for fee-generating purposes   

XXX

.235(2) and 

XXX

.240(a) preclude the use of otherwise eligible local match programs that permit contributions, but not fees, or which
already charge cost-share fees. The commenter states that if fees generated by participant fees, contributions,
or cost-sharing already in an existing program eligible for match are allowed, HUD can retain the CHSP's program's
intent to incorporate a participant expense sharing component and will also address the significant barriers to
sufficient fee-generation that applicants will experience because of the different fee-charge regulations in
a variety of programs that would logically be used for the CHSP matching requirements.

HUD and FmHA response: 

Section 

XXX

.240 of the rule has been revised to allow fees to include cash contributions of the program participant, food stamps
and any other contributions or donations. Cost sharing and fees collected by any eligible new or expanded service
program for the CHSP are currently eligible. However, due to the statutory constraints concerning matching funds,
funds for existing services which are not expanded are not eligible for match. Matching funds must pay for 50% of the
cost of the services under CHSP and therefore, only costs for new or expanded services are eligible for match. 



Definitions





Comment: 

One commenter urged the Department to reconsider its definition of activities of daily living (ADL) and the way that
its definition is applied in the interim common rule. The commenter stated that the definition of ADL promulgated
in the new rule combines what are now commonly known in the worlds of gerontological research and community-based
aging programs as ``activities of daily living'' (ADL) and ``instrumentalities of daily living'' (IDL). The commenter
stated that the rule definition of ADL was created by combining these terms without regard to what is currently used
in the community and other common programs. The commenter argues that this definition is not in the spirit of coordination
of housing and services which it believes is intended by the CHSP. The commenter further states that the way in which
the definition of activities of daily living is applied is ``antithetical to the concept of aging in place.'' The commenter
states that when one looks at the definition and all its caveats, the potential population to be served is not what is
commonly known as the frail elderly but rather a fairly narrow niche of somewhat frail older adults. The commenter
stated that while it understands HUD might want to be cautious about this definition in order to maintain a housing
rather than an institutional character to its developments, it is also important that such appropriateness decisions
be reviewed on an individual rather than a categorical basis whenever possible.



HUD and FmHA response:

 Program participants are limited to the frail elderly deficient in at least three activities of daily living by statute.
Therefore, HUD and FmHA decided to combine the ADL's and IDL's based upon HUD's past experiences in operating the CHSP
of 1978. By combining ADLs and IDLs for the definition of ADLs and stating the minimum deficiency level, the program
is able to serve a larger population of frail elderly persons than would be served by the traditional definitions of
the ADLs. 



Comment:

 One commenter states that the definition of activities of daily living (ADL) should be more concise and the minimum
requirements of ADL which are listed in  

XXX

.225(c)(2) should be initially stated under the definitions.



HUD and FmHA response:

 Section 

XXX

.225(c)(2) restates the definition of activities of daily living found in the definition section.



Comment: 

One commenter states that instead of including PHAs specifically in the definition of ``Applicant'' PHAs are identified
as eligible grantees under the definition of ``Local nonprofit housing sponsor.'' The commenter suggests that the
rule specifically identify PHAs and IHAs as eligible grantees. 



HUD and FmHA response:

 The definition of ``Applicant'' has been revised to specifically identify PHAs and IHAs as eligible grantees.



Comment: 

One commenter states that the definition of qualifying supportive services found in  

XXX

.105 and the eligible activities found in  

XXX

.210 do not tie in directly to the minimum requirements for ADL. The commenter states that the minimum requirements
of ADL do not include non-medical supervision and personal emergency response systems.



HUD and FmHA response: 

Qualifying supportive services and eligible activities should not tie directly into the requirements of ADL. The
ADLs are used to determine if frail elderly persons are minimally eligible to participate in the program. Program
participants (frail elderly persons deficient in at least three ADLs and persons with disabilities) would then be
eligible to receive qualifying supportive services such as non-medical supervision and personal emergency response
systems, if they need them.



Comment:

 The commenter states that the section number in the reference for the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and
Bill of Rights Act contained in  

XXX

.105(7) should be changed from (7) to (5).



HUD and FmHA response:

 This error has been corrected.



Comment: 

The commenter states that in  

XXX

.205(e) Eligible housing projects of the interim rule the reference to non-elderly ``disabled'' should be changed
to non-elderly people with ``disabilities.''



HUD and FmHA response: 

All references to non-elderly handicapped or non-elderly disabled have been changed to non-elderly people with
disabilities.

Eligibility






Comment:

 One commenter recommended deleting the reference to nonresidents in  

XXX

.230 under eligibility. The commenter maintained that due to the limited amount of funds available for this CHSP,
funds should be utilized by tenants occupying eligible housing and that if a community shows a need to serve nonresidents,
other sources of funding could be pursued to meet that need.



HUD and FmHA response:

 Nonresident elderly persons, persons with disabilities, and temporarily disabled are eligible to participate
in CHSP at the option of the program management in consultation with project residents. The program management has
the discretion to deny nonresidents participation in the program if their participation is not cost-effective or
if it adds to the need for assistance under the program. Nonresidents who receive services under CHSP must pay a fee
equal to the cost of the services provided. Nonresidents are not eligible for CHSP funds to subsidize their costs for
services.



Match 





Comment:

 The commenter states that the 50% match requirement for the grantee or eligible owner is excessively burdensome and
may result in an inordinate amount of program failures. These program failures would have the ultimate result of doing
harm to the program participants who relocate to the congregate housing locations in reliance on the programs. The
commenter also states that the rules as written necessitate the inclusion of a great deal of estimated information
in the budget. The commenter states that while service costs may be known, the likelihood of program failure increases
because the number of participants, types of services to be requested and the ability of the participant to pay cannot
be known until program startup. 



HUD and FmHA response:

 Section 802(i)(1)(A)(i) of the National Affordable Housing Act requires that the cost for services under the CHSP
be shared between the Secretary concerned and the grantee. The grantee shall provide 50% of the cost of providing the
CHSP; the Secretary concerned shall provide 40% of the cost of providing CHSP; and fees from the program participant
shall provide 10% of the cost. While HUD and FmHA agree that both participant interest and need are estimated at best,
the budget information is necessary to establish a dollar value and limit for the application and to assist in the rating
and ranking of applications for CHSP funding.



Comment:

 One commenter stated that the 50% match requirement and the restrictions on what can be counted as in-kind service
are barriers that the rule presents which causes its housing authority to be unable to participate in the program.
The commenter suggests that in instances like its own where projects have limited resources that it be allowed to count
the services already provided as in-kind match. The commenter also contends that local community services are already
``maxed'' out because housing authorities have been successful in having a number of services provided by community
agencies and that the housing authorities prior to the grant period have already invested as much or more than the match
requirement.



HUD and FmHA response:

 Section 802(i)(1)(A)(i) of the National Affordable Housing Act requires that the cost for services under the CHSP
be shared between the Secretary concerned and the grantee. The grantee or other third party is required to provide
50% of the cost of providing the CHSP; the Secretary concerned provides no more than 40% of the cost of providing CHSP;
and fee from the program participant provides at least 10% of the cost. Match funds must account for 50% of the cost of
services under the CHSP program. Only qualified supportive services are eligible services under the CHSP. Since
section 802(k)(16) defines qualified supportive services as new or expanded services, match funds can only be used
for new or expanded services.
 


Non-Allowable Costs





Commenter:

 One commenter states that the examples of non-allowable costs under the program include capital funding items. The
commenter states that the failure to allow projects access to funds to cover capital cost will place projects at a disadvantage
in developing a CHSP and may also discourage many nonprofit owners from applying and participating in the program.
The commenter also states that during congressional consideration of NAHA, it supported Senate passage of a new and
separately funded retrofit program to provide for modernization and retrofitting of elderly housing projects.




HUD and FmHA response:

 HUD and FmHA decided to disallow capital funding items because they were concerned the majority of the funds for supportive
services would be used to fund capital improvements. Upon implementation of the retrofit component of the CHSP, modernization
and retrofitting will be eligible activities. Due to the limited amount of funding available FmHA and HUD decided
that the purposes of the program are best served by only funding the supportive services component. 



Program Participant Fees





Comment:

 One commenter states that the regulations should include a provision that does not cap HUD's contribution for resident
fee deficits. The commenter also suggests that the regulations should allow the CHSP to use other income sources to
make up for any resident-fee deficit that arises because of the 20% cap on resident fees, or that arises because the
local program match program permits only contributions. The commenter states that contributions should be permitted
to count as part of the fee amount and that the regulations should be amended to allow a flexible sliding scale fee schedule
for participants for whom 20% or even 10% of adjusted income is too costly or where 10% of the cost of a specific fee is
too high. Commenter also states that there should be more flexible fee waivers to include participants who are at or
below the poverty level.




HUD and FmHA response:

 Section 

XXX

 .240 of the regulation has been revised to allow food stamps and other contributions or donations to be included as
part of the 10% fee amount for program participants. In instances where the grantee finds that the fees for a participant
are too high, the grantee can request a waiver of  

XXX

.240(e) of the regulation. Any waived fees are shared 50% between the Secretary concerned and the grantee. 



Retrofit and Renovations Component





Comment:

 There were several comments and suggestions concerning the retrofitting and renovation component of the Congregate
Housing Services Program. Several commenters expressed discontent with the decisions not to fund the retrofit and
renovation component and the failure to implement regulations. Many stated that the retrofit component was an integral
and critical part of the program. One commenter stated that HUD and FmHA had the authority and the flexibility to allocate
some funding for retrofit in order to have the program in place for full funding later. There was a general concern for
the Department's failure to develop interim regulations in order to implement retrofit once funding is made available.
 


HUD and FmHA response:

 Since HUD and FmHA had very little guidance from Congress on the implementation of the program, they invited comments
from the public on how the renovation and retrofit component should be implemented. They also invited comments on
specific issues concerning this component. HUD and FmHA will use the responses received to assist in the drafting
of regulations implementing the retrofit and renovation component at a later date.



III. Findings and Certifications



A. 

National Environmental Policy Act. 

A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR part 50 implementing section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4332.
The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection and copying between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m.
weekdays at the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, 451 Seventh Street, SW., room 10276, Washington, DC 20410.

B. 

Regulatory Flexibility. 

The Secretary and the Administrator, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), have reviewed
this rule before publication and by approving it certify that this rule does not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. The rule will provide grants to States, Indian tribes, units of general
local government and local nonprofit housing sponsors for congregate services programs for eligible project residents.
Although small entities will participate in the program, the rule would not have a significant impact on them.

C. 

Family Impact.

 The General Counsel of HUD, as the Designated Official under Executive order 12606, 

The Family,

 has determined that the policies contained in this rule will have some significant impact on the maintenance and general
well-being of families. The revised CHSP can be expected to provide supportive services which can prevent or postpone
unnecessary or premature institutionalization, and reduce unnecessary stress and financial burdens on participants'
families by allowing them to remain in their apartments. Because the impact on family concerns is wholly beneficial,
no further review under the executive order is considered necessary.

D. 

Federalism Impact.

 The General Counsel of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, as the Designated Official for the Department
of Housing and Urban Development under section 6(a) of Executive Order No. 12611_Federalism, has determined that
the rule does not involve the preemption of State law by Federal statute or regulation and does not have Federalism
implications.

E. 

Semiannual Agenda.

 This final common rule was listed as item number 1477 in the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Semiannual
Agenda of Regulations published on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 56402) under Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility
Act. 

F. This rule has been reviewed in light of Executive Order 12778 and meets the applicable standards provided in sections
2(a) and 2(b)(2) of that Order. Provisions within this part which are inconsistent with state law are controlling.
All administrative remedies pursuant to 7 CFR part 1900, subpart B must be exhausted prior to filing suit.
 


Public Reporting Burden



The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and
Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520). The Department has determined that
the following provisions contain information collection requirements.

 This part is adopted pursuant to section 802 of the National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 8011) and section 604
of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. Pursuant to section 802(m) of the National Affordable Housing

(b) 

Purpose. 

(1) The program under this part provides for minimal supportive services to the frail elderly, persons with disabilities
and temporarily disabled individuals as a means of preventing unnecessary institutionalization and encouraging
deinstitutionalization. The program also provides management with the capacity to assess the service needs of eligible
residents and to locate and arrange for the delivery of community based supportive services. The program is implemented
in a manner that both respects the dignity of the participants and encourages their independence. The provision of
supportive services allows for a continuum of care on a long term basis and offers another option in supportive living
arrangements. The program functions as an active proponent of community based care and affords an opportunity for
housing projects to become an additional source for supportive service delivery in the local area.
(2) The program is additionally designed to:
(i) Improve the quality of life of older Americans living in federally assisted housing;
(ii) Preserve the viability of existing affordable housing projects for low income older residents who are aging
in place by assisting managers of housing with the difficulties and challenges created by serving older residents;
(iii) Develop partnerships between the Federal Government and State governments in providing services to the frail
elderly and persons with disabilities and the temporarily disabled, and
(iv) Utilize Federal and State funds in a more cost-effective and humane way in serving the needs of older adults.
(c) 

Applicability. 

This part applies to:
(1) Public housing as that term is defined in section 3(b) of the United States Housing Act of 1937;
(2) Low income housing developed or operated under a contract between the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
and an Indian housing authority under title II of the United States Housing Act of 1937;
(3) Housing assisted under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 with a contract that is attached to the
structure under section 8(d)(2) or with new construction or substantial rehabilitation of the structure under section
8(b)(2), as that section existed before October 1, 1983;
(4) Housing assisted under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959;
(5) Housing assisted under section 221(d) or 236 of the National Housing Act, with respect to which the owner has made
a binding commitment to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development not to prepay the mortgage or terminate the
insurance contract under section 229 of the National Housing Act (unless the binding commitments have been made to
extend the low-income use restriction relating to the housing);
(6) Housing assisted under section 514 or 515 of the Housing Act of 1949, with respect to which the owner has made a binding
commitment to the Secretary of Agriculture not to prepay or refinance the mortgage (unless the binding commitments
have been made to extend the low income use restrictions relating to the housing for not less than the 20-year period
under section 502(c)(4) of the Housing Act of 1949); and
(7) Housing assisted under section 516 of the Housing Act of 1949.


  

XXX

.105 

Definitions.


As used in this part_


Act 

means section 802 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act.


Activity of Daily Living (ADL) 

means an activity regularly necessary for personal care and includes eating (may need assistance with cooking, preparing
or serving food, but must be able to feed self); dressing (must be able to dress self, but may need occasional assistance);
bathing (may need assistance in getting in and out of the shower or tub, but must be able to wash self; grooming (may need
assistance in washing hair, but must be able to take care of personal appearance); getting in and out of bed and chairs,
walking, going outdoors, using the toilet; and household management activities (may need assistance in doing housework,
grocery shopping or laundry, or getting to and from one location to another for activities such as going to the doctor
and shopping, but must be mobile. The mobility requirement does not exclude persons in wheelchairs or those requiring
mobility devices). Each of the Activities of Daily Living noted above includes a requirement that a person must be
deficient in his or her ability to perform at a specified minimal level (e.g., to satisfy the eating ADL, the person
must be able to feed him/herself). The determination of whether a person is deficient in this minimal level of performance
must include consideration of those services that will be performed by a person's spouse, relatives or other attendants
to be provided by the individual. For example, if a person requires assistance with cooking, preparing or serving
food plus assistance in feeding him/herself, the individual would meet the minimal performance level and thus satisfy
the eating ADL, if a spouse, relative or attendant provides assistance with feeding the person. Should such assistance
become unavailable at any time, the Owner is not obligated at any time to provide individualized services beyond those
offered to the resident population in general. The Activities of Daily Living analysis is relevant 

only 

with regard to determination of a person's eligibility to receive supportive services paid for by CHSP and is not a
determination of eligibility for occupancy.


Adjusted income 

means adjusted income as defined in 24 CFR part 813 or 913.

owner or grantee gives preference in tenant selection (with HUD approval) for all units in the eligible project (or
for a building within an eligible mixed-use project) to eligible elderly persons, persons with disabilities, or
temporarily disabled individuals. For purposes of this part, this term does not include projects assisted under
the Low-Rent Housing Homeownership Opportunity program (Turnkey III (24 CFR part 905, subpart G)).


Eligible housing project 

means:
(1) Public housing (as that term is defined in section 3(b) of the United States Housing Act of 1937);
(2) Low income housing developed or operated under a contract between the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
and an Indian housing authority under title II of the United States Housing Act of 1937;
(3) Housing assisted under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 with a contract that is attached to the
structure under section 8(d)(2), or with a contract entered into in connection with the new construction or substantial
rehabilitation of the structure under section 8(b)(2), as that section existed before October 1, 1983;
(4) Housing assisted under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959;
(5) Housing assisted under section 221(d) or 236 of the National Housing Act, with respect to which the owner has made
a binding commitment to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development not to prepay the mortgage or terminate the
insurance contract under section 229 of the National Housing Act (unless the binding commitments have been made to
extend the low-income use restrictions relating to the housing for the remaining useful life of the housing);
(6) Housing assisted under section 514 or 515 of the Housing Act of 1949, with respect to which the owner has made a binding
commitment to the Secretary of Agriculture not to prepay or refinance the mortgage (unless the binding commitments

Farmers Home Administration 

(FmHA) means a credit agency for agriculture and rural development in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).


Fees 

mean charges levied to residents for meals with or without other supportive services under CHSP and equivalent fees

prepared and signed by a registered dietitian, which states that each meal provided under CHSP meets the minimum daily
dietary allowances.

(v) 

Food stamps and agricultural commodities. 

In providing meal services under this paragraph (a)(2), each congregate services program shall apply for approval

(1) Working with the professional assessment committee established under section  

XXX

.225 on an ongoing basis to assess the service needs of eligible residents;

(2) Working with service providers and the professional assessment committee to tailor the provision of services
to the minimum needs and characteristics of eligible residents;

(3) Mobilizing public and private resources to ensure that the qualifying supportive services identified under
 

XXX

.210 can be funded over the time period identified under  

XXX

.205;

(4) Monitoring the effectiveness of any supportive service program receiving grant assistance under this section;
and

(5) Performing other duties and functions that the Secretary concerned determines to be appropriate to enable frail
elderly persons, persons with disabilities, and temporarily disabled individuals residing in federally assisted
housing for the elderly to live with dignity and independence.

(b) The service coordinator shall comply with the qualifications and standards required by the Secretary concerned.
The service coordinator shall be trained in the aging process, elder services, disability services, eligibility
for and procedures of Federal and applicable State entitlement programs, legal liability issues relating to providing
service coordination, drug and alcohol use and abuse by the elderly, mental health issues, and any other areas required
by the Secretary concerned.

(c) The Service Coordinator may be employed directly by the grantee, or employed under a contract with a case management
agency on a fee-for-service basis, and may serve less than full-time. The Service Coordinator or the case management
agency providing service coordination shall not provide supportive services under a CHSP grant or have a financial
interest in a service provider agency which intends to provide services to the grantee for the CHSP.

(d) Funding for service coordinators may be provided by state, local, public or private providers or CHSP.

(e) The Service Coordinator shall:

(1) Provide general case management and referral services to all potential participants in the Congregate Housing
Services Program. This involves intake screening upon referral, from the grantee, of income-eligible frail elderly
persons, persons with disabilities and temporarily disabled individuals, and preliminary assessment of frailty
or disability, using a commonly accepted assessment tool. The Service Coordinator then will refer to the professional
assessment committee (PAC) those individuals who appear eligible for the CHSP;

<DOC>

<PARENT> FR940429-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) Establish professional relationships with all agencies and service providers in the community, and develop
a directory of providers for use by program staff and program participants;

(3) Refer proposed participants to service providers in the community, or those of the grantee. Serve as staff to the
PAC. Complete, for the PAC, all paperwork necessary for the assessment, referral, case monitoring and reassessment
processes; implement the case plan developed by the PAC and agreed to by the program participant. Maintain necessary
case files on each program participant, containing such information and kept in such form that HUD and FmHA shall require.
Provide the files to PAC members upon request, in connection with PAC duties;

(4) Monitor the ongoing provision of services from community agencies and keep the PAC and the agency providing the
supportive service informed of the progress of the participant;

(5) Educate grant recipient's program participants on such issues as application procedures, service availability,
and program participant options and responsibilities;

(6) Establish volunteer support programs with service organizations in the community;

(7) Assist the grant recipient to build informal support networks with neighbors, friends and family;

(8) Educate other project management staff on issues related to ``aging-in-place'' and services coordination,
to help them to work with and assist other persons receiving housing assistance through the grantee.

(f) Service coordinators shall not serve as members of the PAC.

(g) For a Service Coordinator obtained under contract with a case management agency, the contract must include provisions
containing, at a minimum: beginning and end dates of the contract; number and responsibilities of staff provided
by the agency; rates of pay/costs of services to be provided; location of offices, and an agreement to provide HUD and
FmHA access to the files; and other documentation pertinent to the Congregate Housing Services Program. Any contracts
awarded or purchases made under this subsection by grantees that are public bodies must conform to the policies and
procedures stated at 24 CFR 85.36.

(h) (1) Each frail elderly person, person with disabilities and temporarily disabled individual tentatively selected
by the grantee must be assessed for degree of functional incapacity before being accepted into the Congregate Housing
Services Program. The assessment is performed by a voluntary PAC, which handles the individual's entrance into and
the transition out of the Congregate Housing Services Program, development of case plans for that person, and regular
reassessment of the individuals in the program. PAC members may not be paid with Congregate program grant funds, but
if the duties and responsibilities of the PAC are discharged by a community agency, the agency's costs may be counted
as matching funds for any time spent on assessments after the initial approval of program participants, if approved
by the Secretary concerned.

(2) The PAC, upon completion of the assessment, must make a recommendation to the Service Coordinator for acceptance
into (or denial of acceptance into) the Congregate Program. In the case of an acceptance, the PAC must provide a case
plan for each eligible resident. Once an individual is accepted into the CHSP it is the responsibility of the Service
Coordinator to tailor the case plan to the needs of that participant, and to work with community agencies, the grantee
and third party service providers to ensure that the services are provided on a regular, ongoing, and satisfactory
basis, in accordance with the plan. Before actual acceptance into the Congregate Housing Services Program, the eligible
resident must work with the PAC and the Service Coordinator in developing his or her supportive services plan. Acceptance
of any services under the plan by the program participant is voluntary. In developing this plan, the PAC must take into
consideration the participant's needs and wants and must provide the minimum supportive services necessary to maintain
independence. If participants want other services, they can buy them at cost, if available.

Professional Assessment Committee (PAC).



(a) 

General. 

A professional assessment committee, under paragraph (b) of this section, shall identify eligible project residents
and shall designate services appropriate to the functional abilities and needs of each eligible project resident.
The committee shall utilize procedures that ensure that the process of determining eligibility of individuals for
congregate services affords individuals fair treatment, due process and a right of appeal of the determination of
eligibility, and shall ensure the confidentiality of personal and medical records. A professional assessment committee
under this section shall consist of not less than three individuals, who shall be appointed to the committee by the
officials of the eligible housing project responsible for the congregate services program. It shall include at least
one qualified medical or other health professional and social services professionals competent to appraise the
functional abilities of frail elderly persons, persons with disabilities and temporarily disabled individuals
in relation to the performance of tasks of daily living. Service coordinators shall not serve as PAC members. PAC members
are subject to the conflict of interest provisions in  

XXX

.245(f). The PAC may be either a voluntary committee appointed by the project management or an agency in the community
which provides assessment services and can conform to HUD and FmHA requirements. At least one PAC member shall not
have any direct or indirect relationship to the grantee. No PAC member may be affiliated with organizations providing
services under the grant. If a case management agency provides the service coordination, the agency may not be affiliated
with the organization providing supportive services under the grant.

(b) 

Operating procedures. 

The PAC shall:
(1) Recommend, to the Service Coordinator, persons eligible for entrance, or for transition out of, CHSP;
(2) Authorize or perform medical evaluations, if necessary. These evaluations may be performed by a PAC medical professional,
or the applicants to CHSP may be referred to another agency in the community that will perform the evaluation without
charge;
(3) Recommend, and update as necessary, a supportive services plan for each frail elderly person or person with disabilities,
or temporarily disabled person;
(4) Obtain and retain information in files concerning program participants. The files should contain such information
and be maintained in such form, as HUD and FmHA shall require;
(5) Present written evaluations to the grantee; and
(6) Allow program participants to appeal decisions related to entrance to, degree of participation needed, and transition
out of CHSP.
(c) 

Duties of the PAC. 

The PAC is required to:
(1) Perform a formal assessment of each potential elderly program participant's deficiencies in performing the
ADLs. This assessment shall be based upon the screening done by the Service Coordinator, and shall include a review
of the adequacy of the informal support network (i.e., family and friends available to the potential participant
to assist in meeting the ADL needs of that individual);
(2) Determine that each elderly program participant is deficient in at least three ADLs. The minimum requirements
of ADL include:
(i) Eating (may need assistance with cooking, preparing or serving food, but must be able to feed self),
(ii) Dressing (must be able to dress self, but may need occasional assistance),
(iii) Bathing (may need assistance in getting in and out of the shower or tub, but must be able to wash self),
(iv) Grooming (may need assistance in washing hair, but must be able to take care of personal appearance),
(v) Getting in and out of bed and chairs, walking, going outdoors, using the toilet and 
(vi) Household management activities (may need assistance in doing housework, grocery shopping or laundry, or getting
to and from one location to another for activities such as going to the doctor and shopping, but must be mobile. The mobility
requirement does not exclude persons in wheelchairs or those requiring mobility devices.)


Each of the Activities of Daily Living noted above includes a requirement that a person must be able to perform at a specified
minimal level (e.g., to satisfy the eating ADL, the person must be able to feed him/herself). The determination of
whether a person meets this minimal level of performance must include consideration of those services that will be
performed by a person's spouse, relatives or other attendants to be provided by the individual. For example, if a person
requires assistance with cooking, preparing or serving food plus assistance in feeding him/herself, the individual
would meet the minimal performance level and thus satisfy the eating ADL, if a spouse, relative or attendant provides
assistance with feeding the person. Should such assistance become unavailable at any time, the Owner is not obligated
at any time to provide individualized services beyond those offered to the resident population in general. The Activities
of Daily Living analysis is relevant only with regard to determination of a person's eligibility to receive supportive
services paid for by CHSP and is not a determination of eligibility for occupancy; 
(3) Determine that non-elderly disabled individuals qualify under the definition of person with disabilities under
 

XXX

.105;
(4) Perform a regular assessment and updating of the supportive services plan of all participants;
(5) Replace any members of the PAC within 30 days after a member resigns. A PAC shall not do formal assessments if its
membership drops below three, or if the qualified medical professional leaves the PAC and has not been replaced by
the grantee;
(6) Notify the grantee or eligible owner and the program participants of any proposed modifications to PAC procedures,
and provide these parties with a process and reasonable time period in which to review and comment, before adoption
of a modification;
(7) Provide assurance of nondiscrimination in selection of CHSP participants, with respect to race, religion, color,
sex, national origin, familial status or type of disability;
(8) Provide complete confidentiality of information related to any individual examined, in accordance with the
Privacy Act of 1974;
(d) 

Procedural rights of participants. 

 (1) The PAC must provide an informal process that recognizes the rights of individuals receiving assistance to due
process of law. This process, at a minimum, must consist of: 
(i) Serving the participant with a written notice containing a clear statement of the reasons for termination; 
(ii) A review of the decision, in which the participant is given the opportunity to present written or oral objections
before a person other than the person (or a subordinate of that person) who made or approved the termination decision;
and 
(iii) Prompt written notification of the final decision to the participant.
(2) Procedures must ensure that any frail elderly person, person with disabilities, or temporarily disabled person
(and program participant upon reassessment) has the option of refusing offered services and requesting other supportive
services as part of the case planning process. 
(3) In situations where an individual requests additional services, not initially recommended by the PAC, the PAC
must make a determination whether the request is legitimately a needs-based service that can be covered under the
CHSP subsidy. Individuals can pay for services other than those recommended by the PAC as long as the additional services
do not interfere with the efficient operation of the program.
(e) 

Eligibility, admissions and transition-out procedures.

 (1) Before selecting frail elderly persons, persons with disabilities, or temporarily disabled participants,
each grantee (with PAC assistance) shall develop a supportive services application form for the use of persons applying
for supportive services under CHSP. The information in the individual's supportive services application is crucial
to the PAC's determination of the need for further physical or psychological evaluation of any individual who wishes
to receive the supportive services offered. The application should include: any intake form, the ADL assessment,
and appropriate comments from both the applicant's physician and the Service Coordinator.
(2) The grantee or PAC must develop procedures for providing for an individual's transition out of the CHSP to another
setting. Transition out is based upon the degree of supportive services needed by an individual to continue to live
independently. If a program participant is transitioned out of the program, but wishes to retain supportive services,
he or she may do so, as long as he or she remains income eligible, continues to live in an eligible project, and pays the
full cost of services provided. A participant can be transitioned out of CHSP if he or she:
(i) Gains physical and mental health and is able to function without supportive services, even if only for a short time
(in which case readmission, based upon reassessment to determine the degree of frailty or the disability, is acceptable);

(iii) Refuses or fails to pay service fees.

services under the CHSP.
(2) In providing services under a Congregate Housing Services Program, the program shall give priority to very low
income individuals, and shall consider their service needs in selecting program participants.
(b)

 Other residents.

 Elderly persons, persons with disabilities and temporarily disabled individuals who reside in an eligible housing
project other than eligible project residents under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may receive services from a
congregate services program if the housing managers, congregate service coordinators, and the professional assessment
committee jointly determine that the participation of these individuals will not negatively affect the provision
of services to eligible project residents. Residents eligible for services under this paragraph shall pay fees as
provided under  

XXX

.240.
(c) 

Nonresidents.

 Elderly persons, persons with disabilities, and temporarily disabled persons who are not residents of the project
may participate in the Congregate Housing Services Program at the option of program management in consultation with
project residents, if the participation of these persons will not adversely affect the cost effectiveness or operation
of the program, or add significantly to the need for assistance. Nonresidents who receive services under the congregate
services program shall pay a fee as established under  

XXX

.240(f).



 

XXX

.235 

Cost distribution.


(a) 

General.

 Each state, Indian tribe, unit of general government, or local nonprofit housing sponsor that receives amounts under
a contract under  

XXX

.205(a) shall supplement any such amount with amounts sufficient to provide at least 50 percent of the cost of providing
the congregate services program. In instances where the state is the applicant, the local government's contribution
shall not exceed 10 percent of the amount required of the state. The Secretary concerned shall authorize owners to
use excess residual receipts (if authorized) to the extent available to supplement funds received from CHSP.
(1) The CHSP shall provide no more than 40 percent of the cost of the program, under a grant agreement in accordance with
 

XXX

In the application, the applicant (and or Project, if different) shall certify that it shall maintain the existing
supportive services that frail elderly and nonelderly disabled residents are already receiving, including those
which a PAC may determine are necessary to maintain independence for potential CHSP participants. These services
will be maintained either for the time the individual remains in the CHSP, or for the duration of the CHSP grant. These
services do not qualify as matching funds. 
(c) 

Prohibition on substitution of funds. 

The grantee shall ensure that the activities provided to the project under a grant in support of activities eligible
for assistance under this part will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, annual funds the grantee was providing
to the project in support of activities eligible for assistance under this part before the date of the submission of
the application for CHSP assistance. The grantee shall certify to the Secretary concerned that CHSP funds will not
be substituted for funds that the grantee was providing before the date of application for assistance under CHSP.
(d) 

Eligible supplemental contributions (Matching Funds).

 (1) All sources of matching funds must be directly related to the types of supportive services prescribed by the PAC
or CHSP administration.
(2) Matching funds may include: 
(i) Cash (which may include funds from federal, state and local governments, third party contributions, available
payments authorized under Medicaid for specific individuals in the Congregate Housing Services Program, Community
Development Block Grants or Community Services Block Grants, Older Americans Act programs or excess residual funds
with the approval of the Secretary concerned).
(ii) The imputed dollar value of other agency or third party-provided direct services or staff who will work with or

provide services to program participants; these services must be justified in the application to assure that they
are the new or expanded services of the CHSP necessary to keep the program participants independent without creating
dependence. If services are provided by the state, Indian tribe, unit of general local government, or local nonprofit
housing sponsor, IHA, PHA, for profit or not for profit owner, any salary paid to staff from governmental sources to
carry out the program of the grantee and any salary paid to residents employed by the program (other than from amounts
under a contract under  

XXX

.205) is allowable match. 
(iii) In-kind items (these are limited to 10 percent of the 50 percent matching amount), such as the current market
value of donated common or office space, utility costs, furniture, material, supplies, equipment and food used in
direct provision of services. The applicant must provide an explanation for the estimated donated value of any item
listed. 
(iv) The value of services performed by volunteers to the program, at the rate of $5.00 an hour. 
(e) 

Limitation. 

 (1) The following are not eligible for use as cash match funds:
(i) Funds from a PHA's operating funds; 
(ii) PHA's section 8 administrative fee; 
(iii) CHSP funds; 
(iv) Section 8 funds other than excess residual receipts; 
(v) CIAP funds unless used for service coordination or case management; 
(vi) Comprehensive grant funds unless used for service coordination or case management. 
(2) For purposes of complying with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, if the state is the applicant,
the Secretary concerned may not consider any amounts contributed or provided by any local government to any state
receiving assistance under this section that exceeds 10 percent of the amount required of the state.
(f) 

Annual review of match.

 The Secretary concerned will review the infusion of matching funds annually, as part of the program/budget review.
If there are insufficient matching funds available to meet program requirements at any point after grant start-up,
or at any time during the term of the grant (i.e., if matching funds from sources other than program participant fees
drop below 50 percent of total supportive services cost), the Secretary concerned may decrease the federal grant
share of supportive services funds accordingly.

of assistance exceeding $100,000 in budget authority to certify that no Federal funds have been or will be spent on
lobbying activities in connection with the assistance. The rule also requires disclosures from applicants, among
others, if nonappropriated funds have been spent or committed for lobbying activities if those activities would

interest in any contract, subcontract, or agreement with respect thereto, or any proceeds thereunder, either for
himself or herself or for those with whom he or she has family or business ties during his or her tenure, or for one year
thereafter.

(g)

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary amends the regulations governing the Secretary's recognition of accrediting agencies in order to
implement provisions added to the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, and
the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993. The purpose of the Secretary's recognition of accrediting agencies
is to assure that those agencies are, for HEA and other Federal purposes, reliable authorities as to the quality of
education or training offered by the institutions of higher education or higher education programs they accredit.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In order to approve a postsecondary education institution to participate in the student financial assistance programs
authorized under Title IV of the HEA (referred to as ``Title IV, HEA programs'') and many other Federal programs, the
Secretary must determine, in part, that the institution satisfies the statutory definition of an ``institution
of higher education.'' Under the HEA and many other Federal statutes, one element of that definition requires an eligible
institution of higher education to be accredited or preaccredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary
as a reliable authority as to the quality of the education or training provided by the institution. Another element
requires an eligible institution to be legally authorized to provide an education program beyond the secondary level
in the State in which it is located. In addition, to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, the institution must
be certified by the Secretary as administratively capable and financially responsible. Thus, the HEA provides the
framework for a shared responsibility among accrediting agencies, States, and the Federal government to ensure
that the ``gate'' to Title IV, HEA programs is opened only to those institutions that provide students with quality
education or training worth the time, energy, and money they invest in it. The three ``gatekeepers'' sharing this
responsibility have traditionally been referred to as ``the triad.'' 


While the concept of a triad of entities responsible for gatekeeping has had a long history, originating in 1952, the
Higher Education Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102-325, significantly increased the gatekeeping responsibilities
of each member of the triad. Specifically, Congress amended the HEA to provide for a new part H of Title IV entitled ``Program
Integrity Triad.'' Under the new part H, the requirements that accrediting bodies must meet if they are to be recognized
by the Secretary as ``gatekeepers'' for Title IV or other Federal purposes are specified in detail. Part H also provides
a new oversight responsibility for States: The State Postsecondary Review Program. Altogether, part H establishes
a set of responsibilities for accrediting agencies, States, and the Secretary that creates a stronger and more coordinated
evaluation of institutions that participate, or wish to participate, in the Title IV, HEA programs.

The Secretary recognizes that the approach to significantly increased gatekeeping activity outlined in the statute
for the three members of the triad is a new one. This approach will require leadership in both implementation and evaluation
if it is to achieve the effectiveness that Congress intended. The Secretary will take steps to assure that the various
responsibilities of the triad members are carried out in a manner that, in fact, results in the identification of institutions
that should not be eligible to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, on the basis of either the quality of education
they offer or their inability to handle program funds. At the same time, the Secretary is committed to carrying out
the responsibility for coordinating the activities of the triad members that are inherent in the statute in a manner
that causes the least burden to institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
To these ends, the Secretary is committed to effective management of the gatekeeping function. The Secretary will
review carefully the applications of accrediting bodies and the standards and operating plans proposed by State
Postsecondary Review Entities (SPREs) under the State Postsecondary Review Program to insure that they meet the
requirements of the statute and these regulations and will enable these triad agencies to fulfill their statutory
purposes. The Secretary will also place a priority on the completion of the ``Postsecondary Education Participation
System,'' the Department's new integrated data base, which will contain the information that the Secretary generates
in the course of the Secretary's oversight of institutions participating in Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary
will use the data base to inform accrediting bodies and SPREs of actions taken by the Secretary so that they may in turn
carry out their responsibilities. This expanded data base is also critical to the Secretary's effective selection
of institutions for program review. 
Monitoring the results of the gatekeeping process is a very important key to effective management. The Secretary
will evaluate the activities of accrediting agencies, SPREs, and the Department to determine their effectiveness
in improving the integrity of institutions participating in Title IV programs and will take such steps as may be indicated
to improve the results. Finally, as provided in the statute, the Secretary will seek the advice and counsel of the National
Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity in evaluating the effectiveness of the triad. 
The Secretary believes that the approach best suited to achieving the objectives of the statute is a complementary
one, with each member of the triad focusing its evaluation on its obligations within the context of the HEA. Thus, the
focus for accrediting agencies is the quality of education or training provided by the institutions or programs they
accredit. States, in addition to providing the legal authority to operate within the state required for participation
in the Title IV, HEA programs, will review institutions that meet certain statutory review criteria related to institutional
performance in the Title IV, HEA programs. The focus of the Secretary's evaluation of institutions is on the administrative
and financial capacity of those institutions to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
While the functions and responsibilities of each of the triad members are generally different, the statute does require,
in some instances, that all members of the triad evaluate similar areas. For the most part, the principle of complementary
functions will lead to the members evaluating those same areas from different perspectives for different purposes.
For example, all three of the triad members are required to examine the finances of an institution. If each looks at
financial strength from a perspective complementary to that of the others, accrediting agencies would focus principally
on the capacity of the institution to continue to offer programs at a level of quality sufficient to meet accrediting
agency standards and to fulfill the institution's mission over a 5-10 year period of accreditation. The emphasis
of a review by a SPRE would be on whether or not the institution possesses the full range of resources needed to serve
students currently attending the institution. The Secretary's responsibilities focus on the institution's finances
in light of its ability to provide the services described in its official publications and statements, to provide
the administrative resources necessary to comply with its Title IV, HEA program responsibilities, and to meet all
of its financial obligations, including, but not limited to, refunds of institutional charges and repayments to
the Secretary for liabilities and debts incurred in programs administered by the Secretary.

Despite the Secretary's efforts to encourage complementary functions for each of the triad members, it is theoretically
possible that, in some instances, an institution could be subject to three different standards regulating the same
area of operation. For this reason, where a Title IV standard has been promulgated at the Federal level, the Secretary
expects accrediting agencies and States to take this into account in establishing their own standards to insure that
varying standards do not pose an unnecessary burden on institutions. It is also important that accrediting agencies
and States not impose any standard that is weaker than a comparable Title IV, HEA program standard. The Secretary believes
coordination of this is a federal responsibility. 

In view of the complementary approach to the functions of the triad members, the Secretary believes, for example,
that institutions should not have to develop different methodologies to provide data that the three members of the
triad may require. The Secretary also believes that, to the extent feasible, any other requests for data about the
institution, its students, or its graduates should rely on information already in the institution's possession.
To that end, the Secretary expects accrediting agencies and States either to accept student data based on the methodology
that will be specified in the regulations governing ``Student Right to Know,'' also mandated by the Higher Education
Amendments of 1992, or, where the institution may have other methodologies for calculating data, such as a system
designed to provide data to a State higher education commission or other State agency, to accept data in the format
already being used by the institution. Similarly, the Secretary expects accrediting agencies and SPREs to use the
audited financial statements institutions are now required to provide to the Secretary on an annual basis to the extent
those statements are compatible with the nature of the reviews conducted under their respective standards. 

The Secretary also recognizes that other Federal agencies, such as the Department of Labor and the Veterans Administration,
also regulate institutions in some areas that are similar to those included in part H. The suggestion has been made
that the Secretary should promulgate Federal standards in the areas of overlap so that institutions would not be subject
to varying standards developed by other Federal agencies and the triad members. However, the Secretary interprets
part H as permitting States and accrediting agencies to establish their own standards, as opposed to using a Federal
standard, and also believes that this is the most effective approach. In addition, it is not clear how the requirements
of the different agencies are compatible with the requirements of part H. The purposes of these programs administered
by other agencies may be very different. As a result, the Secretary has not pursued this alternative. The Secretary
does believe that it would be useful to explore how the varying requirements of other Federal agencies that are similar
to those of part H might be coordinated to reduce any burden on institutions and will initiate such exploration. 

The Secretary believes that, where possible, data developed at the national level should be made available to institutions,
as well as to States and accrediting agencies to assist them in carrying out their responsibilities under part H. In
particular, data concerning labor markets and compensation for specific fields and information concerning graduation
and withdrawal rates at various types of institutions may be helpful to both triad members and institutions. The Secretary
will facilitate the development of this type of information and, where possible under the auspices of the Department,
will coordinate the development of data that will be helpful to institutions and the triad.

Finally, as part of the commitment to providing leadership to the triad, the Secretary will convene representatives
of the triad members and institutions to exchange information about the gatekeeping process and to discuss how the
triad is functioning, both in identifying institutions whose performance is questionable and in reporting requirements
that have proven to be unreasonably burdensome. The Secretary invites comments concerning the functioning of the
triad, as it is implemented through these and other regulations governed by part H. The Secretary will seek improvement,
where possible, within existing regulations and will propose modifications to regulations and to the statute itself
if experience indicates those changes are both necessary to achieve effective gatekeeping, with minimal burden,
and compatible with the need to maintain, and assure the public of, the integrity of the Title IV, HEA programs.

On January 24, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for part 602 in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 3578). The NPRM included, on pages 3578-3601, a thorough discussion of the major issues addressed by the
proposed regulations. The following is a brief summary of the major proposed changes to the Secretary's Procedures
and Criteria for Recognition of Accrediting Agencies that were contained in the NPRM. 
1. As required by section 496(m) of the HEA, the proposed regulations authorized the Secretary to recognize only those
accrediting agencies that accredit institutions of higher education or higher education programs for the purpose
of enabling those institutions or programs to establish eligibility to participate in programs administered either
by the Secretary or by other Federal agencies.

2. As required by section 496(a) of the HEA, the proposed regulations required accrediting agencies whose accreditation
enables the institutions they accredit to participate in programs authorized under the HEA to be administratively
and financially separate from and independent of any related, associated, or affiliated trade association or membership
organization. In accordance with the statute, the proposed regulations allowed the Secretary to waive this requirement
under certain conditions.

3. The proposed regulations added two new steps to the process by which accrediting agencies are recognized by the
Secretary. First, the Secretary proposed to give an agency seeking recognition the opportunity to respond in writing
to the designated Department official's analysis of its application for recognition before the application was
reviewed by the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity. Second, after the Advisory
Committee's review of the agency's application and recommendation to the Secretary, the Secretary proposed to give
both the agency and the designated Department official an opportunity to contest the Advisory Committee's recommendation.

4. In accordance with section 496(n) of the HEA, the proposed regulations permitted the Department, at the Secretary's
discretion, to conduct unannounced site visits to an accrediting agency or its member institutions or programs as
part of the Department's analysis of the agency's application for recognition or its compliance with the requirements
for recognition. 
5. In accordance with section 496(l) of the HEA, the proposed regulations allowed the Secretary to limit, suspend,
or terminate an agency's recognition if the Secretary determined that the agency failed to meet the requirements
for recognition. 
6. The proposed regulations eliminated the provision contained in previous regulations that, in order to demonstrate

experience in accreditation, an agency had to demonstrate that its policies, evaluation methods, and decisions
were accepted throughout the United States by recognized accrediting agencies. 
7. As required by section 496(c)(1) of the HEA, the proposed regulations required an accrediting agency whose accreditation
enables the institutions it accredits to participate in programs authorized under the HEA to conduct, in addition
to its regular announced on-site review of an institution, at least one unannounced on-site review of each institution
that provides prebaccalaureate vocational education or training. 
8. The proposed regulations required accrediting agencies to assess any new or substantively changed program before
including it in the agency's previous grant of accreditation. 
9. As required by section 496(a)(5) of the HEA, the proposed regulations required accrediting agencies to have standards
that assess curricula; faculty; facilities, equipment and supplies; fiscal and administrative capacity as appropriate
to the specified scale of operation; student support services; recruiting and admissions practices, academic calendars,
catalogs, publications, grading and advertising; program length and tuition and fees in relation to the subject
matters taught and the objectives of the degrees or credentials offered; measures of program length in clock hours
or credit hours; success with respect to student achievement in relation to the institution's mission; default rates
in student loan programs 
under Title IV of the HEA; record of student complaints received by, or available to, the accrediting agency; and the
institution's compliance with its program responsibilities under Title IV of the HEA. 
10. As required by section 484B of the HEA, the proposed regulations required accrediting agencies to have a standard
that assesses an institution's practice of making refunds to students. 
11. The proposed regulations required an accrediting agency to take adverse action against an institution or program
that failed to bring itself into compliance with agency standards within a time frame established by the agency. The
proposed regulations permitted this time frame to exceed 18 months only for cause. 
12. As required by section 496(c) of the HEA, the proposed regulations required accrediting agencies whose accreditation
enables institutions to participate in Title IV, HEA programs to take special action whenever institutions establish
new branch campuses. Specifically, agencies must approve a business plan for the branch before its opening and conduct
an on-site review within six months. 
13. As required by section 496(c) of the HEA, the proposed regulations required accrediting agencies to conduct an
on-site review within six months at any institution that undergoes a change in ownership that results in a change in
control. 
14. As required by section 496(c) of the HEA, the proposed regulations required that any institution that enters into
a 
teach-out agreement with another institution must agree to submit to its accrediting agency for approval a teach-out
agreement that is consistent with applicable standards and regulations. 


Changes Resulting From Public Comment 


As a result of the comments received concerning the NPRM, and as discussed in detail in the appendix, the Secretary
has made the following significant changes in the final regulations. 
1. The term ``prebaccalaureate vocational education'' has been deleted from these final regulations. The term ``vocational
education'' has been redefined to be ``an instructional program, below the bachelor's level, designed to prepare
individuals with the skills and training required for employment in a specific trade, occupation, or profession
related to the instructional program.'' This definition is consistent with that used for the term ``vocational program''
in the final regulations governing the State Postsecondary Review Program. This definition was chosen because it
is basically the same as the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) glossary definition of an ``occupationally
specific program,'' and institutions already use this term in reporting enrollment data for various types of vocational
education. The advantage in using this definition is that the IPEDS inventory of occupationally specific programs
provides a list of instructional programs which, if offered by an institution, subject the institution to an unannounced
inspection by its accrediting agency.

2. A new section,  602.5_Notice to accrediting agencies of Federal actions, has been added that provides for
the Secretary to notify an accrediting agency if the Secretary takes 
an action against an institution or program accredited by the agency, if the Secretary learns of an action taken by
another Federal agency against the institution or program, or if the institution is referred for review under the
State Postsecondary Review Program. 

3. Time frames have been added for the designated Department official to provide an accrediting agency with the staff
analysis of its application for recognition and for the agency to respond to that analysis, if it so desires. 

4. The provision that an accrediting agency may request that the Secretary reconsider a decision to deny recognition
or to limit, suspend, or terminate the agency's recognition during the recognition period has been deleted. 


5. The requirement that institutional accrediting agencies must conduct unannounced site visits to institutions
that offer prebaccalaureate vocational education has been replaced with a requirement that those agencies must
conduct unannounced inspections at each institution that offers vocational education for the purpose of determining
whether, at a minimum, the institution has the personnel, facilities, and resources it claimed to have either during
its most recent on-site review by the accrediting agency or in subsequent reports to the agency. Accrediting agencies
are free to determine the procedures for conducting the unannounced inspections. An unannounced inspection does
not have to be as comprehensive as an agency's full accreditation or preaccreditation review of an institution or
program unless the agency wishes it to be. 

6. The substantive change requirement has been revised to clarify the types of changes that require prior approval
by an accrediting agency before they can be included in the institution's accreditation. The substantive change
requirement applies only to institutional accrediting agencies. 

7. The specific language included in the NPRM for each of the 12 required accreditation standards has been deleted.
The section now simply repeats the statutory language for each required standard. 

8. The requirement that accrediting agencies must have a standard that assesses an institution's practice of making
refunds to students has been eliminated. 

9. The time limit for institutions or programs to come into compliance with agency standards has been changed. For
programs of less than one year in length, the time limit is now 12 months. For programs that are at least one year in length
but less than two years, the time limit is 18 months. For programs that are at least two years in length, the time limit
is 24 months. 

10. A requirement has been added that accrediting agencies must notify the Secretary at the same time they notify an
institution or program of a final adverse accrediting action. 




Analysis of Comments and Changes 



In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, more than 1800 parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations.
An analysis of the comments and of the changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM is published as an appendix
to these final regulations. Included in this analysis are comments received during several public hearings and other
meetings held by the Department throughout the United States for purposes of obtaining comment on the proposed regulations.




Executive Order 12866 



These final regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order,
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 

The potential costs associated with the final regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those
determined by the Secretary to be necessary for effective and efficient administration. 

In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these regulations, the Secretary
has determined that the benefits of the regulations justify the costs. 



Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 



Sections 602.4, 602.10, and 602.27 of these regulations contain information collection requirements. In addition,
 602.21(b)(7) contains specific record retention requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1980, the Department of Education has submitted a copy of these sections to the Office of Management and Budget for
its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h))

The annual reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to be 47 hours per respondent, including
the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,
and completing and reviewing the collection of information. This annual reporting estimate takes into account the
fact that the average recognition period granted to accrediting agencies is five years. The total annual reporting
burden for the estimated 96 respondents is 4,512 hours. 

Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements should direct
them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington,
DC 20503; Attention: Daniel J. Chenok. Comments must be received by May 31, 1994. 



Assessment of Educational Impact 



In the NPRM, the Secretary requested comments on whether the regulations in this document would require transmission
of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States. Based
on the response to the proposed regulations and on the Department's own review, the Secretary has determined that
these regulations do not require the transmission of information concerning accrediting agencies that is being
gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States. Where specific provisions of these
regulations require the transmission of information concerning institutions or programs that is similar to that
being collected by the Department for other purposes, such as for the State Postsecondary Review Program or the Department's
review of institutions seeking to become certified to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, these regulations
have been modified to minimize the burden on institutions. A detailed discussion of the changes to the regulations
is provided in the appendix to these regulations.

 602.26 

Required accreditation standards. 



(a)(1) To be listed by the Secretary as a nationally recognized accrediting agency, an accrediting agency must demonstrate
to the Secretary that its accreditation or preaccreditation standards, or both, are sufficiently rigorous to ensure
that the agency is a reliable authority as to the quality of the education or training provided by the institutions
or programs it accredits. 

(2) For a programmatic accrediting agency that does not serve as an institutional accrediting agency for any of the
programs it accredits, the standards must address the areas contained in paragraph (b) of this section in terms of
the type and level of the program rather than in terms of the institution. 

(3) If none of the institutions an agency accredits participates in any Title IV, HEA program, or if the agency only
accredits programs within institutions accredited by an institutional accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary,
the accrediting agency is not required to have the standards described in paragraphs (b)(7), (b)(8), (b)(10), and
(b)(12) of this section. 

(b) In order to assure that an accrediting agency is a reliable authority as to the quality of the education or training
provided by an institution or program it accredits, the agency must have standards that effectively address the quality
of an institution or program in the following areas: 

(1) Curricula. 
(2) Faculty. 
(3) Facilities, equipment, and supplies. 

(4) Fiscal and administrative capacity as appropriate to the specified scale of operations. 

(5) Student support services. 

(6) Recruiting and admissions practices, academic calendars, catalogs, publications, grading, and advertising.


(7) Program length and tuition and fees in relation to the subject matters taught and the objectives of the degrees
or credentials offered. 

(8) Measures of program length in clock hours or credit hours. 

(9) Success with respect to student achievement in relation to mission, including, as appropriate, consideration
of course completion, State licensing examination, and job placement rates. 

(10) Default rates in the student loan programs under Title IV of the Act, based on the most recent data provided by the
Secretary. 

(11) Record of student complaints received by, or available to, the agency. 

(12) Compliance with the institution's program responsibilities under Title IV of the Act, including any results
of financial or compliance audits, program reviews, and such other information as the Secretary may provide to the
agency. 

(c)(1) An accrediting agency shall take appropriate action if its review of an institution or program under any standard
indicates that the institution or program is not in compliance with that standard. 

(2) If the agency believes that the institution or program is not in compliance with the standards, the agency shall_

(i) Take prompt adverse action against the institution or program; or

(ii) Require the institution or program to take appropriate action to bring itself into compliance with the agency's
standards within a time frame specified by the agency.

(3) The accrediting agency has sole discretion to determine the course of action it chooses under paragraph (c)(2)
of this section and, if it selects the option specified in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the time frame for
the institution or program to bring itself into compliance with agency standards. However, except as indicated in
paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the specified period may not exceed_

(i) Twelve months, if the program is less than one year in length;

(ii) Eighteen months, if the program is at least one year, but less than two years, in length; or

(iii) Two years, if the program is at least two years in length.

(4) If the institution or program does not bring itself into compliance within the specified period, the agency must
take adverse action unless the agency extends the period for achieving compliance for good cause.

(d) An accrediting agency shall have a reasonable basis for determining that the information it relies on for making
the assessments described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section is accurate.

(e) An accrediting agency that has established and applies the standards in paragraph (b) of this section may establish
any additional accreditation standards as it deems appropriate.

Appendix 


Analysis of Comments and Changes 



(

Note: 

This appendix will not be codified in the Code of Federal Regulations.) 


 


An analysis of the comments and the changes to the regulations follows. General comments that refer to broad issues
rather than a specific section or sections of the proposed regulations are discussed first, followed by a discussion
of other issues in the order in which they appeared in the NPRM. 

It should be noted that not all comments are discussed in this appendix. There are several reasons for this. First,
many of the concerns expressed by commenters were directed to the statute, not the proposed regulations. In some instances,
those comments are mentioned in the discussion that follows because of the importance of the issues that were raised.
In most instances, however, they are not mentioned because the Secretary is not legally authorized to make the changes
suggested by commenters. Second, many commenters made excellent suggestions for editorial and technical changes,
as well as other minor changes, that, in the Secretary's opinion, strengthened the regulations; the Secretary has
merely incorporated these suggestions without comment. For example, in  602.11(b)(1)(ii) the Secretary
received a comment that it was better to include third-party information received by the Secretary, in addition to
that solicited by the Secretary. Third, some comments appeared to be based on misunderstandings of what was actually
in the NPRM. For example, a few commenters expressed concern about the absence of a particular provision that was,
in fact, included in the NPRM. Fourth, several comments appeared to be directed toward specific practices of currently
recognized accrediting agencies that commenters believed violated either the proposed regulations or what the
commenters believed to be established accrediting practices. In general, these comments are not discussed here,
but Department staff will investigate these complaints as part of the Department's ongoing monitoring of agencies.




General Comments 



The Secretary received numerous comments about the overall impact of the proposed regulations. In general, commenters
opposed to the proposed regulations believed that the NPRM did not achieve the coordinated balance of responsibilities
among the triad members that it sought to achieve, and that it provided for extensive and duplicative data collection
and reporting requirements that created a costly and unnecessary burden on the entire higher education community.
Further, they believed that the regulations did not regulate ``narrowly to the law,'' as they purported to do. In general,
these commenters suggested that the Secretary should review each requirement in the proposed regulations to determine
if it was required by the statute and should further ensure that all requirements that meet this test and are included
in the final regulations are implemented in the most reasonable and cost effective manner. This, they believed, would
ensure the Department's compliance with Executive Order 12866.

<TEXT>
 

The more specific concerns of commenters opposed to the proposed regulations may be summarized as follows: 

(1) The proposed regulations are overly prescriptive and excessive in detail and either exceed the statutory authority
of the Secretary or significantly expand the statute beyond Congressional intent. 

(2) The proposed regulations will force institutions to engage in excessive and duplicative information gathering
and reporting, at considerable cost, with no net increase in the quantity or quality of information available to the
public, and will result in the diversion of institutions' already scarce resources away from their primary mission
of providing a quality education. 

(3) The proposed regulations compromise the integrity of accreditation as a voluntary system of peer review and institutional
improvement; they dilute the focus and purpose of accreditation by requiring accrediting agencies to assume responsibilities
that are more appropriate to the State or Federal government. 

(4) The proposed regulations will create undue, duplicative, and costly burdens on accrediting agencies for which
they will receive no reimbursement from the Federal government. 

(5) The proposed regulations give the Secretary approval authority over accrediting agencies' standards, which
commenters believe is expressly forbidden by the statute. 

(6) The proposed regulations threaten the diversity of American higher education and fail to focus oversight properly
on vocational institutions. 

In addition to receiving comments in opposition to the proposed regulations, the Secretary received many comments
supportive of the NPRM. Some commenters, for example, believed the accreditation process needed a major overhaul,
that accrediting agencies were far too secretive in their actions, and there was genuine need for substantially increased
accountability of accrediting agencies to students and the general public. 

Finally, the Secretary received suggestions from several commenters that the Department should strongly encourage
all triad members to work together and adopt the same or similar language for the various standards, should collect
the necessary data through a common source such as readily available public information or IPEDS, and should use common
methodologies for various calculations such as completion or withdrawal rates. 



Discussion: 

As suggested by several commenters, the Secretary has carefully reviewed each requirement in the proposed regulations
in light of statutory intent. The Secretary has also carefully considered both the burden of the proposed regulations
on institutions and accrediting agencies, in terms of cost, duplication of effort, and the added recordkeeping and
reporting requirements. Similarly, the Secretary has considered the benefits of the proposed regulations, not
just to institutions and accrediting agencies but to students and the general public as well. A particular concern
of the Secretary has been how to ensure that the regulations hold the three members of the triad accountable for the
manner in which they fulfill their responsibilities under the HEA yet still provide each member of the triad the flexibility
to determine the appropriate means to carry out those responsibilities. 

In general, the Secretary has responded to the concerns of commenters by eliminating much of what was perceived as
excessive detail in the NPRM, thus providing accrediting agencies more flexibility to meet a particular requirement
in the manner that best suits their needs and the needs and individual circumstances of the institutions or programs
they accredit. At the same time, however, the Secretary has increased the accountability of agencies, as, for example,
by strengthening the requirements that accrediting agencies must have effective standards and must monitor institutions
or programs carefully for continued compliance with those standards. The final regulations make it quite clear that
the Secretary regards accrediting agencies as having primary responsibility for educational quality, but they
also make it clear that the Secretary holds accrediting agencies accountable for the quality of the institutions
or programs they accredit. 

The Secretary has also responded to the concerns of commenters by eliminating a number of the specific reporting and
recordkeeping requirements the proposed regulations would have imposed on both accrediting agencies and institutions
and by allowing agencies and institutions to work together to determine realistic requirements for reporting and
recordkeeping. At the same time, the Secretary holds agencies accountable for the effectiveness of those requirements.

The Secretary believes this overall approach retains the principal strength of the current accrediting system_a
system of peer review that focuses on the unique mission of each institution or program and that fosters educational
improvement consistent with that mission_but effectively addresses the concerns with the current system that Congress
raised when it created the Program Integrity Triad to strengthen institutional oversight. 

To illustrate the effect of this overall strategy, the Secretary offers as an example the changes to  602.26,
Required accreditation standards. This section now contains only the statutory language for the 12 required standards.
In this ``minimalist'' approach, the regulations achieve the objectives of Executive Order 12866. By no longer requiring
institutions to provide annual audits to accrediting agencies, the regulations reduce the paperwork burden on both
accrediting agencies and institutions at the same time they remove a major source of costly duplication of effort
by accrediting agencies and the Department. By allowing agencies flexibility in establishing standards for the
12 required areas, the regulations minimize any added costs to institutions necessitated by the new requirements.
Accrediting agencies are no longer required to establish and maintain costly and duplicative systems for collecting
and maintaining specific information about the institutions or programs they accredit. Now agencies may tailor
their systems to the mission, needs, and circumstances of those institutions or programs and the students they serve.
The overall effect of the changes to this one section of the regulations is to reduce cost, reduce burden, reduce paperwork,
reduce duplication of effort, and free accrediting agencies and institutions to focus on the quality of education
in all its manifestations. 

The Secretary acknowledges that there is a potential risk with this strategy, however. By giving accrediting agencies
maximum flexibility in these regulations, by giving SPREs corresponding flexibility in the regulations for the
State Postsecondary Review Program, and by retaining authority for the Secretary to set specific requirements implementing
the certification process, the danger exists that institutions will be burdened with reporting requirements that
are similar, but not identical, thus increasing not only the reporting requirement but the recordkeeping requirement
and cost as well. For this reason, the Secretary strongly urges a coordinated approach to any reporting requirement
that may be imposed on institutions by the regulations implementing the Program Integrity Triad. Specifically with
respect to accrediting agencies, the Secretary urges agencies to impose reporting requirements on the institutions
or programs they accredit only after they carefully examine any publicly available information related to those
requirements, any similar reporting requirements imposed on institutions by either the Department or the State
Postsecondary Review Entities under the State Postsecondary Review Program, and any methodologies currently used,
or mandated for use, by institutions in calculating the required information. The Secretary hopes that by bringing
this potential risk of increased burden on institutions to the attention of the entire higher education community_without
specifically addressing it in regulation_the community can work together to prevent undue burden at the same time
it ensures proper accountability. The Secretary expects to take a leadership role in implementing a coordinated
strategy to manage the triad, with the goal of maximizing effectiveness while minimizing burden, duplication, and
inconsistencies among accrediting agencies, SPREs, and the Department. 

As several commenters raised the issue of Secretarial approval authority over an accrediting agency's standards,
the Secretary believes it is necessary to respond. It is the Secretary's belief that section 496(a) of the HEA statute
gives the Secretary explicit approval authority over an agency's standards in the context of the Secretary's overall
responsibility for determining whether the agency is a reliable authority as to the quality of education or training
offered by the institutions and programs it accredits. 

Finally, with regard to the issue of whether the regulations properly focus on vocational institutions, the Secretary
wishes to note that Congress found abuses in all sectors of higher education, not just the vocational sector. For this
reason, the regulations apply to all institutions, with the exception of the requirement of unannounced inspections
to institutions that provide vocational education. 



Changes: 

The specific changes to the regulations are discussed below.

Subpart A_General Provisions 


Section 602.1 Purpose. 




Comments:

 The Secretary received several comments about the requirement that Secretarial recognition is now limited to those
accrediting agencies that accredit institutions of higher education or higher education programs for the purpose
of enabling those institutions or programs to establish eligibility to participate in programs administered either
by the Secretary or by other Federal agencies. In general, commenters expressed concern that the requirement would
cause many of the currently recognized specialized or programmatic accrediting agencies to lose recognition. Commenters
believed that failure to include these agencies on the list of nationally recognized accrediting agencies was counter
to the purpose of the list, which they believed was to inform the public of those accrediting agencies that the Secretary
determined to be reliable authorities as to the quality of education or training provided by the institutions or programs
they accredit. Commenters also believed that, in general, institutional accrediting agencies did not examine in
depth the individual programs offered by an institution and that the only assurance of the quality of these programs
was provided by the programmatic agencies that accredited them. It was suggested by some commenters that the Federal
purpose would be better served if the specialized or programmatic accrediting agencies and the institutional accrediting
agencies worked together to assess the quality of education. 
One commenter urged a broad interpretation of the phrase ``for other Federal purposes'' in section 496(a) of HEA to
include a whole range of benefits that accrue to the Federal Government by virtue of the Secretary's recognition of
an accrediting agency, including the use of an individual's graduation from a program accredited by a nationally
recognized accrediting agency for entry-level qualifications for Federal employment. 
Some commenters expressed concern that the language in  602.1(b)(1) and (2) was misleading because the purpose
of accreditation was not to enable institutions or programs to establish eligibility to participate in Federal programs.
A number of these commenters provided specific suggestions for amending the language to address this concern. 
Finally, the Secretary received a suggestion to reorganize this paragraph so that it, rather than  602.3, provided
a summary of the recognition requirements an accrediting agency must meet in order to be recognized by the Secretary.



Discussion:

 The Secretary acknowledges that the many fine programmatic accrediting agencies currently on the list of nationally
recognized accrediting agencies provide an excellent measure of quality assurance in their respective fields of
specialization. However, section 496(m) of the HEA makes it clear that the Secretary may recognize only those agencies
that accredit institutions of higher education or higher education programs for the purpose of enabling those institutions
or programs to establish eligibility to participate in programs administered either by the Secretary or by other
Federal agencies.
The Secretary does not believe that the broader interpretation of the phrase ``for other Federal purposes'' in section
496(a) suggested by the one commenter is legally supportable because section 496(m) clearly defines the purpose
an agency's accreditation must serve it if is to be recognized by the Secretary, namely the agency's accreditation
must enable the institutions or programs it accredits to establish eligibility to participate in Federal programs.

The Secretary understands that the purpose of accreditation is not to enable institutions or programs to establish
eligibility to participate in Federal programs but rather to publicly recognize those institutions or programs
that meet an accrediting agency's standards for educational quality. The Secretary appreciates the various suggestions
for clarifying this in the regulations and has changed these regulations accordingly. 
Finally, the Secretary appreciates the suggestion for reorganizing this paragraph to summarize the recognition
requirements and believes it is helpful. 


Change:

 The language in  602.1(b) has been modified to clarify that an agency's accreditation of an institution or program
must be a required element in enabling the institution or program to establish eligibility to participate in Federal
programs. The section has been reorganized to clarify the recognition requirements accrediting agencies must meet
if they wish to be recognized by the Secretary. 


Section 602.2 Definitions 


Accreditation

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940429-0-00065 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940429-0-00010 </PARENT>

Comments:

 Several commenters noted that the word ``qualifications'' was either misleading or redundant and that the word ``policies''
or ``procedural requirements'' would be more appropriate. 


Discussion:

 The word ``qualifications'' in the definition, which is the same definition as that used in previous regulations,
does not refer to either policies or procedural requirements. Rather, it refers in general to the various requirements
for accreditation that an accrediting agency might have. For example, an institution located in New York might meet
all of the accreditation standards of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC), but it is ineligible
for accreditation by NEASC because it is not located in New England. 


Change:

 The term ``qualifications'' has been replaced by the term ``requirements.'' 


Adverse Accrediting Action 




Comments:

 One commenter felt the definition could be strengthened to ensure that agencies had a variety of useful sanctions,
the application of which were not automatically appealable under  602.28(a)(5). Another felt that the term
should be uniformly defined by all accrediting agencies to reduce the possibility of misunderstanding arising from
the use of different definitions. 


Discussion:

 For purposes of these regulations, the Secretary has defined the term ``adverse accrediting action'' to include,
as a minimum, those actions initiated by an accrediting agency that result in an institution or program losing its
accreditation. However, the Secretary believes accrediting agencies should be free both to define other actions
they consider to be adverse accrediting actions and to establish other sanctions that are not automatically appealable
by the institution or program. 


Change:

 None. 


Branch Campus




Comments:

 In general, commenters expressed concern that the definition of ``branch campus'' was inconsistent with its use
in  602.27 and that there was no statutory basis for including ``additional locations'' in the requirement
for special actions by accrediting agencies when an institution opened a branch campus. 


Discussion:

 Under 498(j) of the HEA, the Secretary is charged with defining the term ``branch campus'' for purposes of Title IV
of the HEA. Generally, when the Secretary defines a term, the term is defined in the same manner for any and every Title
IV, HEA purpose. Accordingly, the Secretary adopted the definition of the term ``branch campus'' that was proposed
in the Institutional Eligibility regulations, 34 CFR Part 600, in the proposed accreditation regulations. However,
the Secretary realized that particular definition was too narrow to carry out the purposes of sections 496(c) (2)
and (3) of the HEA, under which an institution that establishes a branch campus must file a business plan with its accrediting
agency and the agency must conduct a site visit at the branch campus within six months of its establishment. Therefore,
in  602.27 of the NPRM, the Secretary imposed the requirements relating to branch campus on ``additional locations''
as well. 
For program and administrative reasons, the Secretary has determined to keep the narrow definition of the term ``branch
campus'' in the Institutional Eligibility regulations. However, the Secretary has adopted a different definition
of ``branch campus'' for these regulations because that different definition is more in keeping with the statutory
requirements of section 496(c). The Secretary believes this different definition is preferable because it provides
assurances to students who enroll at any location of an institution that offers a substantial portion of an educational
program that the location has the resources to operate, and is operating, in compliance with accrediting agency standards.



Change:

 The definition has been revised to include locations that meet the definition of this term in 34 CFR 600.2, which is
basically the same definition as in the NPRM, and any other locations at which an institution offers at least 50 percent
of an educational program. Section 602.27 has been revised to eliminate any reference to ``additional location.''



Prebaccalaureate Vocational Education 




Comments:

 The Secretary received numerous comments on the definition of this term and the corresponding term, ``vocational
education.'' Many commenters believed there was no statutory basis for the distinctions in the NPRM and that the use
of the term improperly targeted a particular segment of higher education for burdensome and unwarranted sanctions.
Among commenters who expressed an opinion on the various definitions under consideration, responses were divided.
Some preferred a definition that excluded any type of vocational education that led to a degree, while others felt
the definition should include all prebaccalaureate vocational education regardless of the credential awarded.



Discussion:

 See discussion below under ``vocational education.'' 


Change:

 The term ``prebaccalaureate vocational education'' has been deleted from the regulations. 


Representative of the Public 




Comments:

 The Secretary received two suggestions for changing this definition. One was to allow members of the governing board
of affiliated nonprofit institutions to represent the public. The other was to exclude close relatives of students
or employees at affiliated institutions. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that members of the governing board of affiliated non-profit institutions can make valuable
contributions to an accrediting agency but should not do so in the capacity of a representative of the public. The Secretary
also believes the exclusion of spouses, parents, children, and siblings of employees of affiliated institutions
is appropriate and that the exclusion ought to extend to close relatives of other individuals listed in the definition.
On the other hand, the Secretary believes students, who are the consumers in this instance, and their families can
serve a useful role as representatives of the public. 


Change:

 The definition has been revised to exclude close relatives of individuals listed in the definition from serving as
representatives of the public.

Teach-out Agreement 




Comments: 

The Secretary received a suggestion to include in the definition specific criteria for what constitutes the ``equitable
treatment of students.'' The Secretary also received a suggestion to delete the definition because the Department's
previous teach-out regulations, issued January 1993, were rescinded. 


Discussion: 

The requirement that accrediting agencies have standards for teach-out agreements is specified in section 496(c)(4)
of the HEA and is independent of any Department regulation that may or may not be in effect regarding teach-out agreements.
The Secretary believes the inclusion of provisions for what constitutes equitable treatment of students under a
teach-out agreement is a useful addition to the regulations but believes these provisions should be included in  602.27(b)(6),
where the requirement for teach-out agreements is described, rather than in the definition section. 


Change: 

None. However, the specific criteria for what constitutes equitable treatment of students have been added to  602.27(b)(6).



Vocational Education 




Comments: 

The Secretary received numerous comments on the definition of this term and the corresponding term, ``prebaccalaureate
vocational education.'' Many commenters preferred a broad definition that treated all institutions offering any
type of vocational education the same way. Others preferred a definition that excluded programs leading to any type
of degree. Some commenters suggested a definition similar to that in the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology
Education Act. Others suggested different approaches to the issue, including the use of the term ``nonacademic education
program,'' which they defined to be the opposite of an academic education program, as they believed that term was defined
in the Department's clock hour/credit hour regulations. Still others preferred a definition that restricted the
term to institutions whose predominant offerings were vocational, with ``predominant'' defined to mean more than
75 percent of an institution's offerings. Almost all commenters preferred that the same definition be used in both
the accreditation and SPRE regulations. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary has carefully considered all comments received on this issue, as well as those on the broader issue of
the burden these regulations would impose on institutions and accrediting agencies. While the Secretary agrees
that it would be best if these regulations and those for the State Postsecondary Review Program used both the same term
and the same definition of that term, the Secretary is aware that the statute uses the term ``vocational education''
for accreditation and ``vocational program'' for the State Postsecondary Review Program. Consequently, the Secretary
believes the appropriate term for the accreditation regulations is ``vocational education'' and for the SPRE regulations
``vocational program.'' However, despite the difference in the specific term used, the Secretary believes that
the definition of both terms should be the same. 
The Secretary has examined all of the proposed definitions for the accreditation and SPRE regulations and believes
that the IPEDS glossary definition of an ``occupationally specific program'' most closely meets the needs of both
regulations. The Secretary has modified this definition slightly, however, to meet the specific needs of accreditation
and the State Postsecondary Review Program. Thus, in the accreditation regulations, the term ``vocational education''
is defined to be an instructional program, below the bachelor's level, designed to prepare individuals with the skills
and training required in a specific trade, occupation, or profession related to the instructional program. The identical
definition is used in the SPRE regulations for a ``vocational program.'' While the definition differs slightly from
the exact wording in the IPEDS definition, the Secretary wishes to make clear that the list of occupationally specific
programs provided by IPEDS defines the instructional programs that, if offered by an institution, cause the institution
to be subject to unannounced inspections by the institution's accrediting agency, as specified in  602.24.



Change: 

The term ``vocational education'' has been redefined as indicated above under the Discussion section. 


Section 602.3 Organization and Membership 





Comments: 

A few commenters expressed concern about the requirement in section 496(a) of the HEA that accrediting agencies whose
accreditation enables the institutions they accredit to participate in programs authorized under the HEA must be
administratively and financially separate from and independent of any related, associated, or affiliated trade
association or membership organization. These commenters believed that this requirement would force many agencies
to undergo a major restructuring simply to come into technical compliance with this provision despite the fact that
there was no evidence their present structure in any way compromised the integrity of their accrediting decisions.

The Secretary also received some comments about the provisions for a waiver of the ``separate and independent'' requirements.
Most of these were directed to specific circumstances that exist, or might exist, in the case of a particular accrediting
agency seeking a waiver. The Secretary also received a suggestion that accrediting agencies should have to seek the
waiver each time they applied for recognition, or renewal of recognition, by the Secretary. 


Discussion: 

The general concern about the new organization and membership requirements is directed to the law, not the regulations.
As the language in  602.3 merely restates the requirements of the law, it cannot be changed.

With regard to the waiver of the ``separate and independent'' requirements, the Secretary believes the specific
circumstances described by various commenters about a particular accrediting agency should be addressed in the
context of that agency's application for the waiver, not through regulation. The Secretary accepts the suggestion
to stipulate in regulation that an agency must seek a waiver each time it applies for recognition or renewal of recognition.



Change: 

A requirement has been added that accrediting agencies must seek a waiver of the ``separate and independent'' requirement
each time they apply for recognition or renewal of recognition. 


Section 602.4 Submission of Information to the Secretary by Recognized Accrediting Agencies 




Comments: 

The Secretary received numerous comments that the proposed requirement in  602.4(e)_that an accrediting
agency had to submit to the Secretary, upon request, information to assist the Secretary in resolving problems with
any institution or program accredited by the agency_exceeded the statute and failed to distinguish adequately between
public and private information maintained by accrediting agencies. Commenters generally believed that this requirement
put accrediting agencies in the position of being required to do the Secretary's work and threatened to compromise
the inherent value of the peer review system on which accreditation is based. Some of these commenters believed that
 602.4(e) should be deleted in its entirety, while others suggested that the information to be provided by accrediting
agencies should be restricted either to the accreditation status of an institution or program or to the minimum information
needed to fulfill the intent of the law. 
Not all commenters were opposed to  602.4(e), however. Some supported it as written. Some stated their opinion
that the less confidential information accrediting agencies kept the better. Several of these commenters suggested
that a protocol be developed for the sharing of information and that there should be a single office within the Department
that served as contact with accrediting agencies for the purpose of information sharing. One commenter suggested
that accrediting agencies be given time to negotiate a new understanding of the information sharing concept with
institutions because, as important as the concept was, it was generally in conflict with most agencies' policies
on confidentiality. One commenter, while expressing general support for information sharing, cautioned against
requiring information to be shared before it was confirmed in fact, the institution had received due process, and
any applicable appeals were complete. Many commenters suggested that a possible solution that would allow the Secretary
access to the information the Secretary needed without placing agencies in the position of doing the Secretary's
work was the use of an administrative subpoena by the Department. 
Of general concern to all commenters on the issue of information sharing was the kind of information shared by an accrediting
agency about an accredited institution or program that would be obtainable by anyone under the Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA). 
With regard to the comment in the NPRM that the Secretary was considering adding to this section a requirement that
an accrediting agency must refer to the Department's Office of Inspector General any fraudulent activities it discovers
on the part of an institution or program it accredits, provided that institution or program participates in Title
IV, HEA programs, the Secretary received strong support for the general concept but some concern about agencies'
liabilities should the institution or program be subsequently found not to have engaged in fraud. Commenters also
urged the Secretary to substitute for the term ``fraud,'' which has a very precise legal definition, something more
general like ``substantial wrongdoing'' or ``serious abuse.'' 
Finally, several commenters noted that there was no provision in the proposed regulations that paralleled the proposed
requirement in 34 CFR part 667 that the Secretary notify the State postsecondary review entity of Federal actions
against an institution. Commenters also suggested that the State postsecondary review entity should be required
to notify an accrediting agency of the outcome of any review of an institution accredited by the agency that it makes
under the State Postsecondary Review Program. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary is aware that most accrediting agencies currently have confidentiality policies that prevent them
from releasing information about an accredited institution or program to a third party without the prior approval
of the institution. The Secretary is also aware that confidentiality is an important aspect of the peer review system
on which accreditation is based. 
However, the Secretary notes that under section 487(a)(15) of the HEA, by entering into a Title IV, HEA program participation
agreement, an institution acknowledges the authority of the Secretary, accrediting agencies, State postsecondary
review entities, and others to share with each other information pertaining to the institution's eligibility to
participate in Title IV, HEA programs and any information on fraud or abuse by the institution. Therefore, institutions
can have no genuine expectation that information they provide to their accrediting agencies pertaining to their
Title IV, HEA program responsibilities, fraud, or abuse will be kept confidential from the Secretary or these other
entities. Accordingly, the Secretary has revised  602.4(e) to reflect that statutory provision. Thus, the
information the Secretary may request from an accrediting agency under  602.4(e) is limited to information
concerning an accredited or preaccredited institution's compliance with its Title IV, HEA program responsibilities,
including its eligibility to participate in Title IV, HEA programs. As a result, an agency does not have to provide
the Secretary with copies of an institution's self-study report, reports of on-site evaluations of the institution
by the accrediting agency, or other documents maintained by the agency about the institution for the purpose of determining
the institution's compliance with the agency's standards. However, the agency must provide any information contained
in those documents that is relevant to the institution's compliance with its Title IV, HEA program responsibilities.
The Secretary notes that, as discussed in connection with  602.10, an accrediting agency must provide any document
the Secretary requests relating to whether the agency is complying with the requirements of this part.

The Secretary appreciates the suggestion to develop a protocol for information sharing. As this suggestion relates
to the Secretary's management of a regulatory provision, however, it does not need to be addressed in regulation.
The Secretary intends to work with agencies to develop an appropriate protocol for information sharing, which will
address the concerns raised about both the types of information releasable under a FOIA request and a central point
of contact within the Department for the exchange of information. 
The Secretary acknowledges the difficulties in requiring accrediting agencies to report ``fraud'' or ``suspected
fraud.'' As the statutory provision for information sharing specifically refers to fraud and abuse, however, the
Secretary has added a provision to  602.4 that requires agencies to notify the Secretary if they have reason
to believe that an institution may be engaged in fraud or abuse. The Secretary has also added a provision requiring
agencies to notify the Secretary if they have reason to believe an institution or program is not meeting its Title IV,
HEA program responsibilities. 
The Secretary acknowledges the importance of sharing with accrediting agencies information about Federal actions
against accredited institutions but believes that information sharing goes beyond the cases identified by commenters
to include notification to agencies when an accredited institution is referred for review under the State Postsecondary
Review Program. The Secretary also acknowledges the importance of having the State postsecondary review entity
notify accrediting agencies of the results of its reviews but believes this requirement is more appropriately placed
in 34 CFR Part 667 rather than 34 CFR Part 602. The Secretary notes that an accrediting agency's responsibility for
notifying State postsecondary review entities about its decisions is discussed in  602.29 of these regulations.



Changes

: Section 602.4(e) has been revised to indicate that any agency must comply with the Secretary's request for information
that is related to the institution's or program's compliance with its Title IV, HEA program responsibilities, including
its eligibility to participate in Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary has removed the limitation on an agency's
duty to share information only in those situations where it does not conflict with accrediting agencies' policies
on confidentiality. A requirement has been added that an accrediting agency must notify the Secretary if the agency
has reason to believe an institution or program is not meeting its Title IV, HEA program responsibilities or is engaged
in fraud and abuse. A new section ( 602.5) has been added outlining the Secretary's responsibilities for notifying
accrediting agencies of Federal actions against accredited institutions or programs or referral of institutions
to States under the State Postsecondary Review Program. 


Subpart B_Recognition and Termination Procedures 


Section 602.10 Application for Recognition. 




Comments

: The Secretary received many comments that the statute only allows the Secretary access to an accrediting agency's
records, personnel, and facilities, on an announced or unannounced basis, during the application and review process,
not during the entire recognition period. Some commenters described the Secretary's access as so broad that it constituted
unwarranted search and seizure without probable cause. Some commenters were especially concerned about the possible
release under a FOIA request of an agency's confidential materials that Department personnel examined as part of
the Secretary's evaluation of an agency's application for recognition. With regard to the provision for unannounced
visits by the Secretary, the Secretary received suggestions both to limit and not limit the use of these visits. 
The Secretary received a number of comments that the application process and related recordkeeping requirements
were particularly burdensome on accrediting agencies and that the burden reported in the 

Federal Register

 grossly underestimated the burden imposed by the regulations. Other commenters, however, believed that the application
and recordkeeping requirements were not in any way burdensome and that the Secretary was requesting only the minimum
amount of information needed to determine whether an agency was a reliable authority as to the quality of education
or training provided by the institutions or programs it accredited. 
With regard to the suggestion in the NPRM that the Secretary was considering allowing agencies to provide a simple
statement of assurance that they complied with the requirements for recognition so as to reduce the burden on agencies
applying for recognition, there was mixed reaction. Some commenters welcomed the simplification as a reduction
in burden, but others thought it invited abuse and provided no protection of the public interest. Still others felt
that the first review of an agency under the new regulations should be extremely thorough, but thereafter the simple
assurance approach was reasonable.

<DOCNO> FR940429-0-00069 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940429-0-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Finally, the Secretary received a request to include in the regulations the provision contained in the statute that
the Secretary shall give priority for review to those agencies whose institutions participate most extensively
in Title IV, HEA programs and those agencies that are subject to the most complaints or legal actions. 


Discussion

: The Secretary believes that the statute requires the Secretary to ensure that recognized accrediting agencies
stay in compliance with the requirements for recognition throughout the recognition period. Consequently, the
Secretary believes the statute authorizes the Secretary to have access to an accrediting agency's records, personnel,
and facilities not only during the application and review process but throughout the recognition period as well.

Regarding concerns about possible release of confidential agency materials under a FOIA request, the Secretary
wishes to assure agencies that there are provisions under FOIA that protect most of the types of information the Secretary
expects to obtain from agencies for purposes of  602.10(b). For example, if the Secretary determined that an
accrediting agency's actions with respect to three institutions clearly demonstrated the agency's failure to comply
with the recognition requirements, the Secretary would not be required to release the names of the three institutions
under a FOIA request. The Secretary would, of course, identify the institutions to the accrediting agency so that
the agency would have a clear understanding of the basis on which the Secretary reached the determination that it failed
to meet the criteria for recognition. While the Secretary will protect confidential agency materials to the full
extent allowed under FOIA, the Secretary wishes to make it clear that this does not prevent the Secretary from using
those materials against an agency should the Secretary determine that the agency is in violation of the criteria for
recognition. 
Regarding unannounced visits by the Secretary, which are authorized by the statute, the Secretary believes the use
of such visits is a managerial decision and need not be regulated. 
With regard to the overall burden reported in the 

Federal Register

, the Secretary wishes to note that the estimate was based in part on information provided to the Secretary by various
accrediting agencies as to the time required to complete an application and to meet other requirements contained
in the NPRM. It was also based on the assumption that the Secretary would adopt the simple assurance approach described
in the NPRM. 
Finally, with regard to both the use of a simple assurance statement to simplify the application process and the inclusion
of a set of review priorities, the Secretary believes these relate to the management of the recognition process and
do not need to be addressed in regulation. The Secretary wishes to make it clear, however, that it is the Secretary's
intent to minimize the overall burden to agencies through a simplification of the entire application process. 


Change

: The section that detailed the conditions under which the Secretary uses unannounced visits to determine an agency's
compliance with the recognition requirements has been deleted. The phrase ``analysis of'' in  602.10(a)(2)
has been replaced with ``evidence of'' to conform to the simple assurance approach. 


Section 602.11 Preliminary Review by the Secretary




Comments

: Section 602.11(b)(2) of the proposed regulations provided that the Secretary's evaluation of an agency should
include a review of information directly related to the institutions or programs accredited by the agency, as this
information relates to the institution's or program's compliance with the agency's standards, the effectiveness
of those standards, or the agency's application of those standards. The Secretary received a number of comments that
supported this provision. In general, these commenters felt that it was important for the Secretary to monitor the
extent to which individual agencies continued to accredit institutions that engage in fraud or abuse, particularly
abuse of the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary received many more comments, however, that this provision was inappropriate
and also redundant, given the provisions contained in  602.11(b)(1)(i-iii). These commenters also believed
the provision gave the Secretary approval authority over an agency's accreditation standards, which, in their opinion,
was contrary to the statute. 
The Secretary also received some comments related to the sharing of information used by the designated Department
official to reach conclusions regarding an agency's compliance with the requirements for recognition. In general,
these commenters wanted the regulations to specify time frames for an agency's written response to the Department
staff analysis concerning its application for recognition, to require the designated Department official to share
with the agency all information used in reaching a decision about the agency's application, to require the Department
to forward to an agency written reports on any announced or unannounced site visits, file reviews, or other reviews
of the agency, and to allow the agency the opportunity for response to all these reports. 
Finally, a number of commenters suggested that the regulations should include a requirement that the Secretary must
publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 when an accrediting agency is being considered for recognition and must also notify the State postsecondary review
entities. 


Discussion

: The Secretary believes that the designated Department official's review of information directly related to institutions
or programs accredited by an agency is central to the issue of whether the agency is a reliable authority as to the quality
of the institutions of programs it accredits. Therefore, this provision must be retained. The Secretary notes that
any information provided by the agency in accordance with  602.4(e) of these regulations may also be reviewed
by the designated Department official during any evaluation of the agency for compliance with the requirements for
recognition.

<TEXT>
 

With regard to the suggestion for including various time frames in this section, the Secretary appreciates the concerns
that led commenters to request time frames and, consequently, agrees to include them in this section. The Secretary
does not believe that agencies should have the right to receive a written report after every monitoring activity conducted
by the designated Department official as these activities are conducted for the general purpose of gathering information
about an agency's compliance with the requirements for recognition and, in that sense, are ``predecisional.'' 
Finally, it is already a requirement, under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, that the Secretary must publish an
announcement of each Advisory Committee meeting, including those at which accrediting agencies are considered
for recognition, but the Secretary acknowledges the importance of making that practice clear in these regulations.
The Secretary also acknowledges the importance of notifying the State postsecondary review entities whenever an
agency is being considered for recognition. 


Changes: 

Time frames have been added for providing analyses and supporting documentation to an accrediting agency before
the Advisory Committee meets on that agency's application for recognition. A provision for notifying State postsecondary
review entities and other appropriate organizations of an agency's application for recognition has also been added.
Finally, a provision has been added requiring the Secretary to publish a notice of the Advisory Committee meeting
in the 

Federal Register

 and to invite interested parties to make presentations before the Advisory Committee. 


Section 602.13 Review and Decision by the Secretary 




Comments: 

Some commenters objected to the provision that the Secretary could decide to recognize an agency even if it did not
meet all of the requirements for recognition, provided the Secretary determined that the noncompliance did not impair
the agency's effectiveness. These commenters were particularly concerned that an accrediting agency that failed
to meet a particular requirement might be recognized even though the reasons it failed to meet that requirement were
within its control to correct. Other commenters, however, commended the Secretary's willingness to determine the
appropriateness of a waiver when an agency's noncompliance with one or more requirements for recognition did not
limit the effectiveness of the agency. To these commenters, the Secretary's flexibility was a demonstration that
the Secretary sought a working partnership with accrediting agencies that was based on performance and trust. 
With regard to an appeal of an Advisory Committee recommendation, some commenters felt that the 30-day time frame
was too short. Other commenters requested that, in addition to the designated Department official and the agency,
third parties be allowed to contest an Advisory Committee's recommendation concerning the recognition of an agency.

Finally, several commenters felt that the regulations should contain a time frame for the Secretary to make a decision
regarding an agency's application for recognition. 


Discussion: 

While the Secretary appreciates the concern of the commenters about granting recognition to an agency that does not
meet all of the requirements for recognition, the Secretary believes that some flexibility is needed so that the Secretary
may grant recognition to an agency that fails to meet all of the requirements, even if the circumstances are within
the agency's ability to control. 
The Secretary understands the concerns raised about the 30-day time frame for appealing an Advisory Committee recommendation.
However, the Secretary wishes to note that an agency already has two opportunities prior to the Advisory Committee's
recommendation during which it may state its case as to why a negative recommendation concerning its application
for recognition is unwarranted. First, the agency may respond in writing to a negative recommendation by the designated
Department official before that recommendation is forwarded to the Advisory Committee. Second, agency representatives
have an opportunity to appear in person before the Advisory Committee to argue against a negative recommendation.
Because of these two opportunities, the Secretary does not believe the 30-day time frame after the Advisory Committee
makes its formal recommendation is unrealistic. 
With regard to third parties appealing an Advisory Committee recommendation, the Secretary believes that the appropriate
place for third-party comment is before the Advisory Committee reaches its decision on a recommendation, not after.
With regard to a time frame for the Secretary's decision, the Secretary believes that this is appropriately a management
issue and does not need to be specified in regulation. 


Change: 

None. 


Section 602.14 Limitation, Suspension, or Termination of Recognition

Comments: 

The Secretary received a suggestion from several commenters that any agency subject to the limitation, suspension,
or termination of its recognition should be allowed to challenge the membership of the subcommittee that conducts
a hearing on its case if, in fact, a subcommittee, rather than the full Advisory Committee, hears the case. Commenters
believed a challenge should be allowed on the grounds of either conflict of interest or lack of expertise in either
the type of agency subject to the action or its scope of accrediting activity. The Secretary also received a suggestion
that the subcommittee should consist of five, rather than three, members and another suggestion that all negative
actions recommended by the subcommittee should be discussed and acted upon by the full Advisory Committee. One commenter
suggested that an agency, rather than the Secretary, should be allowed to select members of the subcommittee. 
Finally, the Secretary received several comments that the 30-day frame for an agency to respond to the designated
Department official's notice of intent to limit, suspend, or terminate the agency's recognition was too short. 


Discussion: 

Given the seriousness of the situation that would prompt the use of a subcommittee rather than the full Advisory Committee,
the Secretary accepts the suggestion to expand its size. However, the Secretary believes the same seriousness that
necessitates the use of a subcommittee demands prompt resolution by the subcommittee. Similarly, the Secretary
does not accept the suggestion that the agency should be allowed to choose members of the subcommittee. Regarding
an agency's right to challenge the composition of the subcommittee, it is the Secretary's intent to appoint to the
subcommittee individuals who have no known conflict of interest. However, the Secretary acknowledges that there
may be instances unknown to the Secretary in which a conflict of interest may exist with a subcommittee member. For
this reason, the Secretary believes a challenge to the membership of the subcommittee on grounds of conflict of interest
is warranted. The Secretary does not believe that a challenge on the basis of lack of expertise is justified because
the members of the Advisory Committee from which the membership of the subcommittee is chosen have general expertise
in the areas that come under the purview of the committee. 
With regard to the 30-day time frame for responding to a notice of intent to limit, suspend, or terminate recognition,
the Secretary believes that the seriousness of the situation that prompts such a notice demands equally prompt resolution
to protect the public interest. 


Changes: 

The size of the subcommittee has been increased from three to five members. Agencies are now allowed to challenge the
composition of the subcommittee on grounds of conflict of interest. 


Section 602.15 Requests for Reconsideration of the Secretary's Decision 




Comments: 

In response to the Secretary's question in the NPRM as to whether this provision should be retained, given the additional
appeal opportunities for an agency before the Secretary decides on its application, the Secretary received mixed
responses. Several commenters felt the provision was superfluous. Those who did not had various suggestions for
changing the procedures, from changing the time frames to clarifying the grounds for reconsideration. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary concurs with the assessment of the commenters who believed that the provision for reconsideration
was superfluous in light of the additional appeals procedures provided to agencies before the Secretary reaches
a decision. 


Change: 

The section has been deleted. 


Section 602.16. Appeals Procedures 




Comments: 

One commenter felt that this section was unnecessary because agencies can always appeal to the courts. Other commenters
expressed concern that the NPRM did not provide for a meaningful appeal of adverse recognition decisions, as required
by the statute. These commenters generally suggested using an intermediate administrative appellate body, such
as an administrative law judge, to hear appeals. Other commenters supported the provision as written, fearing that
an alternative administrative process within the Department would deplete the Department's resources inappropriately.



Discussion: 

The Secretary continues to believe, as described in the NPRM, that there can be no administrative appeal within the
Department of a Secretarial decision since the Secretary, as head of the Department, makes all final decisions on
behalf of the Department. The only appeal is through the courts. The Secretary wishes to note, however, that an agency
for which the Advisory Committee recommends denial of recognition is afforded an opportunity to contest that recommendation
before the Secretary reaches a final decision. To delay the Secretary's final decision by adding still another layer
of appeal is, in the Secretary's opinion, unwarranted. 


Change: 

None. 


Subpart C_Criteria for Secretarial Recognition 


Section 602.20 Geographic Scope of Recognition




Comments: 

The Secretary received one comment on this section from an individual who was concerned that the regulations might
be construed to preclude a State from accrediting foreign and out-of-state institutions. 


Discussion: 

Any accrediting agency, including a State, is free to define the geographic area for which it seeks recognition. In
granting recognition, the Secretary defines the geographic area included in the agency's scope of recognition,
which may or may not be the full geographic area requested by the agency. The Secretary bases the decision regarding
the agency's geographical area of recognition on whether the agency is a reliable authority regarding the quality
of education provided by the institutions it accredits throughout its geographic region.

Section 602.21 Administrative and Fiscal Responsibility 




Comments:

 A number of commenters described the recordkeeping burden imposed by the proposed regulations as unduly onerous
and in violation of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines that limit record retention requirements to
three years. Several commenters indicated that the requirement to keep self-study reports for two complete accreditation
or preaccreditation cycles was especially burdensome because of the large volume of materials typically included
with these reports. 
On other issues related to this section, one commenter felt that, to avoid conflicts of interest, members of the agency's
decision making body should not also be members of the agency's governing board. Another believed that the Secretary
should not have authority to determine whether an agency's staff is adequate, knowledgeable, and competent. 


Discussion:

 With regard to the record retention requirement, the Secretary wishes to note that the requirement to keep records
for two complete accreditation or preaccreditation cycles first appeared in the 1988 regulations governing the
recognition of accrediting agencies. The NPRM for those regulations had initially included a provision for the indefinite
retention of records. This was subsequently reduced to the current two-cycle requirement as a result of public comment
on the recordkeeping burden. 
The Secretary also wishes to note that the specific comment about the burden of keeping self-study reports for two
full cycles was made by negotiators during the negotiated rulemaking sessions for these regulations. As a result,
the Secretary carefully monitored the review of self-study reports by Department staff members conducting file
reviews at agencies' headquarters during the past year and has determined that only the most recent self-study reports
are particularly useful to staff. Consequently, the recordkeeping requirement for self-study reports has been
reduced to the most recent report only. 
With regard to the potential conflict of interest when the same individuals serve as members of both the decision making
body and the governing board of an agency, the Secretary appreciates the concern but believes that agencies should
be allowed the flexibility to determine the composition of these bodies that best suits their needs. Further, as all
agencies are required to have adequate policies dealing with conflicts of interest, the Secretary believes there
is adequate protection of the public interest. 
Concerning the issue of the Secretary's review of an agency's staff, the Secretary believes that the adequacy, knowledge,
and capability of an accrediting agency's staff are appropriate factors to be considered in making a determination
regarding whether the agency has the administrative responsibility to carry out its accrediting activities. 


Change:

 Agencies must keep only the most recent self-study report. 


Section 602.22 Demonstration of Accreditation Experience




Comments:

 Several commenters requested that accrediting agencies be required to demonstrate that their policies, evaluation
methods, and decisions are accepted throughout the United States by recognized accrediting agencies. Their rationale
was that acceptance by recognized agencies provided an important measure of an agency's reliability. 


Discussion:

 The commenters' rationale was presented to the Department by the non-Federal negotiators during negotiated rulemaking,
and the Secretary acknowledges that demonstration of acceptance by recognized accrediting agencies can be an important
factor to consider when evaluating an agency seeking recognition, particularly one seeking initial recognition.
On the other hand, those interested in forming new accrediting agencies have expressed concern that this requirement
imposes unfair hurdles for them and unduly stifles competition among accrediting agencies. The Secretary believes
that agencies should not be required to demonstrate acceptance by recognized accrediting agencies but may certainly
do so in their application for recognition, if they wish. 


Change:

 None. 


Section 602.23 Application of Standards 




Comments:

 The Secretary received several suggestions for changes to this section. For example, one suggestion was to change
the wording in  602.23(a) from ``[the agency] consistently applies and enforces written standards that ensure
that the quality of education or training offered is of sufficient quality to achieve * * * the
stated objective for which it is offered'' to ``[the agency] has written standards that it consistently applies to
ensure that the education or training offered * * *.'' Another was to change the wording in
 602.23(b)(5) from ``to ensure that its criteria and standards are appropriate and sufficiently comprehensive
to evaluate the quality of the education of training provided * * * and are relevant
to the education or training needs of affected students'' to ``to ensure that its criteria and standards are comprehensive
and appropriate to the agency's objective of ensuring the quality of the institutions or programs it accredits.''

<TEXT>
 

The Secretary also received a number of comments directed to the requirement that agencies must have a systematic
program of review to ensure what in previous regulations was described as the ``validity and reliability'' of its
standards. Some commenters believed the wording in the NPRM was preferable to the phrase ``validity and reliability''
because of the various technical interpretations often given to those words. Others, however, found the wording
in the NPRM vague and generally not as strong as the original wording. All commenters, regardless of their concerns
about the specific wording, agreed that the requirement was exceedingly important in assessing whether the agency
is a reliable authority as to educational quality. 
Finally, several commenters requested that the limit on preaccreditation status be extended from five to six years
to accommodate some agencies' practice of granting preaccreditation for six years and then reviewing the preaccredited
institution or program every two years during the six-year period. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that the various wording changes suggested by commenters for  602.23, of which two are
described above, substantially reduce the effectiveness of the section by shifting the emphasis away from agencies'
overall responsibility to have effective standards that ensure educational quality. With regard to the request
that the maximum preaccreditation period be lengthened to six years, the Secretary understands the rationale presented
by those agencies that conduct very thorough, and in some cases on-site, reviews of preaccredited institutions or
programs throughout the preaccreditation period. However, the Secretary notes that not all agencies follow this
practice of conducting thorough on-site reviews throughout the preaccreditation period. In these instances, the
Secretary believes that the addition of another year of preaccreditation is not justified. For this reason, the Secretary
does not accept the suggestion to extend the maximum preaccreditation period to six years. 
With respect to the ``validity and reliability'' issue, the Secretary has carefully considered all of the comments,
especially those directed to the level of technical and statistical precision that is often associated with the words.
However, in light of the Secretary's decision to list the twelve required accreditation standards in  602.26
as they appear in the law, with no elaboration, the Secretary believes the strongest possible language is necessary
in this section to make very clear the importance of this requirement in establishing sound accreditation standards.
For the same reason, the Secretary believes it is necessary to add to this section a requirement that an agency must
demonstrate that each of its standards provides both a consistent basis for determining the educational quality
of different institutions and programs and a valid measure of the aspects of educational quality that it is intended
to measure. 


Changes:

 The requirement in  602.23(b)(5) has been revised to incorporate the ``validity and reliability'' language.
A requirement has been added that an agency must demonstrate that each of its standards is effective in determining
educational quality. 


Section 602.24 Accreditation Processes 




Comments:

 The Secretary received numerous comments about the provision pertaining to unannounced site visits, most of which
were directly related to the definitions of ``prebaccalaureate vocation education'' and ``vocational education.''
Many commenters preferred that unannounced visits be restricted to those institutions offering non-degree vocational
education, while others felt that all institutions offering vocational education, regardless of the credential
awarded, should be subject to the requirement. Many commenters suggested that the term ``institution that offers
vocational education'' should be restricted to those institutions whose predominant offerings are vocational.
The word ``predominant'' was defined by these commenters to mean more than 75 percent of an institution's course offerings.

Several commenters also believed that the purpose of the unannounced site visit as stated in the NPRM_to determine
whether or not the institution or program continued to be in compliance with the agency's standards_was inappropriate.
One commenter wanted the regulations to require accrediting agencies to publish clear guidelines for when and how
an agency will conduct an unannounced visit. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary has carefully considered all comments received on this issue, as well as those on the broader issue of
the burden these regulations would impose on institutions and accrediting agencies. The Secretary has also reexamined
the House-Senate Conference Report regarding the requirement for unannounced inspections of institutions that
offer vocational education. This report describes the House language as requiring unannounced inspections of institutions
that are predominately vocational in nature, while the Senate language speaks more generally of requiring these
inspections for all institutions that offer vocational education. As this report also notes that the House deferred
to the Senate on this issue, the Secretary believes it is the clear intent of Congress to require accrediting agencies
to conduct unannounced inspections at all institutions that offer vocational education or training. The Secretary
also believes that Congress' use of the term ``inspection'' rather than ``review'' or ``evaluation'' is evidence
that the purpose of the unannounced visit is not necessarily to conduct a full review of the institution but to determine
whether, at a minimum, the institution actually has the personnel, facilities, and resources it claimed to have,
or appeared to have, either during its last evaluation by the accrediting agency or in subsequent reports to the agency.
The Secretary wishes to point out that an accrediting agency has the flexibility to determine how best to carry out
these unannounced inspections in a manner that achieves the purpose of these inspections but minimizes the cost to
institutions and the burden to accrediting agencies. The agency also has the flexibility to examine, during the unannounced
inspection, other aspects of an institution, such as whether it maintains adequate records or whether it actually
provides the programs and support services it advertises. As agencies are responsible for monitoring institutions
throughout their accreditation period, as described in  602.24(b)(4), the Secretary wishes to point out that
these unannounced inspections can and should serve a useful purpose in helping agencies meet this responsibility.

Section 602.25 Additions to or Substantive Changes in Educational Programs




Comments: 

The Secretary received numerous comments regarding this section. Many commenters felt that there was no substantive
change requirement in the statute so the requirement should be eliminated from the regulations. Other commenters,
however, cited a different reason why the requirement should be eliminated: most accrediting agencies already have
substantive change policies so there is no need for the Department to regulate the content of those policies. A host
of commenters observed that, as worded, the requirement placed an undue reporting requirement on both accrediting
agencies and institutions and an unnecessary burden on agencies by requiring them to grant prior approval to even
the most insignificant of program changes or additions. Many also noted that the prior approval process would severely
inhibit institutions' ability to respond in a timely manner to changing needs, as, for example, in health-related
fields. Finally, commenters noted that many programs, such as those in community colleges, were routinely reviewed
and approved by various State review boards before they could be offered, so requiring additional prior approval
by accrediting agencies would only increase costs without any added benefit. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary firmly believes that an agency cannot be a reliable authority as to the quality of education or training
offered by an institution if the agency does not have a substantive change policy that requires prior approval by the
accrediting agency before a substantive change can be included in the agency's grant of accreditation to an institution.
At the same time, the Secretary acknowledges the burden the requirement proposed in the NPRM imposed on institutions
and accrediting agencies. While the least burdensome approach would be to allow agencies simply to use their existing
substantive change policies to meet this requirement, the Secretary believes this is unworkable and does not adequately
protect the public interest because there is considerable variation among agencies as to what constitutes substantive
change. Furthermore, as the NPRM documents, there have been several significant abuses in this area because of an
agency's unwillingness to evaluate an institution's substantive change before including that change in the institution's
grant of accreditation. Consequently, the Secretary believes that the Federal interest, as well as the interest
of the general public, is best protected if a common core of changes that must be considered substantive is defined
in regulation. To determine what should constitute this common core, the Secretary examined the topics institutional
accrediting agencies typically include in their list of substantive changes that require prior approval and has
included in this section only those that reflect the Secretary's principal concerns regarding institutions that
undergo substantive change. The Secretary believes that the revised substantive change policy, which now applies
only to institutional accrediting agencies, considerably reduces the burden on both accrediting agencies and institutions
at the same time it provides adequate protection to the public. 
The Secretary recognizes that there are many variables that must be taken into account in determining the type of review
that an agency conducts before granting prior approval to an institution's substantive change. For this reason,
the Secretary has decided to give accrediting agencies the flexibility to determine the procedures they will use
in granting prior approval to an institution's substantive change. In some instances, this may involve a full-scale
on-site evaluation of the entire institution. In others, it may involve a focused visit to examine the particular
circumstances surrounding the change. In still others, it may involve simply a thorough review by agency staff of
the institution's report on its ability to implement the substantive change without adversely affecting the institution's
ability to continue to meet the agency's standards. 


Changes: 

The substantive change requirement has been modified to limit the types of changes that must be given prior approval
by an accrediting agency. The requirement now applies to institutional accrediting agencies only. 


Section 602.26 Required Accreditation Standards




Comments: 

The Secretary received numerous comments about the required accreditation standards. Most commenters felt that
the Federal government should not mandate how accrediting agencies defined their standards. They also felt that
the proposed regulations intruded on the autonomy of accrediting agencies, exceeded the statute, and were contrary
to Executive Order 12866. In their opinion, the Secretary overreached his authority by specifying anything in this
section that went beyond a mere restatement of the law on the required standards. These same commenters applauded
the removal of the language on curricula, faculty, facilities, equipment and supplies, and student support services
that had appeared in early drafts of the proposed regulations and urged the Secretary to do the same for the other eight
standards specified in the law.

<TEXT>
 

Several commenters argued that many of the specific responsibilities assigned to accrediting agencies by the various
standards would force agencies into becoming government regulators. They also argued that these new requirements
would require accrediting agencies to duplicate the efforts of the Department and the States and would substantially
increase the paperwork burden on institutions and accrediting agencies. In their opinion, these requirements would
be so burdensome to accrediting agencies in terms of time and personnel that they would shift the focus of accreditors
away from their primary function_that of reviewing educational quality_to a role in which they served merely as investigative
and enforcement agencies for the Federal government. 
While the opinions expressed above were shared by the majority of commenters on this issue, they were by no means unanimous.
Some commenters from the proprietary sector, for example, had no serious objection with the standards, noting that
most of what was contained in the standards was already being examined to the degree of specificity contained in the
proposed regulations by either their accrediting agencies, the State, or both. Others commenters felt that the standards,
as written, protected students as well as Federal dollars. One commenter thought the introductory paragraph to the
required standards section should be strengthened by requiring agencies to have quantitatively validated standards
that were based on a rigorous assessment of the value added by the education or training. 
Finally, one commenter expressed concern that the Secretary was exceeding the statute by requiring institutional
accrediting agencies whose accreditation does not serve Title IV, HEA purposes to meet the student outcomes requirements
of  602.26(b)(9). 


Discussion: 

The Secretary has given very careful thought to all the concerns raised with regard to this section. Of particular
concern to the Secretary is how best to achieve an appropriate balance between the need for agencies to have rigorous
standards in order to protect students' interests and the need for agencies to have flexibility in addressing these
standards in order to reduce cost and burden to both agencies and institutions. Another important factor, in the Secretary's
opinion, is the need to build a partnership among triad members that is based on mutual trust and allows each member
the flexibility to determine the appropriate means to carry out its responsibilities under the HEA. 
After considering all of these factors, the Secretary has decided to eliminate all but the statutory language for
each of the 12 required standards. This approach eliminates many requirements that commenters found especially
burdensome, such as that in  602.26(b)(4) concerning annual financial audits. In addition, it allows accrediting
agencies that already have rigorous standards in these areas to continue operating as they have, thus eliminating
the need for additional cost to agencies and institutions to comply with the requirements of this section. 
While the Secretary believes it is appropriate not to prescribe specific minimum regulatory standards elaborating
on the standards in the statute, the Secretary also believes that the standards contained in the NPRM provide a sound
framework for a thorough assessment of these areas. For this reason, the Secretary summarizes below the major provisions
contained in the NPRM concerning the statutory standards. The Secretary believes these provisions are appropriate
for agencies to address in their own standards for these areas. In addition, the Secretary believes that, in addressing
the development of their own standards, accrediting agencies should consider any comparable Title IV, HEA program
standards and any relevant and applicable State standards developed under the State Postsecondary Review Program.
However, the Secretary wishes to make it clear that this does not prevent an accrediting agency whose standards do
not include all of these provisions from being recognized by the Secretary, provided the agency can justify the appropriateness
of its standards as reasonable applications of the statutory standards in light of its needs, the needs and circumstances
of the institutions or programs it accredits, and the students they serve. Finally, the Secretary wishes to emphasize
the importance of accrediting agencies' developing their standards in such a way that they minimize burden, overlap,
and duplication at the same time they ensure overall educational quality. 
The Secretary notes that for most of the standards discussed below there are comparable, or very similar, standards
in section 494 and some in 498 of the HEA. The Secretary expects to take a leadership role in working with accrediting
agencies and SPREs to ensure that the standards for all three members of the triad are complementary, rather than redundant.



Fiscal and administrative capacity as appropriate to the specified scale of operations. 

An accrediting agency's standard for assessing this area should generally address the overall quality of an institution's
or program's fiscal and administrative capacity. The assessment should examine in particular whether the institution's
or program's finances are sufficiently strong to enable it to meet, and appear likely to continue to meet for the foreseeable
future, all of the agency's standards for accreditation. The assessment should also include some provision for the
ongoing monitoring of an institution's or program's finances throughout any period of accreditation or preaccreditation
granted by the agency. 
The Secretary notes that section 494(d)(5) of the HEA contains a comparable SPRE review standard and sections 498
(c) and (d) of the HEA contain comparable Department standards. 


Recruiting and admissions practices, academic calendars, catalogs, publications, grading, and advertising.


An accrediting agency's standard for assessing these areas should generally address whether they are reasonable
in light of an institution's or program's educational mission, reflect good practice, and accurately reflect actual
practice. 
The Secretary notes that sections 494(d) (1), (2), and (12) of the HEA contain comparable SPRE review standards. 


Program length and tuition and fees in relation to the subject matters taught and the objectives of the degrees or credentials
offered. 

An accrediting agency's standard for assessing this area should generally address the appropriateness of an institution's
program length and tuition and fees, taking into account such factors as program objectives and content, the types
and locations of instructional delivery, the knowledge and skills necessary for students to reach competence in
the field being taught, and generally accepted practices in higher education. 
The Secretary notes that section 494(d)(7) of the HEA contains a comparable SPRE review standard.

Measures of program length in clock hours or credit hours.

 An accrediting agency's standard for assessing this area should generally address the appropriateness of an institution's
or program's measurement of program length, taking into account such factors as program objectives and content,
the types and combinations of instructional methodologies and delivery systems (including outside preparation
as appropriate), the knowledge and skills necessary for students to reach competence in the field being taught, and
generally accepted practices in higher education. 

The Secretary notes that section 494(d)(9) of the HEA contains a comparable SPRE review standard. 



Success with respect to student achievement in relation to mission, including, as appropriate, consideration of
course completion, State licensing examination, and job placement rates.

 An accrediting agency's standard for assessing this area should generally address the success of an institution
or program in meeting its educational objectives, as measured by the achievement of its students. Typically under
this standard, an agency should require the institution or program to document and assess the educational achievement
of students in verifiable and consistent ways, such as student grades, grade point averages, theses or portfolios,
the results of admissions tests for graduate or professional school or other standardized tests, transfer rates
to institutions offering higher level programs, job placement rates, completion rates, results of licensing examinations,
evaluations by employers, follow-up studies of alumni, and other recognized measures of educational outcomes.
The agency should also typically require the institution or program to use effectively the information obtained
in this manner to improve student achievement with respect to the degrees or certificates offered. Finally, the agency
should typically monitor in a systematic way the institution's or program's performance with respect to student
achievement, including, as appropriate, completion rates, job placement rates, and pass rates on State licensing
examinations, or other appropriate measures of occupational competency, to determine if performance is consistent
with both the institution's or program's mission and objectives and any measures the agency may have for institutions'
or programs' performance with respect to student achievement. For programs that provide vocational education,
agencies should establish quantitative standards for completion rates, job placement rates, and pass rates on State
licensing examinations. 


The Secretary notes that section 494(d)(14) of the HEA contains a comparable SPRE review standard. 




Default rates in the student loan programs established under Title IV of the Act, based on the most recent data provided
by the Secretary.

 An accrediting agency's standard for assessing this area should generally address an institution's default rates
in relation to the institution's overall ability to meet the agency's standards. Typically, an agency might evaluate
an institution to determine whether the institution is out of compliance with its accrediting standards if the institution's
latest cohort default rate under the Federal Stafford Loan or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students program equals
or exceeds 25 percent or if it has increased significantly in relation to its rate the previous year. Under this standard,
an agency is not expected to do the work of the Federal government with respect to institutional default rates. Rather,
the agency is expected to review the default rate information provided by the Secretary, determine if that information
calls into question the institution's compliance with agency standards, and take follow-up action as appropriate.





Record of student complaints received by, or available to, the agency.

 An accrediting agency's standard for assessing this area should generally address an institution's or program's
record of student complaints received by or made available to the agency. Under this standard, the agency should typically
review student complaints that relate to the agency's standards and take appropriate follow-up action with regard
to those complaints. If necessary, the agency would refer complainants to appropriate Federal, State, and other
agencies if the complaints do not relate to the agency's standards. Finally, it would require institutions or programs
to make available to students the agency's mailing address or telephone number for complaints. 


The Secretary notes that section 494(d)(11) of the HEA contains a comparable SPRE review standard. 




Compliance with the institution's program responsibilities under Title IV of the Act.

 An accrediting agency's standard for assessing this area should generally address an institution's compliance
with its Title IV, HEA program responsibilities in relation to the institution's overall ability to meet the agency's
standards. The agency's assessment under this standard is based on program reviews, financial and compliance audits,
audited financial statements, and any other information that the Secretary provides. Under this standard, the agency
is not expected to do the work of the Federal government in reviewing institutions for compliance with their Title
IV, HEA program responsibilities. Rather, the agency is expected to review the information provided by the Secretary,
determine if that information calls into question the institution's compliance with agency standards, and take
follow-up action as appropriate. 

With regard to the concern raised by one commenter about the need for quantitatively validated standards, the Secretary
notes that  602.23(b)(5) requires agencies to have in place a program for the systematic evaluation of the validity
and reliability of its standards. In light of the Secretary's decision to eliminate all but the statutory language
for the required standards, this ``validity and reliability'' provision takes on added importance, as described
in the discussion of the changes to  602.23.

Finally, with regard to the concern about extending the requirement to have a standard assessing student achievement
to institutions whose accreditation does not serve Title IV, HEA program purposes, the Secretary wishes to note that
the overriding concern of the statute, as expressed in section 496(a) of the HEA, is that accrediting agency standards
must contain a measure or measures of student achievement. Therefore, it is the Secretary's belief that extending
the requirement to all agencies, not just those whose accreditation serves Title IV, HEA purposes, is warranted.





Changes:

 Paragraph 602.26(b) contains only the statutory language for the 12 required standards. Other changes to  602.26
are discussed below. 




Section 602.26(b)(13) The Institution's Practice of Making Refunds to Students






Comments:

 Many commenters objected to the inclusion of this requirement in the regulations on the grounds that section 496(g)
of the HEA explicitly states that the Secretary may not establish standards for accrediting agencies that are not
required by section 496. This point was argued by non-Federal negotiators during negotiated rulemaking as well.





Discussion:

 The Secretary has carefully reviewed the statutory provision on which this requirement was based and has also reexamined
the requirement in light of refund policies established in the Student Assistance General Provisions, 34 CFR part
668. It is the Secretary's belief that the regulatory language contained in 34 CFR part 668 is sufficient by itself
to ensure that an institution's refund policy meets the requirements of the statute. Thus, there is no need for a requirement
that accrediting agencies must have a standard that assesses institutions' refund policies. 




Changes:

 The section has been deleted. 




Section 602.26(c) Time Limit on Correcting Deficiencies 






Comments:

 Many commenters expressed concern about the proposed 18-month time limit for institutions to come into compliance
with an accrediting agency's standards. Some argued that in many instances, such as when an institution's financial
situation is cause for concern, it takes considerably longer for an institution to come into compliance. Others argued
that, for some programs, 18 months was too long. 


Many commenters expressed concern about the requirement under consideration that accrediting agencies would have
to take adverse action if they determined that an institution was unlikely to continue to be able to meet agency standards
for the foreseeable future. This requirement, they argued, was totally unrealistic because agencies would have
no objective basis on which to make such a determination. According to these commenters, the requirement would result
in a determination that was pure conjecture on the part of accrediting agencies and would leave agencies vulnerable
to lawsuits. Several commenters expressed an opposing view about this requirement, however, stating it was necessary
to protect students who attended institutions whose ability to continue to provide a quality education was clearly
questionable. 




Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that some definitive time frame is necessary to ensure that institutions and programs make
serious efforts to improve the quality of their offerings and to ensure that accrediting agencies take adverse actions
when institutions fail to make those efforts. However, the Secretary also recognizes that, because of differing
lengths of programs, the 18-month time frame is unrealistic for all types of institutions.

With regard to the provision that agencies should be required to take action if it appears that an institution or program
will be unlikely to continue to meet an agency standard, the Secretary understands the concerns of commenters who
opposed the requirement. However, because there is potential for serious harm to students enrolled in an institution
or program the quality of whose education or training appears to be declining, the Secretary remains concerned about
a marginal institution or program that might be accredited by an agency despite the agency's very serious concerns
about its enrollment or financial trends. While the Secretary has not added to these regulations the specific requirement
under consideration in the NPRM, the Secretary wishes to impress upon agencies the importance of the requirement,
contained in  602.24(b)(4) of these regulations, that they monitor institutions and programs throughout
any accreditation or preaccreditation period to ensure that they give prompt and serious attention to any degradation
in an institution's or program's ability to provide a quality education. 


Changes

: Different time frames for corrective action have been incorporated for different lengths of programs. 


Section 602.27 Required Operating Procedures




Comments

: The Secretary received many comments about the special actions accrediting agencies are required to take whenever
institutions establish new branch campuses. Of particular concern to most commenters was the apparent inconsistency
between the definition of ``branch campus'' in  602.2 and the use of that term in this section. Also of concern
to many commenters was the added requirement that accrediting agencies must visit ``additional locations,'' which
many felt went beyond the statute. One commenter felt that the required submission of a business plan for a new branch
campus was unwarranted, burdensome and costly and had no intrinsic value. 
The Secretary also received a number of comments about the requirement that accrediting agencies provide an opportunity
for public comment about an institution's or program's qualifications for accreditation. Many felt this would subvert
the accreditation process by evoking unjustified complaints. Others felt it required the agency to hold a public
hearing every time an institution or program was evaluated for accreditation or reaccreditation. One commenter
held an opposing view, however, preferring that agencies be required to hold public hearings for all accrediting
decisions. 
Finally, the Secretary received a number of suggestions for strengthening the various public disclosure requirements
contained in this section, although a few commenters questioned the statutory authority for these requirements.



Discussion

: The branch campus-additional location issue has already been discussed under the definition of ``branch campus.''

The Secretary notes that the additional information collection requirement related to the establishment of branch
campuses_the submission of a business plan_is a statutory requirement and cannot be eliminated.

With regard to the issue of public comment when an institution or program is being considered for accreditation, the
Secretary believes there should be opportunity for such comment but that there need not be a public hearing to obtain
it. The Secretary believes further that an agency should be free to determine both the manner in which it publicizes
that an institution is scheduled for review and the method it uses to obtain public comment. 
With regard to the other public disclosure issues in this section, the Secretary believes that the more open an accrediting
agency is with regard to its policies and practices, as well as the individuals involved in its accrediting activities,
the better it is for the consumer. However, the Secretary believes it is best left up to the agency to determine its actual
practice in this regard. 


Changes

: The term ``branch campus'' has been redefined, and the phrase ``additional location'' has been deleted from this
section. The public disclosure requirements have been modified to clarify that a public hearing is not required to
obtain public comment on an institution's or program's application for accreditation. 


Section 602.28 Due Process for Institutions and Programs




Comments

: One commenter expressed concern that the proposed regulations allowed an accrediting agency to deny an institution
or program the right to appeal in person any adverse accrediting action. Another commenter noted that the regulations
did not address the provision in section 496(e) of the HEA that prohibits the Secretary from recognizing the accreditation
of an institution unless the institution agrees to submit any dispute involving the final denial, withdrawal, or
termination of the institution's accreditation to initial arbitration prior to any other legal action. This same
commenter felt that accrediting agencies should be required to adopt an initial arbitration procedure for handling
disputes involving the loss of accreditation. 


Discussion:

 With regard to the commenter's concern that institutions have the right to appeal an adverse action in person, the
Secretary believes it is best to give agencies the flexibility to determine the appropriate procedures for appealing
adverse actions. As the cost to an agency when an institution or program appeals an adverse action is generally substantial,
the Secretary believes this approach minimizes the cost without causing undue harm to institutions that are subject
to an adverse action. 
With respect to the issue of arbitration, the Secretary recognizes that the statute does not specifically require
an accrediting agency to agree to binding arbitration. However, the Secretary anticipates that many accrediting
agencies will agree to arbitration since it significantly limits the cost and length of appeals of their final decisions.
Moreover, if an accrediting agency does not agree to binding arbitration, an institution will be free to appeal a final
adverse decision by the agency in the federal courts. 


Change:

 None. 


Section 602.29 Notification of Accrediting Decisions

Comments: 

The Secretary received several comments endorsing the addition of a requirement that an accrediting agency must
notify the Secretary and the appropriate State postsecondary review entity of any final adverse accrediting action
at the same time the agency notifies the institution or program. On another issue, most commenters believed it was
inappropriate to require an accrediting agency to notify the Secretary and others prior to making a final decision
that involved the denial or termination of accreditation, although some supported this provision. Some commenters
believed that the time frame for requiring accrediting agencies to make available to the public the comments of an
institution that loses its accreditation was unrealistic. Finally, one commenter requested clarification as to
which agencies should be included in the phrase ``the appropriate accrediting agencies'' that an agency must notify
of its decisions. 


Discussion: 

As mentioned in the NPRM, the Secretary believes that accrediting agencies should be required to notify the Secretary
and others at the same time they notify an institution or program of a final adverse action in order to prevent excessive
draw-down of Federal funds by the institution or program. The Secretary appreciates the comments received in support
of this position. With regard to the issue of notification before an adverse action is final, the Secretary shares
the concerns of those who support the inclusion of a requirement to this effect but agrees with those commenters who
expressed the concern that notification prior to final action could cause serious harm to institutions that subsequently
had the adverse action reversed. 
With regard to the 60-day time frame for obtaining the comments of an institution or program that is subject to a final
adverse action, the Secretary believes it is in the best interest of the public to publish as soon as possible the reasons
why the agency has denied, withdrawn, suspended, or terminated the accreditation of the institution or program.
If the institution or program chooses not to make its comments about that action available to the accrediting agency
within 60 days, then the accrediting agency is free to publish its statement of reasons without the accompanying statement
of the institution or program. 
With regard to ``appropriate accrediting agencies,'' the Secretary believes that accrediting agencies should
be free to determine which agencies should be notified but that, at a minimum, an agency should notify all recognized
agencies that accredit an institution, or a program offered by the institution, if the agency takes an adverse action
against the institution or one of its programs. 


Changes: 

A requirement has been added that accrediting agencies must notify the Secretary and others at the same time they notify
the institution or program of a final adverse accrediting action. 


Section 602.30 Regard for Decisions of States and Other Accrediting Agencies 




Comments: 

The Secretary received many comments opposing the requirement that institutional accrediting agencies must review
their accreditation or preaccreditation of an institution if a programmatic accrediting agency takes adverse action
against a program offered by the institution. Some commenters also expressed opposition to the requirement that
programmatic accrediting agencies had to review an accredited program at an institution if the institutional accrediting
agency took adverse action against the institution. Many commenters objected to the phrase ``or should have known''
in  602.30(b). 


Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that all agencies, including those that accredit only programs, should be required to take
into account the decisions of States and other accrediting agencies when making any accreditation or preaccreditation
decision involving an institution or program. The Secretary also believes that there may be occasions when a programmatic
agency is the first agency to discover a serious problem that threatens the overall ability of the institution to provide
a quality education. For this reason, the Secretary believes it is important for an institutional accreditor to review
an institution for compliance with its accreditation standards if a programmatic agency takes adverse action against
a program offered by the institution. The Secretary allows the institutional accrediting agency the flexibility
to determine what an appropriate ``review'' is, however. It does not have to be a full on-site review of the institution.

With regard to agencies being accountable for actions about which they ``should have known,'' the Secretary understands
the concerns of commenters that agencies could be held accountable for knowing about the actions of another agency
that failed to inform other agencies of its adverse actions. However, there are instances where information about
an agency's adverse action against an institution or program becomes a matter of public record, and the Secretary
believes that in these instances accrediting agencies should not be absolved from their responsibility to review
the institution simply because another entity failed to notify them. 


Changes: 

None.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final regulations with invitation for comment.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On December 20, 1993, the President signed the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993. These interim final
regulations implement certain provisions of the technical amendments relating to the determination of institutional
cohort default rates in the Federal Family Education Loan program. The Secretary invites comments on these regulations.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 2(c)(55) of Public Law 103-208 amended section 435 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA),
20 U.S.C. 1085. This section modified the process governing institutions' appeals of their cohort default rates
based on allegations of improper loan servicing and collection. 


In a 

Federal Register

 Notice published March 22, 1994, 59 FR 13606, the Secretary requested comments on the procedures that should be established
to implement the statutory amendments. 
The Secretary indicated in the Notice that he intended to issue regulations establishing procedures for schools
to appeal their default rates based on allegations of improper loan servicing or collection. The notice solicited
public help in developing those procedures. The Secretary invited public comment on any aspect of implementing the
statute, but in particular, the Secretary solicited comments on the following issues: 
1. What procedures should the Secretary use in determining whether to exclude from the calculation of cohort default
rates loans, the inclusion of which due to improper servicing or collection, would result in an inaccurate or incomplete
calculation of a school's cohort default rate?

2. What procedures should be used for sampling of loan servicing and collection records? 
3. What procedures should the Secretary provide for schools to review the information provided by the guaranty agencies
to the Secretary for use in determining cohort default rates prior to calculation of the final rates? 
The Secretary received 54 comments in response to the request for comments. Many of the comments are reflected in these
rules. The Secretary's response to the suggestions made by the commenters that were not accepted is provided after
the following discussion of the procedures established by these rules. 


Appeals Based on Allegations of Improper Loan Servicing 


Public Law 103-208 added section 435(a)(3) to the HEA to specifically provide certain institutions with an
opportunity to appeal the calculation of their cohort default rates on the basis of allegations of improper loan servicing
or collection. In particular, this opportunity will be available to institutions that: (1) Are subject to loss of
eligibility for the FFEL Program under section 435(a)(2) of the HEA; (2) are subject to loss of eligibility for the
Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Program under section 428A(a)(2) of the HEA; or (3) have cohort default
rates that equal or exceed 20 percent for the most recent year for which data are available. The statute requires the
Secretary to take steps to ensure that these institutions have access to a representative sample of relevant loan
servicing and collection records for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 30 calendar days. Upon completion
of the appeal, the Secretary will reduce an institution's cohort default rate to reflect the percentage of defaulted
loans in the sample that are required to be excluded under section 435(m)(1)(B) of the HEA. 
Public Law 103-208 also amended section 435(m)(1)(B) of the HEA to clearly provide that the Secretary would
consider allegations of improper loan servicing or collection only in considering appeals of cohort default rate
determinations filed by institutions. This change was made in response to certain court rulings which suggested
that the Secretary was required to determine whether loans were properly serviced prior to making initial determinations
of and releasing cohort default rates. Section 435(m)(1)(B) of the HEA now provides that, in considering appeals
of cohort default rates under section 435(a)(3) of the HEA, the Secretary should exclude any loans which, due to improper
servicing or collection, would, as demonstrated by the evidence submitted in support of the institution's timely
appeal to the Secretary, result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of the cohort default rate. 
These regulations establish the procedures for implementing the appeal process provided by sections 435(a)(3)
and 435(m)(1)(B) of the HEA. The regulations specify that an institution which is subject to the loss of participation
in the FFEL program because of default rates equal to or in excess of 25 percent for the three most recent years for which
rates are calculated or which has a cohort default rate which equals or exceeds 20 percent may appeal the calculation
of the rate based on allegations of improper loan servicing or collection. These regulations do not specifically
include institutions that are subject to the loss of participation in the Federal SLS Program because that program
has been repealed by Congress effective July 1, 1994. See Public Law 103-66, section 4047(b) and (d). These regulations
replace the former regulatory provision which related to the loss of SLS participation because that subsection becomes
moot on the elimination of the SLS program. However, an institution that is currently subject to a loss of participation
in the SLS program will have the opportunity to pursue an appeal under these procedures. 
Under these regulations, once an institution receives notice from the Secretary that its cohort default rate or rates
exceed the levels specified in section 435(a)(3) of the HEA, the institution will have 10 working days to initiate
an appeal of the rate based on allegations of improper loan servicing or collection. The Secretary's default rate
notification to the institution will include a list of all borrowers included in the calculation of the cohort default
rate. To initiate an appeal, the institution must include the list of borrowers in its notification to the guaranty
agencies that it is appealing the calculation of the cohort default rate based on allegations of improper loan servicing
or collection.

Once the guaranty agency receives the institution's appeal, it must provide the institution with the loan servicing
or collection records for a representative sample of the loans insured by the guaranty agency and included in the institution's
cohort default rate. The sample must be identified by the guaranty agency and the universe estimate derived from the
sample results must be acceptable at a 95 percent confidence level with a plus or minus 5 percent confidence interval.
In some cases, the result may be that servicing and collection records for all the loans guaranteed by the agency and
included in the institution's default rate will be sent to the institution. Once the sample is identified, the guaranty
agency must send the loan servicing and collection records to the institution within 15 working days of receiving
the institution's request. The guaranty agency's response to the institution must also include a list of certain
dates that will assist the institution in reviewing the records and the Department in resolving the appeal. An agency
may charge the institution a reasonable fee for copying and production of the records, not to exceed $10 per borrower
file. The Secretary will charge a similar fee in response to a request for records maintained by the Department on behalf
of the Higher Education Assistance Foundation. 
After receiving the records from the guaranty agency, the institution has 30 calendar days to file its appeal with
the Secretary. The regulations identify the material that must be submitted by the institution. The Secretary will
review the appeal and issue a decision. The Secretary will assume that the records maintained by the guaranty agency
in the normal course of business in the FFEL Program are correct unless the institution provides substantial evidence
to the contrary. If the Secretary finds that the evidence submitted by the institution shows that some of the loans
included in the sample of loans should be excluded from calculation of the cohort default rate, the Secretary will
adjust the institution's cohort default rate to reflect the percentage of defaulted loans that should be excluded.
The Secretary will use a statistically valid methodology to determine the estimate of the number of loans that should
be excluded from the calculation of the cohort default rate and the confidence interval of the estimate. In determining
the exact methodology, the Secretary will need to consider the number of loans in the sample, the number of guaranty
agencies involved and other appropriate factors. The Secretary will notify the institution, in writing, of his decision
on the appeal. 
Section 435(m)(1)(B) of the HEA includes two prerequisites for exclusion of a loan from the cohort default rate calculation.
Under the law, the institution must prove both (1) that the loans were serviced or collected improperly and (2) that
the improper loan servicing and collection caused the student loan default. If either of these two requirements is
not proven, the loan will not be excluded from the cohort default rate calculation.

These regulations reflect the Secretary's view, based on consideration of past appeals of cohort default rate determinations
that, for purposes of a cohort default rate appeal, a loan is considered to have been serviced or collected improperly
only if, under applicable rules, the Department would decline to pay reinsurance on the principal of the loan by reason
of the improper servicing or collection. The HEA does not define the term ``improper servicing or collection'' used
in section 435(m). Therefore, to determine what constitutes improper loan servicing and collection, the Secretary
looks to its due diligence regulations, its published policies such as Appendix D to 34 CFR part 682 and other applicable
policies and practices. There is no indication that the 1993 amendments to section 435(m) were intended to establish
new concepts regarding what does and does not constitute improper loan servicing and collection. For that reason,
the Secretary construes section 435(m) by reference to concepts developed over a period of years in the administration
of the FFEL Program. 
Section 435(m) of the HEA also specifies that a loan which has been subject to improper servicing or collection is excluded
from calculation of the cohort default rate only if the default on the loan was ``due to'' improper servicing or collection
and results in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of the cohort default rate. The statute does not explain how
improper servicing or collection could cause a cohort default rate to be inaccurate or incomplete. In 

Atlanta College of Medical and Dental Careers, Inc. 

v. 

Riley, 

987 F.2d 821, 830 (D.C. Cir. 1993), however, the Court of Appeals assumed that a cohort default rate would be inaccurate
or incomplete if it contained loans which defaulted due to improper servicing or collection. The Secretary considers
that interpretation to be reasonable. The Court of Appeals in

 Atlanta College

 also concluded that the type of causal link between improper servicing and default on a loan is properly left to the
Secretary. The Secretary believes that a stringent showing of default causation is appropriate. Section 435(m)
of the HEA does not include any general ``causation'' challenge that would permit an institution to appeal the calculation
of its default rates on the basis that its students defaulted for reasons beyond the institution's control. Moreover,
Congress set tight constraints on the time periods for challenges to the calculation of the cohort default rates and
clearly did not contemplate a time-consuming, heavily burdensome process for determining default causation. 
Based on these factors, the Secretary has determined that section 435(m) should be interpreted to allow only a limited
loan servicing challenge. Accordingly, these regulations reflect the Secretary's determination that, for purposes
of the calculation of a cohort default rate, improper servicing or collection is considered to have caused a default
only if the improper servicing or collection resulted in a lack of notification to the borrower that he or she must begin
repaying the loan. The Secretary believes that once the borrower has been informed of the obligation to repay the loan,
the institution cannot show that a resulting default was due to the alleged improper servicing. The position reflected
in these regulations has its genesis in certain decisions of the Secretary which resolved appeals of cohort default
rate determinations on a case-by-case basis. Case-by-case adjudication is a permissible approach to decision making
under applicable law. See 

NLRB 

v. 

Bell Aerospace Corp., 

416 U.S. 267, 294 (1974). However, the Secretary's adjudications resolving individual appeals have not established
rules of general applicability. As explained in more detail in the comment and response section of this document,
the Secretary has considered a variety of proposed standards for adjudication of appeals based on allegations of
improper servicing and collection. Some of these approaches would arguably broaden the appeal standard for institutions,
while others reflect a more narrow scope than is reflected in the Secretary's adjudications to date. After careful
consideration of these alternatives, the Secretary concludes that the general construction of section 435(m) of
the HEA reflected in his most recent appeal decisions faithfully implements Congressional intent and fairly balances
the rights of all those affected by those decisions. The Secretary particularly invites comments as to whether there
are other types of improper servicing that should be considered to have ``caused'' a default for purposes of calculation
of a cohort default rate and the rationale for any such suggestion. Review of cohort default rate information.

Public Law 103-208 also amended section 435(m)(1)(A) of the HEA to provide, effective October 1, 1994, that
institutions will have an opportunity to review and correct errors in the information provided by the guaranty agencies
to the Secretary for use in calculating cohort default rates. These regulations add paragraph (h) to  668.17
to establish procedures for this review. 
Under the regulations, the Secretary will provide each institution which has a draft default rate equal to or in excess
of 20 percent with a copy of the records provided by each guaranty agency in regard to loans made to borrowers for attendance
at the institution which were insured by that guaranty agency. Institutions with draft default rates under 20 percent
may request copies of the records. These records will be accompanied by a notice indicating the institution's draft
default rate. This draft default rate will not be considered a final agency decision and will not be otherwise voluntarily
released by the Secretary. 
After receiving the information from the Secretary, the institution will have 30 calendar days to review the information
and notify, in writing, the appropriate guaranty agency of any information included in the cohort default rate which
it believes is incorrect. The institution should also send the agency any evidence which it believes supports its
contention that the information provided by the guaranty agency to the Secretary is inaccurate. The guaranty agency
shall review the institution's challenge and respond within 30 calendar days. If the guaranty agency agrees with
the institution, the information used to calculate the cohort default rate will be adjusted prior to the release of
the official cohort default rates. If the guaranty agency does not confirm the error alleged by the institution, the
institution may use the data provided by the guaranty agency as part of an appeal of the calculation of the default rate
based on the allegedly erroneous data after the rates are released. 
The Secretary intends to continue his practice of allowing institutions with a cohort default rate equal to or in excess
of 20 percent for the most recent year for which rates have been calculated to challenge the calculation of the rate
based on allegations that erroneous data were included in the calculation. However, all institutions must satisfy
the time deadlines for filing challenges under the regulations. 
The Secretary believes that section 435 only provides an opportunity for the institution to review and correct errors
in the information provided to the Secretary by the guaranty agency. The statute does not contemplate that all allegations
of error will be resolved prior to release of the final default rates. The regulations, therefore, allow an institution
to appeal the calculation of a cohort default rate based solely on allegations of erroneous data. However, to ensure
that appeals can be decided on a timely basis, the regulations provide that an institution can only base an appeal on
allegations that were raised to the guaranty agency during the review of the draft cohort default rate. The Secretary
believes that this process will benefit the institutions, guaranty agencies and the public by shortening delays
that have been experienced in the appeal process and will result in more timely decisions. 


Effect on Pending Default Rates 


The Secretary received a number of comments regarding the effect of the changes to section 435(a)(3) and (m) on the
current official cohort default rates. As the Secretary noted in the 

Federal Register

 notice, Public Law 103-208 does not specifically provide for reopening prior final determinations. However,
the Secretary has been convinced by the commenters to allow institutions to challenge their current cohort default
rates on the basis of allegations of improper loan servicing or collection. Accordingly, the regulation allows institutions
identified in section 435(a)(3) of the HEA to file an appeal of the current cohort default rates based on allegations
of improper loan servicing. Thus, institutions with cohort default rates equal to or in excess of 20 percent for fiscal
year 1991 (including institutions subject to the loss of SLS participation based on a fiscal year 1991 cohort default
rate in excess of 30 percent) may challenge the 1991 cohort default rate. Similarly, institutions which are subject
to the loss of FFEL program participation based on cohort default rates for fiscal years 1989, 1990 and 1991 may challenge
those rates. The regulation specifies that the time limits for challenging these rates will begin on the date that
the regulations become effective. The Secretary intends to notify institutions of the effective date of these regulations
once that date is determined. The prior default rates will be considered effective until the appeal process is completed
and a new rate issued. 
The Secretary notes that cohort default rates for fiscal year 1992 will be issued during the summer of 1994. Institutions
which are interested in challenging their current cohort default rates may want to wait until after the new rates are
issued. An institution with a cohort default rate in excess of one of the threshold levels for fiscal year 1991 may find
that its fiscal year 1992 cohort default rate is below the threshold and that the institution is no longer subject to
sanctions based on excessive cohort default rates. Thus, an institution may want to consider whether filing a challenge
of the current default rates is worth the time, expense and resources needed to prepare and submit an appeal of a rate
that may soon be irrelevant. The Secretary also notes that the regulations provide that once an institution has challenged
a cohort default rate for a particular year and received a final decision from the Secretary, that decision is binding
in any future challenge to the default rate filed by the institution. 


Analysis of Comments and Responses 




Comment: 

The commenters provided a number of different definitions of the term ``improper servicing or collection'' of a loan.
A number of respondents to the request for comments suggested that the Secretary should remove from the calculation
of the cohort default rate any loan that was not serviced in strict compliance with the Department's due diligence
requirements in 34 CFR 682.411. Some commenters suggested that a loan on which a default claim has been paid should
be considered properly serviced or collected on the grounds that a claim would not have been paid if servicing was not
proper. Other commenters suggested that the Secretary should consider a lender's failure to grant a deferment to
be improper loan servicing or collection. Some commenters also suggested that guaranty agency collection efforts
should be considered in evaluating whether improper servicing or collection has occurred. 


Response: 

The Secretary's view of the satutory term ``improper servicing or collection'' is discussed earlier in this document.
The Secretary does not agree with the suggestion that Congress intended to establish a new standard for proper servicing
or collection. Instead, the Secretary believes it is appropriate to rely on the concepts and requirements developed
and applied by the Department over the years. The requirements in  682.411 are designed to ensure that lenders
and guaranty agencies that are requesting Federal benefits meet certain standards in collection as a requirement
for receiving those benefits. These requirements have never been intended to set forth standards which if not followed
in their entirety provide an excuse for borrowers to refuse to repay their loans. Similarly, they are not intended
to provide protection for institutions that fail to meet the statutory requirements for continued participation
in the loan programs. Congress has determined that the institutions bear a significant responsibility for defaults
in the FFEL program. The Secretary does not believe that a lender's failure to strictly satisfy the requirements for
Federal benefits should excuse the institution from the statutory consequences of its high default rate.

The Secretary also does not agree that it would be appropriate to assume that all claims which have been paid as defaults
have been properly serviced or collected. While failure to pay a default claim may be based on a finding of improper
servicing or collection, payment of a default claim is not absolute proof of compliance with the Secretary's requirements.
Accordingly, institutions should have the opportunity to review servicing and collection records relating to these
loans. 
In regard to the issue of a lender's failure to respond to deferment requests, the Secretary notes that he has consistently
treated deferment errors as ``erroneous data'' in adjudicating appeals of cohort default rate determinations.
This treatment benefits the appealing institution since a determination that erroneous data was reported results
in the affected loan being removed from the calculation of defaulted loans (the numerator), but it remains in the calculation
of loans in repayment (the denominator). In contrast, loans which are excluded from the calculation of the cohort
default rate based on improper servicing or collection are excluded from both the numerator and the denominator.
The Secretary does not believe there is any reason to change his treatment of deferment errors. 
Finally, the Secretary notes that guaranty agency servicing is not relevant to the default rate calculation. A guaranty
agency does not begin to service a loan until it has already defaulted and, thus, its servicing does not affect the institution's
cohort default rate. 


Comment

: Some commenters proposed that the Secretary remove from the calculation of the cohort default rate loans on which
the lender did not request preclaims assistance from the guaranty agency or on which the agency did not provide notice
of the request to the institution. 


Response

: A lender's failure to request preclaims assistance could, in certain circumstances, be considered improper servicing
or collection if it would result in the loss of reinsurance on the principal of the loan based on the applicable rules
and policies and if the borrower defaulted due to lack of notification that the time for repayment had begun. 


Comment

: Some commenters suggested that an institution should remain eligible to participate in the FFEL program during
the appeal process. 


Response

: As provided in current regulations, an eligible institution that files and pursues an appeal in accordance with
the regulatory requirements will be able to continue to participate in the FFELP until and unless the Secretary issues
a decision determining that the institution's cohort default rates remain above the threshold limits.

Comment: 

Some commenters urged the Secretary to allow all institutions to challenge their default rates on the basis of improper
servicing or collection. 


Response: 

Section 435(a)(3) specifically allows only institutions with cohort default rates above certain threshold levels
to challenge their rate based on allegations of improper loan servicing. The Secretary believes that this limitation
was intentional and reasonable in light of the significant burdens placed on guaranty agencies and the Secretary
in reviewing challenges based on allegations of improper loan servicing or collection. 


Comment: 

Some commenters urged the Secretary to require institutions to provide evidence of improper loan servicing prior
to requesting access to loan servicing records. 


Response: 

The HEA does not require institutions to provide evidence of improper loan servicing or collection prior to filing
a challenge of its cohort default rates. 


Comment: 

Some commenters requested that institutions be required to submit a complete appeal before the guaranty agency is
required to meet the time deadlines required by the regulations. 


Response: 

These comments were based on the assumption by the commenters that the institution would be required to submit evidence
of improper loan servicing before the guaranty agency would be required to respond to the institution's appeal. Under
these regulations, the institution will only need to notify the guaranty agency that it is appealing the calculation
of the cohort default rate and provide a copy of the list of borrowers included in the calculation of the rate. Accordingly,
the Secretary believes it is unlikely that an institution will not submit a complete notification to the guaranty
agency. However, an institution which does not submit the notice and list to the guaranty agency as required by the
regulation may be barred from pursuing an appeal. 


Comment: 

Some commenters suggested that loans serviced by lenders or servicers who have been designated as exceptional performers
under section 428I of the HEA should not be included in any loans reviewed for improper servicing or collection on the
ground that these loans are presumed to be serviced or collected properly. 


Response: 

The Secretary does not believe that it is appropriate to exclude loans serviced by exceptional performers from the
process for determining appeals based on allegations of improper servicing or collection. The exceptional performer
designation is related only to the lender's receipt of payments from the guaranty agency. It should not be used to limit
the 
institution's opportunity to challenge the calculation of its cohort default rate. 


Comment: 

A number of commenters urged the Secretary to provide institutions more time to complete and submit appeals to the
guaranty agencies and the Secretary. 


Response: 

The Secretary believes that the regulations provide sufficient time for an institution to complete and submit appeals.
The Secretary believes that the regulations are consistent with the tight time constraints on the time period for
appeals included in the HEA. 


Comment: 

Some commenters recommended that the Secretary consider the quality of education provided by an institution in determining
whether an institution should be sanctioned based on its excessive default rates. 


Response: 

The statute sets forth specific grounds for challenges to an institution's cohort default rates. The quality of education
is not included as a basis for appeal of a default rate based on allegations of improper loan servicing or collection.
The Secretary notes, however, that institutions which are subject to the loss of FFEL Program participation under
section 435(a)(2) of the HEA may appeal on the grounds of exceptional mitigating circumstances as defined by the Secretary's
regulations. 


Comment: 

Some commenters recommended that the Secretary grant an institution's appeal if the guaranty agency does not provide
the 
servicing and collection records within the time set forth in the regulations. 


Response: 

The Secretary does not believe it is appropriate to automatically grant an institution's appeal if the guaranty agency
misses a deadline to provide records to the institution. In most cases, the institution continues to participate
in the program and is not harmed by a short delay. The Secretary believes that the guaranty agencies must take appropriate
steps to provide records within the regulatory time frames. However, in appropriate cases, the Secretary may consider
taking action to levy a financial penalty or limit, suspend or terminate a guaranty agency's participation in the
FFEL program based on violations of the regulatory time frames. 


Comment: 

One commenter recommended that loans which have been improperly serviced or collected be removed only from the numerator
of the calculation of the cohort default rate but not from the denominator. 


Response: 

The Secretary construes section 435(a)(3) to require that loans which are determined to have defaulted due to improper
loan servicing or collection be ``exclude[d]'' from the calculation of the cohort default rate entirely. 


Executive Order 12866 


The contents of this final rule have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the
order, the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of the procedures in this rule. 
The potential costs associated with the contents of this rule are those resulting from statutory requirements and
those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering the FFEL program effectively and efficiently.
In assessing the potential costs of these procedures, the Secretary has determined that the benefits of these procedures
justify the costs. 
The Secretary has also determined that the contents of this rule do not unduly interfere with State, local and tribal
governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. 
The contents of this rule are consistent with the requirements of the HEA and promote the President's priorities.

Sections 668.17 (f) and (h) contain information collection requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of these sections to the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) for its review. These regulations affect institutions of higher education and guaranty agencies that participate
in the Federal Family Education Loan Program. The Secretary needs the information to properly administer certain
aspects of that program. The collection and reporting burden for the 300 institutions which challenge the calculation
of their cohort default rates under these provisions is expected to increase by 15,600 hours. The collection and reporting
burden for the 46 guaranty agencies which must respond to the institutions' requests under these regulations is expected
to increase by 2,576 hours.

Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements should direct
them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington,
DC 20503; Attention: Daniel J. Chenok. Comments on the burden estimate must be received on or before May 31, 1994.




Invitation to Comment 



The Secretary recognizes that many participants in the FFEL program have an interest in these procedural rules. In
light of that interest, the Secretary is requesting comment on these rules. The Secretary will consider any comments
received within the designated comment period in determining whether to make any changes in these rules. After reviewing
any comments received during the comment period, the Secretary will publish changes to the regulation or will publish
a notice in the 

Federal Register

 indicating that no further changes will be made. 



Waiver of Rulemaking 



It is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties an opportunity to comment on proposed regulations.
However, the Secretary has determined that the public interest requires the immediate issuance of this interim final
rule. 

Under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. section 551, 

et seq.,

 procedural amendments to regulations do not require prior public notice and an opportunity for public comment. The
changes being made by this rule do not affect the substantive requirements or the underlying laws or rules; nor do they
modify or revoke existing rights or obligations, or create new ones. These regulations merely establish procedures
to implement the requirements of sections 435(a)(3) and 435(m)(1)(B) of the HEA. Therefore, public comment is not
required under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). 

In addition, the Secretary has determined that notice and comment is impracticable, unnecessary and contrary to
the public interest. The procedures included in these rules are needed to adjudicate appeals from the initial determinations
of cohort default rates for institutions. The Secretary is required by section 435(m)(4) of the HEA to publish cohort
default rates for each institution for which a rate is calculated at least every fiscal year. The cohort default rates
to be released for the current fiscal year are currently scheduled to be released during the summer of 1994. For the
appeal procedures to be in place prior to the release of the default rates, the procedures must be published by May 1,
1994. Moreover, the Secretary invited public comment on what the procedures should be and received and considered
the comments received in preparing this interim final rule. Accordingly, the Secretary has determined that public
comment on this interim final rule is not required under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B).

The Secretary amends part 668 of title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows: 
The authority citation for part 668 continues to read as follows:





Authority:

 20 U.S.C. 1085, 1088, 1091, 1092, 1094, 1099c and 1141, unless otherwise noted.

 

1. Section 668.17 is amended by adding paragraphs (f), (g) and (h) as follows: 


 668.17 

Default reduction measures. 


* * * * * 


(f) 

Appeal based on allegations of improper loan servicing or collection_

(1) 

General.

 An institution that is subject to loss of participation in the FFEL programs under paragraph (a)(1) of this section
or has been notified by the Secretary that its cohort default rate equals or exceeds 20 percent for the most recent year
for which data are available may include in its appeal of that loss or rate a challenge based on allegations of improper
loan servicing or collection. This challenge may be raised in addition to other challenges permitted under this section.

(2) 

Standard of review.

 An appeal based on allegations of improper loan servicing or collection must be submitted to the Secretary in accordance
with the requirements of this paragraph. The Secretary excludes any loans from the cohort default rate calculation
which, due to improper servicing or collection, would, as demonstrated by the evidence submitted in support of the
institution's complete and timely appeal to the Secretary, result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of
the cohort default rate. 
(3) 

Procedures.

 (i) The following procedures apply to appeals from cohort default rates issued by the Secretary during Federal fiscal
year 1994 and subsequent years. Upon receiving notice from the Secretary that the institution's cohort default rate
exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section or that its most recent cohort default rate equals
or exceeds 20 percent, the institution may appeal the calculation of the cohort default rate based on allegations
of improper loan servicing or collection. The Secretary's notice includes a list of all borrowers included in the
calculation of the institution's cohort default rate. 
(ii) To initiate an appeal under this paragraph, the institution must notify, in writing, each guaranty agency that
guaranteed loans included in the institution's cohort default rate that it is appealing the calculation of the cohort
default rate. The notification must be received by the guaranty agency within 10 working days of the date the institution
received the Secretary's notification. The institution's notification to the guaranty agency must include a copy
of the list of students provided by the Secretary to the institution. 
(iii) Within 15 working days of receiving the notification from the institution, the guaranty agency must provide
the institution with a representative sample of the loan servicing and collection records relating to borrowers
whose loans were guaranteed by the guaranty agency and that were included as defaulted loans in the calculation of
the institution's cohort default rate. In selecting the representative sample of records, the guaranty agency must
use the following procedures: 
(A) The guaranty agency shall list in social security number order all loans made to borrowers for attendance at the
institution and guaranteed by the guaranty agency and included as defaulted loans in the calculation of the cohort
default rate which is being challenged by the institution. 
(B) From the population of loans identified by the guaranty agency, the guaranty agency shall identify a sample of
the loans. The sample must be of a size such that the universe estimate derived from the sample is acceptable at a 95 percent
confidence level with a plus or minus 5 percent confidence interval. The sampling procedure must result in a determination
of the number of loans that should be excluded from the calculation of the cohort default rate under this paragraph.

(C) Once the sample of loans has been established, the guaranty agency shall provide a copy of all servicing and collection
records relating to each loan in the sample to the institution in hard copy format unless the guaranty agency and institution
agree that all or some of the records can be provided in another format. 
(D) The guaranty agency may charge the institution a reasonable fee for copying and providing the documents, not to
exceed $10 per borrower file. 
(E) After compiling the servicing and collection records for the loans in the sample, the guaranty agency shall send
the records, a list of the loans included in the sample, and a description of how the sample was chosen to the institution.
The guaranty agency shall also send a copy of the list of the loans included in the sample and the description of how the
sample was chosen to the Secretary at the same time the material is sent to the institution. The list of loans included
in the sample must include the following information: 
(

1

) The loans included in the sample listed in order by social security number; 
(

2

) For each loan listed, the last date of attendance, the date entered repayment, the date of the first payment missed
by the borrower and the default date listed in the guaranty agency's records. 
(iv) After receiving the relevant loan servicing and collection records from all of the guaranty agencies that insured
loans which are included in the cohort default rate calculation, the institution has 30 calendar days to file its appeal
with the Secretary. An appeal is considered filed when it is received by the Secretary. If the institution is also filing
an appeal under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, the institution may delay submitting its appeal under this paragraph
until the appeal under paragraph (d)(1)(i) is submitted to the Secretary. As part of the appeal, the institution must
submit the following information to the Secretary:

(A) A list of the loans which the institution alleges would, due to improper loan servicing or collection, result in
an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of the cohort default rate. 
(B) Copies of all of the loan servicing or collection records and any other evidence relating to a loan that the institution
believes has been subject to improper servicing or collection. The records must be in hard copy or microfiche format.

(C) An explanation of how the alleged improper servicing or collection resulted in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation
of the cohort default rate. 
(D) A summary of the institution's appeal, listing the number of loans insured by each guaranty agency that were included
in the calculation of the institution's cohort default rate, and the number of loans that would be excluded from the
calculation of that rate by application of the results of the review of the sample of loans provided to the institution
to the population of loans for each guaranty agency. 
(E) A certification by an authorized official of the institution that all information provided by the institution
in the appeal is true and correct. 
(v) The Secretary or his designee reviews the information submitted by the institution and issues a decision. 
(A) In making a decision under this paragraph the Secretary presumes that the information provided by the guaranty
agency is correct unless the institution provides substantial evidence showing that the information maintained
by the guaranty agency is not correct. 
(B) If the Secretary finds that the evidence presented by the institution shows that some of the loans included in the
sample of loan records reviewed by the institution should be excluded from calculation of the cohort default rate
under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the Secretary reduces the institution's cohort default rate, in accordance
with a statistically valid methodology, to reflect the percentage of defaulted loans in the sample that should be
excluded. 
(vi) The Secretary notifies the institution, in writing, of the decision. 
(vii) An institution may not seek judicial review of the Secretary's determination of the institution's cohort default
rates until the Secretary or his designee issues the decision under paragraph (f)(3)(v) of this section. 
(viii) For purposes of this paragraph a loan is considered to have been serviced or collected improperly only if, under
applicable rules, the Department would decline to pay reinsurance on the principal of the loan. 
(ix) For purposes of this paragraph, improper servicing or collection is considered to have caused a loan to default
for purposes of the calculation of the cohort default rate only if the improper servicing or collection resulted in
a failure to notify the borrower that he or she must begin repaying the loan.
(x) For cohort default rates issued by the Secretary for federal fiscal years from 1989 to 1991, the procedures in this
paragraph apply, except that the 10-day period for initiating an appeal with the guaranty agency starts on the effective
date of these regulations. 
(g) 

Effect of decision.

 An institution may challenge the calculation of a cohort default rate under this section no more than once. The Secretary's
determination of an institution's appeal of the calculation of a cohort default rate is binding on any future appeal
by the institution. An institution that fails to challenge the calculation of a cohort default rate under this section
within 10 working days of receiving notice of the determination of the cohort default rate is prohibited from challenging
that rate in any other proceeding before the Department. 
(h) 

Review of default rate data.

 Effective on October 1, 1994, an institution has an opportunity to review and correct the information provided to
the Secretary by the guaranty agencies for the purpose of calculating a cohort default rate on the loans to be included
in the calculation of the institution's cohort default rate before the final rate is calculated. 
(1) (i) Once the Secretary has received the information used in calculating the cohort default rates from the guaranty
agencies, the Secretary calculates draft cohort default rates for each institution. 
(ii) The Secretary sends all institutions with draft cohort default rates equal to or in excess of 20 percent a copy
of the information provided by the guaranty agencies in regard to loans included in the institution's cohort default
rate. 
(iii) An institution with a draft cohort default rate less than 20 percent will receive a notice of the draft default
rate and may request a copy of the information provided by the guaranty agencies within 10 working days of receiving
the notice from the Secretary. Upon receiving the request from the institution, the Secretary will send the institution
a copy of the information requested. The time frames provided in this paragraph will not start until the institution
receives or should have received the information from the Secretary. 
(2) Within 30 calendar days of receiving the default rate information from the Secretary, the institution must notify
the guaranty agency of any information included in the default rate data that it believes is incorrect. The institution
must also provide the guaranty agency with any evidence that it believes supports its contention that the default
rate data are incorrect. (3) Within 30 calendar days of receiving the institution's challenge under paragraph (h)(2)
of this section, the guaranty agency shall respond to the institution's challenge. The guaranty agency's response
must include a response to each allegation of error made by the institution and any evidence supporting the agency's
position. 
(4) The guaranty agency shall provide a copy of its response to the institution to the Secretary and identify any errors
in the information previously submitted to the Secretary. 
(5) The information used to calculate cohort default rates will be changed to reflect allegations of error made by
an institution and confirmed by the guaranty agency prior to releasing final cohort default rates. 
(6) The draft default rate issued by the Secretary under paragraph (h)(1) of this section may not be considered public
information and may not be otherwise voluntarily released by the Secretary or the guaranty agency. 
(7) An institution may not appeal a cohort default rate under paragraph (d)(1) of this section on the basis of any alleged
errors in the default rate information unless errors were identified by the institution in a challenge to its preliminary
default rate under paragraph (h) of this section.

Final regulations.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Secretary publishes final regulations to implement the State Postsecondary Review Program (SPRP) authorized
under title IV, part H, subpart 1 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). Under the SPRP, the Secretary
enters into an agreement with a State under which the State designates a State postsecondary review entry (SPRE) to
be responsible for conducting or coordinating reviews of institutions of higher education referred to the State
by the Secretary under specific statutory provisions. The purpose of the SPRE reviews is to determine whether those
institutions should continue to participate in the student financial assistance programs authorized under Title
IV of the HEA (Title IV, HEA programs). The SPRE reviews institutions on the basis of State standards developed in consultation
with institutions located in the State. The Secretary reimburses SPREs for costs they incur under the SPRP from appropriated
funds.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

These regulations implement the changes made to the HEA by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-325)
and the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-208).




On January 24, 1994 the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for this program in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 3604). The NPRM included a discussion of the major issues surrounding the proposed changes that will not be repeated
here. The following list summarizes those issues and identifies the pages of the preamble to the NPRM on which a discussion
of those issues may be found:

Statement of the scope and purpose of the SPRP (page 3606);

In order to approve a postsecondary education institution to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs and many other
Federal programs, the Secretary must determine, in part, that the institution satisfies the statutory definition
of an ``institution of higher education.'' Under the HEA, one element of that definition requires an eligible institution
of higher education to be accredited or preaccredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary as a reliable
authority as to the quality of the education or training provided by the institution. Another element requires an
eligible institution to be legally authorized to provide an education program beyond the secondary level in the State
in which it is located. In addition, to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, the institution must be certified
by the Secretary as administratively capable and financially responsible. Thus, the HEA provides the framework
for a shared responsibility among accrediting agencies, States, and the Federal government to ensure that the ``gate''
to Title IV, HEA programs is opened only to those institutions that provide students with quality education or training
worth the time, energy, and money they invest in it. The three ``gatekeepers'' sharing this responsibility have traditionally
been referred to as ``the triad.''

While the concept of a triad of entities responsible for gatekeeping has had a long history, originating in 1952, the
Higher Education Amendments of 1992, Pub. L. 102-325, significantly increased the gatekeeping responsibilities
of each member of the triad. Specifically, Congress amended the HEA to provide for a new part H of Title IV entitled ``Program
Integrity Triad.'' Under the new part H, the requirements that accrediting bodies must meet if they are to be recognized
by the Secretary as ``gatekeepers'' for Title IV are specified in detail. Part H also provides a new oversight responsibility
for States: the State Postsecondary Review Program. Altogether, part H establishes a set of responsibilities for
accrediting agencies, States, and the Secretary that creates a stronger and more coordinated evaluation of institutions
that participate, or wish to participate, in the Title IV, HEA programs.

The Secretary recognizes that the approach to significantly increased gatekeeping activity outlined in the statute
for the three members of the triad is a new one. This approach will require leadership in both implementation and evaluation
if it is to achieve the effectiveness that Congress intended. The Secretary will take steps to assure that the various
responsibilities of the triad members are carried out in a manner that, in fact, results in the identification of institutions
that should not be eligible to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, on the basis of either the quality of education
they offer or their inability to handle program funds. At the same time, the Secretary is committed to carrying out
the responsibility for coordinating the activities of the triad members that are inherent in the statute in a manner
that causes the least burden to institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs.

To these ends, the Secretary is committed to effective management of the gatekeeping function. The Secretary will
review carefully the applications on accrediting bodies and the standards and operating plans proposed by State
Postsecondary Review Entities (SPREs) under the State Postsecondary Review Program to insure that they meet the
requirements of the statute and these regulations and will enable these triad agencies to fulfill their statutory
purposes. The Secretary will also place a priority on the completion of the ``Postsecondary Education Participation
System,'' the Department's new integrated data base, which will contain the information that the Secretary generates
in the course of the Secretary's oversight of institutions participating in Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary
will use the data base to inform accrediting bodies and SPREs of actions taken by the Secretary so that they may in turn
carry out their responsibilities. This expanded data base is also critical to the Secretary's effective selection
of institutions for program review.

Monitoring the results of the gatekeeping process is a very important key to effective management. The Secretary
will evaluate the activities of accrediting agencies, SPREs, and the Department to determine their effectiveness
in improving the integrity of institutions participating in Title IV programs and will take such steps as may be indicated
to improve the results. Finally, as provided in the statute, the Secretary will seek the advice and counsel of the National
Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity in evaluating the effectiveness of the triad.

The Secretary believes that the approach best suited to achieving the objectives of the statute is a complementary
one, with each member of the triad focusing its evaluation on its obligations within the context of the HEA. Thus, the
focus for accrediting agencies is the quality of education or training provided by the institutions or programs they
accredit. States, in addition to providing the legal authority to operate within the state required for participation
in the Title IV, HEA programs, will review institutions that meet certain statutory review criteria related to institutional
performance in the Title IV, HEA programs. The focus of the Secretary's evaluation of institutions is on the administrative
and financial capacity of those institutions to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs.

While the functions and responsibilities of each of the triad members are generally different, the statute does require,
in some instances, that all members of the triad evaluate similar areas. For the most part, the principle of complementary
functions will lead to the members evaluating those same areas from different perspectives for different purposes.
For example, all three of the triad members are required to examine the finances of an institution. If each looks at
financial strength from a perspective complementary to that of the others, accrediting agencies would focus principally
on the capacity of the institution to continue to offer programs at a level of quality sufficient to meet accrediting
agency standards and to fulfill the institution's mission over a 5-10 year period of accreditation. The emphasis
of a review by a SPRE would be on whether or not the institution possesses the full range of resources needed to serve
students currently attending the institution. The Secretary's responsibilities focus on the institution's finance
in light of its ability to provide the services described in its official publications and statements, to provide
the administrative resources necessary to comply with its Title IV, HEA program responsibilities, and to meet all
of its financial obligations, including, but not limited to, refunds of institutional charges and repayments to
the Secretary for liabilities and debts incurred in programs administered by the Secretary.

Despite the Secretary's efforts to encourage complementary functions for each of the triad members, it is theoretically
possible that, in some instances, an institution could be subject to three different standards regulating the same
area of operation. For this reason, where a Title IV standard has been promulgated at the Federal level, the Secretary
expects accrediting agencies and States to take this into account in establishing their own standards to insure that
varying standards do not pose an unnecessary burden on institutions. It is also important that accrediting agencies
and States not impose any standard that is weaker than a comparable Title IV, HEA program standard. The Secretary believes
coordination of this is a federal responsibility.

In view of the complementary approach to the functions of the triad members, the Secretary believes, for example,
that institutions should not have to develop different methodologies to provide data that the three members of the
triad may require. The Secretary also believes that, to the extent feasible, any other requests for data about the
institution, its students, or its graduates should rely on information already in the institution's possession.
To that end, the Secretary expects accrediting agencies and States either to accept student data based on the methodology
that will be specified in the regulations governing ``Student Right to Know,'' also mandated by the Higher Education
Amendments of 1992, or, where the institution may have other methodologies for calculating data, such as a system
designed to provide data to a State higher education commission or other State agency, to accept data in the format
already being used by the institution. Similarly, the Secretary expects accrediting agencies and SPREs to use the
audited financial statements institutions are now required to provide to the Secretary on an annual basis to the extent
those statements are compatible with the nature of the reviews conducted under their respective standards.

The Secretary also recognizes that other Federal agencies, such as the Department of Labor and the Veterans Administration,
also regulate institutions in some areas that are similar to those included in part H. The suggestion has been made
that the Secretary should promulgate Federal standards in the areas of overlap so that institutions would not be subject
to varying standards developed by other Federal agencies and the triad members. However, the Secretary interprets
part H as permitting States and accrediting agencies to establish their own standards, as opposed to using a Federal
standard, and also believes that this is the most effective approach. In addition, it is not clear how the requirements
of the different agencies are capatible with the requirements of part H. The purposes of these programs administered
by other agencies may be very different. As a result, the Secretary has not pursued this alternative. The Secretary
does believe that it would be useful to explore how the varying requirements of other Federal agencies that are similar
to those of part H might be coordinated to reduce any burden on institutions and will initiate such exploration.

The Secretary believes that, where possible, data developed at the national level should be made available to institutions,
as well as to States and accrediting agencies to assist them in carrying out their responsibilities under part H. In
particular, data concerning labor markets and compensation for specific fields and information concerning graduation
and withdrawal rates at various types of institutions may be helpful to both triad members and institutions. The Secretary
will facilitate the development of this type of information and, where possible under the auspices of the Department,
will coordinate the development of data that will be helpful to institutions and the triad.

Finally, as part of the commitment to providing leadership to the triad, the Secretary will convene representatives
of the triad members and institutions to exchange information about the gatekeeping process and to discuss how the
triad is functioning, both in identifying institutions whose performance is questionable and in reporting requirements
that have proven to be unreasonably burdensome. The Secretary invites comments concerning the functioning of the
triad, as it is implemented through these and other regulations governed by part H. The Secretary will seek improvement,
where possible, within existing regulations and will propose modifications to regulations and to the statute itself
if experience indicates those changes are both necessary to achieve effective gatekeeping, with minimal burden,
and compatible with the need to maintain, and assure the public of, the integrity of the Title IV, HEA programs.

The following is a summary of the significant changes from the NPRM:



Section 667.1 Scope and purpose.

 Section 667.1(a)(1) has been revised to clarify that the purpose of the SPRP is to reduce fraud and abuse in the Title
IV, HEA programs. This section also has been revised to clarify that under the SPRP a State's standards apply only to
referred institutions and a State may review only referred institutions under those standards.



Section 667.2 Definitions.

 The proposed definition of 

professional program

 has been revised to maintain a clear distinction between the terms 

vocational program

 and 

professional program

 in view of the changes made to the definition of 

vocational program.

 A professional program is therefore an undergraduate or graduate educational program that prepares individuals
for an occupation, if that occupation (1) is listed in a Federal classification manual, (2) requires at least a bachelor's
degree to qualify for entry; (3) involves the independent practice or application of a defined or organized body of
competencies that is unique to the occupation; and (4) is formally recognized and regulated under a national or State
licensure, accreditation, or permit system. Also, the definition is expanded to allow a SPRE to use its State's statutory
definition of the term ``professional program.''

The proposed definition of 

vocational program

 has been revised to be consistent with that used in IPEDS. A vocational program is therefore defined as an educational
program that is below the bachelor's level and is designed to prepare individuals with skills and training for employment
in a specific trade, occupation, or profession related to that educational program.



Section 667.3 State agreement.

 Paragraph (b)(3) of this section has been revised to clarify the type of records that a SPRE must keep or have access
to, and the type of information that must be provided to the Secretary. Thus, paragraph (b)(3)(iii) has been revised
to indicate that a SPRE must keep or have access to records of referred institutions, related to activities under this
part, and must provide requested information to the Secretary for financial or compliance audits of referred institutions.
Paragraph (b)(3)(iv) has been added to indicate that the SPRE must keep or have access to records relating to its activities
under this part, and must provide such information to the Secretary upon request when the Secretary evaluates the
SPRE's performance under the SPRP.



Section 667.4 State postsecondary review entity.

 This section has been revised to make clear that the SPRP does not authorize a SPRE to (1) grant State authorization
to provide postsecondary education to an institution, or (2) require nonreferred institutions to comply with the
standards established under  667.21.



Section 667.5 Criteria the Secretary uses to refer institutions to a SPRE for review.

 The criterion in paragraph (b)(11) of this section has been revised to limit complaints the Secretary considers in
determining whether to refer an institution to a SPRE for review to student complaints. This section has also been
revised to allow an institution an opportunity to challenge the accuracy of the information that the Department uses
to refer the institution to a SPRE for review before the Department refers that institution to a SPRE.



Section 667.6 SPRE selection of institutions for review.

 This section has been revised to allow an institution that has not been referred by the Secretary an opportunity to
challenge the accuracy of the information that a SPRE uses to select the institution for review.



Section 667.8 Notice to nationally recognized accrediting agencies of SPRE actions.

 A new section is added to these final regulations to require a SPRE to notify the appropriate nationally recognized
accrediting agency before the SPRE conducts a review of an institution the agency accredits. The SPRE is also required
to notify that accrediting agency of significant and relevant decisions, reports, or actions taken as a result of
the review.

Section 667.21 State review standards.

 The standard requiring a State to evaluate whether the tuition and fees that are charged a student for an educational
program are reasonable given the expected amount of money that the student can earn upon completion of the program
is revised to apply only to vocational programs.



Section 667.23 SPRE reviews of referred institutions.

 Paragraph (d)(2) has been added to allow a SPRE, if an institution presents compelling evidence that its failure to
satisfy a SPRE standard does not warrant further SPRE action, to forego any further action.

This section has been revised to require a SPRE to make available information regarding its priority system for selecting
institutions to review.



Section 667.24 Peer reviews of institutions.

 This section has been revised to require a State to apply minimum, specified criteria to determine whether a peer review
system other than a nationally recognized accrediting agency has demonstrated competence in assessing educational
programs.



Section 667.26 Due process requirements.

 This section has been revised to require a State's due process procedures to specify a minimum time within which an
institution may appeal an adverse action, and to designate an impartial hearing official to consider certain appeals
by institutions.




Analysis of Comments and Changes



In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, approximately 1500 parties submitted comments on the proposed
regulations. An analysis of the comments and of the changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM is published
as an appendix to these final regulations. Substantive issues are discussed under the section of the regulations
to which they pertain.

Technical and other minor changes_and suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under the
applicable statutory authority_are not addressed.



Executive Order 12866



These final regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action.

The potential costs associated with the final regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those
determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens
specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, were identified in the preamble to the
NPRM under the heading 

Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.



Sections 667.3, 667.4, 667.8, 667.12, 667.15, 667.21, 667.22, and 667.26 contain information collection requirements.
As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of these sections
to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). These regulations contain records
that will affect States and State postsecondary review entities. An estimate of the total annual reporting and recordkeeping
burden that will result from the collection of the information is 2000 hours per response for 57 respondents for a total
burden of 114,000 burden hours for this package.

Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements should direct
them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington,
DC 20503; Attention: Daniel J. Chenok. Comments on this burden estimate should be submitted by May 31, 1994.



Assessment of Educational Impact



In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Secretary requested comments on whether the proposed regulations would
require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of
the United States.

Based on the response to the proposed rules and on its own review, the Department has determined that the regulations
in this document do not require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other
agency or authority of the United States.

the number of institutions located in that State that are certified to participate in a title IV, HEA program by the
total number of institutions that are certified to participate in all States;

(2) For the latest award year for which information is available, determining the percentage of title IV, HEA program
funds by dividing the total amount of title IV, HEA program funds that were made available to students who enrolled
in the institutions in that State that participate in a title IV, HEA program, or to those students' parents, by the
total amount of title IV, HEA program funds that were made available to students, or to those student's parents, who
enrolled in institutions that participate in a title IV, HEA program in all States;

(3) Averaging the two percentages determined in paragraph (b) (1) and (2) of this section;

(4) Calculating an ``initial distribution'' by multiplying the average percentage determined in paragraph (b)(3)
of this section by the amount appropriated to carry out this part, less the total amount allotted to Guam, American
Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands;

(5)(i) Determining which States receive less than $75,000 under the initial distribution;

(ii) Providing each of those States with $75,000; and 

(iii) Calculating the difference between the $75,000 provided to each of those States and those States' initial distribution;

(6)(i) Determining which States receive more than $75,000 under the initial distribution; and

(ii) Calculating the difference between each of those States' initial distribution and $75,000;

section by the total amount obtained in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section; and

(8) Reducing the initial distribution of each State in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section by the product of the amount
obtained in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section and the reduction percentage in paragraph (b)(7) of this section.

(c) If the Secretary determines that a SPRE will not spend its entire allotment during the period for which those funds
are made available, or if a SPRE does not spend its allotment by the end of the period for which those funds are made available,
the Secretary reallots those funds to other SPREs_

(1) For unanticipated and extraordinary legal expenses; or

(2) In a manner the Secretary determines best carries out the purposes of the State Postsecondary Review Program.

(d) Federal and State matching funds under the SSIG and NEISP programs are excluded from the calculations in this section.

State review standards.


(a) Each State participating under this part must develop standards, in consultation with institutions in the State,
under which the SPRE reviews referred institutions. The State-developed review standards must evaluate, with regard

requirements, course outlines, tuition-and-fee schedules, refund policy, course cancellation policy, rules
and regulations, and enrollment agreement, if appropriate;
(2) Whether the institution's descriptions of its courses and educational programs are accurate;
(3) Whether the institution has a method to assess that a student has the ability to complete successfully the educational
program for which he or she applies;
(4) Whether the institution maintains and enforces standards relating to satisfactory academic progress;
(5) Whether the institution maintains adequate student and other records;
(6) Whether the institution complies with relevant safety, and health standards, such as fire, building, and sanitation
codes;
(7) The extent to which the institution's financial and administrative capacity is appropriate to its scale of operations,
and whether the institution maintains adequate financial and other information to determine the adequacy of its
financial and administrative capacity;
(8) For an institution that the SPRE determines is at financial risk, the adequacy of the institution's plans to provide
for, if the institution closes_
(i) Instruction to enrolled students; and
(ii) Retention of and access to academic and financial aid records;
(9) If an institution provides a vocational program_
(i) Whether the tuition and fees charged for that vocational program are excessive given the amount of money that a
student who successfully completes the program may reasonably be expected to earn; and
(ii) Whether the vocational program provides students with quality training that leads to useful employment in an
occupation recognized in that State. In making this evaluation, one of the factors the SPRE shall consider is the appropriateness
of the length of the vocational program in terms of both the number of days of instruction and the number of credit or
clock hours the program offers;
(10) The extent to which the institution provides to its students relevant information regarding_
(i) Market and job availability for students in its occupational, professional, and vocational programs; and
(ii) The relationship between the institution's educational programs and State licensing standards for specific
occupations;

(13) Whether, and the extent to which, the actions of any owner or shareholder of the institution, or any person exercising
control over the institution may adversely affect its participation in a title IV, HEA program;
(14) The extent to which the institution's procedures for investigating and resolving student complaints are adequate;
(15) The extent to which the institution's advertising promotion, and student recruiting practices are appropriate;
(16) Whether the institution has a fair and equitable refund policy; and
(17) The extent to which the institution's educational programs are successful as measured by_
(i) The completion and graduation rates of the students enrolled in those programs, taking into account the length
of the programs and the selectivity of the institution's admission policy (for the purpose of this provision, a completion
rate is the same as a graduation rate);
(ii) The institution's withdrawal rate;
(iii) With respect to the institution's vocational and professional programs, the placement rate of the institution's
graduates in occupations related to their educational programs, with related programs and occupations determined
by reference to the 

NOICC Master Crosswalk

;
(iv) Where appropriate, the rate at which the institution's graduates pass licensure examinations; and
(v) The success of the institution's students who express other completion goals, such as transferring to another
institution, obtaining full-time employment in their field of study, or qualifying for military service, in meeting
those goals.
(b) In developing the review standards in paragraph (a) of this section, a State_
(1) May establish different standards for different types or categories of institutions or educational programs;
(2)(i) Shall specify the records and information that a referred institution would need to maintain to demonstrate
to a SPRE the institution's compliance with those standards; and
(ii) If a referred institution was not, before the institution was referred, otherwise required to keep records relating
to its compliance with State review standards, and did not keep those records, must allow the institution a reasonable
period of time to obtain those records to enable the institution to demonstrate its compliance with the State standards;
(3) Except for standards regarding prospective students in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, shall establish standards
that apply at least to all regular students;

be expected to earn;

(ii) Acceptable completion and graduation rates of students enrolled in educational programs offered by an institution;

(iii) An acceptable withdrawal rate of students at an institution;

(d)(1) The SPRE must give the institution an opportunity to respond to its findings and required actions; and

(2) The SPRE may determine, based on compelling evidence provided by the institution, that the institution's failure
to satisfy a State standard does not warrant any further action by the SPRE.

(e) If the institution chooses to respond to the SPRE's report within the time permitted by the SPRE, the SPRE must evaluate
the institution's response and issue a final report to the institution that includes its findings and required action.

(f)(1)(i) The SPRE must provide to the Secretary a copy of its final report to an institution within 30 days of its issuance
to the institution; or

(ii) If the institution did not respond to the SPRE's initial report by the date permitted by the SPRE, the SPRE must
provide to the Secretary a copy of its initial report. The SPRE's initial report becomes its final report on the day
after the date provided to the institution for responding to that report; and

(2) If the SPRE did not prescribe a course of action the institution must follow to correct a violation of the State's
standards under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the SPRE must include in its report to the Secretary an explanation
of why no action was prescribed.

(g) In addition to the reasons for initiating a proceeding to effect the termination an institution's participation
in a title IV, HEA program under paragraph (c) of this section, the SPRE may determine that the institution should no
longer participate in that title IV, HEA program if that institution_

(1) Does not respond to the SPRE's findings or comply with the SPRE's required actions within the time permitted by
the SPRE, and the SPRE's findings show violations of the State's standards;

(2) Does not allow SPRE personnel at the institution; or 

(3) Fails to provide SPRE officials with prompt access to its documents and records.

Termination of an institution's participation in the title IV, HEA programs.


(a)(1) If a SPRE determines that a referred institution should no longer participate in a title IV, HEA program, based
upon its review, because the institution is in violation of State standards, or based upon a report or review of that
institution by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or peer review system under  667.24, or has not complied
with the SPRE requirements such as those listed in  667.23(g), the SPRE must provide the institution with the
opportunity to contest that determination in accordance with procedures the Secretary has approved for that purpose
under  667.26.
(2) If the SPRE still concludes, after affording the institution the opportunity to challenge the SPRE's initial
determination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, that the institution should no longer continue to participate
in a title IV, HEA program, the SPRE notifies the Secretary of those findings and that determination.
(b)(1) Upon notice by the SPRE that the institution should no longer participate in a title IV, HEA program, the Secretary
immediately terminates that institution's participation in that program and notifies the institution, the SPRE,
and the appropriate accrediting agency of the effective date of that termination.

Appendix_Analysis of Comments and Changes



(

Note:

 This appendix will not be codified in the Code of Federal Regulations.)



General Comments



The Secretary received numerous comments about the overall impact of the proposed regulations. In general, commenters
opposed to the proposed reguations believed that the NPRM did not achieve the coordinated balance of responsibilities
among the triad members that it sought to achieve, and that it provided for extensive and duplicative data collection
and reporting requirements that created a costly and unnecessary burden on the entire higher education community.
Further, they believed that the regulations did not regulate ``narrowly to the law,'' as they purported to do. In general,
these commenters suggested that the Secretary should review each requirement in the proposed regulations to determine
if it was required by the statute and should further ensure that all requirements that meet this test and are included
in the final regulations are implemented in the most reasonable and cost effective manner. This, they believed, would
ensure the Department's compliance with Executive Order 12866.

Specifically, many commenters were concerned that:

(1) The proposed regulations will force institutions to engage in excessive and duplicative information gathering
and reporting, at considerable cost, with no net increase in the quantity or quality of information available to the
public, and will result in the diversion of institutions' already scarce resources away from their primary mission
of providing a quality education; and

(2) The proposed regulations threaten the diversity of American higher education and fail to focus oversight properly
on vocational institutions.

In addition, the Secretary received suggestions from several commenters that the Department should strongly encourage
all triad members to work together and adopt the same or similar language for the various standards, should collect
the necessary data through a common source such as readily available public information or IPEDS, and should use common
methodologies for various calculations such as completion or withdrawal rates.



Discussion:

 As suggested by several commenters, the Secretary has carefully reviewed each requirement in the proposed regulations
in light of statutory intent. The Secretary has also carefully considered both the burden of the proposed regulations
on institutions and SPREs, in terms of cost, duplication of effort, and the added recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
Similarly, the Secretary has considered the benefits of the proposed regulations, not just to institutions and SPREs
but to students and the general public as well. A particular concern of the Secretary has been how to ensure that the
regulations hold the three members of the triad accountable for the manner in which they fulfill their responsibilities
under the HEA yet still provide each member of the triad the flexibility to determine the appropriate means to carry
out those responsibilities.

The Secretary acknowledges that there is a potential risk with this strategy, however. By giving SPREs maximum flexibility
in these regulations, by giving accrediting agencies corresponding flexibility in the regulations for Secretary's
Procedures and Criteria for Recognition of Accrediting Agencies, and by retaining authority for the Secretary to
set specific requirements implementing the certification process, the danger exists that institutions will be
burdened with reporting requirements that are similar, but not identical, thus increasing not only the reporting
requirement but the recordkeeping requirement and cost as well. For this reason, the Secretary strongly urges a coordinated
approach to any reporting requirement that may be imposed on institutions by the regulations implementing the Program
Integrity Triad. Specifically with respect to States, the Secretary urges SPREs to impose reporting requirements
on referred institutions only after they carefully examine any publicly available information related to those
requirements, any similar reporting requirements imposed on institutions by either the Department or accrediting
agencies under the regulations governing the Secretary's Procedures and Criteria for Recognition of Accrediting
Agencies, and any methodologies currently used, or mandated for use, by institutions in calculating the required
information. The Secretary hopes that by bringing this potential risk of increased burden on institutions to the
attention of the entire higher education community_without specifically addressing it in regulation_the community
can work together to prevent undue burden at the same time it ensures proper accountability. The Secretary expects
to take a leadership role in implementing a coordinated strategy to manage the triad with the goal of maximizing effectiveness
while minimizing burden, duplication, and inconsistencies among SPREs, accrediting agencies, and the Department.

The discussion that follows addresses the commenters concerns and the Secretary's response to those concerns.



Section 667.1 Scope and Purpose





Comments:

 Many commenters interpreted this section as applying State oversight to all institutions in a State. As a result,
these commenters believed that the Secretary expanded the SPRP beyond that authorized in the statute. The commenters
believed that the NPRM's stated purpose of the program, ``to strengthen State oversight of institutions participating
in the title IV, HEA programs through development of State standards for those institutions,'' was inaccurate and
``unduly alarming'' because it suggested that a SPRE was authorized to establish review standards for all institutions
in a State. Many of these commenters believed the primary purpose of the program was to reduce fraud and abuse in the
title IV, HEA programs through State oversight of selected institutions. Many other commenters believed that Congress
intended the program to focus exclusively on ``problem institutions'' identified by the Secretary, i.e., those
institutions that have serious academic or financial problems or those institutions that have otherwise failed
to fulfill their fiduciary responsibilities in administering the title IV, HEA programs.



Discussion:

 The Secretary notes that  667.1, as proposed, was not intended to apply to all institutions in a State but only
to institutions in a State that were participating in the title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary agrees that a SPRE only
has authority to review ``referred institutions'' under the standards it develops under this program, and therefore
agrees that the provisions of  667.1(a) could be viewed as overbroad. The Secretary also agrees that a primary
purpose of the SPRP is to reduce fraud and abuse in the title IV, HEA programs.


Changes:

 Section 667.1(a)(1) has been revised to clarify the purpose of the SPRP, and to clarify that under the SPRP a State's
standards apply only to referred institutions and that a State may review only referred institutions under those
standards.

<DOCNO> FR940429-0-00109 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 



Comments: 

One commenter urged the Secretary to indicate that a SPRE could take an action against an entire institution or one
of the institution's branch campuses, additional locations, or educational programs. The commenter believed there
would be instances where a SPRE could determine that a branch campus or an additional location of the institution,
but not the entire institution, should be terminated from the title IV, HEA programs. The commenter also noted that
several of the State's standards apply only to specific educational programs and argued that it could be inappropriate
for a SPRE to take an adverse action against the entire institution if the basis for that action was a finding directly
related to a specific educational program offered by that institution.



Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees that a SPRE has flexibility under the SPRP to craft a remedy along the lines suggested by the commenter.
Thus, the SPRE can require an institution to stop offering a particular program or stop offering programs at particular
locations or branch campuses. However, the Secretary believes that the authority of a SPRE under section 494C(h)
of the HEA to determine that an institution should no longer participate in the title IV, HEA programs relates to terminating
the institution as a whole, not to particular parts of the institution.



Changes: 

None.



Section 667.2 Definitions



Education and General Expenditures





Comments: 

One commenter recommended that instead of using the statutory definition of 

education and general expenditures, 

used for purposes of Title III of the HEA, which governs the Strengthening Institutions Program, the Secretary adopt
the definition used by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. In addition, the commenter noted
that two financial-standard-making bodies have issued or have under consideration changes that will modify the
current accounting and reporting standards. The commenter suggested that the final regulations refer only to current
generally accepted accounting principles and financial reporting requirements by source rather than provide a
specific definition of education and general expenditures.



Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that it is most appropriate to use a definition of education and general expenditures for this
program that is already included in the HEA.



Changes: 

None.



Professional Program





Comments: 

Several commenters agreed with the proposed definition of professional program.

Several other commenters argued that professional education is placed in the same category as occupational and vocational
education with regard to the standards described in sections 494C (d)(8) and (d)(14)(C) of the HEA. The commenters
contended that the use of professional education in this context implies a limited use of the term; namely, one that
is closely related to vocational education. These commenters suggested that the proposed definition of 

professional program

 be modified to include only programs at or below the associate degree level.

Several commenters suggested adopting the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) definition
of 

first professional degree

 to ensure compatibility with data collected at the Federal level.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940429-0-00110 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940429-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

One commenter writing on behalf of a SPRE noted that 

professional programs 

are defined and governed under the State's education and judiciary Laws. The commenter urged that the definition
of 

professional program 

recognize a State's statutory definition as provided under section 494C(d) of the HEA. (That section of the HEA requires
a State to develop standards that are consistent with the constitution and laws of the State.)


Discussion: 

Secretary disagrees with those commenters that suggest that the term 

professional program 

be limited to programs at or below the associate degree level. The term 

professional program 

is commonly accepted as encompassing programs at higher degree levels.
The Secretary agrees with the commenter that the proposed definition of 

professional program 

be modified to recognize State law.
The Secretary believes that the IPEDS definition of 

first professional degree

 is too narrow. Under that definition, the term 

profession program

 would encompass only 10 fields of study. However, the Secretary also agrees that the proposed definition was overly
broad in that it permitted overlap between what constitutes professional education and what constitutes vocational
education. The final regulations need to make the distinctions between both types of education clear. See also the
discussion of 

vocational program.
Changes: 

The Secretary has revised the second element of the proposed definition to maintain a clear distinction between the
terms 

vocational program 

and 

professional program. 

Thus, a 

professional program 

is an educational program that prepares individuals for an occupation, if that occupation requires, in part, at least
a bachelor's degree to qualify for entry. Also, the definition is expanded to allow a SPRE to use a State's statutory
definition of the term 

professional program.


Vocational Program


Comments: 

All commenters agreed that the definition of the term 

vocational program 

under the SPRP be the same as the definition of 

vocational education 

under the 

Accreditation 

regulations, 34 CFR part 602. Several commenters agreed with the proposed definition of a 

vocational program. 

Most of these commenters preferred the SPRP definition to that proposed in the accreditation NPRM.
Many commenters writing on behalf of community colleges and universities believed the proposed definition of 

vocational program 

was too broad. Many of these commenters believed strongly that proprietary institutions were primarily responsible
for abuses in the title IV, HEA programs, and it was unfair to classify associate degree programs as vocational programs
or to include any degree programs offered by community colleges or universities within the scope and meaning of the
term 

vocational program.
Many commenters writing on behalf of proprietary and vocational institutions believed strongly that the proposed
definition was too narrow. These commenters noted that most postsecondary educational programs are employment
or career oriented and that students who enroll in those programs should be treated equally, regardless of the institution
they chose to attend. These commenters believe that the term vocational program 

should include all undergraduate programs.
One commenter agreed with the propositions that the commenter claimed were presented in the accreditation NPRM that
(1) every postsecondary educational program is technically vocational, and (2) while all programs may be vocational
in nature, not all programs are academic. This commenter suggested that a better case be made for classifying programs
as ``academic'' or ``nonacademic.'' Under this approach, the term 

vocational program 

would be replaced by the term 

nonacademic program

 and the term 

academic program

 would be defined to include any program described under proposed 34 CFR 668.8(c) (1) and (2), that (1) a program of at
least two academic years in length that provides an associate degree, a bachelor's degree, a professional degree,
or an equivalent degree as determined by the Secretary, or (2) a program in which each course is acceptable for full
credit toward that institution's associate degree, bachelor's degree, professional degree, or equivalent degree
as determined by the Secretary, provided that the institution's degree requires at least two academic years of study.
Many commenters believed that the proposed definition was too vague. Several of these commenters suggested adopting
the definition of an ``occupationally specific program,'' as that term is defined in the CIP and used under IPEDS.
These commenters noted that the National Center for Education Statistics and other Federal agencies use this definition
to obtain data from institutions through IPEDS for research and other purposes.


Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees with the commenters that the definition of 

vocational program

 in this part should be the same as the definition of 

vocational education 

in the accreditation regulations, 34 CFR part 602.
The Secretary further agrees with those commenters that suggested that the IPEDS/CIP definition, with minor modifications,
is the most appropriate definition to use in this part and in the accreditation regulations because under that definition,
educational programs are classified in a manner that is congruent with various SPRP statutory provisions that require
a clear identification and reporting of educational programs offered by an institution that are occupationally
specific and employment related. 

See,

 for example, the standards described under section 494C(d)(7) of the HEA, ``If the stated objectives of the courses
or programs of the institution are to prepare students for employment * * *;'' section 494C(d)(8)
of the HEA, ``Availability to students of relevant information by institutions of higher education, including * * *
information related to market and job availability for students in occupational, professional, and vocational
programs; and * * * information regarding the relationship of courses to specific standards necessary
for State licensure in specific occupations;'' and section 494C(d)(14)(C) of the HEA, ``The success of the program
at the institution, including * * * with respect to vocational and professional programs, the rates
of placement of the institution's graduates in occupations related to their course of study.''
The Secretary disagrees with the commenter who suggested classifying programs as ``academic'' and ``nonacademic,''
because the Secretary disagrees with the commenter's premise that all vocational programs are ``nonacademic''
programs.
The Secretary disagrees with those commenters who suggest that the term 

vocational program 

excludes in some manner degree programs offered by colleges and universities. The statute does not exempt types of
institutions; rather, as noted above, the statute clearly speaks in terms of vocational programs offered at institutions.

Changes:

 A vocational program is defined as ``an educational program, below the bachelor's level, designed to prepare individuals
with skills and training required for employment in a specific trade, occupation, or profession related to the educational
program.'' The Secretary notes that this definition is operationally consistent with the IPEDS/CIP definition
of an ``occupationally specific program.''



Section 667.3 State Agreement





Comments:

 Several commenters suggested that the Secretary specify more clearly when sanctions would be imposed on a State that
failed to establish review standards. These commenters recommended that the Secretary impose sanctions on a State
that failed to establish review standards by the end of the second year. However, these commenters suggested different
time periods for measuring the end of that second year. These suggestions included using the Federal fiscal year,
the State fiscal year, the calendar year, and the planning year.



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees to be more specific in these regulations with regard to when sanctions will fall on a State that
fails to establish review standards. Because the Secretary encourages all States to participate in the program,
the Secretary has chosen a deadline date for sanctions that should enable all States to avoid that sanction.



Changes:

 Section 667.3(d)(4) has been revised to provide that a State will have until December 31, 1995 to submit State review
standards that are subsequently approved by the Secretary if the State received fiscal year 1993 funds to carry out
SPRP activities, and until December 31, 1996 to submit those standards if the State that did not receive fiscal year
1993 funds to carry out SPRP activities. The deadline date for imposing sanctions has been changed from the date on
which standards are approved to the date on which approvable standards are submitted to the Secretary for approval.



Comments:

 Several commenters writing on behalf of SPREs argued that the Secretary should not impose sanctions on a State that
failed to establish review standards within two years if the reason for exceeding the proposed two-year limit was
due to (1) a State requirement to codify those standards in State regulations, or (2) a condition beyond the control
of the SPRE.



Discussion:

 The Secretary disagrees that codifying standards in State regulations is a valid reason for not imposing sanctions
on a State that fails to establish review standards. Under  667.12(a)(2), a State establishes review standards
if those standards meet the requirements in  667.21 and the Secretary does not approve those standards under
 667.22. This process of establishing standards is distinct from the process a SPRE may need to follow to codify
standards in State regulations. Accordingly, a SPRE may submit the State's standards to the Secretary for evaluation
while simultaneously beginning the process to codify those standards in State regulations as long as the State coordinates
the two processes.

Moreover, as noted above, the Secretary has extended the deadline date for submitting approved standards to the Secretary.
Therefore, the Secretary believes that no State codification process should prevent a State from submitting its
standards in a timely manner. Similarly the Secretary believes that a State should be able to meet that deadline regardless
of conditions outside its control.



Changes:

 None.



Comments:

 Several commenters were concerned that the provision in proposed  667.3(b)(3)(iii) that stated that ``the
SPRE will keep records or have access to records * * *'' implied that the SPRE had the authority to (1)
require nonreferred institutions to submit financial and standards-related information to the SPRE, and (2) gain
access to the records of nonreferred institutions without first obtaining authorization from those institutions
for that access.



Discussion:

 It is not the Secretary's intention that a SPRE generally have records or access to records of nonreferred institutions,
and the Secretary agrees to clarify this point.



Changes:

 Section 667.3(b)(3)(iii) is revised to require State assurance that a SPRE will keep records or have access to records
of referred institutions, and will provide requested information to the Secretary for purposes of financial and
compliance audits of referred institutions. A new  667.3(b)(3)(iv) is added to require State assurance that
SPRE will keep records or have access to records, related to its activities under this part, and will provide requested
information to the Secretary, for purposes of program evaluations of the manner in which the SPRE carries out its SPRP
responsibilities.



Comments;

 A few commenters suggested that the proposal to include in the State's agreement with the Secretary a description
of the SPRE's relationship with State-level entities be removed on the grounds that it would unnecessarily divert
SPRE resources.



Discussion:

 The Secretary disagrees that such relationships would unnecessarily divert SPRE resources. To the contrary, the
Secretary believes strongly that to carry out effectively the purposes of this part, a SPRE must avail itself of relevant
information regarding the actions that any State agency takes or plans to take with regard to a referred institution
in the State. 



Changes:

 None.



Comments:

 Many commenters acknowledged that the statute requires a SPRE to review referred institutions on a schedule that
coincides with the Secretary's schedule for recertifying institutions. Several commenters urged the Secretary
to require a SPRE to review only those institutions that represent the highest risk for fraud and abuse. A number of
other commenters suggested that the SPRE develop additional priorities for the review of this set of institutions
that would be compatible with the Secretary's schedule for recertifying these institutions.



Discussion:

 The Secretary acknowledges that a SPRE's allotment of funds may be inadequate to review all referred institutions
on a schedule that coincides with the Secretary's schedule for recertifying institutions. For that reason, the Secretary
proposed in  667.12(c) and restates in that same section in these regulations, to allow a State to establish
review priorities, giving States discretion to establish their own priorities, subject to the requirement for coordinating
with the Secretary's schedule for recertification of institutions. The Secretary expects that, to the extent possible,
States will select ``high-risk'' institutions for review.



Changes:

 None.

Section 667.4 State Postsecondary Review Entity




Comments:

 Many commenters believed strongly that this section of the regulations be amended to reflect unambiguously the NPRM
preamble discussion that a SPRE merely represents certain State entities.


Discussion:

 Under section 494A(b)(1) of the HEA, the SPRE must represent any State entity that is responsible for (1) providing
the legal authorizations to institutions to operate in the State, for the purposes of 1201 of the HEA, and (2) ensuring
that each institution in the State remains in compliance with the State's review standards developed pursuant to
section 494C of the HEA. The Secretary simply repeated these statutory provisions in proposed  667.4. In the
NPRM preamble, the Secretary indicated that these statutory provisions did not give a SPRE itself authority under
this part to provide licenses to or legally authorize institutions to operate in a State, or ensure that all institutions
in the State remain in compliance with the State's standards. The Secretary agrees to accommodate the commenters
by including these statements in the regulations.


Changes:

 Section 667.4(b) has been revised to indicate that under the SPRP, a SPRE is not authorized by the SPRP to (1) grant State
authorization to provide postsecondary education in that State, or (2) require a nonreferred institution to comply
with State review standards established under  667.21.


Section 667.5 Criteria the Secretary Uses To Refer Institutions to a SPRE for Review




Comments:

 Many commenters objected strongly to the proposed procedures regarding the confirmation of the data used by the Secretary
to refer an institution to a SPRE for review. These commenters urged the Secretary to discard those procedures and
establish new procedures under which a referred institution would be provided an opportunity to challenge the referral
data before the Secretary referred that institution to a SPRE. Under the suggested procedures, the Secretary would
not refer an institution to a SPRE if that institution challenged the referral data within the time permitted by the
Secretary. The Secretary would only refer an institution to a SPRE if the institution did not challenge the referral
data or the Secretary confirmed the challenged referral data.


Discussion:

 Based on public comment and further review, the Secretary agrees with the commenters that an institution should be
given an opportunity to challenge the accuracy of referral data before the Secretary refers that institution to a
SPRE for review. Similarly, the Secretary agrees with the commenters that an institution should be given an opportunity
to challenge the accuracy of referral data before a State notifies the Secretary that it wishes to review an institution
on the basis of having more current information that the institution satisfies one or more of the referral criteria.
If an institution challenges the information on which the Secretary or the State based its referral, the Secretary
and the State presume that records maintained in the normal course of business by ED, a guaranty agency under the FFEL
programs, a SPRE, a State licensing agency, or another State agency are accurate unless the institution proves to
the Secretary's satisfaction that the records are not properly maintained or are inaccurate. Thus, unless an institution
can prove that the information on which its referral is based is inaccurate, the institution will be referred for SPRE
review.


Changes:

 Section 667.5 has been revised to allow an institution to challenge the accuracy of referral data before the Secretary
refers that institution to a SPRE.


Comments:

 With respect to the  667.5(b)(11), under which the Secretary refers an institution that has been subject to
a pattern of complaints, several commenters urged the Secretary to remove references to complaints from faculty,
or persons other than students. These commenters argued that the statute requires the Secretary to consider only
complaints from students. In addition, some commenters contended that statute does not authorize the Secretary
to use complaint information collected by the SPRE for referral purposes.


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenters regarding references to complaints from ``faculty, or others.'' Under
section 494C(b)(11) of the HEA, the referral criterion makes specific reference to the complaint system a State is
to develop.

The Secretary believes that the most appropriate entity to provide to the Secretary information about a pattern of
the complaints is the SPRE.



Changes:

 The Secretary has limited consideration of a pattern of complaints as a basis for referrals under  667.5(b)(11)
to a pattern of student complaints.



Comments:

 A number of commenters agreed that it would be wasteful continually to refer an institution to a SPRE for review for
an event that happened once. In the NPRM, the Secretary proposed to reserve for future consideration whether to refer
an institution to a SPRE for review under three criteria if on the basis of an earlier referral, the SPRE conducted a
review of the institution and made no significant findings. These criteria were those relating to late audits, changes
of ownership, and the first five years of participating in a title IV, HEA program. These commenters also suggested
that this consideration ought to be given to more or all of the referral criteria.



Discussion:

 The Secretary attempted to resolve this problem by proposing remedies through legislation. However, in the Higher
Education Technical Amendments of 1993, Public Law 103-208, only one of the three subject criteria, the criterion
set forth in  667.5(b)(10) was addressed. With regard to that criterion, an institution participating for
less than five years in a title IV, HEA program must be referred to a SPRE, but the Secretary may determine that the SPRE
need not review the institution if the institution was referred solely under  667.5(b)(10), and the SPRE previously
conducted a review of that institution and found no violations of the State's standards. For the other two criteria,
the Secretary believes that section 494C(b) of the HEA requires the Secretary to refer institutions that meet those
other two requirements. However, to avoid wasting a SPRE's time and effort, the Secretary will allow a SPRE to place
institutions on the lowest review priority if the institutions were referred because of a late audit or a change in
ownership and a previous SPRE review found no significant violations of State standards.



Changes:

 Section 667.23(a)(2) is changed to provide that the Secretary may determine that a SPRE need not review an institution
that was referred only because it meets  667.5(b)(10), if the SPRE previously conducted a review of that institution
and found no violations of the State's standards. In addition, a new  667.12(c)(3)(ii) is added to permit a SPRE
to place an institution in the lowest priority for review if the institution was referred because of a late audit or
a change in ownership and a previous SPRE found no significant violations of State standards.



Comments: 

A few commenters noted that the Secretary did not have complete data pertaining to several of the referral criteria
and were concerned that the Secretary would nevertheless refer institutions to a SPRE based on this incomplete data
or on assumptions regarding this data.



Discussion:

 The Secretary acknowledges that complete data for all the referral criteria are not available. However the Secretary
assures commenters that no referral will be made based on assumptions or incomplete data.



Changes:

 None.



Comments:

 Several commenters noted that the Secretary sometimes withdraws an action to limit, suspend, or terminate an institution's
participation in a title IV, HEA program because the Secretary concludes retrospectively that such an action was
not warranted. Therefore, these commenters argued that the proposed language for this referral criterion be modified
to reflect that the Secretary would not refer an institution subject to limitation, suspension, or termination until
the Secretary completes that action.



Discussion:

 If the Secretary withdraws a limitation, suspension, or termination action solely because the Secretary determines
that there was no factual basis for that action, the Secretary will not consider that action as triggering a referral.
However, if the Secretary withdraws a limitation, suspension, or termination action against an institution because
of an action on the part of the institution, or the promise of some current or future action on the part of the institution,
the initiation of the Secretary's action will trigger a referral.



Changes:

 None.



Section 667.6 SPRE Selection of Institutions for Review





Comments:

 Many commenters were concerned about the SPRE's authority under the statute to select an institution for review if
the SPRE had ``reason to believe'' that the institution was engaged in fraudulent practices. Some of these commenters
believed that SPREs would abuse this authority by using it as the basis to review any institution. A number of commenters
believed strongly that the regulations should clarify what is meant by the phrase ``reason to believe'' and define
the term ``fraud.''



Discussion:

 The Secretary disagrees with the commenters that SPREs would abuse the statutory authority that allows SPREs to review
institutions that they have reason to believe are engaged in fraudulent practices.

With regard to a definition of fraud, in general, fraud involves intentional misconduct to obtain a benefit.



Changes:

 None.



Comments:

 Many commenters believed that an institution selected by the SPRE on the basis of ``more recent data'' should be afforded
the opportunity to challenge that data before the SPRE may conduct a review of that institution. In addition, several
commenters urged that institutions selected by the State for review under proposed  667.6 should be afforded
the opportunity to challenge the State's data. A few of these commenters believed that the confirmation procedures
should be waived in cases where the State has reason to believe that institutions were engaged in fraudulent practices.



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees based on the reasons in the discussion under  667.5.



Changes:

 A change has been made similar to the change in  667.5.

Section 667.7 Notice to SPRE of Federal Actions; and  667.8 Notice to Nationally Recognized Accrediting
Agency of SPRE Actions




Comments:

 A number of commenters believed that the Secretary should shorten the time period proposed in the NPRM for notifying
SPREs of Federal actions. Several of these commenters suggested shortening the time period to 5 days, while others
suggested notification within 48 hours in cases where the Secretary intended to terminate an institution's participation
in a title IV, HEA program.
A few commenters suggested that the Secretary notify the SPRE in writing of the applicable action.
Several commenters suggested that the Secretary make clear that an action includes a limitation, suspension, or
termination proceeding.
A number of commenters urged the Secretary to (1) provide to accrediting agencies the same information provided to
SPREs, and (2) require States to provide to accrediting agencies information regarding SPRE reviews of referred
institutions.


Discussion:

 The Secretary proposed 10 days in the NPRM because in some instances the Secretary may need to confirm information
before providing it to a SPRE. The Secretary agrees that accrediting agencies should also be notified by the Secretary
and by SPREs. Accordingly, the Secretary (1) intends to notify SPREs and accrediting agencies of Federal actions
as soon as possible and provide this notification orally in writing, and (2) will require States to notify accrediting
agencies of SPRE actions. The Secretary further agrees to include as Federal actions those identified by the commenters.


Changes:

 Section 667.7 is revised to describe an action taken by the Secretary against an institution as one that includes a
limitation, suspension, or termination proceeding. A new  667.8 is added to require SPREs to notify appropriate
accrediting agencies of SPRE reviews of referred institutions and SPRE findings and planned and actual corrective
actions. This section is also revised to provide that the Secretary notifies the appropriate nationally recognized
accrediting agency of actions taken by the Secretary or another Federal agency against an institution.


Section 667.9 Institutions With Locations in More Than One State




Comments:

 Many commenters objected to the proposed requirement that an institution's branch campuses or additional locations
be subject to the standards of the State in which those branch campuses or additional locations are located. These
commenters believed strongly that an institution's branch campuses and additional locations be subject only to
the standards of the State in which the main campus of that institution is located. The commenters argued that it is
unreasonable and burdensome to require an institution's branch campuses and locations to comply with different
State standards.

Discussion:

 The Secretary disagrees with the commenters. This provision is consistent with the requirements that an institution
must satisfy to obtain institutional eligibility under the HEA for locations or branch campuses in States different
from the main campus. For institutional eligibility purposes, the institution must obtain a license or other legal
authority to provide postsecondary education at the branch campus or additional location from the State in which
the branch campus or other location is physically located, not the Senate in which the main location is physically
located.



Changes:

 None.



Section 667.11 Allotment Formula





Comments:

 Two commenters writing on behalf of States that would receive the minimum allotment under the proposed formula believed
strongly that a SPRE could not conduct reviews of referred institutions and carry out its other responsibilities
under this part within that allotment. One of these commenters suggested the minimum allotment be increased from
$50,000 to $75,000. The other commenter contended that a SPRE's actual costs in carrying out its responsibilities
would be five to ten times the proposed minimum amount.

A few commenters writing on behalf of States were concerned that unanticipated and extraordinary expenses a SPRE
could incur as a result of a legal challenge from a referred institution to the SPRE's determination that the institution
should no longer participate in the title IV, HEA programs, could prevent the SPRE from carrying out its planned activities
under this part. These commenters suggested that the final regulations provide for an appeal to the Secretary by the
SPRE for additional funds to meet those legal costs and unanticipated and extraordinary expenses.



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenters that the proposed minimum allotments were too low and has raised that minimum,
as suggested by one of the commenters, from $50,000 to $75,000. The Secretary also raised the minimum allotment from
$20,000 to $30,000 for Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, and the Trust Territory
of the Pacific Islands.

The Secretary also agrees with the commenters that a SPRE should be allowed to petition the Secretary for additional
funds for unanticipated and extraordinary legal expenses. The Secretary use funds available for reallotment for
this purpose.



Changes:

 The formula in  667 is revised to provide an allotment of $30,000 each to Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana
Islands, the Virgin Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and to provide a minimum allotment of
$75,000 to each of the other States. This section has also been revised to provide that funds available for reallotment
may be used to pay for a SPRE's unanticipated and extraordinary legal expenses.



Comments:

 Several commenters writing on behalf of States disagreed with the proposed provision under which the Secretary would
reallot, to other SPREs, funds not spent by a SPRE by the end of the period for which those funds were made available.
These commenters suggested that a SPRE be allowed to carry over to the next allotment period any unspent funds from
the current allotment period if the SPRE could demonstrate that it was making progress in carrying out allowable activities.



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that funds allotted to a State for a specific period be spent by the SPRE during that period.
If a SPRE cannot spend its allotment for that period, the Secretary believes that those funds are best used by carrying
out SPRP activities during that period through reallotment to other States.



Changes:

 None.



Section 667.12 Application for Funds





Comments:

 A few commenters writing on behalf of States noted that it would be wasteful to require a SPRE to prepare and submit on
two different occasions plans and budgets to receive its entire allotment for a fiscal year if the SPRE was unable to
complete the development of review standards during the previous fiscal year for which it received an allotment.



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the comments but points out that while this procedure can be modified, under  667.3
a State must have submitted by December 31, 1995 or, in some instances, December 31, 1996, standards that can be approved
by the Secretary.



Changes:

 Proposed  667.12(d) is revised to allow any SPRE that did not complete development of review standards to submit
simultaneously in its application for funds a plan and budget to complete developing review standards and a plan and
budget to review referred institutions.



Comments:

 A commenter writing on behalf of a number of associations suggested that each State should be required to submit a plan,
not only to develop the review standards and complaint procedures, but also to identify information maintained by
institutions and State agencies that is relevant to the development the State review standards. Additionally, the
commenter suggested that the plan should also include the costs of coordinating information systems and should identify
information not currently collected that is needed to demonstrate compliance with review standards. The commenter
recommended that the proposed regulations be revised to require a State to provide the estimated total cost to develop
the SPRE's information system if the total cost exceeds the State's fiscal year 1993 allotment. The commenter also
suggested that a State be required to provide the total estimated cost to review all referred institutions even if
the total estimated cost of reviews exceeds the State's allotment. The commenter believes these costs are among those
that President Clinton's Executive Order 12866 requires the Secretary to identify and consider in determining,
when developing regulations, the costs and benefits of collecting and maintaining regulatory information.



Discussion:

 The Secretary disagrees with the commenter. The statute governing the SPRP does not require a SPRE to perform the activities
suggested by the commenter, and the Secretary believes that SPREs should not be forced to engage in those activities.

The Secretary considers these regulations to satisfy section 1(b)(6) of Executive Order 12866 that requires each
agency to assess both the costs and benefits of the intended regulations. The Secretary further believes that it is
unnecessary to require a State to provide the estimated costs to carry out any functions of the SPRP that exceed the
State's allotment since the SPRE is not required to perform functions in excess of that allotment.



Changes:

 None.



Comments:

 One commenter was concerned that a student or other party may try to hold a SPRE liable for alleged harm based on his or
her reliance on an institution's continued eligibility for title IV, HEA program funds in a case where the institution
is referred to a SPRE because the SPRE did not have sufficient funds to conduct that review. The commenter suggested
that a provision preventing any liability from falling on the SPRE for failing to review an institution because of
inadequate funding be added to the regulations.



Discussion:

 While nothing can prevent a person from suing a SPRE for the reasons cited by the commenter, in the Secretary's view,
there would be no legal basis for charging a SPRE with any liability under the facts described by the commenter.



Changes:

 None.

Comments:

 Most commenters agreed with the Secretary that the SPRE's review priorities should reflect the objectives of protecting
students, saving tax dollars, and promoting educational quality, but differed on the methods to best accomplish
those objectives. Many of these commenters agreed strongly with the proposal in the NPRM that a SPRE be provided maximum
flexibility in selecting institutions to review, except as provided by the statute; i.e., under section 494A(b)
of the HEA, a SPRE must review referred institutions on a schedule that coincides with the Secretary's schedule for
recertifying those institutions. Several of these commenters suggested that the SPRE be required to publicize its
review priority system to assure consistent selection of referred institutions under that system.

Many commenters believed strongly that a SPRE should first review referred institutions that meet multiple referral
criteria. Many other commenters believed strongly that a SPRE should consider, in addition to the referral criteria,
other factors, such as data measuring student outcomes (for instance, graduation and placement rates), and other
information a State might have that would indicate that a referred institution was not properly providing its educational
programs. Several commenters suggested that the Secretary set the review priorities to ensure that all SPREs select
institutions on the same basis. A number of commenters contended that an overwhelming number of institutions scheduled
by the Secretary for recertification would also meet a referral criterion. Those commenters feared that this pool
of institutions would be so great that a SPRE would never be able to select institutions under the State's review priority
system. To alleviate this problem, the commenters recommended that the NPRM be revised to allow a SPRE to select institutions
for review under the State's priority system from among the pool of referred institutions the Secretary scheduled
for recertification.


Discussion:

 If a State's allotment is less than will be needed to review all referred institutions, the Secretary believes that
a SPRE is in a better position than the Secretary to determine which institutions to select for review from among all
the referred institutions. The Secretary also believes that any of the review priorities suggested by the commenters
could be effective in selecting ``problem institutions'' for review under this program, provided that those priorities
reflect the objectives of protecting students, saving tax dollars, and promoting educational quality. Therefore,
the Secretary will not require a SPRE to adopt any of the commenters priority suggestions for establishing priorities.
The Secretary agrees with the commenter who noted that for some States for some years, the number of institutions scheduled
for recertification by the Secretary may exceed the money allotted to the State for reviews. Under that circumstance,
the SPRE will use its priority criteria to select for review only institutions scheduled for recertification by the
Secretary.

The Secretary agrees with the commenters who recommended that a SPRE should make known its review priorities.


Changes:

 Section 667.(23)(b) is revised to require a SPRE to make available information regarding its review priority system
after its plan submitted under  667.12 is approved by the Secretary and prior to conducting reviews of referred
institutions. Also, in response to comments regarding review priorities under  667.5, a new  667.12(c)(3)(ii)
is added to permit a SPRE to place an institution in the lowest priority for review if the institution was referred because
of a late audit or a change in ownership and a previous SPRE review found no significant violations of State standards.


Comments:

 Several commenters suggested that the final regulations contain procedures, in addition to the reallotment procedures,
under which a State could request a supplemental allotment to carry out the requirements of the State Postsecondary
Review Program.



Discussion:

 The Secretary disagrees with the commenters. If a State needs additional funds and those funds are available through
reallotment, the Secretary will allow States to apply for those funds. Funds for the program's purposes are provided
through annual, discretionary appropriations from Congress. The program is not an entitlement. The Secretary does
not have the authority to award ``supplemental allotments'' beyond reallotment through these regulations.



Changes:

 None.



Section 667.14 Allowable Costs and Activities





Comments:

 Several commenters suggested that information sharing be added to the list of allowable activities.



Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees.


Changes: 

Section 667.14(c) is revised to include as an allowable direct cost sharing of information by a SPRE with other SPREs,
the Secretary, other State agencies, accrediting agencies, institutions, private organizations, and others.


Comments: 

Several commenters suggested that the training of employees of private organizations, nationally recognized accrediting
agencies, and peer review systems by considered allowable activities when the training is necessary for those employees
to perform required activities contracted by a SPRE.



Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that in establishing a contract with a private organization, nationally recognized accrediting
agency, or peer review system, the SPRE may include in the contract any training that is required for the contracted
organization to carry out required activities, and the SPRE may pay for that training with SPRP funds.



Changes: 

None.



Section 667.15 Fiscal Procedures and Records





Comments: 

One commenter recommended that an audit of a SPRE's activities be performed annually instead of at least once every
two years as proposed in the NPRM. The commenter indicated that annual audits are needed to protect Department and
taxpayer interests in light of the fact that the SPRP is a new program.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940429-0-00117 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940429-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The commenter also stated that annual audits would ensure that SPRE funds supplement, not supplant, existing licensing
or review functions conducted by the State. The commenter further argued that SPREs should have annual audits because
the HEA now requires institutions and others to have audits performed annually.



Discussion:

 The Secretary disagrees. The Secretary believes that more frequent audits are not necessary to monitor adequately
the activities of a SPRE. The Secretary believes that requiring a SPRE to have an annual audit would divert funds away
from performing reviews or referred institutions. Also, in the case of States that receive the minimum allotment,
the cost of an audit would represent a significant portion of the allotment.



Changes:

 None.



Section 667.16 Supplement, Not Supplant, Requirement





Comments:

 A few commenters recommended that the Secretary review compliance with this requirement on a case-by-case basis.
Several commenters suggested that a State document its activities and functions that are in place prior to the implementation
of the program and be able to demonstrate to the Secretary that SPRE activities did not replace those activities or
functions. A few commenters recommended that the Secretary monitor the allocation of general State funds to ensure
that those funds either matched or exceeded the State's expenditure levels before the establishment of the SPRE.



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that a State should maintain adequate documentation to show, on audit, that the funds spent
for SPRE activities supplemented, but did not supplant, existing State licensing or review functions.



Changes:

 None.



Section 667.21 State Review Standards



The Secretary received many comments regarding the framework, proposed in  667.21(b), under which a State
develops review standards. In proposing the framework, the Secretary intended to achieve the following objectives:

(1) To recognize and account for the diversity of institutions that would be subject to the standards by allowing States
to establish different standards for those institutions;

(2) To facilitate effective enforcement of State standards by requiring States to quantify certain standards, and
by requiring States to specify the records and information an institution would need to maintain for those standards;

(3) To limit the scope of the quantitative standards by allowing a State to apply those standards only to regular students,
i.e., students enrolled at an institution for the purpose of obtaining a degree, certificate, or other recognized
credential offered by the institution; and

(4) To introduce a level of rigor in the standards by requiring a State to determine whether a comparable title IV, HEA
program standard would be an acceptable State standard.



Quantified Standards





Comments:

 Many commenters writing on behalf of institutions and several accrediting bodies objected to the requirement proposed
in the NPRM that a State quantify certain review standards by establishing ``acceptable percentages'' for those
standards. Many of these commenters believed strongly that this requirement constitutes an ``enforcement mechanism''
and thus violates section 494C(k) of the HEA. A number of commenters acknowledged that the statute allows a State to
establish quantitative standards but did not believe that the Secretary has the authority under the statute to require
a State to develop quantitative standards. A number of commenters believed that quantitative standards were too
restrictive and feared that States would develop such standards without regard to the mission of institutions. Several
commenters believed that enforcement of quantified standards would impinge on institutional autonomy and force
institutions to shift their missions away from serving high-risk students. A number of commenters believed that
standards reduced to ``acceptable percentages'' would either by arbitrary, and probably without legal defense,
or statistical, and would, be definition, place a number of institutions below the acceptable levels, regardless
of whether the performance of those institutions is otherwise outstanding. Still other commenters argued that standards
based on minimum ``acceptable percentages'' would create a safe harbor for institutions that might otherwise be
judged to be substandard. By achieving the numerical minimum, such institutions would be able to tie the SPREs' hands
and escape adverse action that might otherwise be warranted because, under the NPRM, the SPRE must consider those
institutions to be in compliance with the review standard.

Commenters writing on behalf of States and student legal services organizations agreed with the proposal. These
commenters believed strongly that objective, quantified standards are essential for meaningful enforcement and
regulatory review.



Discussion:

 The Secretary disagrees strongly with the commenters who contend that the proposed requirement that a State quantify
certain review standards by establishing acceptable percentages for those standards, constitutes an ``enforcement
mechanism'' in violation of section 494C(k) of the HEA. That section of the HEA states, ``Nothing in this subpart shall
restrict the authority of the States to establish mechanisms to enforce the standards established under subsection
(d) or require the States to establish specific mechanisms recommended by the Secretary.''

The restriction on the enforcement of standards in section 494C(k) is based upon the establishment of standards under
section 494C(d). Therefore, the restriction on the enforcement of standards has no bearing on the establishment
of those standards.

The Secretary disagrees with those commenters who indicated that the Secretary is without authority to require States
to develop quantitative standards. The nature of the standards imposed by statute is such that without quantifiable
measures, the standards would be meaningless.

While the Secretary understands the concerns of some of the commenters that States might develop standards without
regard to institutional mission or that enforcement of quantified standards could either force institutions away
from serving high-risk students, or allow some institutions that would otherwise be judged to be substandard under
other measures to escape State oversight, the Secretary believes that quantitative student outcome standards are
an extremely valuable measure of the success of an institution. Quite the contrary to the views of the commenters,
the Secretary believes that the imposition of quantifiable standards will have the effect of improving institutional
quality and will protect high-risk students from unscrupulous substandard institutions. Further, quantifiable
standards will assist prospective students and their parents in making choices about attendance at institutions.
The Secretary further notes there is nothing in this part that would preclude a State from taking into account the fact
that an institution serves high-risk students. 



Changes: 

No changes were made regarding the quantifiable standards in  667.21(a)(17). However, the reader is referred
to the discussion under the heading ``Relationship between tuition-and-fee charges and remuneration'' for information
regarding changes made to the standard described in  667.21(a)(9). 



Different Standards for Different Types of Institutions





Comments: 

Many commenters writing on behalf of proprietary institutions objected strongly to the proposal to allow a State
to develop different standards for different types or categories of institutions. These commenters argued that
Congress intended that all institutions be judged under the same standards, except as explicitly provided in the
statute.

Many other commenters agreed strongly with the proposal. A number of these commenters urged the Secretary to require,
not simply allow, States to develop different standards for different types of institutions to ensure that all SPREs
take into consideration the nature and mission of institutions. 

Several comments urged the Secretary to allow States to develop different standards only for different categories
of institutions to protect institutions from being placed in arbitrary categories by States and to promote nationwide
consistency in identifying categories. The commenters recommended that institutions be categorized according
to (1) their for- or not-for-profit status, (2) whether they grant degrees, and (3) the levels and types of degrees
or educational programs they offer. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that State standards should reflect the mission of institutions and that enforcement of such
standards will allow SPREs to accomplish most effectively the purpose of the SPRP. The fact that the SPRP is a program
designed to strengthen the State role in the program integrity triad means that the program is intended to foster the
flexibility that inevitably results from differences among the States. The Secretary reiterates that States are
provided flexibility in developing standards. Thus, a State may categorize institutions or educational programs
in a manner that the State deems appropriate. 



Changes: 

None. 



Regular Students 





Comments:

 Commenters generally agreed that a State's standards should be applied only to regular students at institutions.
A few commenters opined that quantified standards would be misleading and irrelevant to institutions that offer
open admissions because many students who attend those institutions do not aspire to attain a certificate or a degree,
yet have a specific educational goal. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that in evaluating student outcomes of an institution, and most particularly with regard
to institutions offering open enrollment, the evaluation should be based on regular students because they are the
ones who can qualify for title IV, HEA funds, the protection of which is one of the primary purposes of SPRP. 




Changes: 

None. 



Comparable Title IV, HEA Program Standard as an Acceptable State Standard





Comments: 

Several commenters objected to the proposal to require a SPRE to consider the relevance of a title IV, HEA program standard
as a requirement in establishing the State's standards. The commenters believed that acceptance of Federal standards,
and application of those standards, by a SPRE would have an adverse effect on institutions at which a small percentage
of students receive assistance under the title IV, HEA programs. 

Several other commenters believed the proposal is a reasonable approach because institutions that participate
in the title IV, HEA programs already have to comply with these standards. 

Several other commenters believed that this provisions should be expanded to require a SPRE to adopt comparable State
licensure standards if those standards are more rigorous than comparable title IV, HEA program standards. The commenters
argued that if a SPRE adopts review standards that are less rigorous than the State licensing standards, institutions
might later argue persuasively to the State legislature to reduce the State licensing standards to the level of lower
SPRE standards on the grounds that varying standards would be onerous and confusing. At the very least, these commenters
suggested that the Secretary require States to establish standards that are at least as rigorous as the comparable
title IV, HEA program standards. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary is giving SPREs latitude to develop standards and expects States to take into account comparable title
IV, HEA program standards as they develop their own standards. The Secretary does not agree that this program will
have an adverse impact on institutions at which only a few students receive title IV, HEA program assistance (1) because
the SPRP only requires a SPRE to establish standards for referred institutions, and (2) because any standard that
a SPRE establishes that is comparable to a title IV, HEA program requirement already applies to those institutions
as title IV, HEA program participants. The Secretary agrees, however, with the commenters who noted that it does not
make sense for a State to adopt standards under the SPRP that are weaker than its State licensing standards. Nevertheless,
this is a matter that must be resolved among the appropriate State authorities. 



Changes: 

None 



Records and Information an Institution Must maintain to Demonstrate to SPRE its Compliance With the State's Standards






Comments: 

Many commenters strongly urged the Secretary to make clear in the final regulations that a SPRE may not require an institution
that has not been referred by the Secretary to the SPRE for review to maintain these records and information. A number
of these commenters suggested if that institution is later referred by the Secretary to the SPRE for review, the SPRE
should be required to assist the institution in generating the required information, or that the SPRE should be required
to allow the institution a reasonable time to comply with the State's standards and recordkeeping requirements.




Discussion: 

If an institution is referred to a State for review under the SPRP, the institution must satisfy the State's standards.
If the institution was not otherwise required to keep records relating to its compliance with State Standards, and
it did not keep those records, the Secretary agrees that the State should allow an institution a reasonable period
of time to obtain records and information to enable the institution to demonstrate its compliance with the State's
standards.

Changes:

 Section 667.21(b) is revised to require that if a referred institution was not otherwise required to keep records
relating to its compliance with State standards, and it did not keep those records, the SPRE allow the institution
a reasonable period of time to obtain those records to enable it to demonstrate its compliance with the State's standards.



Relationship Between Tuition-and-Fee Charges and Remuneration





Comments:

 Many commenters objected to the proposal that a State establish an acceptable percentage for the relationship between
the tuition and fees charged by an institution for an educational program and the amount of money that a student who
successfully completes that program actually earns. A number of commenters believed strongly that this approach
would be administratively unmanageable for comprehensive institutions that offer a broad spectrum of programs,
including programs in liberal arts, sciences, teacher education, engineering, and nursing.

Many commenters believed that the Secretary does not have the authority under the statute to require a SPRE to make
a judgment regarding the reasonableness of the tuition and fees charged by an institution. Many of these commenters
contended that the standard, as proposed in the NPRM, was tantamount to price-fixing. The commenters argued that
this standard, as articulated in the statute, simply requires an institution to disclose to students and prospective
students information on program costs and on earnings that a graduate of that program could reasonably be expected
to make in an occupation related to that program.

Other commenters asserted that relating the amount of tuition and fees to the amount of money a graduate of an educational
program earns assumes incorrectly that (1) the institution alone is responsible for a student's education and employment,
and (2) salary is the only reason for education. The commenters pointed out that a student is also responsible for his
or her education and that the student may choose a job that is rewarding in ways other than money.

A few commenters pointed out that States sometimes establish the tuition and fees for certain programs at public institutions.
The commenters urged the Secretary to exempt these programs from this standard.

Many commenters contended that States do not have adequate data on wages and salaries either to establish an acceptable
percentage or determine that an institution met that percentage. These commenters were concerned that the results
of surveys conducted by an institution of its graduates' earnings would not be reliable. Finally, many commenters
argued that any formula governing the relationship between tuition and remuneration consider State subsidies provided
to public institutions to ensure a fair comparison of tuition and fees between like programs offered by all types of
institutions.

A number of commenters agreed with the proposal.



Discussion:

 The Secretary notes that this requirement only applies to vocational programs and therefore does not apply to programs
such as liberal arts programs.

The Secretary acknowledges that commenters are correct when they note that many variables influence whether a person
obtains a particular job. However, the Secretary believes that one of the most important factors is the job training
of that individual. Further, institutions that purport to offer education to prepare students for occupations ought
to be able to substantiate that the education they provide does just that. In addition, for students who receive loans
for their education, it is reasonable to expect that they will qualify for positions that will enable them to repay
those loans. For these reasons, the Secretary disagrees with the commenters who categorized this standard merely
as a student consumer information disclosure requirement or that it is tantamount to price fixing. More appropriately,
under this standard, a SPRE must determine whether an institution's tuition and fees are too high, given the remuneration
that its graduates can reasonably expect to receive.

Finally, based on public comment and further review, the Secretary has decided that an institution should not be required
to survey its graduates to obtain employment and wage data; rather, a SPRE may rely on local, State, or Federal employment
and wage data to determine the institution's compliance with this standard.

Changes:

 Section 667.21(b)(4)(i) is revised to require a State to quantify this standard by establishing criteria (rather
than just a percentage, as in proposed  667.21(b)(4)(i)) under which a SPRE determines if the tuition and fees
charged by an institution for a vocational program are excessive compared to the amount of money that a student who
successfully completes that program may reasonably be expected to earn. Section 667.21(a)(9)(i) is changed to clarify
that this is the purpose of the standard. In addition,  667.22(b)(5) is revised to require a State to specify
the methods and data used by the SPRE to determine if the tuition and fees charged by an institution for a vocational
program are excessive.



Assessing a Student's Ability to Complete the Program





Comments:

 Many commenters objected to the proposal that a SPRE judge the effectiveness of an institution's method to assess
that a student has the ability to complete successfully the educational program for which he or she applied. Many commenters
argued that there is no correlation between an institution's assessment method and the graduation rate of students
in an educational program. The commenters cited many reasons that a student might fail to complete a program that is
unrelated to the student's academic ability, including motivation, personal finances, family obligations, a change
in employement, and others, and suggested that the proposed requirement be removed. Many other commenters contended
that the Secretary exceeded statutory authority in proposing this requirement. A number of these commenters argued
that requiring a SPRE to judge the effectiveness of an institution's assessment method could lead to the use of mandatory,
standardized tests, or other methods that require profiles of program completers, for determining a student's admission
into a program. These commenters believed the use of these methods would lead institutions whose mission is to serve
high-risk students to change their mission.

Several other commenters suggested that the proposed standard be expanded to (1) include other positive outcome
measures, or (2) allow a SPRE to consider the rigor, fairness, and consistent application of an institution's assessment
method in judging that method.

A number of commenters agreed with the proposal but suggested that an SPRE's judgment regarding the effectiveness
of an institution's assessment method should be limited to vocational programs. Like many other commenters, these
commenters contended that there is little direct correlation between student success and admissions standards
for degree programs. One of these commenters argued that there is a much stronger correlation between student success
and admissions criteria in vocational programs than in degree programs because of the shorter length and more narrow
focus of vocational programs. The commenter believed there is a greater need to assess the adequacy of the admission
standards for vocational programs because the population served by those programs tends to be less prepared for postsecondary
education than students in degree programs. Another commenter believed strongly that an extraordinarily high student
drop-out rate (1) may indicate other serious problems with an educational program, including the poor quality of
its teachers or the lack of necessary equipment, and (2) invariably indicates enrollment of students unable to understand
or handle course material.

A few other commenters believed that the ``ability-to-benefit'' provision in the title IV, HEA program regulations
satisfies the statutory requirement under this part that an institution have a method to assess a student's ability
to complete successfully an educational program.



Discussion:

 The Secretary is convinced that many points made by the commenters are valid, and that other standards adequately
accomplish the Secretary's originally stated objectives in proposing this standard. The Secretary clarifies,
however, that the standard described in  667.21(a)(3) applies to all regular students at an institution, not
just those students who qualify to receive financial assistance under the title IV ability-to-benefit provisions.



Changes:

 Proposed  667.21(a)(4) is removed.



Suggestion to Augment the Standard Proposed in  667.21(a)(7) Concerning Compliance With Health and Safety
Standards





Comments:

 Most commenters objected to the suggestion in the preamble to the NPRM for views on whether a SPRE, as part of its review,
should determine an institution's compliance with statutes and regulations governing access to disabled individuals.
They considered the proposal to be beyond the scope and purpose of the SPRP.



Discussion:

 Based on comments and further review, the Secretary agrees not to include this provision. Disabled individuals are
protected under applicable statutes without the additional provision for a SPRE review in that area.



Changes:

 None.



Standard in Proposed  667.21(a)(9) Governing Institutional Plans for Closure





Comments:

 A number of commenters, including several commenters writing on behalf of States, urged the Secretary to define the
term ``financially at risk'' as that term applies to the standard under which a SPRE would require an institution to
provide for the instruction of students and the retention of records in the event the institution closes.



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that a SPRE may view an institution to be financially at risk if it does not satisfy the factors
of financial responsibility in  668.15 of the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations, 34 CFR part
668.



Changes:

 None.



Standard in Proposed  667.21(a)(14)





Comments:

 A number of commenters suggested specific methods for establishing acceptable percentages for student completion
and graduation rates, placement rates, withdrawal rates, and licensure examination pass rates.


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940429-0-00121 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940429-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

One commenter opined that it was critical that quantitative measures be consistent within and among all States and
believed that the Student-Right-to-Know regulations, when published, will provide a uniform basis for calculating
student graduation rates. The commenter recommended a coordinated study by the research community to develop acceptable
percentages for the quantified standards and suggested that the implementation of those standards should be delayed
for 12 to 18 months pending the results of that study.

Several commenters urged the Secretary to remove the proposed references to the

 NOICC Master Crosswalk 

in the standard regarding the placement rate of an institution's graduates in occupations related to their educational
program. The commenters believed that any method under which the 

 NOICC Master Crosswalk 

could be used to code employment status would be extremely complex and likely to yield false precision at great cost.



Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees that the Student-Right-to-Know methodology will provide a uniform basis for calculating student
graduation rates, and encourages States to develop consistent methods for calculating student withdrawal rates,
placement rates, and licensure examination pass rates to reduce burden on institutions. The Secretary acknowledges,
however, that some States have developed robust student information systems, and does not intend to force those States
to use specific methodologies for computing rates to measure student outcomes. Therefore, the Secretary disagrees
with the commenters who suggest (1) that it is critical that all States adopt the same quantitative measures, or (2)
a delay in implementing those measures is warranted.

Finally, the Secretary disagrees that using the 

 NOICC Master Crosswalk 

(Crosswalk) to code employment status would either be complex or costly. The Secretary intends that institutions
and SPREs use the Crosswalk as it is currently used by State agencies_as a reference source and guide to evaluate the
relationship between an educational program and a job.



Changes: 

None.



Standard in Proposed  667.21(a)(11) Governing Market, Job Availability, and Licensing Standards





Comments: 

A few commenters suggested that the Secretary should expand this standard. The commenters were concerned that the
standard does not specify the geographical scope of the labor market information to be provided, nor does it specify
that average entry-level earnings should be provided. In addition, the commenters believed that the proposed provision
regarding the disclosure of State licensing requirements should be more specific. According to the commenters,
some of the most egregious title IV, HEA program abuses have involved institutions that, by enrolling a student in
a program that required a State license, implied that the program met, and the student would meet, the State's licensing
requirements when in fact the institution failed to provide adequate training to meet those requirements. The commenters
suggested that the standard be revised to require an institution to describe in clear and specific terms how its educational
program meets, and a student in the program would be able to meet, the relevant State licensing requirements.



Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that a SPRE's standards in this area will only be acceptable if they are applied in a meaningful
manner that meets the demands of these last commenters, but the criterion in these regulations does not have need to
be revised to accomplish this purpose. With regard to the comments concerning the geographical scope of labor market
information on the determination of entry-level earnings based on averages, the Secretary does not disagree that
these might be relevant and valid considerations. The Secretary does not believe, however, that these regulations
need to specify all the factors that contribute to making disclosures meaningful. Instead, these factors are best
considered when a SPRE consults with the institutions in its State to develop the standard for applying this provision.



Changes: 

None.



Section 667.22 Disapproval of State Review Standards





Comments: 

A number of commenters opined that the NPRM would empower the Secretary to exercise control over an institution in
a manner that is contrary to section 103(b) of the Department of Education's Organization Act (Pub. L. 98-88).
The commenters believed that the Secretary would exercise control over the direction, supervision, or curriculum,
program of instruction, administration, or personnel or an institution through the evaluation of State review standards.
According to the commenters, given the influence of States over institutions by virtue of State review standards,
evaluation of those standards by the Secretary enables the Secretary to exercise the direction, supervision, and
control over institutions that is prohibited by law. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary disagrees with the commenters. First, section 494C(d) of the HEA provides that the standards shall
be subject to the Secretary's disapproval. Second, under the same statutory provision, these standards must be developed
by the SPRE in consultation with institutions in the SPRE's State, and these regulations provide in  667.22(a)
for the Secretary to take that consultation into consideration in determining whether the standards may be disapproved.
The Secretary believes that institutional participation in the development of standards does not constitute interference
in institutional areas protected by the Department of Education Organization Act. 



Changes: 

None.



Comments: 

A few commenters writing in response to the request in the NPRM for additional criteria the Secretary should use to
evaluate a State's review standards, suggested the following criteria:

(1) An explanation by the State of the rationale for each standard;



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940429-0-00122 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940429-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) If applicable, an explanation of the reasons for deviating from applicable provisions in State law;
(3) Information that is necessary to demonstrate compliance with the review standards, including information not
already collected by institutions or other State agencies; and
(4) A provision that would allow an institution to provide directly to the Secretary comments of third parties regarding
the State's review standards within a specified time.
Several commenters requested that the Secretary clarify the proposed criterion regarding the use of statistically
valid methods and procedures to obtain employment-related data through the conduct of surveys of an institution
graduates. A few commenters suggested that the Secretary substitute for that requirement a provision to use ``representative
sampling.'' The commenters contended that representative sampling would be a less onerous requirement, especially
for smaller institutions. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary thanks the commenters for their suggestions for additional criteria for reviewing standards. The
Secretary has decided not to accept the first one because it imposes an unnecessary burden on a State to include a rationale
for a standard where the rationale would be self-evident from the standard. However, the Secretary will use the commenters'
suggestion as a useful guideline for determining whether to disapprove a particular standard.
The Secretary has decided not to adopt the second suggestion because a State could not adopt a standard that was in violation
of its State law. The Secretary has decided not to adopt the third suggestion because that information is not necessary
to determining whether a standard is not acceptable. It is left to a SPRE to establish how an institution complies specifically
with a standard. Finally, the Secretary did not adopt the fourth suggestion because it is the responsibility of a State
in consulting with institutions in the development of those standards, to obtain and consider all relevant comments.
The Secretary considers ``representative sampling'' to be a valid statistical method for conducting surveys.


Changes:

 None.


Comments: 

One commenter writing on behalf of an accrediting commission, urged the Secretary to make a State's review standards
subject to third party review. The commenter also recommended this treatment for a SPRE's plan and budget for carrying
out the activities under this part. The commenter believed that the statute and the proposed regulations require
the Secretary to exercise informed judgment on whether a number of broad standards have been met. Third-party comment
would provide valuable input to the Secretary's exercise of informed judgment. In addition, the commenter offered
the view that if the Secretary's key goal for the Program Integrity Triad is to reduce redundancy and promote complimentary
input from interested parties, notably other members of the triad and affected institutions, would help the Secretary
determine whether State plans, budgets, and standards are in fact complementary to the efforts of the Department
and nationally recognized accrediting agencies and not unduly burdensome to institutions. Finally, in the commenters
opinion, input from third parties would also help prevent the Secretary from mistake or embarrassment. For example,
if the consultative process in a State has been inadequate, it is highly unlikely that the State will reveal the inadequacies
in its submission to the Secretary. Institutions that have been adversely affected, however, could point out those
deficiencies before Federal funds are wasted on SPRE efforts to apply standards that may later legitimately be challenged.
Similarly, nationally recognized accrediting agencies may provide useful information to the Secretary about proposed
contracts with other ``peer review systems'' that are inadequate to the tasks that they would be given. The commenter
maintained that according to interested parties the right to review and comment need not be burdensome or time-consuming,
and recommended procedures under which the Secretary would provide for and receive third-party comment on a State's
review standards, and the SPRE's plans and budgets, before determining whether to approve those standards and plans.


Discussion: 

The Secretary disagrees strongly that the suggested procedures for third-party comment would not be burdensome
or time-consuming. Under the suggested procedures, the Secretary would need to publish in the 

Federal Register

 each State's application for funds and each State's review standards, and allow a 30 day comment period and consider
that comment, before determining whether to approve a State's application or disapprove a State's standards. These
procedures would delay unnecessarily decisions the Secretary must make to ensure proper and timely administration
of the SPRE. Moreover, the Secretary believes that inadequate consultation with all affected parties will likely
be revealed in deficient standards, which the Secretary will have the authority to review and disapprove.


Changes:

 None.


Comments: 

A number of commenters believed that SPREs, not institutions, should be required to calculate student completion
rates, withdrawal rates, placement rates, and licensure examination pass rates, and other related data. The commenters
contended that the statute does not require or imply that institutions should be required to collect or maintain this
information. Other commenters suggested that an institution be required to generate data regarding these rates
only when the institution is reviewed by a SPRE.


Discussion: 

The Secretary disagrees with the commenters. It is clear under the SPRE that referred institutions must satisfy SPRE
standards, and must be able to demonstrate that they satisfy those standards.


Changes:

 None.


Section 676.23 SPRE Reviews of Referred Institutions




Comments: 

A few commenters believed that a SPRE should be able to conduct an unannounced review of a referred institution if the
SPRE has reason to believe that the institution is engaged in fraudulent practices.


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940429-0-00123 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940429-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Other commenters suggested that, except where fraud is suspected, the Secretary require a SPRE to provide notice
to a referred institution before conducting a review of that institution. The commenters argued that advance notice
of a SPRE review would enable the institution to prepare adequately for the review, including having required records
and personnel at the institution during the review.


Discussion: 

In general, the Secretary believes strongly that a SPRE is in the best position to determine the actions it should take
in carrying out its review responsibilities. If the SPRE determines that an unannounced review of any referred institution
is necessary, the SPRE may conduct that review.


Change: 

None.


Comments: 

Several commenters suggested that a SPRE be allowed to determine, based on the referral criteria or based on a preliminary
review of the institution, whether to conduct a comprehensive review of the institution under all of the State's standards
or conduct a more limited review designed to identify and correct certain problems at the institution. The commenters
argued that this would provide for efficient use of SPRE resources and reduce the burden on referred institutions.


Discussion: 

Section 494C(d) of the HEA requires a SPRE, in conducting its review of a referred institution, to determine the institution's
compliance with all of the State's standards. The Secretary believes, however, that a SPRE may devise review procedures
under which the SPRE decides the manner or level of review required to determine an institution's compliance with
each of the State's standards.


Changes: 

None.


Comments: 

A few commenters suggested a change in the amount of time a SPRE should have to issue an initial report of its findings
to an institution. Some commenters suggested increasing the time from 45 days to 60 days; other commenters suggested
decreasing the time to 30 days. Another commenter asked the Secretary to clarify what constitutes the completion
of a review and recommended that a SPRE issue its initial report no later than 45 days after it has completed its review
of the institutions under all of the State's standards and has received a report from the relevant accrediting agency
or peer review system.


Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that 45 days provides a SPRE with sufficient time to prepare a report of findings. The Secretary
considers the 45-day period to begin at the time a SPRE has completed its review of all of the documentation and information
it needs in order to prepare the report, including information provided by an accrediting agency or peer review system.
The Secretary notes, however, that this does not preclude a SPRE from issuing a partial report of its findings to an
institution, if, for example, the SPRE determines that the institution must, or should, take immediate actions in
response to the SPRE's findings.


Changes: 

None.


Comments: 

Several commenters took issue with the proposal that a SPRE may prescribe a course of action a referred institution
must follow to correct a violation of the State's standards. One of the commenters believed that a SPRE should be allowed
to recommend, but not prescribe, the course by which an institution brings itself into compliance with State standards.
The commenter argued that allowing a SPRE to prescribe a course of action would constitute an inappropriate interference
with normal institutional governance and management.
Some commenters were concerned that the Secretary set the wrong tone in the NPRM by suggesting that a SPRE take actions
to effect the termination of an institution only when the SPRE finds that the institution ``continuously or egregiously
violated the State's standards.'' The commenters believed that SPREs will not be the overzealous terminators that
institutions and many others fear; more likely, SPREs will generally be disinclined to take forceful actions against
institutions in their State for fear of litigation and other repercussions that would result from those actions.
The commenters urged the Secretary to change the regulations to make clear that in all cases where a referred institution
fails to meet a State standard, the SPRE would be required to prescribe a course of action the institution would need
follow to correct the violation. The commenters further believed that a SPRE should be required to initiate a proceeding
under  667.25 to effect the termination of an institution, if the institution did not bring itself into compliance
with the State standards within a time specified in regulations unless the SPRE extended that time for good cause.


Discussion: 

The Secretary disagrees strongly with the first series of comments because a SPRE would not be able to enforce the State's
standards if it could not require an institution to take the corrective action it determined the institution needed
to take to bring the institution into compliance with its standards.
While the Secretary agrees strongly with the commenters that SPREs take consistent and appropriate actions against
institutions that fail to comply with the State's standards, the Secretary does not believe that it is necessary or
prudent to require a SPRE, on an absolute basis, to prescribe a course of action an institution must follow to correct
a violation and bring itself into compliance with State standards, particularly with the State's quantified standards.
An institution's compliance with acceptable percentages established for those standards is not inviolate; the
acceptable percentage reflects, or should reflect, whether the institution is successfully providing its educational
programs, rather than whether the institution should be terminated because it failed to satisfy that percentage.
In the NPRM, the Secretary acknowledged that developing such standards will be difficult, and in fairness to institutions,
proposed that a SPRE provide an institution the opportunity to present compelling evidence that would demonstrate
to the SPRE that its failure to meet a State standard would not warrant any further action by the SPRE. Thus, in  667.23(c),
the Secretary permits the SPRE to determine whether to prescribe a course of action and the nature of that action.


Changes: 

Section 667.23(d) is revised to make clear that a SPRE must provide an institution the opportunity to present compelling
evidence that its failure to satisfy a State standard does not warrant any further action by the SPRE.


Comments: 

One commenter suggested that the Secretary initiate an emergency action proceeding against an institution based
on a SPRE's report of serious problems at an institution.


Discussion: 

Certainly, the Secretary will examine the findings contained in the SPRE's report and may investigate the matter
further to determine whether an emergency action is warranted. If the Secretary determines that an emergency action
is warranted, the Secretary initiates that action under 34 CFR part 668, subpart G.

Comments: 

Numerous commenters recommended that a SPRE be required to give an institution a minimum number of days to respond
to the findings and required actions contained in the SPRE's report to the institution. The commenters recommended
that the minimum number be set at 30, 40, 45, 60, or 90 days, or be set by the Secretary in regulations. Most of the commenters
argued that the setting of a minimum number of days was needed because the regulations did not provide for an appeal
by an institution of the SPRE's findings to the Secretary.



Discussion: 

The Secretary understands the commenters' concerns that a SPRE could take a precipitous action against an institution
by not allowing the institution sufficient time to respond to its report. As stated previously, however, the Secretary
believes strongly that a SPRE is in the best position to determine the actions it should take in carrying out its review
responsibilities, and, in view of the change made to  667.23(d), the Secretary has no reason to believe that
a SPRE would not afford an institution a reasonable time to respond to its report.




Changes: 

None.



Comments: 

Several commenters were concerned that a SPRE might punish an institution by initiating a proceeding to effect the
termination of the institution's participation in a title IV, HEA program if the institution did not respond ``quickly
enough'' to the SPRE's request for information, access to the institution, or access to personnel at the institution.
The commenters agreed, in principle, that an institution should not be able to thwart the efforts of a SPRE to obtain
necessary information by refusing to provide to the SPRE information or access to the institution, but believed that
the NPRM provided the SPRE too much authority. The commenters recommended removing two parts of the provision and
modifying the third part so that a SPRE would take an action if ``* * * the institution exhibits a documented
pattern of failure to allow SPRE personnel at the institution or repeated failure to provide SPRE officials with access
to documents or records.''

A number of commenters believed that, although the proposed provisions were appropriate, some changes should be
made. A few commenters argued that a SPRE should view all violations of the State's standards as serious violations
and recommended that the term ``serious'' be removed from the phrase ``* * * the SPRE's findings show
serious violations of the State's standards.''



Discussion: 

The Secretary does not agree that a SPRE must request repeatedly, and be denied repeatedly, information or access
by an institution before taking an action. The Secretary agrees to remove the term ``serious,'' but in doing so does
not intend that a SPRE take an action under these provisions for because of a technical violation by an institution.




Changes: 

Proposed  667.23(g) is revised to remove the word ``serious.''



Comments: 

A number of commenters responded to the request in the NPRM regarding specific areas where SPRE performance standards
should be established and how that performance should be evaluated.


Several commenters suggested that the Secretary should consider a SPRE's performance to be seriously deficient
if the SPRE exhibits a pattern of (1) allowing reviewed institutions an excessive time to correct violations, or (2)
not initiating termination proceedings against institutions for serious violations of the State's standards.

Other commenters suggested that the Secretary evaluate a SPRE's performance based on the SPRE's success in completing
its objectives under the plan the SPRE submits annually to the Secretary, and on other areas related to the SPRE compliance
with statutory requirements.



Discussion: 

The Secretary appreciates the commenters suggestions. Based on these suggestions, and upon further review, the
Secretary has decided not to promulgate specific SPRE performance criteria because the Secretary already has, or
will have, access to all of the information or records pertaining to the suggested criteria. In addition, the Secretary
intends that on occasion Department of Education officials and representatives will accompany SPRE personnel in
conducting reviews of referred institutions. 






Changes: 

None.


Section 667.24 Peer Review of Institutions



One commenter, writing on behalf of an accrediting commission, objected strongly to the regulations and views expressed
in the NPRM. The commenter argued that if States wish to use peer review systems other than recognized accrediting
agencies, those peer review systems should be subject to an approval process established and administered by the
Secretary along the lines of the proposal noted in the NPRM preamble. The commenter submitted that ceding the choice
of peer review systems to the States would be an abdication of the Secretary's responsibilities and an invitation
to abuse. According to the commenter, the goals of Congress for ensuring integrity in the title IV, HEA programs will
not be met if, in the future, instances come to light where the quality reviews performed by ``peer review systems''
on behalf of SPREs have been found to be inadequate, politicized, or abused. In addition, the commenter believed that
it could not be assumed that every SPRE would appropriately choose or create peer review systems that will be competent
to assess institutions and programs. For these reasons, the commenter urged the Secretary to define in final regulations
a ``peer review system'' and the process by which such systems are to have shown ``demonstrated competence in assessing
programs.'' Many commenters echoed this commenter's views.

Several commenters suggested that the Secretary permit a SPRE the use of a ``peer review system'' only in cases where
there is substantial reason to doubt the reliability of the accrediting agency's evaluation of an institution.


A number of commenters agreed that a SPRE should determine the competence of a peer review system and agreed that the
criteria listed in the NPRM preamble are appropriate for making that determination. Some of these commenters suggested
the following additional criteria: 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940429-0-00125 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940429-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) The system has clear and effective controls against conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest;
and

(2) The system is independent administratively and financially of the SPRE, and is able to make decisions and recommendations
free from undue influence by the SPRE.

Several commenters believed that a SPRE should have the flexibility to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether
to sue the services of an accrediting agency or a peer review system. The commenters offered, however that a SPRE should
have defensible procedures in place for selecting a peer review system, and suggested that final regulations require
a SPRE to publicize and submit to the Secretary the criteria and procedures it uses to select an appropriate accrediting
body or peer review system.

Another commenter suggested that a SPRE should be required to develop its own mechanism to assure that a peer review
system meets the same level of quality as a recognized accrediting agency.

Still other commenters believed that a peer system should have the same qualifications and meet the same criteria
required of nationally recognized accrediting agencies.



Discussion: 

The Secretary disagrees with the comments of the first commenter because the Secretary believes SPREs will select
competent peer review systems. Moreover, the Secretary disagrees with the suggestion of the second set of commenters
because section 494C(d)(15) of the HEA does not contain that limitation.


Based upon the suggestions of the other commenters and further review, the Secretary believes that a peer review system
(1) must have an established basis for evaluating educational quality, (2) must have review procedures that include
the selection of peer reviewers who have experience in evaluating the types of programs offered by the institution,
and (3) must have established policies and procedures that guard against bias in conducting reviews of institutions.



Changes: 

Proposed  667.24(a) is revised to require a SPRE to evaluate a peer review system using these criteria described
in the discussion above.



Section 667.25 Termination of an Institution's Participation in the Title IV, HEA Programs





Comment: 

A few commenters were concerned that providing termination authority to a SPRE represented a potential conflict
with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and perhaps with the equal protection clause of the Constitution of the
Untied States.



Discussion: 

The Secretary disagrees. If the SPRE took an action against a referred institution because the institution violated
a SPRE standard and treated that institution in the same manner as it treated other institutions that had the same or
similar violations, the SPRE's action would not violate title VI of the Civil Rights Act nor the equal protection clause
of the Constitution.



Change: 

None.



Comment: 

One commenter questioned whether a SPRE could provide notice to the Secretary to terminate an institution's participation
in a title IV, HEA program based solely on findings resulting from a review conducted by a nationally recognized accrediting
agency or other peer review system.



Discussion: 

It depends. First, it depends on whether the institution was a referred institution. Second, it depends on the nature
of those accrediting agency or peer review findings. Moreover, before it could recommend termination, the SPRE would
have to give the institution a hearing at which the institution could challenge the findings of the accrediting agency
or peer review.



Changes: 

None.



Comments: 

Many commenters believed strongly that the Secretary should allow an institution to appeal to the Secretary a SPRE's
determination that the institution should no longer participate in the title IV, HEA programs. A number of these commenters
recommended that the Secretary establish procedures under which the Secretary would review cases where a SPRE's
decision was clearly biased.



Discussion: 

As the Secretary indicated in the NPRM, it is the Secretary's view that section 494C(h)(1) of the HEA does not allow
an appeal to the Secretary of the SPRE's termination determination.



Changes: 

None.



Section 667.26 Due Process Requirements





Comments: 

Many commenters believed that a State could develop due process procedures that met the minimum requirements outlined
in the NPRM, but those procedures would not be adequate or provide for a meaningful appeal. The commenters suggested
that final regulations (1) specify the time within which an institution could challenge an adverse action taken by
a SPRE, and (2) require a State to provide an institution the opportunity to present its case in a hearing before a third
party or impartial hearing official.



Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees with the commenters' suggestions.



Changes: 

Section 667.26 is revised to require a State to (1) identify a minimum time within which it will allow an institution
to challenge its actions, and (2) provide for a hearing before an impartial official.

 Final Regulations.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary amends the Student Assistance General 
Provisions regulations. These regulations are needed to 
implement statutory changes to the Higher Education Act of 1965, 
as amended by the Student Right-to-Know and Campus Security Act 
(Pub. L. 101-542), the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 
1991 (Pub. L. 102-26), the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 
(Pub. L. 102-325), and the Higher Education Technical Amendments 
of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-208). These regulations require an 
institution of higher education to disclose information about its 
campus safety policies and procedures, and statistics concerning 
whether certain crimes took place on campus. These regulations 
also make technical changes to Subpart F of the Student 
Assistance General Provisions regulations, which governs 
misrepresentation. Encouraging students to pursue high quality 
postsecondary education is an important element of the National 
Education Goals; a safe campus environment facilitates such 
education. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Student Assistance General 
Provisions regulations implement requirements that are common to 
the participation of postsecondary institutions in the student 
financial assistance programs authorized by Title IV of the 
Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (Title IV, HEA 
programs). These programs include the Federal Pell Grant, 
Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, Federal Supplemental Loans 
for Students (SLS), Federal Direct Student Loan (FDSL), State 
Student Incentive Grant (SSIG), Federal Perkins Loan, Federal 
Work-Study (FWS), Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity 
Grant (FSEOG), Presidential Access Scholarship (PAS), and 
National Early Intervention Scholarship and Partnership (NEISP) 
programs. 




On July 10, 1992 and October 22, 1993 the Secretary 
published two notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRMs) for 
34 CFR part 668 in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 30826-30833 and 
58 FR 54902-54905, respectively). Both of these proposed 
regulations included a discussion of the major issues surrounding 
the proposed changes that will not be repeated here. The list 
below summarizes those issues and identifies the pages of the 
preambles to the NPRMs on which a discussion of those issues may 
be found. The final regulations to implement the Student 
Right-to-Know Act, proposals for which were also included in the 
July 10, 1992 NPRM, are not included in these regulations. With 
the passage of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, and its 
proliferation of completion and graduation rate provisions, it 
became necessary to write a second NPRM regarding these rates. 
The Secretary expects to publish the second NPRM this year. The 
Secretary does not want to delay publication of final regulations 
regarding campus security and is, therefore, proceeding with this 
publication separately. As indicated above, here is a summary of 
proposed issues relating to crime prevention and statistical 
disclosure: 

Addition to student consumer provisions to require the 
disclosure of an annual security report (57 FR 30828 and 
58 FR 54903); 

Addition of list of actual disclosures to be made 
(57 FR 30828 and 58 FR 54903-54904); 

Addition of time periods for collection of crime statistics 
(57 FR 30829 and 58 FR 54904, but superseded by subsequent 
statutory change reflected in these final regulations); and

Addition of a definition of 

campus 

for the purpose of section 668.47 of the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations (FR 57 30829 and FR 58 54904).



Substantive Changes Reflected in These Final Regulations Changes Pursuant to the Higher Education Amendments of
1992, Public Law 102-325



Sex Offenses, Forcible or Nonforcible



Section 668.47(a)(12) of the final regulations has been changed to provide for the disclosure of certain policies
and procedures, the purpose of which is to prevent forcible and nonforcible sex offenses and address various issues
relating to these offenses. Institutions are required to establish campus sexual assault programs to prevent sex
offenses and procedures for a victim to follow when a sex offense occurs.

Section 668.47(a)(6)(i) of the final regulations has been changed to provide that for the purpose of disclosing statistics
about campus crimes, institutions must compile and disclose statistics on rape for periods of time prior to August
1, 1992 and sex offenses, forcible and nonforcible, for periods of time on or after August 1, 1992. This change reflects
an amendment to section 485(f)(1)(F)(ii) of the HEA made by section 486(c)(1) of Public Law 102-325. An institution
must use the definition of rape through July 31, 1992 found in the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Handbook. In addition,
an institution must use the definitions of forcible and nonforcible sex offenses found in the National Incident-Based
Reporting System (NIBRS) Edition of the UCR Handbook for collection of these statistics on or after August 1, 1992.



Reporting of Crime Statistics



Section 668.47(d)(1) of these final regulations, relating to the periods of time for which statistical data on campus
crime must be compiled and disclosed, is changed to reflect  486(c)(3) of Public Law 102-325.



Analysis of Comments and Changes



In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRMs, approximately 300 parties submitted comments on the proposed
regulations. An analysis of the comments and of the changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRMs follows.

Substantive issues are discussed under the section of the regulations to which they pertain. Technical and other
minor changes and suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under the applicable statutory
authority are not addressed.



Section 668.47 Institutional Security Policies and Crime Statistics



Definition of Campus Security Authority





Comments: 

Several commenters supported the intent of the statute and applauded the efforts to accurately collect and report
information on crime and educate consumers, and believe the regulations are a deterrent towards criminal activity.
The majority of commenters affirmed their support of the Secretary's removal of the term counselors from the proposed
definition of campus security authority.

A number of commenters believed that the proposed regulatory definition of campus security authority struck the
appropriate balance between the needs of a crime victim and the need for crime reporting. Other commenters defended
the inclusion of deans and residence directors in the proposed definition, maintaining that the definition allows
victims to be served properly by reducing accusations concerning interference and coverup of crimes and, most importantly,
reducing the risk of someone else becoming a victim of crime.

Many commenters believed that the proposed definition was too broad, particularly because it included deans and
residence directors. The commenters offered a variety of reasons for this belief, the most common reason being the
belief that a student who is a victim of rape, date rape, or similar crime will often solicit a dean or residence director
to help him or her work through the trauma of the event; the victim may decide not to file an official action with the legal
authorities. In these instances, the commenters believe the proposed rules could limit the victim's ability to receive
immediate assistance and would most likely prolong his or her trauma. Several commenters indicated that deans and
residence directors should play a strong role in educating students in security matters and in developing a disciplinary
environment that refuses to support criminal behavior.

<TEXT>
 

Several commenters said that the regulations should not define the term campus security authority at all, thereby
ensuring maximum institutional flexibility with respect to the reporting of crimes and the allocation of counseling
responsibilities. The commenters suggested this course of action, stating that because of the variety of campus
administrative structures (size, complexity, structure, and staffing patterns), an all-inclusive definition
would be difficult to achieve. Other commenters said that the regulations should define the term but include only
specific campus officials, such as the chief law enforcement official on campus or the dean of students, or specific
offices, such as the campus security office. 

Many commenters specifically objected to including campus officials such as deans and residence directors within
the definition of campus security authority. These commenters advanced several arguments: Some commenters said
that students should be able to seek confidential counseling from such administrators before deciding whether to
report a campus crime and that by requiring these administrators to report possible crimes brought to their attention
by students, would undermine the usefulness of the administrators as student advisors and advocates; other commenters
noted that deans and residence directors are not trained in criminal law and that requiring them to report possible
crimes would probably lead to double-counting of crimes, once by the dean or other campus official and once by the campus
police. Several commenters noted that under the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI's) Uniform Crime Reporting
System, determining the number of crime counts is based on law enforcement investigation and does not include determinations
by persons, such as those that might be made by deans and residence directors, who are not law enforcement personnel.
Other commenters said it is unethical to require deans and residence directors to report crimes, that doing so is inconsistent
with the intent of Congress, and that the proposed definition does not clearly exclude campus religious authorities,
such as chaplains. 

Many commenters asked for clarification as to how the definition of a campus security authority relates to the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). 



Discussion: 

Section 485(f)(1)(F) of the HEA requires institutions to disclose statistics of certain campus criminal offenses
reported to campus security authorities and local police agencies. As noted in the preamble to the first NPRM, the
proposed definition of campus security authority, which the statute does not define, represented an attempt to strike
an appropriate balance between the need of individual crime victims for confidential counseling and the need of the
broader campus community for prevention and a complete reporting of campus crime. 

The Secretary continues to believe that to achieve this balance, and to ensure consistent reporting of crime statistics,
it is necessary to define the term campus security authority and to include within the definition a wider range of campus
administrators than those exclusively devoted to criminal or security matters. Therefore, the definition of a campus
security authority includes a campus law enforcement unit, an individual or organization specified in an institution's
statement of campus security policy as the individual or organization to whom students and employees should report
criminal offenses, and an official of an institution who has significant responsibility for student and campus activities,
but does not have significant counseling responsibilities. The Secretary does not agree that including a broader
range of administrators is unethical or unauthorized by the statute; neither is it inappropriate by virtue of their
lack of specific training in criminal law, nor is it likely to lead to double-counting. The function of these administrators
is not to determine authoritatively whether a crime took place_that is the function of law enforcement professionals
working within the criminal justice system_but, with respect to these regulations to report to the appropriate law
enforcement personnel, either campus or local police, those allegations of campus crimes that the administrators
conclude are made in good faith. These administrators would, of course, be free to seek advice from legal experts before
reporting any allegations. In addition, there is no penalty for reporting allegations of campus crime to the appropriate
law enforcement personnel if those allegations turn out to be baseless. If the law enforcement personnel, upon further
investigation, conclude that the allegations reported are not substantiated by the facts or the law, no campus crime
need be disclosed as a statistic. 

Because of the wide variety of institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs, the Secretary acknowledges
that it is not appropriate to identify particular administrators, such as deans and residence directors, by their
titles as being either included or excluded from the definition of campus security authority. Instead, the identifications
must be made in terms of the functions of particular administrators. Institutions are expected to determine which
officials have significant responsibility for student and campus activities and do not have significant counseling
responsibilities for the purpose of this definition and to make this information known to the campus community. The
Secretary notes that it was never the intent of the proposed rule to include chaplains within the meaning of the term
campus security authority. 

Records created and maintained by a campus law enforcement unit, for the purpose of law enforcement, are not education
records and are not protected from disclosure by FERPA. The definition of campus security authority also includes
(1) an individual or organization specified in an institution's statement of campus security policy as the individual
or organization to whom students and employees should report criminal offenses; and (2) an official of an institution
who has significant responsibility for student and campus activities, but does not have significant counseling
responsibilities.

<TEXT>
 

Information on crimes reported to these officials could be included in records classified as protected from non-consensual
disclosure under FERPA regulations. However, FERPA does not prohibit the disclosure of statistical, non-personally
identifiable information. The Secretary does not interpret FERPA to prevent compliance with the timely warning
provision, as in a case of an emergency involving the safety of others_even where the identity of an individual may
be disclosed. 


Changes: 

The Secretary has revised the definition of campus security authority to include, in addition to those individuals
or organizations specified by the institution's statement of campus security policy as those to whom criminal offenses
should be reported, other officials of the institution who have significant responsibility for student and campus
activities, but only if those officials do not have significant counseling responsibilities. The definition has
also been revised expressly to include a campus law enforcement unit. 



Victim's Rights





Comments: 

A number of commenters said that victims should have the option of consulting with student affairs personnel before
deciding whether or not to report the occurrence of a crime. Some commenters said that the victim of a crime on campus
should be allowed to report the crime anonymously. 


Discussion: 

Under these final regulations, victims of a crime on campus remain free to seek confidential counseling from campus
administrators who have significant counseling responsibilities. Section 485(f)(1)(F) of the HEA and these regulations
require the statistical reporting of crimes to the campus community, not personally identifiable accounts of crimes.
A victim who reports a crime to a campus security authority may, of course, request anonymity to the extent practicable
and permitted by local law. 



Changes: 

None. 



Monitoring Crimes On-Campus and Off-Campus 





Comments: 

A few commenters requested that the Secretary require institutions to monitor crimes that take place in areas other
than those proposed in the NPRM. For example, the commenters believe it is within the spirit of the statute to monitor
crime on public and private property that is not owned or controlled by an institution, but that is frequented by the
institution's students. This recommendation would include the neighborhood surrounding the campus. One commenter
indicated that there are many unidentifiable properties within the institution's area that are controlled by recognized
organizations, but that the properties of the organizations are not officially recognized by the institution. 



Discussion: 

Neither the HEA nor these regulations require institutions to gather data and report to the campus community about
off-campus crime. Section 485(f)(1)(F) of the HEA and these regulations require institutions to disclose statistics
about particular crimes that occur on campus. The statute includes in the definition of ``campus'' any building or
property owned or controlled by student organizations recognized by the institution. Institutions should note,
however, that an institution can be considered to control certain space that may be owned by a third party. For example,
some institutions rent space in building owned by a third party; the institution controls the space that it occupies
and that space is covered under these provisions of the HEA. 



Changes: 

None. 



Timely Warning to the Campus Community 





Comments: 

A few commenters requested a clear definition of ``timely reports'' for the purpose of section 485(f)(3) of the HEA
and these regulations, which require an institution to make timely reports to the campus community on crimes that
are reported to campus security authorities or local police and that are considered a threat to other students and
employees. Some commenters believed that timely warnings made by those who are not enforcement personnel could jeopardize
a criminal investigation and allow a suspect to be released. Other commenters believe that the campus community must
be informed of these threats and these provisions allow the law enforcement authorities to receive the evidence to
build a case. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary does not believe that a definition of ``timely reports'' is necessary or warranted. Rather, the Secretary
believes that timely reporting to the campus community for this purpose must be decided on a case-by-case basis in
light of all the facts surrounding a crime, including factors such as the nature of the crime, the continuing danger
to the campus community, and the possible risk of compromising law enforcement efforts. Campus security authorities
should consult the local law enforcement agency for guidance on how and when to release ``timely reports'' to the campus
community. 



Changes: 

None. 



Coordination With State Requirements 





Comment: 

One commenter said that State and Federal requirements pertaining to the disclosure of crime statistics by institutions
should be coordinated with respect to both the types of crimes reported and the dates for disclosure. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary supports coordinated efforts to disclose all required statistical disclosures to the extent they
are consistent with specific requirements of section 485(f) of the HEA and these regulations. 



Changes: 

None. 



Distribution of Annual Security Report





Comments: 

One commenter requested clarification as to the means of distribution of the annual security report. The commenter
wondered whether the institution would be required to mail the security report to current students and employees
or could simply notify them about how to obtain the security report. Another commenter requested the Secretary to
identify those to whom an annual security report is given only upon request. 


Discussion: 

These regulations require that the annual security report be distributed to all current students and employees,
and to any prospective student and employee upon request. As defined in  668.41(b), a prospective student is
one who has requested information concerning admission to the institution. However, because of the importance of
this information regarding personal safety, the Secretary believes that any person requesting information on admission
should be notified of the availability of the report, given a summary of the report, and given an opportunity to request
it. A prospective employee requesting an application for employment from the institution or information about employment
at the institution should be treated in the same manner as a prospective student. The Secretary agrees that these regulations
need to clarify how the report is distributed. 


Changes: 

The regulations have been changed to clarify the methods of distribution that are to be used to ensure individual delivery
of the security report. An institution may choose to distribute the report by any of the following means: (1) Directly
mailing of the report to each individual through the U.S. Postal Service, campus mail, or computer network; or (2)
providing the report directly to each individual (by hand-delivery). Institutions may include the security report
as a part of an institutional publication that is distributed to each individual, such as a catalog, student handbook,
registration materials, or tuition bill. An institution must provide prospective students and employees information
about the availability of the report and a summary of the information in it. 



Reporting Crime Data

<PARENT> FR940429-0-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Comments: 

Some commenters asked if there is a form or format for 
reporting and disclosing crime data. 



Discussion: 

With respect to a prescribed format or form on which 
to disclose and report crime statistics, the Secretary notes that 
an institution may voluntarily participate in the Uniform Crime 
Reporting (UCR) System of the FBI. In this system, there are 
prescribed forms for the reporting of crime. The Secretary notes 
that while the HEA does not mandate participation in the UCR 
System, the HEA does, however, require use of the UCR definitions 
in determining whether a crime has been committed. 



Changes: 

None. 



Institutional Security Policies 





Comments: 

Several commenters asked whether an institution that 
does not have programs to promote the awareness of rape, 
acquaintance rape, and other forcible and nonforcible sex 
offenses is required to establish these programs itself. They 
asked whether an institution could use as educators, in those 
areas, personnel who are experts in their respective fields. 



Discussion: 

Section 485(f) of the HEA requires an institution to 
provide education programs to promote the awareness of rape, 
acquaintance rape, and other sex offenses. An institution may 
contract with experts in these areas, such as rape crisis 
intervention experts, local law enforcement officials, and social service personnel to provide training to students
and 
staff. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comments: 

Two commenters questioned the change in terminology 
from sexual assault to sex offense with regard to procedures 
students should follow if a sex offense occurs. Two commenters 
were concerned over the issue of preserving evidence of a 
criminal offense: one commenter believed that this requirement 
could place the institution in the position of interpreting laws 
regarding evidence. The institutions asked for guidance with 
respect to preserving evidence. Two commenters agreed that a 
student should retain the right, under the regulations, to decide 
whether to report a sex offense. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary changed the term sexual assault to sex 
offense to conform with the statutory provision requiring 
institutions to use the definitions of the FBI's UCR System; 
forcible and nonforcible sex offenses are defined. During 
negotiated rulemaking sessions with the academic community, many 
non-Federal negotiators recommended that institutions be required 
to define what is meant by ``preserving evidence''. The Secretary 
urges institutions to consult with their campus security 
officials, local law enforcement officials, and the local 
prosecutor's office in addressing what constitutes the 
preservation of evidence. The Secretary further encourages 
institutions to develop working relationships with the emergency 
rooms of local hospitals and local rape crisis programs. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comments: 

One commenter asked to what extent an institution is 
required to assist a student in notifying proper authorities of 
the occurrence of a sex offense, if the student requests the 
institution's assistance. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary expects an institution to accommodate 
a victim's request for assistance reasonably. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comments: 

Fifteen commenters addressed the requirement for an 
institution to notify students that the institution will change a 
victim's academic and living situations after an alleged sex 
offense and of the options for such changes, if changes are 
requested by the victim and are reasonably available. Some of 
the commenters recommended that this should apply only to 
institutions that have control over on- and off-campus housing. 
Some community colleges indicated that they do not have the 
experience or resources to handle such a request. Some 
commenters were concerned that this requirement could impose an 
unlimited liability on institutions. Some of the commenters 
asked the Secretary to specify what constitutes acceptable 
accommodation by an institution. 



Discussion: 

With regard to those commenters who expressed 
concern over potential legal liability and those who wish to 
limit the scope of this provision to institutions that control 
housing, it is important to recognize that these requirements 
provide an institution flexibility. Moreover, 
section 485(f)(7)(c) of the HEA provides that no private right of 
action is created by this statute. A change to accommodate a 
victim must be reasonably available. If a change of living or 
academic situation requested by a victim is unreasonable, an 
institution is not required to make the change. As examples, an 
institution could allow a victim out of a housing contract with 
the institution so that the student may pursue off-campus 
housing; on the other hand, if would not be reasonable to expect 
the institution to pay for the rental of a private apartment for 
the student. The Secretary does not believe that it is useful to 
list in these regulations all examples of acceptable 
accommodation. Institutions are expected to make reasonable 
efforts at acceptable accommodation. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comments: 

Four commenters expressed concern that the Secretary 
has not specified how an institution must ensure due process for 
the accused in a campus disciplinary proceeding. The commenters 
were concerned that the institution not take punitive action 
against the accused until all of the evidence is weighed and 
there is a conviction. 



Discussion: 

The commenters are correct that the HEA does not 
provide due process requirements under these provisions; due 
process is a matter of local law and other requirements. The 
purpose of this provision is to provide disclosure of an 
institution's disciplinary procedures with certain minimum 
requirements.

Other Comments 





Comments: 

A few commenters warned that the distribution of 
campus security policies could be dangerous because criminal 
elements might use the information provided to evade detection 
and plan further crimes. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary expects institutions to consider the 
needs of the campus community for which they are providing a 
statement of campus security policies and to be judicious in the 
selection of information to be provided. The Secretary does not 
believe the required disclosures will aid crime. Rather, the 
disclosures will serve to discourage crime on campus. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comments: 

A few commenters said the statistics disclosed of 
campus crimes should represent only verifiable crimes or 
convictions. 



Discussion: 

The occurrence of a crime on campus need not be 
disclosed to students and staff under these regulations unless 
the appropriate law enforcement officials conclude that the crime 
did occur with the same degree of certainty they would require 
for purposes of reporting under the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting 
System. Convictions, however, are not required, because an 
acquittal means only that a specific defendant did not commit the 
crime charged, not that a crime did not occur. For information 
concerning ``Unfounded Complaints'' an institution should refer to 
the UCR Handbook. The Secretary provided this clarification as a 
guide to disclosure requirements. It is in no way to be 
interpreted as discouraging the reporting of crime to the proper 
law enforcement agencies. 



Changes: 

None. 



Executive Order 12866 



These final regulations have been reviewed in accordance 
with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the 
Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this 
regulatory action. 

The potential costs associated with the final regulations 
are those resulting from statutory requirements and those 
determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering 
this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens specifically 
associated with information collection requirements were 
identified and explained in the NPRM. (Approved by the Office of 
Management and Budget under control number 1840-0537)


 
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both 
quantitative and qualitative_of these regulations, the Secretary 
has determined that the benefits of the regulations justify the 
costs. 

The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory 
action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal 
government in the exercise of their governmental functions. 



Assessment of Educational Impact 



In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Secretary 
requested comments on whether the proposed regulations would 
require transmission of information that is being gathered by or 
is available from any other agency or authority of the United 
States. 

Based on the response to the proposed rules and on its own 
review, the Department has determined that the regulations in 
this document do not require transmission of information that is 
being gathered by or is available from any other agency or 
authority of the United States.

Institutional Eligibility Under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as Amended; Final Rule









Federal Register

  Vol. 59, No. 82  Friday, April 29, 1994  Rules and Regulations






DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 









Institutional Eligibility Under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as Amended 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final regulations.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary amends the regulations governing institutional eligibility under the Higher Education Act of 1965,
as amended (HEA). The regulations implement new HEA statutory provisions that were added by the Higher Education
Amendments of 1992 and the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993. In general, these new statutory provisions
tightened the eligibility requirements for institutions participating in the student financial assistance programs
authorized under title IV of the HEA (title IV, HEA programs). The regulations also clarify existing provisions,
and, in keeping with the statutory changes, tighten procedures governing institutional eligibility determinations.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Institutional Eligibility regulations contain requirements that apply to all postsecondary educational institutions
that seek initial or continued eligibility to apply to participate in the programs authorized by the HEA. 



On February 10, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for this part in the 

Federal Register

, 59 FR 6446-6465. The NPRM included a discussion of major issues surrounding the proposed changes that will
not be repeated here. The following list summarizes those issues and identifies the pages of the preamble to the NPRM
on which a discussion of those issues can be found. 

Definitions in  600.2 (pages 6446-6447). 

Institution of higher education in  600.4 (pages 6447-6448). 

Proprietary institution of higher education in  600.5 
(pages 6448-6450). 

Conditions of institutional ineligibility in  600.7 
(pages 6450-6451). 

Treatment of a branch campus in  600.8 (page 6451). 

Written agreement between an eligible institution and another institution or organization in  600.9 (page
6451). 

Date, extent, duration, and consequence of eligibility in  600.10 (pages 6451-6452). 

Special rules regarding institutional accreditation or preaccreditation in  600.11 (page 6452). 

Change in ownership resulting in a change of control in  600.31 (pages 6452-6454). 

Eligibility of additional locations in  600.32 (page 6454). 

Loss of eligibility in  600.40 (page 6454). 

Termination and emergency action proceedings in  600.41 
(page 6454). 

The following discussion describes the significant changes since publication of the NPRM and the manner in which
certain critical provisions will be initially implemented. They are discussed in the order in which they appear in
the text of the regulations. If a provision applies to more than one section or is included in more than one section,
it is discussed the first time it appears with an appropriate reference to its other appearances. 



Section 600.5 Proprietary Institution of Higher Education



With regard to the two-year rule, the Secretary provides exceptions to the requirement that the program an institution
lists on its initial eligibility application be substantially the same as the program it offered for two years preceding
that application. An institution may satisfy the two-year rule even if it substantially changed the subject matter
of its program over the two-year period if that change was made because of new technology or the requirements of other
Federal agencies. In addition, an applicant institution may count as part of the two-year rule any period during which
it was a branch campus. 

These changes also apply to the two-year rule for postsecondary vocational institutions in  600.6. 

The Secretary changed the manner in which an institution calculates whether it satisfies the 85 percent rule. Instead
of determining the amount of title IV, HEA program funds it received over an award year and the amount of revenues it
received over a fiscal year in the fraction set forth in  600.5(d), institutions will use their latest fiscal
year to determine both amounts. Instead of determining the amount of title IV, HEA program funds received on a cash
basis of accounting and the amount of revenue received on an accrual basis of accounting, institutions will use a cash
basis of accounting for both title IV, HEA program funds and revenues. Institutions must report to the Department
of Education that they do not satisfy the 85 percent rule no later than 90 days after the last day of their fiscal year,
and institutions that fail to satisfy the 85 percent rule will become ineligible on the last day of their fiscal year.

Institutions may choose to have either the auditor who prepares its financial statement audit or the auditor who prepares
its title IV, HEA program compliance audit certify to the accuracy of its computations under the 85 percent rule, and
the auditor must submit that certification as part of that audit report. If the auditor determines that the institution
did not accurately calculate whether it satisfied the 85 percent rule, the auditor must include in the audit the correct
amount of title IV, HEA program funds and revenues the institution received in the fiscal year, and the correct ratio
under  600.5(d). 

The Secretary proposed in  600.5(d)(2)(v) that title IV, HEA program funds will be presumed to be used to satisfy
tuition, fees and other institutional charges unless these charges were satisfied with grant funds provided by sources
independent of the institution. This provision is changed so that the presumption would also not apply to institutional
charges that were satisfied with money provided through job training contracts under Federal, State, and local training
programs described in  600.7(d). 

When these regulations become effective on July 1, 1994, a proprietary institution must determine whether it qualifies
as an eligible proprietary institution for award year 1994-95 under the 85 percent rule. The Secretary has developed
special rules for this initial determination. 

If an institution's latest complete fiscal year ended during the period of October 1, 1993 through June 30, 1994, the
institution shall use that fiscal year to determine whether the institution satisfies the 85 percent rule. Such an
institution must notify the Secretary no later than September 30, 1994 if it fails to satisfy the 85 percent rule, and
if the institution fails to satisfy that rule, it becomes ineligible on June 30, 1994. Therefore, as a general matter,
it will be liable for all title IV, HEA program funds it disbursed to its students for award year 1994-95. 

If an institution's latest complete fiscal year ends before October 1, 1993, the institution shall use the fiscal
year that ends between July 1, 1994 and September 30, 1994 as its latest fiscal year to determine whether the institution
satisfies the 85 percent rule. The institution must notify the Secretary if it fails to satisfy the 85 percent rule
within 90 days following the end of that fiscal year, and if it fails to satisfy that rule, it becomes ineligible on the
last day of its fiscal year. 



Section 600.7 Conditions of Institutional Ineligibility



In order to qualify as an eligible institution, starting in award year 1994-95, an institution must not, 

inter alia

, be in violation of the limitations set forth in  600.7. The provisions in that section implement the provisions
in sections 481(a)(3) and 481(a)(4) of the HEA. The former section was effective on October 1, 1992 while the latter
section was effective on July 23, 1992. Accordingly, institutions were subject to those provisions as of those dates.
Until July 1, 1994, the Secretary will view an institution as not violating those statutory limitations if the institution
can demonstrate, under a plausible interpretation of those statutory provisions, that it did not violate those limitations.


Section 600.7 becomes effective on July 1, 1994, and  600.7(a)(1)(i) implements section 481(a)(3). Under
 600.7(a)(1)(i), the Secretary evaluates an institution's eligibility on the basis of the institution's
actions over the latest complete award year. Accordingly, as of July 1, 1994, the latest complete award year is the
1993-94 award year. Thus, for determining whether an institution qualifies as an eligible institution during
award year 1994-95, the institution will use award year 1993-94 for purposes of determining whether more
than 50 percent of its courses were correspondence courses, whether 50 percent or more of its enrolled regular students
were enrolled in correspondence courses, whether 25 percent or more of its enrolled regular students were incarcerated,
and whether 50 percent or more of its enrolled regular students had neither a high school diploma or its recognized
equivalent. 



Waivers



An institution loses its eligibility if more than 50 percent of its regular students are enrolled in correspondence
courses. However, an institution that offers a 2-year associate-degree or 4-year bachelor's-degree program may
receive a waiver of that limitation for ``good cause.'' To receive a waiver, an institution can demonstrate ``good
cause'' if the students enrolled in the institution's correspondence courses receive no more than five (5) percent
of the title IV, HEA program funds received by all the students at that institution during its latest award year. 

An institution loses its eligibility if more than 50 percent of its regular students do not have a high school diploma
or its recognized equivalent (ability to benefit [ATB] students). However, a nonprofit institution may receive
a waiver of this limitation if its enrollment of ATB students exceeded 50 percent of its total enrollment because it
served a substantial number of ATB students through contracts with Federal, State, or local government agencies
during its latest complete award year. 

To receive a waiver, the contract must provide job training for low-income individuals who are in need of that training.
An example of such a contract is a job training contract under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA). 

In addition, an institution may receive a waiver only if no more than 40 percent of its enrollment of regular students
consists of ATB students who are not being served under the above-described contracts. 

If the Secretary grants a waiver to an institution under  600.7, the waiver will extend indefinitely provided
that the 
institution satisfies the waiver requirements in each award year. If an institution fails to satisfy the waiver requirements
for an award year, the institution becomes ineligible on June 30 of that award year.

This section has been changed to provide that an eligible institution may not contract with an ineligible institution
for the latter to provide any portion of an educational program if the ineligible institution had ever been terminated
from participation in the title IV, HEA programs, or had ever withdrawn from such participation while under a termination,
show-cause, suspension, or similar type proceeding initiated by a State licensing agency, accrediting agency,
guaranty agency, or the Department of Education. 


Section 600.30 Institutional Notification Requirements


A substantial number of institutions are structured as, or owned by, partnerships or limited partnerships. Customarily,
the governance of a partnership is vested in the ``general partners'' rather than in a ``board of directors,'' and
the management is under the control of one or more of the general partners rather than under an ``executive officer.''
Accordingly, the term ``a general partner'' is added to  600.30(a)(7)(iv) to clarify that the Secretary considers
a person who is a general partner to be exercising substantial control over the institution. 


Section 600.31 Change of Ownership Resulting in a Change in Control


Commenters expressed apprehension about how the change of ownership rules affect sales in which the parties make
the sale conditional upon securing the Department of Education's certification for the institution under the new
ownership. The regulation has been changed to provide that the Secretary will review an application filed with respect
to a transfer that is subject to any contingency, provided that the sale was otherwise completed. A transfer that is
otherwise final is considered completed even if the seller retains a security interest in the institution or its assets
to assure satisfaction of payment of the purchase price. 
Section 498(i)(3) of the HEA provides that the transfer of the interest of an owner upon his or her death to a family member
or to a current owner may be excluded from its purview. This exclusion would apply readily to the kind of unexpected
transfers of control that would occur of necessity upon the death of an actively-managing principal of an institution
owned by a closely-held corporation. The regulation is changed to adopt the same description of the family of the owner
as that used in  600.30(f). 
The regulation is modified to state that a change of ownership and control of a closely-held corporation occurs when
a person who holds or acquires a legal or beneficial ownership interest in that corporation acquires or relinquishes
control of 50 percent or more of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation. 
The regulation treats the change of control of a registrant with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a
change of ownership and control within the meaning of section 498(i) of the HEA. For other corporations not closely
held, the regulation treats as a change of ownership and control any action by which a person who has or thereby acquires
a legal or beneficial ownership interest in that corporation obtains both ownership of 25 percent of the voting stock
of the corporation, or the right under a proxy, power of attorney, or similar agreement to vote that share, and actual
control. Conversely, relinquishing that control would also constitute a change within the meaning of this section.

The regulation clarifies that a change from a taxable to a tax-exempt entity that qualifies under section 501(c)(3)
of the Internal Revenue Code, or 

vice versa, 

constitutes a change of ownership and control under this section of the regulations. 


Section 600.32 Eligibility of Additional Locations


Section 600.32 has been revised to clarify that the provisions of   600.8 and 600.10 also apply to the eligibility
of additional locations. 


Section 600.40 Loss of Eligibility


The loss of eligibility because of a violation of the 85 percent rule was discussed earlier in connection with  600.5.



Analysis of Comments and Changes 


In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 546 parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations.
An analysis of the comments and of the changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM follows. Substantive
issues are discussed under the section of the regulations to which they pertain. 
Technical and other minor changes_and suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under applicable
statutory authority_are not addressed. 


Comments and Responses 
Section 600.2. Definitions


Branch Campus




Comments: 

Nearly all commenters confused the definition of the term ``branch campus'' with the provisions governing additional
locations. One commenter asked whether an institution's branch campus could be located in a foreign country. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary defined the term ``branch campus'' narrowly in the NPRM and in this final regulation to enable institutions
to expand to serve the legitimate needs of students and communities not in close proximity to their main campuses without
having to undergo a full certification review. Under section 498(j) of the HEA, as amended by the Higher Education
Technical Amendments of 1993, to participate in the title IV, HEA programs, a branch campus must be certified by the

Secretary under the provisions of subpart 3 of part H of title IV of the HEA. Thus, it must separately meet all of the applicable
requirements for participation contained in the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations, 34 CFR part
668. Because a full certification review is a complicated and lengthy process, the Secretary believes that a broad
definition of branch campus would capture numerous off-campus sites of institutions and would seriously deter institutions
from expanding to serve the legitimate needs of students and communities not in close proximity to their main campuses.
The narrow definition avoids this adverse impact. Instead, additional locations of an institution will not necessarily
be treated as branch campuses and thus will be subject to more moderate provisions elsewhere in this part, including
in  600.32. 
A branch campus located in a foreign country may not qualify as an eligible branch campus under the HEA because one of
the statutory requirements for eligibility (other than for purposes of the Federal Family Education Loan programs)
is that the branch be located in a State. 


Changes: 

None. 


Correspondence Course




Comments: 

A commenter suggested that the Secretary classify a course offered partly by correspondence and partly in residential
training as a correspondence course only if the course is more than 50 percent correspondence. 


Discussion: 

In the preamble to the NPRM, the Secretary indicated that a program that is part correspondence and part residential
is considered to be a correspondence program because ``This straightforward interpretation eliminates the need
for the Secretary to address all the troublesome issues involving the quantity of education that an institution claims
to provide in a correspondence program.'' The Secretary is still of that view.

Changes:

Incarcerated Student




Comments: 

Two commenters commended the Secretary's exclusion of persons in half-way houses or home detention or sentenced
to serve on weekends from the definition of ``incarcerated student.'' They noted that this exclusion helps to reduce
burden by eliminating the need to identify and track these individuals. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary appreciates the support for this provision. 


Changes: 

None. 


Recognized Equivalent of a High School Diploma




Comments: 

A few commenters suggested broadening the definition of students who excelled academically in high school. They
suggested that persons in the upper quartile of their high school graduating class and persons who have passed standardized
tests be considered as having excelled in high school. One commenter asked the Secretary to remove this provision
because it could potentially be open to abuse. 
Other commenters noted that the Secretary proposed to consider an academic transcript resulting from the successful
completion of a two-year transfer program to be the recognized equivalent of a high school diploma and suggested that
the following transcripts also be so recognized: the transcript of a student who completed at least one semester or
quarter of a two-year transfer program; and the transcript of a student enrolled in a two-year program if most of the
credits in that program could be transferred to a bachelor's degree program. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that the recognized equivalent of a high school diploma is generally a GED and the two provisions
discussed by the commenter apply only in exceptionally limited circumstances. Therefore, the Secretary does not
believe it useful to expand either provision at this time. The Secretary has reconsidered his position and no longer
believes that a student's class standing in high school is an adequate indication that the student excelled in high
school. The final rules reflect the Secretary's current policy in this area. 


Changes: 

None. 


Sections 600.4, 600.5, and 600.6 Institution of Higher Education, Proprietary Institution of Higher Education,
and Postsecondary Vocational Institution




Comments: 

Several commenters noted that while section 496(e) of the HEA required an institution to submit a dispute with an accrediting
agency regarding its loss of accreditation to initial arbitration prior to bringing other legal action, the NPRM
proposed requiring the institution to agree to binding arbitration. Most of these commenters were concerned that
requiring binding arbitration would violate an institution's right to have its case reviewed in court. Other commenters
noted that while institutions have to agree to binding arbitration, accrediting agencies do not have to so agree.
Another commenter asked whether an institution would retain its institutional eligibility under this part while
it undergoes binding arbitration. 


Discussion: 

In the NPRM, the Secretary stated that he proposed that an institution agree to binding arbitration ``so that any legal
action after arbitration would be limited to whether the arbitrator's decision was arbitrary or capricious. The
Secretary believes that this approach best carries out the purpose of section 496(e) by limiting, to the maximum extent
possible, litigation in this area.'' The Secretary is still of this view. 
The Secretary recognizes that the HEA does not specifically require an accrediting agency to agree to binding arbitration
but anticipates that accrediting agencies will agree to such arbitration without the necessity of a regulatory requirement
since it significantly limits the cost and length of appeals of their final decisions. Moreover, if an accrediting
agency does not agree to binding arbitration, institutions will be free to appeal their final adverse decisions in
federal courts. 
If an institution loses its accreditation as a result of a final accrediting agency action, it loses its eligibility
under this part because of its lack of accreditation. If it takes that accrediting agency to binding arbitration,
it will not regain that eligibility unless the arbitrator requires the agency to restore the institution's accreditation.



Changes: 

None. 


Section 600.5 Proprietary Institution of Higher Education


Two-year rule




Comment: 

Several commenters questioned how the Secretary would determine whether a program offered for two years prior to
an institution's initial eligibility application was substantially the same as a program it listed in its application
for approval.

</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940429-0-00139 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940429-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Other commenters were concerned that a new institution would not be able to make substantive changes in curriculum
to keep up with new technology and changes in industry and marketplace requirements. One commenter explained that
other Federal agencies may have regulations that affect course content and length and suggested that if the Secretary
retained language prohibiting institutions from changing courses substantially in content and length, the provision
be revised to allow for course content and length changes necessitated by regulations of other Federal agencies.
Another commenter was concerned that a new institution would never be able to change its courses. Other commenters
suggested that accrediting agencies and State Postsecondary Review Entities (SPREs) would monitor program integrity
and quality and a shorter period than two years could be used. 


Discussion: 

As the Secretary indicated in the preamble to the NPRM, the purpose behind this provision is to prevent an institution
from offering a minimal program during the first two years of its existence and then expanding its programs when it
becomes eligible to participate in the title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary believes that the best way to support
this purpose is to require an institution to offer over the two-year period a training program that is substantially
the same in terms of subject matter and length as the training program it offers when it applies for institutional eligibility.
However, the Secretary agrees with the point made by some commenters that some flexibility should be provided with
regard to the subject matter of a program to take into account new technology and requirements of other Federal agencies.
The Secretary does not agree with the suggestion that an institution should be able to make substantive changes in
the subject matter of a program because of changes in market conditions. 
The Secretary considers programs to be substantially the same if they are listed within the same generic series and
codes defined in Chapter I, Academic and Occupationally Specific Programs, published by the Secretary in the Classification
of Instructional Programs, Second Edition (1990). 
The Secretary considers a program to be substantially the same in terms of length as the program the institution is
currently offering if the program offered over the two-year period would qualify the applicant to be an eligible proprietary
institution of higher education or eligible postsecondary vocational institution. Thus, in general, the program
must provide at least 20 weeks of instructional time and at least 
16 semester hours, 24 quarter hours, or 600 clock hours. 


Changes: 

The Secretary will permit an institution to demonstrate that the subject matter of its program changed substantially
over the two-year period because of new technology or the requirements of other Federal agencies. 


Comment: 

A number of commenters suggested that the institutional portions of programs, such as the Federal SEOG and Federal
Perkins programs, should not be included in the numerator since the money comes from the institution and not the Federal
Government. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees. An institution should not include institutional matching funds in the numerator as part of
its title IV, HEA program funds. 


Changes: 

None. 


Comment: 

A number of commenters discussed the presumption that title IV, HEA program funds are used to satisfy tuition, fees
and other institutional charges unless these charges were satisfied with grant funds provided by sources independent
of the institution. Commenters suggested that the above presumption should not apply if the tuition, fees and other
institutional charges were satisfied with money provided by other Federal agencies, such as the Department of Veterans
Affairs, or through job training contracts under Federal, State, or local training programs, such as the Job Training
Partnership Act (JTPA). 


Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees with the commenters with regard to funds received by an institution under a job training contract
under Federal, State, or local training programs since the Congress in the Higher Education Technical Amendments
of 1993 provided for an exception to the ability to benefit (ATB) enrollment limitation for institutions serving
ATB students under such contracts. 



Changes: 

Section 600.5(d)(2)(v) has been amended to allow an institution to consider that a student's tuition, fees and other
institutional charges were satisfied from funds provided under contracts described in  600.7(d). 


Comment: 

A number of commenters suggested that the definition of ``revenue'' in the denominator used in  600.5(d)(1)
is too narrow and should be expanded. 


Discussion: 

As indicated in the preamble to the NPRM, the Secretary believes the definition of the term ``revenue'' establishes
a reasonable middle ground between counting only the income received from students' tuition and fees and counting
as revenue income from businesses that are owned and operated by the institution, regardless of the relationship
between the educational institution and the businesses. 


Changes: 

None. 


Comment: 

A number of commenters suggested that revenue from contract training (on or off-site) provided by the institution
to business and industry be included as revenue in the denominator in  600.5(d)(1) since this type of training
is directly related to the curriculum offered by the institution. 


Discussion: 

An institution can count as revenue only tuition, fees, and institutional charges for students enrolled in eligible
programs at the institution, and funds received for activities that are necessary to the education or training of
those students enrolled in eligible programs. Therefore, whether an institution can count as revenue in the denominator
of the fraction in  600.5(d)(1) the revenue described by the commenters depends on whether an institution's
contract training programs qualify as eligible programs.

Changes: 

Section 600.5(d)(1) has been amended to clarify this requirement. 



Comment: 

Several commenters suggested that an institution should be allowed to include institutional charges that were paid
by institutional scholarships and loans as revenue in the denominator of the fraction contained in  600.5(d)(1).
One commenter said that his school awarded $1,000 institutional scholarships to all students in the second year of
their program. The commenter felt strongly that his institution should be able to include these scholarships as institutional
revenues. 




Discussion:

 An institution is not prohibited from including institutional charges that were paid by institutional scholarships
and institutional loans as revenue in the denominator of the fraction contained in  600.5(d)(1), provided
that the scholarships and loans are valid and not just part of a scheme to artificially inflate an institution's tuition
and fee charges. For this purpose, the Secretary does not consider institutional loans to be real unless such loans
are routinely repaid by the student borrowers. The Secretary does not consider institutional scholarships to be
valid if every student receives such a scholarship so that no student ever pays the claimed tuition and fee charges.
The Secretary considers the above-described practice of the commenter to be a classic example of this scheme. 


In this connection, the Secretary will scrutinize institutions that raise their tuition and fee charges to avoid
the 85 percent rule but can show no actual payment of those additional charges, or payment through ``artificial''
institutional scholarships and loans. 



Changes:

 None. 




Comment:

 A number of commenters suggested that non-need-based title IV, HEA program assistance, such as funds under the Federal
PLUS Loan Program, the Federal SLS Program, and the unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan Program, should not be included
in the numerator of the 85 percent rule calculation because it is unrealistic to penalize an institution whose students
chose to borrow under these programs. 




Discussion:

 The statutory provision that established the 85 percent rule, section 481(b)(6) of the HEA, provides that an eligible
proprietary institution must have at least 15 percent of its revenues that ``are not derived from funds provided under
this title,'' i.e., title IV of the HEA. Section 481(b)(6) does not differentiate between ``need-based'' title IV,
HEA program funds and non-need-based title IV, HEA program funds. However, when determining the amount of title IV,
HEA program funds derived from FFEL programs or the Federal Direct Loan Program, the institution should only include
loan proceeds disbursed to students. It should not include the face amount of a loan because that amount includes loan
origination fees and loan guarantee fees that are not disbursed to students. 



Changes:

 None. 




Comment:

 A number of commenters pointed out problems with the fraction the Secretary proposed to determine whether an institution
satisfies the 85 percent rule. The commenters noted that the title IV, HEA program funds in the numerator were reported
on an award year basis but the revenues in the denominator were reported on a fiscal year basis. The commenters indicated
that when the institution's fiscal year does not coincide with an award year, the computation would not provide reliable
results. 


In addition, a number of commenters raised concerns that the information reported in the numerator and denominator
would be produced under two different methods of accounting. Several auditing organizations noted that the title
IV, HEA program funds must be reported in the numerator on a cash basis of accounting (received). They further noted
that the revenue figure in the denominator would be verified through the use of a financial statement audit, and in
accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), financial statements are prepared on an accrual
basis of accounting. The commenters concluded that it does not make sense to compare the amount determined in the numerator
with the amount determined in the denominator when each number is determined under a different basis of accounting.










Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenters about the deficiencies in the proposed rule and has made the following changes.
First, the Secretary agrees that there should be a common reporting period for the numerator and the denominator.
The Secretary will not require institutions to change their fiscal year to parallel an award year. Therefore, although
the Secretary will be giving up a degree of oversight, the Secretary will allow institutions to use their fiscal year
as the reporting period for the numerator as well as the denominator. 


Second, since institutions must report and account for title IV, HEA program funds on a cash basis, the institution
must also account for revenue in the denominator on a cash basis. Under a cash basis of accounting, the institution
reports revenues on the date that the revenues are actually received. 


An institution's computation must be verified as part of the institution's title IV, HEA program compliance audit
or as part of its financial statement audit. The institution may choose which audit will include the verification.




Changes:

 Section 600.5 is amended as follows: institutions will report title IV, HEA program funds in the numerator of the fraction
set forth in  600.5(d) on a fiscal year basis and that fiscal year will be the same fiscal year used to report revenues
in the denominator of that fraction; institutions will report revenues in the denominator on a cash basis of accounting;
and institutional computations will be verified in financial statement audits or title IV, HEA program compliance
audits. 




Comment:

 Several commenters suggested that 30 or 60 days after an award year or fiscal year does not provide enough time for an
institution to compute its percentage of title IV, HEA program funds because of possible year-end adjustments and
because the institution's computation must be verified by the financial audit.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940429-0-00141 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940429-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees with the commenters that institutions may need an additional period to take possible year-end
adjustments into account. Therefore, the Secretary will allow an institution up to 90 days from the last day of its
fiscal year to report that it fails to satisfy the 85 percent rule. However, if an institution determines that it fails
to satisfy the 85 percent rule, it will be ineligible as of the last day of that fiscal year; therefore the longer an institution
takes to report its ineligibility, the greater its potential liability for improperly disbursed title IV, HEA program
funds. 

The Secretary believes that an institution does not need to wait for an audit to determine the percent of its revenue
that was derived from title IV, HEA program funds. The institution should be keeping track of these amounts over the
course of its fiscal year to avoid becoming ineligible. Moreover, since an institution must now determine its revenues
on a cash accounting basis, it is relatively easy for an institution to know its position relative to the 85 percent
rule. 


Changes:

 An institution will have 90 days from the last day of its fiscal year to report its ineligibility to the Department of
Education under the 85 percent rule. 


Comment:

 A number of commenters suggested that although an institution may give its best efforts to track revenues and keep
within the guidelines of the 85 percent rule, the institution will not know positively of the result until its annual
audited financial statement is completed. The commenters suggested that given the dire consequences of having title
IV, HEA program funds exceed 85 percent of its revenues, and the fact that a great many students could be potentially
harmed by such precipitous action, the Secretary should add a provision that allows an institution to voluntarily
refund any excess money to bring its percentage in compliance with the 85 percent rule. 


Discussion:

 The purpose of the 85 percent rule is to preclude the participation in the title IV, HEA programs of proprietary institutions
of higher education whose overwhelming source of revenue is title IV, HEA program funds. The repayment of title-IV,
HEA program funds to the Department of Education is not consistent with that statutory purpose. Moreover, since a
refund of title IV, HEA program funds would reduce both the numerator and denominator of the fraction used to determine
this rule, any conforming refund would involve a significantly large amount of money. 


Changes: 

None. 


Section 600.7 Conditions of Institutional Ineligibility





Comment:

 As a general rule, an institution may not have 
50 percent or more of its students enrolled in correspondence courses and retain its eligibility under the HEA. However,
as a result of the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993, the Secretary may waive this requirement for an institution
that offers a 2-year associate-degree or 4-year bachelor's-degree program for ``good cause.'' In the NPRM, the Secretary
solicited comments as to what should be considered ``good cause''. 
One comment was received on this provision. The commenter suggested that a waiver should be granted for ``good cause''
only if the students attending the institution's correspondence courses received a minimal percent of the title
IV, HEA programs at that institution. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenter's suggestion. 


Changes:

 Section 600. 7(b)(3) has been amended to provide that the Secretary will waive this requirement for an institution
that offers a 2-year associate-degree or 4-year bachelor's-degree program if the students enrolled in the institution's
correspondence courses receive no more than 5 percent of the title IV, HEA program funds received by students at that
institution. 


Comment:

 One commenter suggested that an institution should not permanently lose its eligibility if its current owner or Chief
Executive Officer (CEO) has been found guilty of a crime involving title IV, HEA program funds and that owner or CEO
disassociates himself or herself from the institution. The commenter also asked for clarification as to what is meant
by ``judicially determined to have committed fraud.'' 


Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that if the current owner or CEO of an institution has been found guilty of a crime involving
title IV, HEA program funds, that institution should no longer be eligible to participate in the title IV, HEA programs.
The phrase ``judicially determined to have committed fraud'' means that a court of competent jurisdiction has made
such a finding. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comment:

 Section 481(a)(3)(D) of the HEA provides that an institution that does not offer an associate or bachelor's degree
is not an eligible institution if more than 50 percent of its enrollment consists of students without a high school
diploma or its recognized equivalent (ATB students). As a result of an amendment by the Higher Education Technical
Amendments of 1993, the Secretary may waive the limitation for nonprofit institutions. However, to receive a waiver,
the institution must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it exceeds the limitation because it serves,
through contracts with Federal, State, or local government agencies, significant numbers of ATB students. 
In the NPRM, the Secretary requested comments regarding the conditions under which the Secretary should grant this
waiver. Comments were particularly requested on the purpose of the referenced contracts, what constitutes a ``significant''
number of ATB students, and the duration of a waiver. 
Two commenters suggested that an institution should receive a waiver if the purpose of the referenced contracts is
to provide job training for low-income people who are in need of such services. 
One commenter suggested that 20 to 25 percent of an institution's enrollment constitutes a significant number, another
suggested 40 percent, and yet another suggested 50 percent. 
One commenter suggested that a waiver should be issued for a period of one year at a time, renewable on a yearly basis,
depending upon graduation and employment rates. A second commenter suggested that a waiver should be issued for the
duration of the certification agreement period. A third commenter suggested that the waiver should be issued for
the period in which the institution is in good standing with its accrediting agency. 


Discussion:

 For purposes of granting this waiver, the Secretary agrees with the commenters regarding the type of contract that
supports a waiver. The Secretary thus agrees that the contracts must provide job training for low-income individuals
who are in need of such services. An example of such a contract is a job training contract under the Job Training Partnership
Act (JTPA). 
Further, to receive a waiver, an institution must demonstrate that its enrollment of ATB students exceeded 50 percent
of its total enrollment because it served a substantial number of those students through contracts. That is, the institution
must demonstrate cause and effect; it exceeded the statutory limit because it served a significant number of ATB students
through contracts. 
An institution cannot satisfy this waiver provision simply by demonstrating it served a large number of ATB students
under a contract. For example, if an institution's enrollment of ATB students who were not served under contract exceeded
51 percent of its total enrollment, that institution would not satisfy the waiver requirement regardless of the number
of additional ATB students it served under contract. Similarly, if an institution's enrollment of ATB students who
were not served under contract equaled 50 percent of its total enrollment, so that one additional ATB student would
put the institution over the 50 percent limitation, the institution would not satisfy the waiver requirement regardless
of the number of additional ATB students it served under contract. In neither case did the institution's enrollment
of ATB students exceed 50 percent of its total enrollment because it served a significant number of ATB students under
contract. 
In view of the above, the critical factor in whether an institution qualifies for a waiver is the percentage of its enrollment
who are ATB students not being served under contract. 
An institution is evaluated to determine whether it falls within the limitation set forth in  600.7(a)(1)(i)
on an 
award-year basis. If the Secretary grants a waiver to an institution under this section, the waiver will extend indefinitely
provided that the institution satisfies the waiver requirements in each award year. If an institution fails to satisfy
the waiver requirements for an award year, the institution becomes ineligible on June 30 of that award year. (This
policy is applicable to all waivers provided for under  600.7.)

Changes:

 An institution may receive a waiver if the contracts provide job training for low-income individuals who are in need

under contract exceeds 40 percent of its total enrollment. If the Secretary grants a waiver to an institution under
this section, the waiver will extend indefinitely provided that the institution satisfies the waiver requirements

ineligible on June 30 of that award year. 


Section 600.9 Written Agreement Between an Eligible Institution and Another Institution or Organization




Comment:

 One commenter suggested that the provision that requires an eligible institution to give credit to students enrolled
in a contracted program on the same basis as if it provided that program itself be modified to make an exception in 
the case of study abroad programs approved for credit by the eligible institution. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that this rule should apply to all contracted programs, including contracted programs involving
study abroad. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comment:

 One commenter noted that this section prevents an eligible institution from entering into an agreement with an ineligible
institution if that institution had its eligibility to participate in the title IV, HEA programs terminated by the
Secretary. The commenter suggested that this provision be expanded to prevent an eligible institution from entering
into an agreement with an ineligible institution that withdrew from participating in the title IV, HEA programs under
a show-cause or suspension order issued by the institution's State licensing agency, accrediting agency, guarantor,
State Postsecondary Review Entity (SPRE), or the Secretary. On the other hand, another commenter suggested removing
this provision entirely since it could eliminate teachout agreements when institutions close and could prevent
students from participating in valuable educational programs. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenter's suggestion that it is inappropriate for an eligible institution to contract
with an ineligible institution that had its eligibility to participate in the title IV, HEA programs terminated or
that 
withdrew from participating in the title IV, HEA programs under a termination, show-cause, suspension, or similar
type proceeding initiated by the institution's State licensing agency, accrediting agency, guarantor, or SPRE,
or by the Secretary. Moreover, the Secretary believes that this limitation should also apply to contracts under which
the ineligible institution provides 25 percent or less of the eligible institution's program. The Secretary believes
that there are a sufficient number of eligible institutions to allow teachouts of students whose institutions closed.



Changes:

 Section 600.9 is amended to preclude an eligible institution from contracting any portion of its educational program
to an ineligible institution that had its participation in the title IV, HEA programs terminated by the Secretary,
or that withdrew from that participation under termination, 
show-cause, suspension, or similar type proceeding initiated by the institution's State licensing agency, accrediting
agency, guarantor, or SPRE, or by the Secretary. 


Section 600.10 Date, Extent, Duration, and Consequences of Eligibility 




Comment:

 Several commenters suggested that it is unfair to require that certain new educational programs have to be approved
by the Secretary as eligible programs before students enrolled in those programs would be eligible to receive title
IV, HEA program funds. The commenters felt that this would place an undue burden 
on the institution and the students the institution is attempting to serve by creating delays in new program implementation.



Discussion:

 Prior to the issuance of the Institutional Eligibility regulations in April of 1988, it was the Secretary's practice
to require institutions to apply to the Department of Education to have any new program designated as an eligible program
before students enrolled in that program could receive 
title IV, HEA program funds. The Secretary changed this practice in the regulation to reduce the burden on institutions
and the Department of Education. 
Under current regulations, an institution could determine on its own whether a new educational program qualified
as an eligible program. However, the institution would be liable for all title IV, HEA program funds it disbursed to
students enrolled in a new program if the institution incorrectly determined that the program qualified as an eligible
program. 
The Secretary has found that this new practice has not worked out. The Secretary has found that when institutions have
made incorrect determinations regarding whether a new educational program is an eligible program, the liability
associated with that incorrect determination was usually too high to be repaid. Moreover, this practice is inconsistent
with the new emphasis on ``gatekeeping'' as evidenced in Program Integrity Triad legislation, particularly with
respect to the certification process. 
The Secretary has found that most problems in this area come from an institution offering new, short-term vocational
programs. Therefore in the NPRM, the Secretary has not required preapproval for new programs leading to an associate
degree or higher, or new vocational programs similar to the ones the institution already provides. The Secretary
retains this position in the final rule and believes that this procedure provides a proper balance between the need
of institutions to provide title IV, HEA program funds to students enrolled in new programs, and the need to limit abusive
practices of certain institutions. 


Changes:

 None. 


Section 600.20 Application Procedures

Comment:

 Several commenters expressed concern about when and how to apply for renewal of eligibility. One commenter believed
that institutions should have to apply to have eligibility extended to educational programs. 



Discussion:

 With regard to an institution's eligibility for purposes of the title IV, HEA programs,  600.10(d)(1) provides
that an institution's eligibility designation for the title IV, HEA programs will expire when the institution's
program participation agreement expires. Section 498(g) of the HEA requires the Secretary to establish a schedule
for the expiration of those program participation agreements. When this schedule is established, the Secretary
will notify each institution well in advance of the scheduled expiration of its program participation agreement
of the need to reapply in order to continue its eligibility designation without interruption. Similarly, the Secretary
will provide each institution with the necessary information about the forms to use and the date by which the application
must be submitted. 

Once an institution has undergone a reapproval review, if it is approved, it will receive a program participation
agreement with a specific expiration date. Thereafter, it is the institution's responsibility to reapply for approval
to continue its eligibility to participate in the title IV, HEA programs beyond the expiration date. 

The Secretary has addressed the addition of new educational programs in connection with  600.10(c). 



Changes:

 None. 



Section 600.30 Notification Requirements





Comments:

 Several commenters noted that institutions would be required to notify the Secretary of certain changes within 10
days of occurrence, but that it was unclear whether such changes would necessitate the filing of a new application
and reestablishing eligibility, especially with respect to such changes as changes in boards of directors and percent
of ownership interest. 




Discussion:

 Section 600.30 specifies the institutional changes of which the Secretary must be advised. Upon receipt of the notification,
the Secretary will advise the institution of any additional information that needs to be provided and whether the
institution needs to file an application. Section 600.20 identifies those key circumstances in which an institution
is always required to file an application. However, the Secretary retains the authority to request that an institution
undergo a reevaluation of institutional eligibility and certification whenever warranted. It should be noted that
the new institutional eligibility application will consist of a cover sheet plus separate schedules that deal with
the institution's additional locations, educational programs, boards of directors, etc. Thus an institution that
has a change in its board of directors or a change in the address of one of its locations may be asked to submit an application,
but that application may consist only of the application cover sheet and the appropriate schedule(s). 

In summary,   600.20, 600.21, and 600.30 taken together explain what an institution is required to do
and when. 



Changes:

 None. 



Section 600.31 Change in Ownership Resulting in a Change in Control





Comment:

 A commenter expressed the view that the statute did not require that divisions, mergers or consolidations of public
or private non-profit institutions be treated as changes of ownership under section 498(i) of the HEA and objected
to their inclusion in the requirements of this section of the regulation. The basis for the comment is the list of examples
in section 498(e) of the HEA of an ``ownership interest.'' The commenter noted that these examples are not typical
of the ownership of public or non-profit entities. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary disagrees with the commenter. As indicated in section 498(e) of the HEA, the list of examples provided
is not exclusive, and the examples of change of ownership and control included in section 498(i) of the HEA include
transactions that public and non-profit institutions undergo, such as sales, mergers, and divisions. Therefore,
such changes of ownership and control are covered by  600.31 and could cause the eligibility of those institutions
to lapse. 

With regard to changes of ownership of non-profit institutions, where the non-profit institution is incorporated
as a stock corporation, the same bright lines used to identify changes of ownership constituting changes of control
for other stock corporations will apply. For non-profit institutions organized as member corporations, the corresponding
interest is the membership interest, and those rules should apply in the same way to changes in the membership of the
non-profit institutions. Changes of ownership and control also occur with regard to institutions that are owned
by non-profit corporations; changes in the persons or individuals who by virtue of their membership in the non-profit
corporation own the institution can result in a change of ownership and control of that institution. The bright lines
that identify changes of ownership and control of other corporations apply to changes in the membership of non-profit
corporations as well. 

In connection with any change of ownership, whether a transfer of the assets and educational enterprise of an institution
to another institution is a change within this section, or is subject to  600.32 turns on whether the institution
continues to function as a separate educational enterprise after the transfer. If the entity that acquires the institution
continues the operation of that institution not as a separate institution but as part of another institution, the
transaction would be considered an acquisition of an additional location and would be subject to  600.32. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comment:

 Commenters expressed apprehension about how the change of ownership rules affect sales in which the parties make
the sale conditional upon securing the Department's certification for the institution under the new ownership.
Commenters believed that the proposal that the Department would not review the school under the new ownership until
the sale has been completed would tend to foster undesirable disruption of title IV, HEA program funding and pose a
threat to continued training of students enrolled at the time of the sale. Commenters urged adoption of a procedure
in which the Department would review a proposed transfer of ownership before the consummation of the sale, so that
the sale could be aborted if certification were denied. A commenter suggested consideration of a preapproval procedure
described as used by other agencies in which the Department would review a proposed sale, and, if the institution under
the new ownership would qualify for certification, offer the certification on the condition that the sale be fully
consummated promptly.

Discussion:

 The Secretary recognizes the importance of reducing possible interruption in funding to the extent consistent with
the conduct of a responsible review of the financial and administrative capability of the school under new ownership.


The Department currently reviews only transfers that have taken effect, and thereby have caused the eligibility
and certification of the institution to lapse, even if the transfer is subject to a condition 

subsequent

, such as obtaining the Department's approval and certification. The Department has taken this position because
it ensures that the parties submit only transfers under which the purchaser has conducted the requisite due diligence
to ensure that approval and certification will be granted. The Secretary believes this position is fair because the
regulations state fully the standards under which the qualifications of the school for certification will be measured,
and because virtually all the information on which approval of the institution under new ownership depends is fully
available to, and in many instances derived directly from, the institution. 

The Secretary sees no reason why a purchaser should not be able and expected to have made a fully informed decision to
purchase before submitting the application for certification. Unfortunately, in the past, purchasers have often
engaged in wholly inadequate due diligence, given scant professional attention to the requirements for participation
in the student assistance programs, and presented seriously deficient applications for approval. These deficiencies
unnecessarily consume Department review resources and needlessly delay approval decisions for the institution.
Lack of competent due diligence also results in other purchasers purporting to be unaware of problems with the qualifications
of the institution they have purchased that are serious enough to make Department approval impossible. The Secretary's
procedure for review of change of ownership applications will foster responsible and effective due diligence by
the purchaser. 



Changes:

 The regulation provides that the Secretary will review an application filed with respect to a transfer that is subject
to any contingency, provided that the sale was otherwise completed. A transfer that is otherwise final is considered
completed even if the seller retains a security interest in the institution or its assets to assure satisfaction of
payment of the purchase price. 



Comment:

 Several commenters believed that a transfer of ownership to a person who had been engaged in management of the school
should not be considered a change within the meaning of section 498(i) of the HEA. Others urged excluding transfers
of ownership interests among current shareholders, particularly if the institution was owned by a close corporation
and the shareholders had held those interests for several years or the shareholder acquiring the controlling interest
had been engaged in managing of that institution. Other commenters urged that transfers of controlling ownership
interests from the owner upon retirement to a shareholder currently involved in management of the school be excluded
from changes in ownership within the meaning of section 498(i) of the HEA. 



Discussion:

 Section 498(i) of the HEA requires an institution to reestablish its educational credentials and its administrative
and financial capability after a change of ownership and control. Transfers of ownership commonly take place between
those holding the controlling interest in the institution and individuals who have been managing the institution.
While there may often be a continuity of management and administration through such transfers of ownership, the financial
capability of the institution after the current managers assume controlling ownership interests may be dramatically
different than under the prior owner, particularly where the transaction is structured as an asset sale rather than
a stock transaction. The fact that the new owner already had an ownership interest, or was involved in management of
the institution, or both, does not provide assurance that scrutiny can responsibly be waived for those reasons. 

Section 498(i)(3) of the HEA does provide that the transfer of the interest of an owner upon his or her death to a family
member or to a current owner 

may

 be excluded from its purview. This exclusion would apply readily to the kind of unexpected transfers of control that
would occur of necessity upon the death of an actively-managing principal of an institution owned by a closely-held
corporation. However, the rationale for deferring to this humanitarian objective of facilitating a smooth transition
in this narrow circumstance does not support waiving otherwise-mandated scrutiny in a broader range of transfers
involving corporations that are not closely held, or planned transfers to those who have neither an ownership interest
nor any managerial involvement in the institution. The Secretary considers it prudent to limit the waiver at this
time only to those transfers of the interest of a deceased or retiring owner either to one who is a current manager and
owner of the institution or to an immediate family member, and to evaluate the consequences of this kind of waiver,
before considering further waivers. 



Changes:

 The regulation is changed to adopt the same description of the family of the owner as that used in  600.31(f).




Comment:

 Most commenters welcomed the adoption of bright-line tests for identifying changes of ownership and control, and
the use of the acquisition or relinquishment of a 50 percent interest in the institution or its owner was generally
agreed as a suitable line. Some commenters stressed the importance of looking to control rather than simply percentage
of ownership interest, and urged that a transfer of ownership interest between active and passive investors be disregarded
if the transfer did not change the control of the institution. 



Discussion:

 In proposing that the term ``control'' as used in section 498(i) of the HEA and current regulations be interpreted
with reference to SEC regulations, 17 CFR part 230.405, the Secretary intended to recognize that ``the power to direct
or cause the direction of the management and policies, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract,
or otherwise,'' included the power held by a managing partner or active investor to effectively direct the decisions
and policies of the partnership or corporation. Therefore, the intent and effect of the proposed rule was to recognize
that a transfer of an ownership interest to one who holds some ownership interest and who already had the power to direct
the management of the entity does not constitute a change of ownership resulting in a change in control. Such transfers
do not fall within the purview of this section.

Although there appeared to be general support for adoption of the 50 percent standard for identifying the possession
of ownership and control of a closely-held corporation, the manner in which this was described suggested some need
to reaffirm how the test would actually apply. 

In interpreting section 498(i) of the HEA, which does not itself define change of ownership resulting in a change in
control, but gives as examples of such changes a list taken almost verbatim from Department regulations in effect
for many years, the Secretary considers Congress to have intended that the mandate of section 498(i) of the HEA be applied
in situations that would have triggered changes under the Department's regulations. Like the SEC definition of control,
with which businessmen and practitioners can be expected to be already thoroughly familiar, both the proposed rule
and current Department regulations focus on the acquisition_through ``any action''_of ``new authority to control
the actions of the institution'' by one with a legal or beneficial ownership interest in the entity. A person may already
have acquired an ownership interest and then acquire such new authority, or may in a single transaction acquire both
an ownership interest and control. In either case, the transaction changes the control group for that institution
to a degree that warrants the scrutiny mandated in section 498(i) of the HEA. Actions by which a person who has no legal
or beneficial ownership interest gains or loses ``control'' are not changes of ownership and control within the meaning
of the regulation unless the person acquires an ownership interest in that action. 

Therefore, the 50-percent test is simply meant to identify those situations in which a person becomes owner or controller
of the majority of the voting stock of a closely-held corporation. Conversely, the power to direct the management
and decisions of the corporation can reasonably be presumed to change, and therefore to warrant scrutiny of the continued
capability of the institution, when a person who held control of the majority of the stock loses that control, even
if no other single person thereby gains that control. The test is met therefore when a person with an ownership interest
in any amount acquires control of 50 percent of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation, or when a person who
has an ownership interest and control of 50 percent of the voting stock relinquishes that degree of control. Very small
changes in ownership and/or control can be enough to change control. To control a closely-held corporation, a person
who already holds an ownership interest need not acquire an additional 50 percent share in order to control the corporation;
a shareholder with ownership or control of 49 percent of the voting stock need only acquire either ownership or control
of another percent of that stock to achieve at very least equal power with any other person, and by acquiring an added
two percent, would hold greater power than any other person to direct the management and policies of the corporation.
Relinquishing those minor shares of control results in the person having less than control of a majority of the voting
stock of the corporation, and causes a change of ownership and control of the corporation. 



Changes: 

The regulation is modified to state that a change of ownership and control of a closely-held corporation occurs when
a person who holds or acquires a legal or beneficial ownership interest in that corporation acquires or relinquishes
control of 50 percent or more of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation. 



Comments: 

Commenters generally agreed that for those corporations whose stock is registered with the SEC, using the events
that would constitute a change of control of the corporation so as to trigger an obligation to file an SEC Form 8-K
would be a suitable bright line for identifying changes of ownership and control within the meaning of section 498(i)
of the HEA for institutions owned by those corporations. Commenters differed in their reactions to the proposal to
adopt a 25 percent ownership interest with actual control as the test for corporations that are neither closely held
nor registrants with the SEC. Still others thought that the 25 percent test should be used even for SEC registered corporations.
Other commenters believed that the 50 percent test applied to closely-held corporations should be used for all others
as well. 



Discussion: 

As noted earlier and as apparent from a number of the comments, SEC registrants already have an obligation, with which
they are presumably comfortable and familiar, to notify the SEC when management identifies a change of control, which
presumably is invariably accompanied by, or presupposes, the acquisition of an ownership interest. Because of this
obvious familiarity of the affected parties, the relative similarities of the objectives of the two rules, and the
difficulty in creating any new bright line that would be meaningful in this area, 
adopting the SEC test makes good sense for publicly-traded corporations. 

For corporations that are neither closely held nor publicly traded, creating a bright line is difficult, and it is
desirable therefore to use, to the extent practical, regulatory standards that have already applied to this category
of institutions. As the Secretary noted in proposing the rule, Department regulations have recognized that a person
who holds or acquires the power to vote a 25 percent ownership interest may reasonably be presumed to have the ability
to ``affect substantially the actions of the institution.'' (See 34 CFR part 668.13(c)(5)(i), [or, in the words of
the proposed  668.15(c)(1), (f)(2), to ``exercise substantial control over an institution.'' February 28,
1994, 59 FR 9568-69].) ``Substantial'' control may differ from control, and the presumptions in that section
are warranted for persons with records of misfeasance with title IV, HEA program funds, but may not warrant the disruption
of mandated scrutiny for transfers of ownership and control involving other persons. Because of the wide variety
of circumstances and institutions that may be neither closely held nor publicly traded, the use of this same bright
line where it is also accompanied by real control_judged by the facts of the particular case_seems a fair test that
should be consistent with, and build on, current standards. Acquisition of a 25 percent ownership interest, or the
right to vote such an interest, with actual control, constitutes a change within the meaning of section 498(i) of the
HEA for these corporations. Holding or acquiring such an ownership share would not constitute a change of control
if another person nevertheless had the power to control the corporation.

Changes: 

The regulation treats the change of control of a registrant with the SEC as a change of ownership and control within
the meaning of section 498(i) of the HEA. For other corporations not closely held, the regulation treats as a change
of ownership and control any action by which a person who has or thereby acquires a legal or beneficial ownership interest
in that corporation obtains both ownership of 25 percent of the voting stock of the corporation, or the right under
a proxy, power of attorney, or similar agreement to vote that share, and actual control. Conversely, relinquishing
that control would also constitute a change within the meaning of this section. 



Comment: 

Some commenters believe that a change from a for-profit to a nonprofit status should not be considered a change of ownership
and control within the meaning of section 498(i) of the HEA at all; others thought that so long as management remained
the same, or the facility, staff, and management remained the same, that the regulations should not treat changes
in tax-filing status as significant under section 498(i) of the HEA. Other commenters felt strongly that a change
from for-profit to nonprofit status should be considered a change of ownership and control within the scope of this
section, and noted the various changes already made in the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, and in particular
those proposed in regulations, that were designed to prevent program weaknesses and abuse among for-profit institutions.
The commenter stated that these measures would readily be frustrated by unscrutinized conversion to nonprofit status,
and would be contrary to the objectives of increasing protection for students and the public. The commenter believed
that there was little reason to expect that the institution would improve its financial strength by such a conversion,
and that it may in fact have increased its liabilities in the process, yet under the proposed financial responsibility
standards, the school upon conversion would claim the benefit of a more lenient financial responsibility test than
that which it would have faced had it remained a for-profit entity. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary recognizes that institutions that change from for-profit to nonprofit status may well retain the very
same faculty, management, programs and facilities. The very fact that the institution retains these characteristics
through the conversion, however, points out the logic of ensuring that section 498(i) of the HEA be applied to these
conversions in a way that is consistent with congressional intent to impose a range of precautions and restrictions
on for-profit vocational schools. 

Based on the strong congressional intent evidenced in these statutory changes to restrict title IV, HEA program participation
by proprietary trade schools, the Secretary considers it reasonable to treat changes in business form by such institutions
to a status to which those restrictions do not necessarily apply as significant changes warranting the same scrutiny
section 498(i) of the HEA dictates for other, perhaps far less consequential changes in governance by schools. Moreover,
a change from taxable to nonprofit, tax-exempt status contains sufficient elements of a change in ownership and control
to fall within the scope of section 498(i) of the HEA. Although changes in the form of incorporation from for-profit
to nonprofit are governed by a variety of State laws, only those nonprofit organizations that meet the further restrictions
of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code qualify to participate in the title IV, HEA programs as nonprofit
institutions. (See 34 CFR 600.2 and 600.6(a).) To so qualify, a corporation must not merely ensure that its net earnings
do not benefit private individuals, but that, unlike a general corporation that may engage in any lawful business,
this nonprofit institution must be organized and operated exclusively for educational or other qualifying purposes.
Furthermore, unlike other corporations, including those nonprofit institutions that are not tax-exempt, the incorporators
or shareholders must forego any residual claim to a distribution of corporate assets upon dissolution of the corporation.
Acceptance of these restrictions include relinquishment both of ownership rights and the independence in choice
of business objectives and method of operation formerly enjoyed. 

Therefore, although a corporation may affect the change in form from taxable to tax-exempt, nonprofit status with
little formality, and may not be required, under local law, to reconstitute itself as a new or different corporation,
these consequences of the change make it a change cognizable under section 498(i) of the HEA. 

The Secretary is charged by section 498(h)(1)(B)(ii) of the HEA with provisionally certifying institutions that
undergo a change of ownership and control. Provisional certification means, as the Department has spelled out in
proposed  668.13(c)(4)(ii), 59 FR 9564, certification subject to conditions, and the change from for-profit
to nonprofit status warrants adopting as those conditions of the required provisional certification those restrictions
that would have applied to the institution had it remained a for-profit entity. The Secretary therefore expects to
include such provisions for a limited period in certifications given to converting schools. 



Changes: 

The regulation clarifies that a change from a taxable to a tax-exempt entity that qualifies under 501(c)(3) of the
Internal Revenue Code, or vice versa, constitutes a change of ownership and control under this section of the regulations.




Section 600.32 Eligibility of Additional Locations 





Comments: 

Nine commenters expressed concern that the provisions governing the acquisition of an institution that owes a liability
on improperly expended or unspent title IV, HEA program funds would discourage the practice of ``teaching out.''
A commenter suggested that the Secretary should not apply the ``two-year rule'' to the acquisition of an institution
owing a liability on title-IV, HEA program funds, even if the liability is not being paid properly. Another commenter
suggested that the Secretary make clear that the eligibility of additional locations under this section is also subject
to the provisions of   600.8 (concerning the treatment of branch campuses) and 600.10 (which contains
provisions governing the date, extent, duration, and consequences of the eligibility of an institution with respect
to the institution's locations). 



Discussion: 

The Secretary does not agree with the first two commenters for the same reasons that were given by the Secretary when
this provision was originally published as a final regulation in the 

Federal Register

 of July 31, 1991. (See 56 FR 36685.) In the three years since the implementation of those regulations, the Secretary
has seen no evidence that the provisions discourage ``teach-outs'' to students, or that the application of the ``two-year
rule'' has not served its purpose. The Secretary agrees with the last commenter that clarification is necessary with
regard to the relationship of this section to   600.8 and 600.10.

Changes: 

This section has been revised to make clear that the provisions of   600.8 and 600.10 also apply to the eligibility
of additional locations. 


Section 600.40 Loss of Eligibility





Comments: 

A number of commenters suggested that to avoid an institution's sudden closure and the consequent interruption of
the education of currently enrolled students, there should be some provision for those students to receive aid to
complete their educational program even after the institution has lost its eligibility. 




Discussion: 

Under  668.25 of the current Student Assistance General Provisions regulations, and proposed 34 CFR 668.26
(see 59 FR pages 9580-9581) that will go into effect on July 1, 1994, provisions have been made to pay title IV,
HEA program funds to students enrolled in institutions that are terminated. Under those sections, if termination
became effective during a payment period and a student had received a commitment to receive title-IV, HEA Program
funds for that payment period before the effective date of termination, the student would receive those funds for
that payment period as long as the institution continued to provide instruction to the student during that payment
period. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comments: 

Several commenters suggested that the end of the applicable award or fiscal year should not be used as the effective
date for loss of eligibility as a result of a violation of the requirement to derive more than 85 percent of an institution's
revenues from title IV, HEA program funds. They pointed out that the loss of eligibility has the effect of causing an
institution to be liable for any title IV, HEA program funds disbursed or delivered after that date but before a compliance
audit substantiating the institution's calculations is performed. These commenters suggested that institutions
not be held liable for any such disbursements or deliveries of those funds made before the date on which calculations
are audited. 



Discussion: 

These comments have been addressed in connection with  600.5. 



Changes: 

None. 



Section 600.41 Termination and Emergency Action Proceedings 





Comments: 

Three commenters supported the Secretary's proposed position in this section to use a show-cause proceeding for
terminations of institutional eligibility only in instances where neither the facts nor the law would be in dispute
during the proceeding. Two commenters objected to the use of a show-cause proceeding (in place of a proceeding under
34 CFR part 668, subpart G) for terminations of institutional eligibility for a violation under   600.5(a)(8)
or 600.7(a), claiming that violations of these provisions could involve questions of fact that are in dispute. A commenter
also objected to the use of a show-cause proceeding (in place of a proceeding under 34 CFR part 668, subpart G) for terminations
for loss of accreditation, preaccreditation, or State legal authorization. One commenter suggested that the Secretary
always use a proceeding under 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, for violations of provisions in part 600. One commenter suggested
that the Secretary always use a show-cause proceeding, rather than a proceeding under 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, for
terminations of institutional eligibility. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary reiterates that because an institution itself reports that it is not in compliance with the applicable
eligibility requirements of   600.5 or 600.7, there is no question of fact in dispute in a termination
action taken on those grounds. The Secretary continues to believe that a termination proceeding under 34 CFR part
668, subpart G, is neither necessary nor cost effective when facts are not in dispute. The Secretary agrees, however,
that it is appropriate to use the provisions of 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, when the Secretary undertakes to terminate
an institution's eligibility when the facts giving rise to that termination are in dispute. However, even with regard
to these institutions, the Secretary may take an emergency action against such an institution if that action is considered
warranted, and if the institution challenges the emergency action, that dispute is heard in a show-cause proceeding.




Changes: 

None. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification





Comment: 

In the NPRM, the Secretary certified that the proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities. Several commenters suggested that this statement was erroneous and that
these rules will definitely have a significant impact on institutions, especially the smaller ones that are not computerized.




Discussion: 

The Secretary recognizes that the regulations will have an impact on small institutions. However, based on Department
estimates of the impact, the Secretary does not believe that the impact will be disproportionately or economically
significant. The Secretary therefore reaffirms his certification that the regulations would not have a significant
economic impact or a substantial significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. To the extent
that commenters are able to provide additional information on the economic impact of the regulations, the Secretary
invites the commenters to submit this information so that it may be considered in reviewing the regulations to reduce
regulatory burden. 



Changes: 

None. 



Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 





Comment: 

In the NPRM, the Secretary provided an estimate for the total number of burden hours associated with these regulations.
Several commenters suggested that this estimate was understated. 



Discussion: 

In estimating the total number of burden hours associated with these regulations, the Secretary considers the best
information that is available to the Department and computes the estimate based on that information. The commenters
have complained about the burden but have not provided sufficient additional information to support a revised computation
of burden hours. The Secretary appreciates the comments and recognizes that the requirements of the statute and regulations
impose a burden. As a result of the comments and revisions to the regulations, the Department is modifying the burden
estimates. The total annual reporting and recordkeeping burden that would result from the collection of the information
is 20,375 burden hours for this package. 



Changes: 

None. 



Executive Order 12866 



These final regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 

The potential costs associated with the final regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those
determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens
specifically associated with information collection requirements were identified and explained in the NPRM. 

In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these regulations, the Secretary
has determined that the benefits of the regulations justify the costs.

The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal
government in the exercise of their governmental functions. 



Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 



Sections 600.5, 600.7, 600.10, 600.20, 600.30, and 600.31, contain information collection requirements. As required
by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of these sections to the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). 

These regulations contain records that will affect postsecondary institutions that wish to participate in the title
IV, HEA programs. An estimate of the total annual reporting and recordkeeping burden that will result from the collection
of the information is 1.96 hours per response for 10,720 respondents for a total burden of 21,035 burden hours for this
package. 

Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements should direct
them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington,
DC 20503; Attention: Daniel J. Chenok. Comments on this burden estimate should be submitted by May 31, 1994. 



Assessment of Educational Impact 



In the NPRM, the Secretary requested comments on whether the proposed regulations would require transmission of
information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States. 

Based on the response to the proposed rules and on its own review, the Department has determined that the regulations
in this document do not require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other
agency or authority of the United States.

(2) If an institution fails to satisfy the waiver requirements for an award year, the institution becomes ineligible
on June 30 of that award year. 

(g)(1) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and any applicable waiver or exception under this section,
the institution shall substantiate the required calculations by having the certified public accountant who prepares

report on the accuracy of the institution's calculation based on performing an agreed-upon procedures attestation
engagement in accordance with the AICPA's Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements, and include that
report as part of the audit report.

(2) If the certified public accountant cannot attest to the accuracy of the institution's calculations for purposes
of paragraph (a)(1) of this section or any applicable waiver or exception under this section, the Secretary presumes
that the institution lost its eligibility as a result of those provisions.
 
(3) The institution may rebut this presumption if, no later than 30 days after the date on which the audit report that
includes the attestation engagement report was submitted, the institution submits a calculation to the Secretary
indicating that it satisfies the provisions of paragraph (a)(8) of this section, and the certified public accountant

 600.10

 Date, extent, duration, and consequence of eligibility. 



(a) 

Date of eligibility.

 (1) If the Secretary determines that an applicant institution satisfies all the statutory and regulatory eligibility
requirements, the Secretary considers the institution to be an eligible institution as of the date_

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940429-0-00157 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940429-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(i) The Secretary signs the institution's program participation agreement described in 34 CFR part 668, subpart
B, for purposes of participating in any title IV, HEA program; and

(ii) The Secretary receives all the information necessary to make that determination for purposes other than participating
in any title IV, HEA program.

(2) For purposes of participating in a title IV, HEA program, if an eligible institution seeks eligibility for a location
or educational program not previously designated eligible, and the Secretary determines that the location or educational
program satisfies all the statutory and regulatory eligibility requirements, the Secretary considers the location
or program to be eligible to participate in that title IV, HEA program as of the date the Secretary certifies that location
or program to so participate.

(b) 

Extent of eligibility. 

(1) If the Secretary determines that the entire applicant institution, including all its locations and all its educational
programs, satisfies the applicable requirements of this part, the Secretary extends eligibility to all educational
programs and locations identified on the institution's application for eligibility.

(2) If the Secretary determines that only certain educational programs or certain locations of an applicant institution
satisfy the applicable requirements of this part, the Secretary extends eligibility only to those educational programs
and locations that meet those requirements and identifies the eligible educational programs and locations in the
eligibility notice sent to the institution under  600.21.

(3) Eligibility does not extend to any location that an institution establishes after it receives its eligibility
designation if the institution provides at least 50 percent of an educational program at that location, unless_

(i) The institution has notified the Secretary of that location in accordance with  600.30(a)(3); and

(ii) The Secretary does not require the institution to submit an eligibility application for that location under
 600.21(c).

(c) 

Subsequent additions of educational programs. 

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if an eligible institution adds an educational program
after it has been designated as an eligible institution by the Secretary, the institution must apply to the Secretary
to have that additional program designated as an eligible program of that institution.

(2) An eligible institution that adds an educational program after it has been designated as an eligible institution
by the Secretary does not have to apply to the Secretary to have that additional program designated as an eligible program
of that institution if the additional program_

(i) Leads to an associate, baccalaureate, professional, or graduate degree; or

(ii)(A) Prepares students for gainful employment in the same or related recognized occupation as an educational
program that has previously been designated as an eligible program at that institution by the Secretary; and

(B) Is at least 8 semester hours, 12 quarter hours, or 
600 clock hours.

(3) If an institution incorrectly determines under paragraph (c)(2) of this section that an educational program
satisfies the applicable statutory and regulatory eligibility provisions without applying to the Secretary for
approval, the institution is liable to repay to the Secretary all HEA program funds received by the institution for
that educational program, and all the title IV, HEA program funds received by or on behalf of students who were enrolled
in that educational program.

(d) 

Duration of eligibility. 

(1) If an institution participates in the title IV, HEA programs, the Secretary's designation of the institution
as an eligible institution under the title IV, HEA programs expires when the institution's program participation
agreement, as described in 34 CFR part 668, subpart B, expires.

(2) If an institution participates in an HEA program other than a title IV, HEA program, the Secretary's designation
of the institution as an eligible institution, for purposes of that non-title IV, HEA program, does not expire as long
as the institution continues to satisfy the statutory and regulatory requirements governing its eligibility.

(e) 

Consequence of eligibility. 

(1) If, as a part of its institutional eligibility application, an institution indicates that it wishes to participate
in a title IV, HEA program and the Secretary determines that the institution satisfies the applicable statutory and
regulatory requirements governing institutional eligibility, the Secretary will determine whether the institution
satisfies the standards of administrative capability and financial responsibility contained in 34 CFR part 668,
subpart B.

(2) If, as part of its institutional eligibility application, an institution indicates that it does not wish to participate
in any title IV, HEA program and the Secretary determines that the institution satisfies the applicable statutory
and regulatory requirements governing institutional eligibility, the institution is eligible to apply to participate
in any HEA program listed by the Secretary in the eligibility notice it receives under  600.21. However, the
institution is not eligible to participate in those programs, or receive funds under those programs, merely by virtue
of its designation as an eligible institution under this part.

An institution that is owned by a nonprofit corporation or association changes ownership and control when a change
specifically described in this paragraph (c) takes place. 
(7) 

Public institution. 

Notwithstanding paragraph (d) of this section, an institution owned and operated by a governmental entity changes
ownership and control only when the ownership of the institution is transferred to a different governmental entity
or to another person. 
(d) 

Covered transactions. 

For the purposes of this section, a change in ownership of an institution that results in a change of control may include,
but is not limited to_ 
(1) The sale of the institution; 
(2) The transfer of the controlling interest of stock of the institution or its parent corporation; 
(3) The merger of two or more eligible institutions; 
(4) The division of one institution into two or more institutions; 
(5) The transfer of the liabilities of an institution to its parent corporation; 
(6) A transfer of assets that comprise a substantial portion of the educational business of the institution, except
where the transfer consists exclusively in the granting of a security interest in those assets; or 
(7) A conversion of the institution from a for-profit to a nonprofit institution. 
(e) 

Excluded transactions

. A change of ownership and control otherwise subject to this section does not include a transfer of ownership and control
upon the retirement or death of the owner, to_ 
(1) A member of the owner's family, as described in  600.30(f); 
(2) A person with an ownership interest in the institution who has been involved in management of the institution for
at least two years preceding the transfer. 
(f) 

Transfers subject to contingency. 

An institution may submit and have considered an application for a designation of eligibility and for certification
under 34 CFR part 668, subpart B, only when the transfer has been completed. A transfer is complete for purposes of this
section when the transfer is otherwise final but is subject to the condition subsequent that the institution obtain
approval from the Secretary, the accrediting agency, or State licensing authority after the transfer. A transfer
otherwise complete is not considered incomplete or contingent where the transferor retains a interest in the stock
or assets of the institution or its owner solely for purposes of security.

(3) Initiate an emergency action under the provisions contained in 34 CFR 668.83 with regard to the institution's
participation in one or more title IV, HEA programs with respect to students enrolled in that educational program.


(c)(1) An action to terminate and limit the eligibility of an institution as a whole or as to any of its locations or educational

the institution, location, or program has the requisite accreditation or preaccreditation. The presiding official
has no authority to consider challenges to the action of the accrediting agency. 

(2) If the basis for the loss of eligibility is the loss of legal authorization, the sole issue is whether the institution,
location, or program has the requisite legal authorization. The presiding official has no authority to consider
challenges to the action of a State agency in removing the legal authorization. 

(3) If the basis for the loss of eligibility for title IV, HEA program purposes is a notice under 34 CFR part 667 from a
SPRE to the Secretary of the SPRE's determination that the institution shall not be eligible to participate in the
title IV, HEA programs, the sole issue is whether the SPRE notified the Secretary of that determination. The presiding
official has no authority to consider any challenge to the SPRE's determination.

 Interim final regulations with invitation for comment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary amends the Student Assistance General 
Provisions regulations, the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) 
Program regulations, and the Federal Pell Grant Program 
regulations to implement changes in the Higher Education Act of 
1965, as amended (HEA), and to improve the monitoring and 
accountability of institutions and third-party servicers 
participating in the student financial assistance programs 
authorized by Title IV of the HEA (Title IV, HEA programs). 
These changes also establish standards of administrative and 
financial responsibility for third-party servicers that 
administer any aspect of a guaranty agency's or lender's 
participation in the FFEL programs. 


These regulations seek to improve the efficiency of Federal 
student aid programs and, by so doing, to improve their capacity 
to enhance opportunities for postsecondary education. The 
Secretary invites comment on these regulations. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Higher Education Amendments of 
1992, Pub. L. 102-325, (the Amendments of 1992) and the Higher 
Education Technical Amendments of 1993, Pub. L. 103-208 (the 
Technical Amendments of 1993) amended the HEA in several areas 
relating to the participation of institutions in the 
Title IV, HEA programs. Further, the Amendments of 1992 amended 
the HEA to expand the Secretary's authority to regulate the 
activities of those individuals and organizations now called 


third-party servicers

. The Student Assistance General Provisions 
regulations contain requirements that are common to educational 
institutions that participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. 


On February 28, 1994, the Secretary published a Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for parts 668 and 690 in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 9526). The NPRM included a discussion of the 
major issues surrounding the proposed changes which will not be 
repeated here. The following list summarizes those issues and 
identifies the pages of the preamble to the NPRM on which a 
discussion of those issues can be found: 
The Secretary proposed to clarify the terms used in the 
statutory definition of 

academic year

 (pages 9529-9530); 
The Secretary proposed a definition of an eligible program 
to implement statutory requirements, including requirements for 
``short-term'' programs (at least 300 but less than 600 clock 
hours) that would be eligible for the FFEL programs only. The 
Secretary proposed methodologies for the measurement of 
completion and placement rates for short-term programs, as 
required by the statute. Also in accordance with the statute, 
the Secretary proposed further provisions to evaluate the quality 
of short-term programs (pages 9530-9531); 
The Secretary proposed to add two new sections to codify 
procedures with regard to applications to participate initially 
or to continue to participate in a Title IV, HEA program and 
procedures by which the Secretary certifies that an institution 
meets the standards in subpart B of these regulations and 
accordingly may participate in a Title IV, HEA program. The 
Secretary proposed procedures to codify new statutory provisions 
governing provisional certification procedures for participation 
in a Title IV, HEA program (pages 9533-9536); 
The Secretary proposed to amend the regulations governing 
program participation agreements to include numerous new 
provisions added by the Amendments of 1992 and provisions 
previously prescribed by the HEA but not specifically spelled out 
in the regulations. The Secretary also proposed provisions to 
amend the regulations governing program participation agreements 
(pages 9536-9539); 
The Secretary proposed significant changes to the section 
governing the evaluation of an institution's financial 
responsibility. The Secretary proposed to strengthen the factors 
used to evaluate an institution's financial responsibility and to 
reflect statutory changes (pages 9539-9544);

The Secretary proposed to strengthen and expand the 
standards of administrative capability for participating 
institutions, addressing areas previously not regulated or for 
which there were only guidelines (pages 9544-9549); 
The Secretary proposed to amend the provisions governing 
default reduction measures to reflect statutory changes made by 
the Amendments of 1992 and current departmental practices. The 
provisions in the Technical Amendments of 1993 that address 
institutional appeals of cohort default rates were not included 
in the NPRM (pages 9549-9551); 
The Secretary proposed to clarify the terms used in the 
statutory definition of a fair and equitable refund policy (pages 
9551-9556); 
The Secretary proposed to implement the statutory 
requirement that institutions have annual compliance audits. The 
Secretary proposed to extend the audit requirements to foreign 
institutions (pages 9556-9557); and 
The Secretary proposed to amend the Federal Pell Grant 
Program regulations to implement section 487(c)(7) of the HEA 
that provides that an institution may offset the amount of Title 
IV, HEA program disbursements against liabilities or may receive 
reimbursement from the Department for those amounts if, in the 
course of any audit conducted after December 31, 1988, the 
Department discovers or is informed of any Title IV, HEA program 
assistance (specifically, Federal Pell Grant Program funds) that 
an institution has provided to its students in accordance with 
program requirements, but the institution has not previously 
received credit or reimbursement for these disbursements 
(page 9558). 
On February 17, 1994, the Secretary published an NPRM 
proposing amendments to parts 668 and 682 in the 

Federal Register

 
(59 FR 8044). The NPRM included a discussion of the major issues 
involved in the proposed changes. The following list summarizes 
those issues and identifies the pages of the preamble to the NPRM 
on which a discussion of those issues can be found: 
The Secretary proposed a definition of 

third-party servicer

 
as applicable to those individuals or organizations that contract 
with an institution to administer any aspect of the institution's 
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs (page 8045); 
The Secretary proposed to expand the factors of financial 
responsibility of an institution to take into consideration 
substantial control over both institutions and third-party 
servicers (pages 8046-8047); 
The Secretary proposed annual audit requirements for 
third-party servicers as necessary to implement statutory 
provisions under the Amendments of 1992 (pages 8047-8048); 
The Secretary proposed notification requirements for 
third-party servicers against which the Secretary has assessed a 
liability for a violation of a Title IV, HEA program violation 
(pages 8048-8049); 
The Secretary proposed to create a new section to codify 
contract requirements between institutions and third-party 
servicers. As one of the conditions in the contract, a 
third-party servicer would be required to assume joint and 
several liability with an institution that the servicer contracts 
with for any violation by the servicer of any Title IV, HEA 
program requirement (pages 8049-8050); 
The Secretary proposed to apply against a third-party 
servicer the sanctions under subpart G of the Student Assistance 
General Provisions that currently solely apply to institutions 
for any violation of a Title IV, HEA program requirement 
(pages 8050-8051); 
The Secretary proposed to apply the fiduciary standards that 
currently only apply to institutions to third-party servicers so 
that third-party servicers would be required to act at all times 
with the competency necessary to qualify them as a fiduciary 
(page 8051); 
The Secretary proposed a definition of 

third-party servicer

 
applicable to those individuals or organizations that contract 
with a lender or guarantee agency to administer any aspect of the 
lender's or guarantee agency's participation in the FFEL programs 
(page 8055); 
The Secretary proposed to require a third-party servicer 
that contracts with a lender or guaranty agency to assume joint 
and several liability for any violation of any FFEL program 
requirement or applicable statutory requirement. Collection of 
liabilities from the violation would be collected first from the 
lender or guaranty agency (page 8055-8056); and 
The Secretary proposed a new section to codify Federal 
requirements for third-party servicers that contract with lenders 
or guaranty agencies. A third-party servicer would be required 
to meet certain standards of financial responsibility and 
administrative capability to be considered eligible to contract 
with a lender or guaranty agency. In addition, this section 
would require a third-party servicer to have performed an annual 
audit of the servicer's administration of a lender's or guaranty 
agency's participation in the FFEL programs (page 8056); 


Program Integrity Triad 


In order to approve a postsecondary education institution to 
participate in the student financial assistance programs 
authorized under Title IV of the HEA (referred to as ``Title IV, 
HEA programs'') and many other Federal programs, the Secretary 
must determine, in part, that the institution satisfies the 
statutory definition of an ``institution of higher education.'' 
Under the HEA and many other Federal statutes, one element of 
that definition requires an eligible institution of higher 
education to be accredited or preaccredited by an accrediting 
agency recognized by the Secretary as a reliable authority as to 
the quality of the education or training provided by the 
institution. Another element requires an eligible institution to 
be legally authorized to provide an education program beyond the 
secondary level in the State in which it is located. In 
addition, to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, the 
institution must be certified by the Secretary as 
administratively capable and financially responsible. Thus, the 
HEA provides the framework for a shared responsibility among 
accrediting agencies, States, and the Federal government to 
ensure that the ``gate'' to Title IV, HEA programs is opened only 
to those institutions that provide students with quality 
education or training worth the time, energy, and money they 
invest in it. The three ``gatekeepers'' sharing this 
responsibility have traditionally been referred to as ``the 
triad.'' 
While the concept of a triad of entities responsible for 
gatekeeping has had a long history, originating in 1952, the 
Higher Education Amendments of 1992, Pub. L. 102-325, 
significantly increased the gatekeeping responsibilities of each 
member of the triad. Specifically, Congress amended the HEA to 
provide for a new part H of Title IV entitled ``Program Integrity 
Triad.'' Under the new part H, the requirements that accrediting 
bodies must meet if they are to be recognized by the Secretary as 
``gatekeepers'' for Title IV or other Federal purposes are 
specified in detail. Part H also provides a new oversight 
responsibility for States: the State Postsecondary Review 
Program. Altogether, part H establishes a set of 
responsibilities for accrediting agencies, States, and the 
Secretary that creates a stronger and more coordinated evaluation 
of institutions that participate, or wish to participate, in the 
Title IV, HEA programs.

The Secretary recognizes that the approach to significantly 
increased gatekeeping activity outlined in the statute for the 
three members of the triad is a new one. This approach will 
require leadership in both implementation and evaluation if it is 
to achieve the effectiveness that Congress intended. The 
Secretary will take steps to assure that the various 
responsibilities of the triad members are carried out in a manner 
that, in fact, results in the identification of institutions that 
should not participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, on the 
basis of either the quality of education they offer or their 
inability to handle program funds. At the same time, the 
Secretary is committed to carrying out the responsibility for 
coordinating the activities of the triad members that are 
inherent in the statute in a manner that causes the least burden 
to institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
To these ends, the Secretary is committed to effective 
management of the gatekeeping function. The Secretary will 
review carefully the applications of accrediting bodies and the 
standards and operating plans proposed by State Postsecondary 
Review Entities (SPREs) under the State Postsecondary Review 
Program to insure that they meet the requirements of the statute 
and these regulations and will enable these triad agencies to 
fulfill their statutory purposes. The Secretary will also place 
a priority on the completion of the ``Postsecondary Education 
Participation System,'' the Department's new integrated data base, 
which will contain the information that the Secretary generates 
in the course of the Secretary's oversight of institutions 
participating in Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary will use 
the data base to inform accrediting bodies and SPREs of actions 
taken by the Secretary so that they may in turn carry out their 
responsibilities. This expanded data base is also critical to 
the Secretary's effective selection of institutions for program 
review. 
Monitoring the results of the gatekeeping process is a very 
important key to effective management. The Secretary will 
evaluate the activities of accrediting agencies, SPREs, and the 
Department to determine their effectiveness in improving the 
integrity of institutions participating in Title IV programs and 
will take such steps as may be indicated to improve the results. 
Finally, as provided in the statute, the Secretary will seek the 
advice and counsel of the National Advisory Committee on 
Institutional Quality and Integrity in evaluating the 
effectiveness of the triad. 
The Secretary believes that the approach best suited to 
achieving the objectives of the statute is a complementary one, 
with each member of the triad focusing its evaluation on its 
obligations within the context of the HEA. Thus, the focus for 
accrediting agencies is the quality of education or training 
provided by the institutions or programs they accredit. States, 
in addition to providing the legal authority to operate within 
the state required for participation in the Title IV, HEA 
programs, will review institutions that meet certain statutory 
review criteria related to institutional performance in the Title 
IV, HEA programs. The focus of the Secretary's evaluation of 
institutions is on the administrative and financial capacity of 
those institutions to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
While the functions and responsibilities of each of the 
triad members are generally different, the statute does require, 
in some instances, that all members of the triad evaluate similar 
areas. For the most part, the principle of complementary 
functions will lead to the members evaluating those same areas 
from different perspectives for different purposes. For example, 
all three of the triad members are required to examine the 
finances of an institution. If each looks at financial strength 
from a perspective complementary to that of the others, 
accrediting agencies would focus principally on the capacity of 
the institution to continue to offer programs at a level of 
quality sufficient to meet accrediting agency standards and to 
fulfill the institution's mission over a 5-10 year period of 
accreditation. The emphasis of a review by a SPRE would be on 
whether or not the institution possesses the full range of 
resources needed to serve students currently attending the 
institution. The Secretary's responsibilities focus on the 
institution's finances in light of its ability to provide the 
services described in its official publications and statements, 
to provide the administrative resources necessary to comply with 
its Title IV, HEA program responsibilities, and to meet all of 
its financial obligations, including, but not limited to, refunds of institutional charges and repayments to the
Secretary for 
liabilities and debts incurred in programs administered by the 
Secretary. 
Despite the Secretary's efforts to encourage complementary 
functions for each of the triad members, it is theoretically 
possible that, in some instances, an institution could be subject 
to three different standards regulating the same area of 
operation. For this reason, where a Title IV standard has been 
promulgated at the Federal level, the Secretary expects 
accrediting agencies and States to take this into account in 
establishing their own standards to insure that varying standards 
do not pose an unnecessary burden on institutions. It is also 
important that accrediting agencies and States do not impose any 
standard that is weaker than comparable Title IV, HEA program 
standards. The Secretary believes coordination of this is a 
federal responsibility. 
In view of the complementary approach to the functions of 
the triad members, the Secretary believes, for example, that 
institutions should not have to develop different methodologies 
to provide data that the three members of the triad may require. 
The Secretary also believes that, to the extent feasible, any 
other requests for data about the institution, its students, or 
its graduates should rely on information already in the 
institution's possession. To that end, the Secretary expects 
accrediting agencies and States either to accept student data 
based on the methodology that will be specified in the 
regulations governing ``Student Right to Know,'' also mandated by 
the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, or, where the 
institution may have other methodologies for calculating data, 
such as a system designed to provide data to a State higher 
education commission or other State agency, to accept data in the 
format already being used by the institution. Similarly, the 
Secretary expects accrediting agencies and SPREs to use the 
audited financial statements institutions are now required to 
provide to the Secretary on an annual basis to the extent those 
statements are compatible with the nature of the reviews 
conducted under their respective standards. 
The Secretary also recognizes that other Federal agencies, 
such as the Department of Labor and the Veterans Administration, 
also regulate institutions in some areas that are similar to 
those included in part H. The suggestion has been made that the 
Secretary should promulgate Federal standards in the areas of 
overlap so that institutions would not be subject to varying 
standards developed by other Federal agencies and the triad 
members. However, the Secretary interprets part H as permitting 
States and accrediting agencies to establish their own standards, 
as opposed to using a Federal standard, and also believes that 
this is the most effective approach. In addition, it is not 
clear how the requirements of the different agencies are 
compatible with the requirements of part H. The purposes of 
these programs administered by other agencies may be very 
different. As a result, the Secretary has not pursued this 
alternative. The Secretary does believe that it would be useful 
to explore how the varying requirements of other Federal agencies 
that are similar to those of part H might be coordinated to 
reduce any burden on institutions and will initiate such 
exploration. 
The Secretary believes that, where possible, data developed 
at the national level should be made available to institutions, 
as well as to States and accrediting agencies to assist them in 
carrying out their responsibilities under part H. In particular, 
data concerning labor markets and compensation for specific 
fields and information concerning graduation and withdrawal rates 
at various types of institutions may be helpful to both triad 
members and institutions. The Secretary will facilitate the 
development of this type of information and, where possible under 
the auspices of the Department, will coordinate the development 
of data that will be helpful to institutions and the triad.

Finally, as part of the commitment to providing leadership 
to the triad, the Secretary will convene representatives of the 
triad members and institutions to exchange information about the 
gatekeeping process and to discuss how the triad is functioning, 
both in identifying institutions whose performance is 
questionable and in reporting requirements that have proven to be 
unreasonably burdensome. The Secretary invites comments 
concerning the functioning of the triad, as it is implemented 
through these and other regulations governed by part H. The 
Secretary will seek improvement, where possible, within existing 
regulations and will propose modifications to regulations and to 
the statute itself if experience indicates those changes are both 
necessary to achieve effective gatekeeping, with minimal burden, 
and compatible with the need to maintain, and assure the public 
of, the integrity of the Title IV, HEA programs. 


Substantive Changes to the NPRMs 


Part 668_Student Assistance General Provisions 


Subpart A_General 


Section 668.2 General Definitions 




Academic Year.

 In the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the Secretary requested 
comment on how to implement the technical amendment that provided 
that the Secretary may reduce, for good cause on a case-by-case 
basis, the required minimum of 30 weeks of instructional time to 
not less than 26 weeks of instructional time in the case of an 
institution of higher education that provides a 2-year or 4-year 
program of instruction for which it awards an associate or 
baccalaureate degree. The Secretary did not propose specific 
criteria to implement this technical amendment in the 
February 28, 1994 NPRM, but instead requested comments on a 
definition of ``good cause'' and requested comments on ways of 
implementing this provision that addressed the Secretary's 
concern that reductions in the award year would encourage many 
institutions to seek that treatment routinely. After reviewing 
public comments on defining good cause, and developing safeguards 
to discourage routine requests for reductions in the academic year, the Secretary has implemented this technical
amendment in 
new  668.3. 
Under this section, for the purpose of awarding Title IV, 
HEA funds, the Secretary may reduce the length of an academic 
year for an institution that submits a written request to the 
Secretary. Section 668.3 provides for a two-year ``phase-in'' 
period for institutions that are currently participating, have an 
academic year of 26-29 weeks, and meet the other applicable 
standards of the section. The Secretary will consider all other 
requests for a reduction in the minimum number of weeks of 
instructional time to not less than 26 weeks on a case-by-case 
basis in accordance with the requirements of  668.3. Section 
668.3 is discussed in greater detail in the section of the 


Analysis of Comments and Changes

 that addressed the definition of 
an 

academic year

 ( 668.2). 
In the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the Secretary requested 
comment on how to address an abuse of the definition of an 


academic year 

whereby an institution that has programs that are 
measured in credit hours without terms could claim that it meets 
the requirements for the minimum amount of work to be performed 
by a full-time student over an academic year by giving a full-
time student a minimal amount of instruction over a 30-week (or 
more) period, which the institution claims to be equivalent to 24 
semester or 36 quarter hours. The Secretary requested comment on 
whether a minimum full-time workload for students enrolled in 
these educational programs should be established to address this 
abuse. Several commenters agreed that this abuse should be addressed. However, rather than changing the proposed
definition 
of full-time student to require measurement of student workloads, 
a modification has been made to require that, for educational 
programs using credit hours, but not using a semester, trimester, 
or quarter system, a week of instructional time is any week in 
which at least five days of regularly scheduled instruction, 
examinations, or preparation for examinations occurs, as opposed 
to one day of regularly scheduled instruction, examinations, or 
preparation for examinations for all other programs. The 
Secretary believes it is important to ensure that full-time 
students are performing comparable workloads regardless of the 
type of institution they are attending, and that such work should 
be ratably allocated throughout the period of instruction. The 
Secretary notes that this is an area of abuse that is not fully 
addressed by the implementation of the ``clock hour/credit hour'' 
regulations. A corresponding change has been made to the 
definition of an 

eligible program. 
One-third of an academic year and two-thirds of an academic year.

 
In response to public comment, the Secretary has defined 
one-third of an academic year and two-thirds of an academic year 
in order to clarify the procedure for prorating awards under the 
FFEL and NDSL programs. 


Undergraduate student.

 Because the Secretary recognizes that, at this time, there are 
legitimate reasons supported by statute for separate definitions 
of an 

undergraduate student 

under the various Title IV, HEA 
program regulations the definition of 

undergraduate student 

has 
been deleted in these final regulations. 


Section 668.8 Eligible Program 




Qualitative factors.

 Section 668.8(e)(1)(iii) requires that, for a short-term 
program, the length of the program may not exceed by more than 50 
percent the minimum number of clock hours required for training 
in the recognized occupation for which the program prepares 
students, as established by the State in which the program is 
offered, if the State has established such a requirement. In 
response to public comment, this provision has been amended to 
also prohibit a short-term eligible program from exceeding by 50 
percent any applicable minimum number of clock hours required by 
a 

Federal 

agency for training in the recognized occupation for 
which the program prepares students. 
In response to public comment,  668.8(e)(2) has been revised 
to clarify that, since a certified public accountant cannot 
certify the accuracy of an institution's completion or 
placement-rate calculations, the institution shall substantiate 
these calculations by having the certified public accountant 
follow the procedures of an attestation engagement. 


Calculation of completion rate.

 Section 668.8(f)(4) has been amended to require that a 
student must complete the educational program in which he or she 
is enrolled within 150 percent of the published length of the 
educational program in order to be counted as a completer for 
purposes of this calculation. This change was made to conform 
with the calculation of a completion rate under the Student 
Right-to-Know provisions. The Secretary notes that the 
Department will continue to evaluate the feasibility of replacing 
this methodology with the methodology developed relative to the 
Student Right-to-Know Act once that methodology has been 
published in final regulations.

Calculation of Placement Rate.

 
In response to public comment, the requirement in proposed 
 668.8(g)(1)(ii) that an institution exclude from the calculation 
of a placement rate students who are hired by the institution has 
been deleted from these regulations. 
In response to public comment, a change has been made to the 
placement rate calculation to clarify that every student must be 
employed for at least 13 weeks in a recognized occupation for 
which they were trained or in a related comparable occupation 
before that student can be counted as placed. 
The Secretary has amended  668.8 by revising paragraph (k) 
to remove the provision that an institution offering an 
undergraduate educational program measured in credit hours and at 
least two academic years in length is exempt from applying the 
formula contained in paragraph (l) to that program if the program 
provides an equivalent degree as determined by the Secretary, or 
if each course within the program is fully acceptable for credit 
toward that institution's equivalent degree. 

Paragraphs (k) and (l) were originally published in final 
regulations on July 23, 1993 (58 FR 39618). In those final 
regulations, the Secretary exempted from the requirements of the 
regulations, undergraduate educational programs that were at 
least two years in length and lead to an associate, bachelor's, 
professional, or an equivalent degree as determined by the 
Secretary or if each course within that program was fully 
acceptable for credit toward one of those degree programs at 
that institution. The Secretary believed that it was prudent to 
exempt programs that lead to an equivalent degree because there 
might be a type of degree being offered (not an associate, 
bachelor's, or professional degree) that the Secretary had not 
yet encountered. The Secretary wanted to be able to examine the 
degree to determine if that degree was in fact equivalent to an 
associate, bachelor's, or professional degree. If the Secretary 
determined that the degree was equivalent to an associate, 
bachelor's, or professional degree, and was at least two academic 
years in length, the Secretary would exempt from the regulations 
undergraduate educational programs that lead to the equivalent 
degree or if each course within the program was fully acceptable 
for credit toward that institution's equivalent degree. 
However, since publication of the final regulations on 
July 23, 1993, the Secretary has yet to encounter a degree that 
the Secretary would consider to be an equivalent of an associate, 
bachelor's, or professional degree. Conversely, dozens of 
institutions have submitted to the Secretary arguments that their 
diploma programs are the equivalent of an associate degree 
program. The regulations were never meant to permit a 
determination that a nondegree program be classified as the 
equivalent of a degree program. The regulations only applied to 
a determination of whether a degree resulting from an educational 
program is equivalent to an associate, bachelor's, or 
professional degree. Because the diploma programs are not in 
themselves degree programs, the Secretary does not consider those 
programs to lead to an equivalent degree. 
Because of this misconception by many institutions that 
``equivalent degree'' means an educational program equivalent to a 
degree granting program, and because the Secretary has not yet 
found a true instance of an equivalent degree that is not an 
associate, bachelor's, or professional degree, the Secretary is 
removing the phrase ``equivalent degree as determined by the 
Secretary'' from paragraph (k).

Subpart B_Standards for Participation in the Title IV, HEA 
Programs 


Section 668.13 Certification Procedures 




Period of participation.

 
In response to concerns of many commenters about the 
consequences (particularly the potential for provisional 
certification) to a participating institution in the event that 
the Secretary does not complete a review of the institution's 
application prior to the expiration of the institution's program 
participation agreement, even if the institution had filed its 
renewal application in a timely manner,  668.13(b) is amended to 
provide that full certification will be extended on a month to 
month basis following the expiration of a program participation 
agreement where the institution's application for recertification 
was materially complete, and submitted at least 90 days prior to 
the expiration date. 


Provisional certification.

 
In response to public comment, proposed  668.13(c)(1)(ii) 
that provided that the Secretary may provisionally certify an 
institution if the financial responsibility and administrative 
capability of the institution was being determined for the first 
time has been deleted from these regulations. Although this 
provision is statutory, the Secretary has decided that the other 
standards requiring the use of provisional certification are 
adequate to identify institutions that would be captured by this 
provision where greater monitoring and procedural restrictions 
are appropriate. 
Section 668.13(c)(2)(i) has been amended to clarify the 
maximum permissible length of periods of provisional 
certification. Upon further consideration, the Secretary has 
decided to repeat the language of the statute that provides that 
periods of participation under provisional certification should 
be for ``complete award years.'' So, for example, the regulations 
will permit the Secretary to provisionally certify an initial 
applicant for one complete award year, rather than for a period 
of 12 months as proposed in the February 28, 1994 NPRM. This 
will provide the Secretary with a complete award year of data on 
which to base determinations of further participation for the 
institution. 
In response to public comment,  668.13(d)(1) that lists the 
requirements for provisional certification to participate on a 
limited basis for institutions that are not financially 
responsible has been amended to make clear that the criteria of 
this section are not required for an institution that meets the 
exceptions to the general standards of financial responsibility 
under  668.15(d). 
In response to public comment  668.13(d)(1)(ii) has been 
amended to clarify that any required submission of a letter of 
credit must be in an amount and in a form acceptable to the 
Secretary. 
Proposed  668.13(d)(1)(iii)(B) has been revised, consistent 
with similar changes in  668.15(b) (3) and (4), to make clear how 
an institution demonstrates that it has met all of its financial 
obligations and is current in its debt payments. This provision 
is explained in greater detail in the section of the 

Analysis of 
Comments and Changes

 that addresses the factors of financial 
responsibility ( 668.15). 
In response to public comment,  668.13(d)(2) has been 
clarified to explain that financial guarantees are only required 
if the institution comes within the requirements of 
 668.15(c)(2), or where the institution fails to demonstrate 
financial responsibility under its current audit and has failed 
to do so at least one other time under the standards in effect 
during the preceding five years. 
In response to public comment, a new paragraph (e) is added 
to  668.13 which provides for denial of certification to initial 
applicants for participation in a Title IV, HEA program and to 
participants that have undergone a change of ownership resulting 
in a change of control, if the State in which those applicants or 
participants are located does not participate in the State 
Postsecondary Review Program. This addition conforms these 
regulations to the requirements of the State Postsecondary Review 
Program in 34 CFR part 667, and provides some further explanation 
of the consequences to an institution if the State in which the 
institution is located does not participate in the State 
Postsecondary Review Program. Under paragraph (e), the Secretary 
may provisionally certify a participating institution or branch 
campus in that State. Section 668.13(c)(2)(ii) has also been 
revised to provide that the provisional certification of an 
institution under these circumstances expires at the end of the 
third complete award year following the date of the provisional 
certification. 
In response to public comment, a change has been made to 
provide for notices of revocation of provisional certification to 
be sent by certified mail, instead of registered mail. 

In response to public comment,  668.13(f)(4)(i) has been 
modified to provide that the official reviewing a request for 
reconsideration of provisional certification must be different 
from, and not subject to supervision by, the official that issued 
the notice of revocation. 


Section 668.14 Program Participation Agreement 


In response to public comment,  668.14(b)(1) has been 
amended to clarify that an institution must comply with all 
special arrangements, agreements, or limitations entered into 
under the authority of statutes applicable to Title IV of the 
HEA. Corresponding changes have been made throughout the 
sections of 34 CFR part 668 and 34 CFR part 682 contained in this 
regulatory package. 
In response to public comment,  668.14(b)(4) has been 
amended to provide that an institution must provide information 
relating the administrative capability and financial 
responsibility of the information to a SPRE only if the 
institution was referred by the Secretary under 34 CFR 667.5. 
The proposed regulations prohibited any type of incentive 
payments, particularly those based on ``retention.'' In response 
to public comment, the Secretary has amended  668.14(b)(22) to 
allow that token gifts may be given to students or alumni for 
referring other students for admission to the institution, as 
long as: 
(1) The gift is not money, check or money order; 
(2) No more than one such gift is given to any student or 
alumnus; and 
(3) The value of the gift is no more than twenty-five 
dollars. 
In response to public comment, proposed  668.16(k) that 
requires that an institution: (1) Demonstrate a reasonable 
relationship between the length of the program and occupational 
entry level requirements and (2) establish the need for the 
training has been moved to  668.14(b)(26). Further, the 
requirements of this provision have been amended to require an 
institution to demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the 
length of the program and occupational entry level requirements 
established by any Federal agency.

Section 668.15 Factors of Financial Responsibility 



Sections 668.15(b) (1), (2), and (3) have been amended to 
clarify that, in order to be financially responsible, an 
institution must be providing the services described in its 
official publications and statements; providing the 
administrative resources necessary to comply with the 
requirements of subpart B; and meeting all if its financial 
obligations. This is a change from the proposed regulations that 
would have required an institution to demonstrate that it was 


able 

to provide and meet these requirements. The Secretary 
believes these changes more accurately reflect the intent of the 
regulations. 

In response to public comment,  668.15(b)(4) further defines 
the requirement that an institution be current in its debt 
payments. The Secretary considers an institution to be current 
in its long-term debt obligations if it is not in violation of 
existing loan agreements at the end of the institution's fiscal 
year. The Secretary considers an institution to not be current 
in all of its debt obligations whenever the institution is more 
than 120 days delinquent in making payments, and a legal claim 
has been initiated against the institution or a lien has been 
filed on its assets due to the non-payment of the obligation. 
The Secretary believes that an institution's non-payment of 
obligations is a serious concern because the possibility exists 
that legal actions brought by creditors may result in forfeiture 
of some or all of an institution's assets. Consistent with the 
determination that payment delinquencies place the institution at 
risk, the Secretary notes that such actions are also often 
precede an action by creditors to force a company into 
bankruptcy. 

In response to public comment,  668.15(b)(5) has been 
amended to require that the amount of an institution's required 
cash reserve shall be one-quarter of the amount the institution 
paid in refunds during its previous year, as shown in its audited 
financial statement. By using historical information specific to 
the individual institution, the Secretary provides for adequate 
reserves for all institutions, rather than establishing an across 
the board measure which would be inadequate for some and 
inappropriate for others. Also, in response to the comments, the 
regulations have been changed to require the cash reserve to be 
maintained as a cash deposit in a federally insured bank account 
or an investment in U.S. Treasury securities, with an original 
maturity of three months or less. 

Proposed  668.15(b)(6)(ii) that would have provided that an 
institution is financially responsible if the institution does 
not have a finding of unauthorized use of donor restricted net 
assets to meet current operating expenses, has been removed from 
these regulations. This change was made based upon general 
considerations that were presented in the public comments 
concerning the need to implement consistent standards for 
determining financial responsibility for for-profit and nonprofit 
institutions, and to simplify the administrative resources 
necessary to determine whether institutions were in compliance 
with the regulations. 

In response to numerous public comments, 
 668.15(b)(7)(i)(A) and (b)(8)(i)(B) have been amended to 
require that both for-profit institutions and nonprofit 
institutions must meet an acid test ratio of 1:1 to replace the 
proposed ratio requirements that differed for for-profit and 
nonprofit institutions. The acid test ratio is defined as the 
sum of cash and current accounts receivable, divided by current 
liabilities. The Secretary has kept the regulatory exclusions of 
unsecured or uncollateralized related party receivables because 
they represent capital outflows from an institution that do not 
contain provisions for repayment. The Secretary has allowed the 
inclusion of the institution's cash reserve requirement in the 
calculation of the acid test ratio. 

In response to public comment concerning the proper 
development of standards for nonprofit and for-profit 
institutions,  668.15(b)(7)(i)(B) has been amended to require 
that a for-profit institution may not have operating losses in 
one or both years exceeding ten percent of equity capital. The 
Secretary's intent is to determine whether a trend of continuing 
losses exists, or if a loss occurs in any one year that it's 
magnitude is such that it does not materially impact the equity 
of the institution. The Secretary has changed the reference year 
used in the calculation to be that of the beginning of the first 
year in the two year period rather than the most recently 
completed fiscal year. 

In response to public comment,  668.15(b)(7)(ii), 
(b)(8)(ii), and (b)(9)(v) have been added to provide that a for- 
profit institution, a nonprofit institution, or a public 
institution may demonstrate that it is financially responsible if 
it submits evidence of a superior bond rating as an alternative 
to having to meet the tests for financial responsibility. The 
Secretary considers an institution to be financially responsible 
if the institution has currently issued an outstanding debt 
obligations that are, without insurance, guarantee, or credit 
enhancement rated at or above the second highest level of rating 
given by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. 

Section 668.15(b)(8)(i)(C)(

1

) has been changed from the NPRM 
to incorporate the existing requirement that a nonprofit 
institution must have a positive unrestricted current fund 
balance or positive unrestricted net assets. This requirement is 
unchanged from the former requirement in effect for more than 
fourteen years that a nonprofit have a positive unrestricted 
current fund balance. 

Section 668.15(b)(8)(i)(C)(

2

) has been amended to require 
that a nonprofit institution may not have excess current fund 
expenditures in either or both of two years that results in a 
decrease in the current unrestricted fund or a decrease in 
unrestricted net assets of greater than ten percent of the 
institution's unrestricted current fund balance or unrestricted 
net assets in the beginning of the first year of the two year 
period. The proposed regulation would have required that a 
nonprofit institution not have a decrease in total net assets of 
such significance that if continued would result in a current 
ratio of less than 1:1. As in the requirement for for-profit 
institutions, the Secretary's intent is to determine whether a 
trend of continuing excess expenditures exists, or if a 
significant excess expenditure in any one year is so great in 
magnitude that it materially affects the unrestricted current 
fund balance or the unrestricted net assets of the institution. 

In the NPRM the Secretary proposed that a public institution 
is financially responsible only if it has its liabilities backed 
by the full faith and credit of a state. In response to public 
comment,  668.15(b)(9) has been revised to add three alternatives 
that a public institution may employ to demonstrate that it is 
financially responsible: for institutions reporting under the 
Single Audit Act, a positive unrestricted current fund balance; 
a positive unrestricted current fund balance in a state's Higher 
Education Fund, as presented in the general purpose financial 
statements of the state; or the submission of a statement by the 
State Auditor General that the institution has sufficient 
resources to meet all of its financial obligations. 

In response to public comment,  668.15(d)(ii) has been 
amended to identify the circumstances where an institution that 
does not otherwise demonstrate financial responsibility can 
continue to participate fully by showing that it meets certain 
conditions to demonstrate that it has sufficient resources to 
ensure against its precipitous closure. 

In response to public comment,  668.15(e)(3) has been added 
to clarify that the submission of an audit performed in 
accordance with the Single Audit Act satisfies the requirement 
for a submission of an audited financial statement under 
 668.15(e)(1).

Section 668.16 Standards of Administrative Capability 



In response to public comment, the Secretary has modified 
the proposed administrative standards significantly. The 
Secretary made some changes and clarified implementation of 
standards where commenters pointed out that the Secretary could 
achieve the same goal by requiring less detail or action by those 
institutions that have demonstrated a history of compliance with 
regulations governing the Title IV, HEA programs and by imposing 
more requirements or restrictions on institutions that either 
have no track record or have a record of problems administering 
the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary removed other sections 
of the proposed standards because there was overlap with the 
responsibilities of accrediting agencies or SPREs or duplication 
of other sections of the regulations. 

In response to public comment,  668.16(a) clarifies that an 
institution must administer the Title IV, HEA programs in 
accordance with all the statutory and regulatory provisions, and 
with any applicable special arrangement, agreement or limitation 
entered into under the authority of statutes applicable to Title 
IV of the HEA. 

In response to public comment,  668.16(b)(1) is amended by 
adding documented success in administering Title IV, HEA programs 
to the list of factors the Secretary may consider in determining 
whether an individual is capable. The Secretary intends to use 
the list of factors in  668.16(b)(2) primarily to assess the 
adequacy of staff levels at institutions that apply for initial 
participation, change of ownership, or the addition of a location 
or branch campus; institutions that make other changes that have 
an impact on the administrative capability of the institution, 
such as ceasing to use a financial aid servicer; and institutions 
with documented compliance violations. 

In the preamble to the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the Secretary 
solicited comment on the regulation of appropriate staffing 
levels at institutions. In response to public comment, the 
Secretary does not plan to specifically regulate in this area at 
this time. However,  668.16 has been amended to clarify that the 
Secretary will look at the number and distribution of financial 
aid staff when determining if an institution uses an adequate 
number of qualified persons to administer the Title IV, HEA 
programs. The Secretary believes this addition is inherent to 
this provision and should be clearly stated. However, the 
Secretary does not plan to closely scrutinize the number or 
distribution of financial aid staff at an institution unless the 
Secretary finds other indications that the institution may not be 
administratively capable due to understaffing or a poor 
distribution of staff at the institution. 

In response to public comment, use of third-party servicers 
is added to the list of factors in  668.16(b)(2). 

After consideration of public comment, the Secretary agrees 
that the burden to an institution of having to prepare written 
procedures for or written information indicating the nature and 
frequency of communication of pertinent information among all the 
offices that have an impact on the administration of the 
Title IV, HEA programs outweighs the benefit that this provision 
would provide to the Secretary. Therefore, proposed 
 668.16(b)(4)(i) has been removed from these final regulations. 
The Secretary also agrees that, unless compliance problems 
relevant to the listed responsibilities are identified, 
institutions may satisfy the requirement in  668.16(b)(4) that an 
institution have written procedures for or written information 
indicating the responsibilities of the various offices with 
respect to the approval, disbursement, and delivery of Title IV, 
HEA program assistance and the preparation and submission of 
reports to the Secretary by a general written description of the 
responsibilities of the various offices. 

In response to public comment,  668.16(e)(3)(B) is amended 
to clarify that a maximum time frame in which a student must 
complete his or her educational program must be no longer than 
150 percent of the published length of the educational program 
for full-time students. 

This section is also amended to clarify that the time frame 
must be divided into increments 

of equal size.

 The Secretary is 
making this change, as well as the change from previous 
regulations that requires increments to be the lesser of an 
academic year or one-half of the length of the program, to make 
clear that no increment can coincide with the length of the 
maximum time frame. 

Some institutions have used the previous provision as a 
means of avoiding determining satisfactory academic progress for 
a student until the student completes his or her program. 
Increments of the maximum time frame are expected to coincide 
with an institution's payment period, however. For example, in a 
program of one academic year that is structured on a quarter 
basis, the increments would be expected to be the quarters. 

In response to public comment,  668.16(f)(3) has been 
modified to include documentation of a student's social security 
number in the information normally available to an institution 
and for which the institution must have a system to identify and 
resolve discrepancies. 

In response to public comment,  668.16(g) has been amended 
to clarify that an institution must only refer to the Office of 
the Inspector General of the Department of Education 

credible

 
information indicating fraud and abuse.

In response to public comment, the following sections have been removed from these regulations: proposed  668.16(i)
that provided that an institution that serves significant numbers of students with special needs must have and implement
plans for providing students with information about how to meet their needs; proposed  668.16(j) that would
require institutions to have procedures for receiving, investigating, and resolving student complaints; proposed
 668.16(l), requiring that certain information be made available to students; proposed  668.16(m)
that required that an institution have advertising, promotion, and student recruitment practices that accurately
reflect the content and objective of the educational programs offered at the institution; proposed  668.16(o)
which addressed the issue of outstanding liabilities; and proposed  668.16(r), which proposed consideration
of completion, placement and pass rate standards. The specific reasons for the removal of these provisions are discussed
in the section of the 

Analysis of Comments and Changes

 that addresses administrative capability ( 668.16). 

In response to public comment, proposed  668.16(k) that requires that an institution: (1) demonstrate a reasonable
relationship between the length of the program and occupational entry level requirements and (2) establish the need
for the training has been moved to the program participation agreement section ( 668.14). 

In response to public comment,  668.16(j) has been amended to specify that the significant problems identified
in reviews of the institution that the Secretary will take into account in determining administrative capability,
relate to the administration of Title IV, HEA programs. 
Proposed  668.16(s), which would have made an annual cohort default rate of 20% in the FFEL programs and a 15%
default rate in the Federal Perkins Loan Program immutable standards of administrative capability, has been modified
in these final regulations in  668.16(m) as follows. The Secretary accepted commenters' arguments that it
would be more logical to use a 25% cohort default rate for the FFEL programs over a three-year period. Further, the Secretary
has specified in this section of the regulations that if an institution cannot be determined administratively capable
solely because the institution fails to comply with this section, the Secretary will provisionally certify the institution
in accordance with  668.13(c). An institution will have the right to appeal noncompliance with this provision
by submitting an appeal in accordance with  668.17(d). The Secretary has amended  668.17(c)(6) to specify
that this standard will not apply to tribally controlled colleges, HBCUs, and Navajo community colleges. 

In response to public comment, the Secretary has amended  668.16(l) to provide for the use of net enrollment
figures, after deduction of students who were entitled to a 100 percent refund, in the calculation of withdrawal rate.
In addition, the Secretary has now restricted the calculation of withdrawal rates to withdrawals of undergraduate
students. The Secretary believes that the undergraduate enrollment pattern is an adequate measurement of an institution's
ability to administer the Title IV, HEA programs. 


Section 668.17 Default Reduction Measures



In accordance with statute,  668.17(c)(6) has been amended to extend the exemption of historically black colleges
or universities (HBCUs), tribally controlled community colleges, and Navajo community colleges from the provisions
of  668.17(c)(1) to July 1, 1998. Section 668.17(c)(1) addresses the loss of participation in the FFEL programs
for institution's with cohort default rates above the specified thresholds. 
Section 668.17(f) which addresses Federal SLS Program participation has been deleted since the Federal SLS Program
is no longer in existence. 


Section 668.22 Institutional Refunds and Repayments



Section 668.22(a)(1)(ii), (e)(1)(i), (g)((2)(iv), (i)(1)(i)(B), and (i)(2)(iii) have been revised to reflect
that a student who has taken an approved leave of absence is considered to have withdrawn for purposes of Title IV, HEA
program refunds and repayments. This change has been made to ensure the treatment of leaves of absence is consistent
for all Title IV, HEA programs. The Federal Pell Grant Program regulations consider a student on a leave of absence
to have withdrawn for purposes of receiving Federal Pell Grant Program funds. This was inconsistent with the FFEL
programs regulations, which allowed an institution to consider a student on a leave of absence to still be enrolled.
The FFEL programs treatment of leaves of absence remains in effect, but only for in-school deferment purposes, not
for purposes of Title IV, HEA refunds and repayments. All Title IV, HEA programs will now treat a leave of absence as
a withdrawal for refund and repayment purposes. Corresponding changes have been made by removing the language addressing
leaves of absence in proposed  668.22(i)(1)(ii), (i)(2), and (i)(3)(iii). 
Section 668.22(a)(2) has been amended to clarify that the institution must provide refund examples to students only
upon request, and must inform students of the availability of these examples in the written statement of its refund
policy. The language proposed in the February 28, 1994 NPRM was unclear and implied that the required written refund
statement must include the refund examples themselves. 
In response to public comment,  668.22(c)(2) and (f)(2)(ii) has been amended to include allowable late disbursements
of unsubsidized Federal Stafford loans and loans made under the FDSL Program when calculating a student's unpaid
charges. This language has also been changed to allow for the inclusion of late disbursements of State student financial
assistance, provided the State in question has a standard written late disbursement policy which the institution
follows in calculating unpaid charges and provided the student is eligible to receive the late disbursement in spite
of having withdrawn. If an institution chooses to count a late disbursement of State student aid in this manner, the
institution will be liable for any amount not disbursed within 60 days after the student's withdrawal. If the late
disbursement of State aid does not come in, the institution must recalculate the Title IV, HEA program refund and return
any additional amounts required to the appropriate Title IV, HEA program accounts or to the lender within the applicable
regulatory deadlines. 
The February 28, 1994 NPRM proposed that certain fees could be subtracted from the refund due under a 

pro rata 

refund calculation. This treatment was consistent with previous 

pro rata 

guidance given under the FFEL programs. The February 28, 1994 NPRM pointed out that, as proposed, the calculation
included the fees in the institutional costs, allowed the institution to retain a prorated portion of those institutional
costs, and then allowed the full amount of those fees to be subtracted from the resulting refund. The resulting ``double-counting''
allowed the institution to retain more than the actual fees that were charged. In response to commenters that supported
the elimination of such double-counting,  668.22(c)(4) has been revised to allow an institution to exclude
certain fees from the 

pro rata 

refund calculation so that the most an institution would be allowed to retain is 100 percent of an institutional charge.

Further, in response to comment, the reference to an application fee as an excludable fee has been deleted as it is not
necessary to specifically allow for such an exclusion. The Secretary agrees with the commenters that asserted that
an application fee should not be a factor in the calculation of an institutional refund for Title IV, HEA program purposes,
because it is not an educational cost. 

The provision allowing for the exclusion of expended board credits in excess of the attributable prorated portion
(proposed  668.22(c)(1)(iv)), based on the period attended by the student prior to withdrawal, has been removed.
After further examination, the Secretary has found this provision to be excessively complicated and not entirely
effective in the purpose intended. No support for this provision was received from commenters and the Secretary plans
to revisit this issue in the future, after seeking further input from the financial aid community. Except for treatment
under the provision in  668.22(c)(6)(i), all room and board charges must be included in the 

pro rata

 refund calculation and refunded at the applicable percentage, as required by the Amendments of 1992. 

The language of  668.22(c)(5) (and corresponding language in Appendix A) has been changed to clarify the specific
requirements related to ``other charges assessed the student by the institution'' under the 

pro rata

 refund calculation. ``Other charges'' includes, but is not limited to, charges for any equipment, books, or supplies
issued by an institution to the student, provided that the enrollment agreement signed by the student specifies a
separate charge for such equipment or provided that the institution refers the student to an affiliated vendor for
purchase of the equipment. An institution may exclude the documented cost of such equipment from the 

pro rata

 refund calculation in the following instances: For unreturnable equipment, if the student actually receives and
keeps the equipment; or for returnable equipment, the student does not return the equipment in good condition allowing
for reasonable wear and tear, within 20 days after withdrawal. For example, an item is not considered to be in good condition
and, hence, is unreturnable, if it cannot be reused because of clearly recognized health and sanitary reasons. Institutions
must clearly disclose in the enrollment agreement any restrictions on the return of equipment, including identifying
equipment that is unreturnable. The regulatory language has been changed to reflect that an institution must notify
the student in writing, prior to enrollment, that return of such equipment will be required within 20 days of withdrawal.
It is the responsibility of the institution to determine whether specific equipment is returnable or not, in accordance
with State and accrediting agency guidelines. This change conforms with a similar provision from the FFEL programs
regulations. The Secretary believes that it would be unreasonable to expect a student to return equipment within
a certain time period without ensuring that the student has been informed of the conditions of acceptable return of
equipment. 

The February 28, 1994 NPRM proposed that institutions be exempted from making refunds of $25 or less, because the burden
and cost of making such a refund would exceed the amount refunded. However, that proposed change will not be made. Section
668.22(f)(3)(iii) has been amended to remove the proposed minimum dollar amount below which a refund would not have
to be made. After further consideration, the Secretary believes that this proposed provision is inconsistent with
the amendment made to section 490 of the HEA that established criminal penalties for failure to pay refunds, specifically
including refunds of less than two hundred dollars. Further, the Secretary believes that by the time the institution
has determined the amount of the refund, most of the administrative effort and cost has been expended. The Secretary
believes that neither the institution nor the student would benefit from the proposal to allow institutions to forego
making refunds of $25 or less. Also, the Secretary believes that part of the institution's administrative costs are
recouped through the administrative fee that is allowed to be excluded from the 

pro rata

 refund calculation. 

In response to public comment, language has been added to  668.22(i)(1)(ii) to limit an institution's determination
of a student's unofficial withdrawal to no later than 30 days after the expiration of the enrollment period, the academic
year, or the program, whichever is earlier. 
Section 668.22(i)(2) has been amended to clarify that the refund deadline in that paragraph is applicable only to
refunds made to students, and does not alter or affect the FFEL regulatory deadlines for returning a refund to a lender
or the regulatory deadline for returning a refund to a Title IV, HEA program account. 

In response to public comment, the Secretary has provided the following examples to aid in the implementation of the
refund requirements:

Fair and Equitable Refund: Term Institution





Institutional Profile. 

Term Community College (TCC) offers two- and four-year programs, measured in credit hours, and its academic year
is divided into two semesters, each 15 weeks long. TCC participates in the Federal Pell Grant program, the Federal
Family Education Loan (FFEL) programs, and the Federal campus-based programs. TCC charges by the semester: $1800
for tuition, $2500 for on-campus housing and meals, $25 for application, and $75 for administrative costs. Noninstitutional
charges include: books and supply costs (because these items are purchased separately by the student, from the campus
bookstore or an unaffiliated vendor), living expenses and meals (if the student lives in off-campus housing), transportation,
and personal miscellaneous expenses. (Noninstitutional costs vary by student budget, depending in part upon the
educational program in which the student enrolls.)

Applicable Refund Policies. 

The State in which TCC is located has a modified pro rata refund policy: students who withdraw on or before the 25 percent
point of the enrollment period receive a 75 percent refund; students who withdraw after the 25 percent point but on
or before the 50 percent point of the enrollment period receive a 50 percent refund; and students who withdraw after
the 50 percent point but on or before the 75 percent point of the enrollment period receive a 25 percent refund. (Students
withdrawing after the 75 percent point of the enrollment period receive no refund under State guidelines.) 
TCC's accrediting agency refund guidelines offer a 50 percent refund to students who withdraw in the first four weeks
of the enrollment period, and a 25 percent refund to those who withdraw after four weeks but before the beginning of
the ninth week. (Students withdrawing after that point receive no refund under the accrediting agency policy.) 


Student Profile. 

Sam the Student enrolled in a two-year program at TCC, moved into on-campus housing, and began attending classes.
Sam made a cash payment of $500 toward institutional charges. 


Financial Aid Package and Disbursements. 

Sam's financial aid package for the academic year consisted of a $2200 Federal Pell Grant, a $2400 Federal Stafford
Loan, a $1600 FSEOG, and $1000 in Federal Work-Study funds. Sam's first disbursement of Federal Pell Grant funds ($1100),
his first disbursement of Federal Stafford Loan funds ($1116_loan and origination fees have been subtracted), and
his first disbursement of FSEOG funds ($800), were credited to his institutional account. Sam received $400 of his
Federal Work-Study award, paid directly to him for living expenses, before he officially withdrew at the end of the
fifth week. 


Step One: Figuring the Educational Costs. 

Only institutional costs are included in the refund calculation. TCC must use the institutional costs as charged,
by the term, for a total of $4375_$1800 tuition, $2500 on-campus housing and meals (because Sam lives on-campus),
and $75 for administrative costs. (The $25 application fee is not a cost of education, so it is not included.) Noninstitutional
costs are treated in the repayment calculation. (See Example 

#

3.) 


Step Two: Figuring the Totals Paid to Institutional Costs. 

TCC's records show that Sam paid $500 in cash toward his institutional costs, and that a total of $3016 in student aid
was paid toward institutional charges [$1100 Federal Pell+$1116 Federal Stafford+800 FSEOG=$3016]. (The Federal
Work-Study funds are not reflected in this total, because funds earned through work-study cannot be required to be
refunded or returned, and are therefore not included in the calculation of a refund.) 
The total paid to institutional costs (student payments and financial aid) is $3516 [$500+$3016=$3516]. Only funds
paid to institutional charges are included in the refund calculation; aid disbursed to the student for noninstitutional
expenses is treated in the repayment calculation. (See Example 

#

3.) 


Step Three: Checking for Pro Rata Eligibility Under the Law. 

To determine whether Sam is eligible for a statutory 

pro rata

 refund calculation, TCC must determine if he's a first-time student and if he withdrew on or before the 60 percent point
in time of the enrollment period for which he was charged. Sam is a first-time student, because he's never attended
classes at TCC prior to this term. He withdrew at the end of the fifth week in the term; the term is 15 weeks long, and the
60 percent point is figured in calendar time for term institutions [15 weeks x .60=
9, so any withdrawal prior to the end of the ninth week falls within the 60 percent requirement of statutory 

pro rata

]. Sam withdrew at the end of the fifth week, so he is entitled to a statutory 

pro rata

 refund calculation. 


Step Four: Calculating the Unpaid Charges. 

Because a student's unpaid charges impact the refund calculation, TCC must first calculate Sam's unpaid charges
(as defined in  668.22(c) and (f)) using the following formula:




Total Institutional Costs ^Total Aid Paid to Institutional Costs 




=Student's Scheduled Cash Payment (SCP) ^Student's Cash Paid to Institutional Costs 




=Unpaid Charges




To calculate Sam's unpaid charges, TCC subtracts the $3016 in total aid paid to institutional costs (from Step Two,
above) from the Total institutional costs of $4375 (from Step One, above). The resulting scheduled cash payment is
$1359 [$4375^$3016=$1359]. From that total, TCC subtracts Sam's cash payment of $500 (from Step Two, above) and Sam's
unpaid charges equal $859 [$1359^$500=$859]. This amount ($859) will be used in all three refund calculations. 




Step Five: Calculating a Fair and Equitable Refund. 

Under the Amendments of 1992, TCC must calculate Sam's refund under State and accrediting agency guidelines, and
under statutory 

pro rata

 requirements. TCC must then use whichever calculation provides the largest refund. 
In accordance with the June 8, 1993 Student Assistance General Provisions regulations, for all refunds other than
statutory 

pro rata 

refunds, the student's unpaid charges must be subtracted from the amount the institution may otherwise retain. Therefore,
in calculating Sam's refund under State and accrediting agency guidelines, $859 (from Step Four, above) must be subtracted
from the amount TCC could otherwise retain. 
The State refund guidelines allow Sam a 50 percent refund (he withdrew after the 25 percent point but before the 50 percent
point), which means TCC is allowed to retain 50 percent of the institutional charges. Total institutional costs (from
Step One, above) are $4375. Assessed at 50 percent, this allows TCC to retain $2188 [$4375 x .50=$2187.5]. (Figures
are rounded to the nearest dollar.) However, in accordance with the June 8, 1993 regulations, TCC must subtract Sam's
unpaid charges of $859 (from Step Four, above) from this amount. Therefore, TCC is actually allowed to retain $1329
[$2188^$859=$1329]. Sam's refund under the State policy is $2187, figured by subtracting the amount TCC can retain
from the total paid to institutional costs (from Step Two, above) [$3516^$1329=$2187]. 
The accrediting agency refund guidelines allow Sam a 25 percent refund (he withdrew after four weeks but before the
beginning of the ninth week), which means TCC is allowed to retain 75 percent of the institutional charges. Total institutional
costs (from Step One, above) are $4375. Assessed at 75 percent, this allows TCC to retain $3281 [$4375 x .75=
$3281.25]. (Figures are rounded to the nearest dollar.) However, in accordance with the June 8, 1993 regulations,
TCC must subtract Sam's unpaid charges of $859 (from Step Four, above) from this amount. Therefore, TCC is actually
allowed to retain $2422 [$3281^$859=$2422]. Sam's refund under the accrediting agency policy is $1094, figured
by subtracting the amount TCC can retain from the total paid to institutional costs (from Step Two, above) [$3516^$2422=$1094].

To figure Sam's refund under the statutory 

pro rata

 refund calculation, TCC must first calculate the portion of the enrollment period that remains (in accordance with
 668.22(c)) by using the following formula for credit-hour programs:




Weeks Remaining in Period 
Total Weeks in Period 




=Portion of Enrollment Period That Remains




Sam withdrew at the end of the fifth week of a fifteen-week semester, so 10 weeks remain in the term. TCC calculates that
for Sam, 60 percent of the enrollment period remains [10+15=.666, rounded down to the nearest tenth]. The statutory


pro rata

 calculation allows Sam a refund proportionate to the portion of the enrollment period that remains: 60 percent. Total
institutional costs (from Step One, above) are $4375. However, under the statutory 

pro rata

 refund calculation, TCC is allowed to exclude from this amount an administrative charge, not to exceed the lesser
of $100 or 5 percent of the institutional charges (provided that the fee is a real and documented charge). Therefore,
the $75 administrative fee charged to all TCC students can be excluded, making the total institutional costs for statutory


pro rata

 purposes equal $4300 [$4375^$75=$4300]. (Had the administrative fee exceeded $100 or 5 percent of TCC's total institutional
charges, TCC could only have excluded the allowable portion of the fee.) Total institutional costs are assessed at
60 percent, making Sam's initial refund equal $2580 [$4300 x .60=$2580]. However, in accordance with the law,
TCC must subtract Sam's unpaid charges of $859 (from Step Four, above) from his initial refund amount. Therefore,
Sam's actual refund under the statutory 

pro rata

 refund calculation is $1721 [$2580^$859=$1721].

<PARENT> FR940429-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

After calculating all of Sam's possible refunds, TCC must 
use the calculation which provides for the largest refund. In 
this case, the largest refund is provided by the State refund 
calculation: $2187. This refund amount must be returned, in 
Sam's behalf, first to the Title IV, HEA programs and then to 
Sam, in accordance with the allocation priorities in  668.22(g); 
no portion of the refund due can be used to pay Sam's unpaid 
charges to TCC.

Fair and Equitable Refund: Nonterm Institution. 




Institutional Profile.

 Nonterm Technical Institute (NTI) 
offers 900-hour and 1200-hour programs, measured in clock hours, 
and its academic year is 30 weeks long. NTI participates in the 
Federal Pell Grant program and the Federal Family Education Loan 
(FFEL) programs. NTI charges by the program and requires payment 
up-front. The institutional costs of the 900-hour program are: 
$3000 for tuition; $520 for equipment, books, and supplies; and a 
$100 administrative fee. Institutional costs for the 1200-hour 
program are: $4000 for tuition; $740 for equipment, books, and 
supplies; and a $150 administrative fee. Noninstitutional 
charges include: living expenses and meals (NTI has no on-campus 
housing or food service), transportation, and personal 
miscellaneous expenses. (Noninstitutional costs vary by student 
budget, depending in part upon the educational program in which 
the student enrolls.) 


Applicable Refund Policies.

 The State in which NTI is 
located provides a 90 percent refund to students who withdraw 
before completing 10 percent of the program; students who 
withdraw after the 10 percent point but before completing 25 
percent of the program receive a 70 percent refund; students who 
withdraw after the 25 percent point but before completing 50 
percent of the program receive a 45 percent refund; and students 
who withdraw after the 50 percent point but before completing 75 
percent of the program receive a 20 percent refund. (Students 
withdrawing after completing 75 percent of the program receive no 
refund under State guidelines.) 
NTI's accrediting agency gives an 80 percent refund to 
students who withdraw before completing 15 percent of the 
program; students who withdraw after the 15 percent point but 
before completing 45 percent of the program receive a 50 percent 
refund; and students who withdraw after the 45 percent point but 
before completing 60 percent of the program receive a 25 percent 
refund. (Students withdrawing after completing 60 percent of the 
program receive no refund under the accrediting agency policy.) 


Student Profile.

 Susan the Student, who lives in an off-campus apartment, enrolled in a 900-hour program at NTI and began 
attending classes. Susan made a cash payment of $800 toward 
institutional charges. 


Financial Aid Package and Disbursements.

 Susan's financial 
aid package for the program consisted of a $2000 Federal Pell 
Grant and a $2325 Federal Stafford Loan. Susan's first Federal 
Pell Grant disbursement ($1000) and the first disbursement of her 
Federal Stafford Loan ($1081_loan and origination fees have been 
subtracted) were credited to her institutional account. At the 
end of the academic year, NTI determined that Susan had 
unofficially withdrawn. The last record of Susan's attendance 
was a midterm exam she'd taken after completing 450 hours of the 
program. 


Step One: Figuring the Educational Costs.

 Only 
institutional costs are included in the refund calculation. NTI 
must use the institutional costs as charged, by the term, for a 
total of $3620_$3000 tuition, $520 for equipment, books, and 
supplies, and $100 for administrative costs. Noninstitutional 
costs are treated in the repayment calculation. (See Example 


#

3.) 


Step Two: Figuring the Totals Paid to Institutional Costs.

 
NTI's records show that Susan paid $800 in cash toward her 
institutional costs, and that a total of $2081 in student aid was 
paid toward institutional charges [$1000 Federal Pell+$1081 
Federal Stafford=$2081]. 
The total paid to institutional costs (student payments and 
financial aid) is $2881 [$800+$2081=$2881]. Only funds paid 
to institutional charges are included in the refund calculation; 
aid disbursed to the student for noninstitutional expenses are 
treated in the repayment calculation. (See Example 

#

3.) 


Step Three: Checking for Pro Rata Eligibility Under the 
Law.

 To determine whether Susan is eligible for a statutory pro 
rata refund calculation, NTI must determine if she's a first-time 
student and if she withdrew on or before the point in time when 
she had completed 60 percent of the clock hours scheduled for the 
period of enrollment for which she was charged. Susan enrolled 
last year in the same program at NTI, but she never began 
attending classes and so was entitled to a 100 percent refund. 
Therefore, in accordance with the regulatory definition in 
 668.22(c), Susan is a first-time student. Susan's last recorded 
date of attendance was at the point of having completed 450 clock 
hours; 900 clock hours are scheduled for the program, and 60 
percent of the scheduled hours would be 540 clock hours [900 
hours x .60=540]. Because Susan is a first-time student and 
she withdrew before completing 60 percent of the hours scheduled, 
she is entitled to a statutory pro rata refund calculation. 


Step Four: Calculating the Unpaid Charges.

 Because a 
student's unpaid charges impact the refund calculation, NTI must 
first calculate Susan's unpaid charges (as defined in  668.22(c) 
and (f)) using the following formula:

 

Total Institutional Costs 
^Total Aid Paid to Institutional Costs 





=Student's Scheduled Cash Payment (SCP) 
^Student's Cash Paid to Institutional Costs 





=Unpaid Charges

 

To calculate Susan's unpaid charges, NTI subtracts the $2081 in 
total aid paid to institutional costs (from Step Two, above) from 
the total institutional costs of $3620 (from Step One, above). 
The resulting scheduled cash payment is $1539 [$3620^$2081=$1539]. From that total, NTI subtracts Susan's cash
payment of 
$800 (from Step Two, above) and Susan's unpaid charges equal $739 
[$1539^$800=$739]. This amount ($739) will be used in all 
three refund calculations.

Step Five: Calculating a Fair and Equitable Refund.

 Under 
the Amendments of 1992, NTI must calculate Susan's refund under 
State and accrediting agency guidelines, and under statutory 

pro 
rata

 requirements. NTI must then use whichever calculation 
provides the largest refund. 
In accordance with the June 8, 1993 Student Assistance 
General Provisions regulations, for all refunds other than 
statutory 

pro rata

 refunds, the student's unpaid charges must be 
subtracted from the amount the institution may otherwise retain. 
Therefore, in calculating Susan's refund under State and 
accrediting agency guidelines, $739 (from Step Four, above) must 
be subtracted from the amount NTI could otherwise retain. 
The State refund guidelines allow Susan a 20 percent refund 
(she withdrew after the 50 percent point but before completing 75 
percent of the program), which means NTI is allowed to retain 80 
percent of the institutional charges. Total institutional costs 
(from Step One, above) are $3620. Assessed at 80 percent, this 
allows NTI to retain $2896 [$3620 x .80=$2896]. However, in 
accordance with the June 8, 1993 regulations, NTI must subtract 
Susan's unpaid charges of $739 (from Step Four, above) from this 
amount. Therefore, NTI is actually allowed to retain $2157 
[$2896^$739=$2157]. Susan's refund under the State policy is 
$724, figured by subtracting the amount NTI can retain from the 
total paid to institutional costs (from Step Two, above) [$2881^$2157=$724]. 


The accrediting agency refund guidelines allow Susan a 25 
percent refund (she withdrew after the 45 percent point but 
before completing 60 percent of the program), which means NTI is 
allowed to retain 75 percent of the institutional charges. Total 
institutional costs (from Step One, above) are $3620. Assessed 
at 75 percent, this allows NTI to retain $2715 [$3620 x .75=$2715]. However, in accordance with the June 8, 1993

regulations, NTI must subtract Susan's unpaid charges of $739 
(from Step Four, above) from this amount. Therefore, NTI is 
actually allowed to retain $1976 [$2715^$739=$1976]. Susan's 
refund under the accrediting agency policy is $905, figured by 
subtracting the amount NTI can retain from the total paid to 
institutional costs (from Step Two, above) [$2881^$1976=$905]. 


To figure Susan's refund under the statutory 

pro rata

 refund 
calculation, NTI must first calculate the portion of the 
enrollment period that remains (in accordance with  668.22(c)) by 
using the following formula for clock-hour programs: 




Hours Remaining in Period 



Total Hours in Period 
=Portion of Enrollment Period That Remains

 

Susan's last recorded date of attendance was at the point of 
having completed 450 clock hours, so 450 hours remain in the 
program. NTI calculates that for Susan, 50 percent of the 
enrollment period remains [450
900=.50]. The statutory pro 
rata

 calculation allows Susan a refund proportionate to the 
portion of the enrollment period that remains: 50 percent. Total 
institutional costs (from Step One, above) are $3620. However, 
under the statutory 

pro rata

 refund calculation, NTI is allowed 
to exclude from this amount an administrative charge, not to 
exceed the lesser of $100 or 5 percent of the institutional 
charges (provided that the fee is a real and documented charge). 
Therefore, the $100 administrative fee charged to all NTI 
students can be excluded, making the total institutional costs 
for statutory 

pro rata

 purposes equal $3520 [$3620^$100=$3520]. (Had the administrative fee exceeded $100 or 5 percent 
of NTI's total institutional charges, NTI could only have 
excluded the allowable portion of the fee.) NTI could also 
exclude (from the total institutional costs) the documented cost 
of any returnable equipment that Susan failed to return in 
accordance with  668.22(c), and the documented cost of any 
unreturnable equipment that was actually issued to Susan (and 
kept by Susan) in accordance with 668.22(c). Total institutional 
costs are assessed at 50 percent, making Susan's initial refund 
equal $1760 [$3520 x .50=$1760]. However, in accordance with 
the law, NTI must subtract Susan's unpaid charges of $739 (from 
Step Four, above) from her initial refund amount. Therefore, 
Susan's actual refund under the statutory 

 pro rata

 refund 
calculation is $1021 [$1760^$739=$1021]. 


After calculating all of Susan's possible refunds, NTI must 
use the calculation which provides for the largest refund. In 
this case, the largest refund is provided by the statutory 

pro 
rata

 refund calculation: $1021. This refund amount must be 
returned, in Susan's behalf, first to the Title IV, HEA programs 
and then to Susan, in accordance with the allocation priorities 
in  668.22(g); NTI cannot bill Susan for any unpaid charges, 
because under the statutory 

pro rata

 refund calculation, those 
charges have been paid by Title IV, HEA program funds.

Repayment Calculation 




Institutional Profile.

 United States Academy (USA) offers 
one- and two-year programs on a semester system; its academic 
year is 30 weeks long and divided into two equal semesters, each 
15 weeks in length. USA participates in the Federal Pell Grant 
program and the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) programs. 
USA charges $800 tuition per semester. Noninstitutional costs 
are assessed by the semester at the following average rates: 
$3000 for living expenses and meals (USA has no on-campus housing 
or food service), $250 for books and supplies (not purchased 
through the institution), $600 for transportation, and $300 for 
personal miscellaneous expenses. (Noninstitutional cost 
assessments are amended as necessary based on individual student 
needs and circumstances.) 


Institutional Repayment Policy.

 In keeping with the local 
bookstore's refund policy, 50 percent of the books and supplies 
allowance is incurred at the time of purchase. All other 
noninstitutional (living) expenses are prorated based on the 
percentage of the semester completed. 


Student Profile.

 Sarah the Student, who lives in an off-campus apartment, enrolled for the winter semester at USA and 
began attending classes. She made a $400 cash payment toward her 
tuition costs. Her noninstitutional costs are adequately 
reflected in the institution's average student budget. 


Financial Aid Package and Disbursements.

 Sarah's financial 
aid package for the program consisted of a $1800 Federal Pell 
Grant and a $2000 Federal Stafford Loan. Sarah's first Federal 
Pell Grant disbursement ($900) was applied first to her tuition 
balance ($400) and the remaining $500 was then disbursed to her 
in cash. The first disbursement of her Federal Stafford Loan 
($930_loan and origination fees have been subtracted) was also 
disbursed directly to her. Sarah officially withdrew after 
attending 4 weeks. 


Step One: Figuring Expenses Actually Incurred.

 Only 
noninstitutional costs are included in a repayment calculation. 
Institutional costs are treated in the refund calculation. (See 
Examples 

#

1 and 

#

2.) According to USA's repayment policy, 50 
percent of Sarah's $250 books and supplies allowance was incurred 
at the time of purchase [$250 x .50=$125]. The rest of her 
semester expenses, for living expenses and meals, transportation, 
and personal miscellaneous expenses, are prorated based on the 
percentage of the term completed. Total noninstitutional costs 
equal $3900 [$3000+$600+$300=$3900]. Because Sarah 
completed 4 of 15 weeks, these costs should be prorated at 27 
percent [4
15=.266, rounded to the nearest tenth]. 
Therefore, Sarah's noninstitutional costs incurred equal $1053 
[$3900 x .27=$1053]. 


Step Two: Figuring the Total Federal Student Financial Aid 
(SFA) Disbursed as Cash.

 Sarah received $500 of her Federal Pell 
Grant in cash, and all of her first Stafford Loan disbursements, 
$930, in cash. However, in accordance with  668.22(e), the 
repayment calculation does not include any Title IV, HEA program 
loan amounts disbursed as cash, because those loan funds will 
have to be repaid by the student anyway. Therefore, a total of 
$500 cash disbursed is considered for repayment purposes. (As 
with the refund calculation, the repayment calculation does not 
include any Federal Work-Study funds disbursed as cash, because 
repayment of work earnings cannot be required. Notice that 
students Sam and Susan, from Examples 

#

1 and 

#

2 respectively, 
would not have owed repayments because they received no cash 
disbursements other than FFELP loan funds or Federal Work-Study 
funds.)

<TEXT>
 



Step Three: Calculating the Repayment Owed. 

To calculate Sarah's owed repayment, USA must subtract the total costs incurred ($1053, from Step One above) from
the total cash disbursed ($500, from Step Two above). In Sarah's case, this calculation results in a negative number
[$500^$1053=0], which means she owes no repayment. If her cash disbursement had exceeded her costs incurred, however,
she would have been required to repay the balance back to the Title IV, HEA program funds (the Federal Pell Grant program,
in this case), in accordance with the allocation priorities in  668.22(g); if Sarah had owed unpaid charges
to USA, no portion of the repayment owed could be used to pay those charges. 


Section 668.23 Audits, Records, and Examinations 


The Secretary has amended  668.23 by requiring an institution or a third-party servicer with which the institution
contracts to cooperate with the institution's nationally recognized accrediting agency in the conduct of audits,
investigations, or program reviews authorized by law, in addition to the other authorized entities that were stipulated
in the NPRMs. 
In addition, the Secretary has amended this section to require an institution to have performed, without exception,
on an annual basis, a compliance audit of an institution's administration of its Title IV, HEA programs or a third-party
servicer to have performed, without exception, on an annual basis, a compliance audit of a third-party's administration
of an aspect of an institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program. 
The Secretary is removing the audit exceptions proposed in the NPRMs that would have exempted certain institutions
and third-party servicers from some or all of the audit requirements of this section because upon further review,
the Secretary has determined that the proposed exemptions were inconsistent with the requirement in section 487(c)
of the HEA that annual compliance audits be provided for in these regulations. However, changes are planned for the


Student Financial Assistance Programs Audit Guide

 to reduce administrative costs by allowing institutions meeting certain performance-based or funding criteria
to submit compliance audits under a reviewed or compiled basis rather than a full compliance audit. 
Paragraph (c)(3) is revised to specify that an institution's or third-party servicer's audit report must be submitted
to the Department of Education's Office of Inspector General within 120 days after the end of the institution's or
servicer's fiscal year. An institution or third-party servicer that submits an audit conducted in accordance with
the Single Audit Act (Chapter 75 of Title 31, United States Code) is required to submit that audit report in accordance
with the deadlines established in that act. 
Finally, paragraph (c)(4) is revised to include the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in the list of entities that the
Secretary may require an institution or a third-party servicer to provide, upon request, the results of any audit
conducted under this section.

Section 668.82 Standard of Conduct 


The Secretary has revised paragraph (d)(1)(D) to clarify that a third-party servicer violates its fiduciary duty
and that of any institution with which the servicer contracts if the servicer uses or contracts in a capacity that involves
any aspect of the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs any person, agency, or organization that has been or
whose officers or employees are guilty of a crime or judicially or administratively determined to have committed
fraud or other material violation of law with respect to government funds. 


Section 668.92 Fines 


The Secretary has revised this section to take into account additional criteria when determining the amount of a fine
against a third-party servicer. Paragraph (a)(5) is revised so that a repeated mechanical systemic unintentional
error is not counted as a single violation if the third-party servicer, against whom the fine is assessed, had already
been cited for a similar violation and had not taken the appropriate steps to correct the problem. The Secretary will
also take into consideration in determining the amount of the fine, the amount of Title IV, HEA program funds that were
wasted as a result of the repeated mechanical systemic unintentional error. The Secretary also makes a conforming
change in  682.413 to parallel the changes described in this section. 


Part 682_Federal Family Education Loan Programs



Subpart D_Guaranty Agency Programs 


Section 682.413 Remedial Actions 


The Secretary has revised the provisions of this section governing the means of collecting a liability that results
from a third-party servicer's violation of applicable Title IV, HEA program requirements in administering a lender's
or guaranty agency's FFEL programs. A third-party servicer is required to repay any outstanding liabilities because
of its violation only if the lender or guaranty agency has not paid the full amount of the liability or has not made satisfactory
arrangements to pay the amount of the liability within 30 days from the date that the lender or guaranty agency receives
the notice from the Secretary of the liability. If the 30-day period elapses and the lender or guaranty agency has not
paid the full amount of the liability within that time frame or has not set up a payment plan acceptable to the Secretary
to repay that liability, the Secretary will attempt to collect any remaining amount owed by offsetting the lender's
or guaranty agency's first bill to the Secretary for interest benefits or special allowance. After that, if the liability
has not been completely paid, the Secretary will seek payment for the remainder of the liability from the third-party
servicer. 


Section 682.416 Requirements for Third-Party Servicers and Lenders Contracting With Third-Party Servicers



The Secretary has revised paragraph (b) to specify that the Secretary will apply the provisions of 34 CFR 668.15(b)
(1)-(4) and (6)-(9) to determine that a third-party servicer is financially responsible under this part.
Any references to an institution under those provisions shall be understood to mean the third-party servicer, for
this purpose. 


Analysis of Comments and Changes 


In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRMs, 84 parties submitted comments on the NPRM published on February
17, 1994 and 421 parties submitted comments on the NPRM published on February 28, 1994. An analysis of the comments
and of the changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRMs follows. 
Substantive issues are discussed under the section of the regulations to which they pertain. Technical and other
minor changes and suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under the applicable statutory
authority are not addressed. 
General comments that refer to broad issues rather than a specific section or sections of the proposed regulations
are discussed first, followed by a discussion of other issues in the order in which they appeared in the NPRMs. 
It should be noted that not all comments are addressed in these final regulations. There are several reasons for this.
First, many of the concerns expressed by commenters were directed to the statute, not the proposed regulations. In
some instances, those comments are mentioned in the discussion that follows because of the importance of the issues
that were raised. In most instances, however, they are not mentioned because the Secretary is not legally authorized
to make the changes suggested by commenters. Second, many commenters made excellent suggestions for editorial and
technical changes, as well as other minor changes, that, in the Secretary's opinion, strengthened the regulations;
the Secretary has merely incorporated these suggestions without comment. Third, some comments appeared to be based
on misunderstandings of what was actually in the NPRMs. For example, a few commenters expressed concern about the
absence of a particular provision that was, in fact, included in the NPRMs. In general, these types of comments are
not discussed. 


General Comments 


The Secretary received numerous comments about the overall impact of the proposed regulations. In general, commenters
opposed to the proposed regulations believed that the February 28, 1994 NPRM did not achieve the coordinated balance
of responsibilities among the triad members that it sought to achieve, and that it provided for extensive and duplicative
data collection and reporting requirements that created a costly and unnecessary burden on the higher education
community. Further, they believed that the regulations did not regulate ``narrowly to the law,'' as they purported
to do. In general, these commenters suggested that the Secretary should review each requirement in the proposed regulations
to determine if it was required by the statute and should further ensure that all requirements that meet this test and
are included in the final regulations are implemented in the most reasonable and cost effective manner. This, they
believed, would ensure the Department's compliance with Executive Order 12866. 
The more specific concerns of commenters opposed to the proposed regulations may be summarized as follows: 
(1) The proposed regulations are overly prescriptive and excessive in detail and either exceed the statutory authority
of the Secretary or significantly expand the statute beyond Congressional intent. 
(2) The proposed regulations will force institutions and third-party servicers to engage in excessive and duplicative
information gathering and reporting, at considerable cost, with no net increase in the quantity or quality of information
available to the public, and will result in the diversion of institutions' and third-party servicers' already scarce
resources away from their primary mission of providing a quality education.

<PARENT> FR940429-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) The proposed regulations threaten the diversity of American higher education and fail to focus oversight properly
on vocational institutions.

In addition to receiving comments in opposition to the proposed regulations, the Secretary received comments supportive
of the NPRM. For example, these commenters favored the increased protections for students in the changes to the refund
provisions, and approved of the strengthening of the administrative capability and financial responsibility standards.

Finally, the Secretary received suggestions from several commenters that the Department should strongly encourage
all triad members to work together and adopt the same or similar language for the various standards, should collect
the necessary data through a common source such as readily available public information or IPEDS, and should use common
methodologies for various calculations such as completion or withdrawal rates.



Discussion: 

As suggested by several commenters, the Secretary has carefully reviewed each requirement in the proposed regulations
in light of statutory intent. The Secretary has also carefully considered both the burden of the proposed regulations
on institutions and third-party servicers, in terms of cost, duplication of effort, and the added recordkeeping
and reporting requirements. Similarly, the Secretary has considered the benefits of the proposed regulations,
not just to institutions and third-party servicers but to students and the general public as well. A particular concern
of the Secretary has been how to ensure that the regulations hold the three members of the triad accountable for the
manner in which they fulfill their responsibilities under the HEA yet still provide each member of the triad the flexibility
to determine the appropriate means to carry out those responsibilities.

In general, the Secretary has responded to the concerns of commenters by eliminating much of what was perceived as
excessive detail in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, thus providing institutions more flexibility to meet a particular
requirement in the manner that best suits their needs. The final regulations make it quite clear that the Secretary
continues to bear the primary responsibility for enforcing standards and requirements to ensure that institutions
and third-party servicers administer Title IV, HEA program funds properly.

The Secretary does not believe that the Department's role overshadows those of the accrediting agencies or the States.
These regulations not only speak to the responsibilities of each member of the triad, but also establish the Federal
requirements for institutions and third-party servicers under the HEA. Therefore, the Federal role in these regulations
may appear larger than that envisioned for the States and accrediting bodies, but this appearance is due to the inclusion
of the implementing regulations for these responsibilities. Without question, the States and accrediting bodies
will exercise their responsibilities by promulgating and implementing standards for HEA program participants,
and the Secretary anticipates that any overview of all such requirements by the triad would show that the Federal role
has been appropriately established. The Secretary notes that some of the commenters specific concerns are addressed
in the 

Analysis of Comments and Changes

 section of these regulations.

Finally, with regard to the issue of whether the regulations properly focus on vocational institutions, the Secretary
wishes to note that Congress found abuses in all sectors of higher education, not just the vocational sector. For this
reason, the regulations apply to all institutions.



Changes: 

The specific changes to the regulations are discussed below.



Part 668_Student Assistance General Provisions


Subpart A_General


Section 668.2 General Definitions.





Academic Year. Comments: 

Many commenters argued that the proposed definition of a week in determining the length of an academic year should
not be based on the number of days of instructional time for institutions that use clock hours to measure program length.
These commenters suggested that a week of instructional time should be based on the number of clock hours completed
by a student. Some of these commenters suggested that a week of instructional time should be defined as 24 clock hours;
another commenter suggested 30 clock hours. A number of these commenters suggested that this approach was more consistent
with the regulatory requirements for calculating pro-rata refunds, which relies on the number of clock hours completed
by students.



Discussion: 

Section 481(d)(1) of the HEA requires that an academic year must be a minimum of 30 weeks of instructional time in which
a full-time student is expected to complete at least 900 clock hours at an institution that measures program length
in clock hours. Thus, the statute requires a minimum of 30 weeks and a minimum of 900 clock hours; both standards must
be met.



Changes: 

None.



Comments: 

Many commenters recommended that the Secretary implement the provision in the Technical Amendments of 1993 that
provides that the Secretary may reduce, for good cause, the 30-week minimum to not less than 26 weeks of instructional
time.

Many of these commenters suggested that ``good cause'' should be based on educational outcomes, such as placement
rates or completion rates. Some commenters suggested the same standard that was proposed for short-term programs
in  668.8_a 70 percent completion rate and a 70 percent placement rate. Other commenters suggested that approval
by an institution's nationally recognized accrediting agency or State postsecondary review entity (SPRE) would
demonstrate good cause. Some commenters suggested that good cause should be based on whether an educational program
has historically provided instruction for less than 30 weeks in previous academic years. Other factors suggested
for defining good cause included fiscal stability of an institution, scheduling adjustments due to natural disasters,
ethnic composition of an institution's student population, an accelerated or concentrated educational program,
and educational programs that offer advanced placement.

Some commenters recommended that no reductions in the 30-week minimum should be permitted or that reductions should
be approved on an extremely limited basis in order to avoid inequitable treatment of institutions and students.



Discussion: 

The Secretary did not propose specific criteria to implement this technical amendment in the February 28, 1994 NPRM,
but instead requested comments on a definition of ``good cause'' and requested comments on ways of implementing this
provision that addressed the Secretary's concern that reductions in the award year would encourage many institutions
to seek that treatment routinely. After reviewing public comments on defining good cause, and developing safeguards
to discourage routine requests for reductions in the academic year, the Secretary has implemented this technical
amendment through regulation.

In an effort to discourage routine requests, the Secretary will grant a reduction for institutions that can demonstrate
a commitment to changing to a 30-week academic year, but will not permit the period of reduction to exceed two years.
For institutions that do not demonstrate a commitment to changing to a 30-week academic year, the Secretary may grant
a reduction for a limited period, on a case-by-case basis.

The Secretary agrees with the commenters that suggested approval by an institution's nationally recognized accrediting
agency or State body that authorizes the institution to provide postsecondary programs should be considered as factors
in determining good cause on a case-by-case basis, but such approval may not be a sufficient reason for granting an
institution's request. Other factors that should be taken into account include the number of hours of attendance
and other coursework that a full-time student is required to complete in the academic year, and any unique circumstances
that justify granting the institution's request.

The Secretary does not believe that placement rates, completion rates or other educational outcomes that may measure
the quality of an educational program are relevant in determining whether the instruction offered in less than thirty
weeks is sufficient to justify a reduction in the minimum standard. Other factors suggested by commenters may qualify
as unique circumstances that justify granting the institution's request, depending upon the context in which these
factors are presented in a particular case.

<TEXT>
 

Every institution that requests a reduction must also demonstrate that it has provided Title IV, HEA program funds
to its students based on the academic-year requirements in section 481(d) of the HEA since July 23, 1992, as the requirements
became applicable to the various Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary believes institutions must have made a good
faith effort to comply with the requirements of the statute. Institutions that did not comply with the law should not
now expect to receive a temporary waiver.



Changes: 

A new  668.3 is established, under which, for the purpose of awarding Title IV, HEA funds, the Secretary may reduce
the length of an academic year for an institution that submits a written request to the Secretary. The request must
identify each educational program for which a reduced academic year is requested and specify the requested length,
which may not be less than 26 weeks of instructional time. The Secretary considers requests for reducing an academic
year only for educational programs at institutions that provide 2-year and 4-year programs leading to associate
degrees or baccalaureate degrees, respectively. In addition, an institution must demonstrate that it has provided
Title IV, HEA program funds to its students based on the academic-year requirements in section 481(d) of the HEA since
July 23, 1992.

In addition, for an institution that currently has an academic year of less than 30 weeks and demonstrates that it is
in the process of changing to a 30-week academic year, the Secretary will grant a reduction for a period not to exceed
two years.

For an institution that meets all of the above requirements other than demonstrating a commitment to changing to a
30-week academic year, the Secretary may grant a reduction for a limited period, on a case-by-case basis, The Secretary
considers such factors as approval of the academic year for each educational program by the institution's accrediting
agency or State body that legally authorizes the institution to provide postsecondary education, the number of hours
of attendance and other coursework that a full-time student is required to complete in the academic year, and any unique
circumstances that justify granting the institution's request.



Comments: 

Some commenters supported the proposed definition of a week as a seven-day period of instructional time in which one
day of regularly scheduled instruction, examination, or preparation for examination occurs. Some commenters argued
that the standard of one day a week was too lax and susceptible to abuse. One commenter suggested that the minimum standard
for one week of instructional time should be revised to require one instructional hour per week. Another commenter
suggested that the definition of an academic year should be based on the total number of days of scheduled instruction.



Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees with those commenters who were concerned that the proposed definition of a week of instructional
time was susceptible to abuse. Based on these comments and on information the Secretary has received regarding abuses
in this area, the Secretary believes that the standard of one regularly scheduled instructional day per week needs
to be increased to five days of regularly scheduled time per week for educational programs using credit hours and not
using a semester, trimester, or quarter system. Under the proposed definition published in the February 28, 1994
NPRM, institutions could structure programs that do not use clock hours or standard academic terms to provide one
class a week and permit those classes to be ``made up'' later in the program, in order to maximize the amount of Title
IV, HEA program funds received by the institution.



Changes: 

A change has been made. For an educational program using credit hours but not using a semester, trimester, or quarter
system, the Secretary considers a week of instructional time to be any week in which at least five days of regularly
scheduled instruction, examinations, or preparation for examinations occurs. A corresponding change has been
made to the definition of an 

eligible program

.



Comments: 

A number of commenters suggested that instructional time should include internships. Some commenters suggested
including other activities, such as periods of orientation, cooperative education, independent study, special
studies, and research.



Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees that internships, cooperative education programs, independent study, and other forms of regularly
scheduled instruction can be considered as part of an institution's academic year. In most cases, research is not
considered to be regularly scheduled instruction. Orientation programs do not provide educational instruction
related to class preparation or examination and must not be included in determining the length of an academic year.



Changes: 

None.



Comments: 

Several commenters argued that the proposed academic year definition would make it difficult for institutions to
develop creative programs that allow students to accelerate their educational programs. One commenter believed
that, if the Secretary does not account for these types of programs, a student will no longer have an incentive to accelerate
his or her educational program, and the Department will expend more Title IV, HEA program funds on longer periods of
study.



Discussion: 

Because the cost of a student's education includes living expenses in addition to the cost of tuition and fees, the
Secretary believes that students who have an incentive to reduce their costs by accelerating their educational programs
will still have a strong incentive to pursue a more concentrated or intensive course load. In addition, the Secretary
will consider unique circumstance in determining whether to reduce the academic year for programs that are eligible
for such consideration.



Changes: 

None.



Comments: 

A commenter suggested that the Secretary define two-thirds of an academic year as a minimum of 15 weeks of instructional
time and one-third of an academic year as 10 weeks of instructional time in order to clarify the procedure for prorating
the awards for students attending programs that are less than an academic year.

Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees that the procedure for 
prorating the awards for students attending programs that are 
less than an academic year needs to be clarified. However, the 
Secretary does not believe that 15 weeks of instructional time is 
an adequate minimum standard for two-thirds of an academic year. 
If the minimum standard for a full academic year is 30 weeks, the 
minimum standard for two-thirds of an academic year should be 
two-thirds of 30 weeks (20 weeks). 



Changes: 

A change has been made. In  668.2, the Secretary 
defines two-thirds of an academic year as a period that is at 
least two-thirds of an academic year as determined by an 
institution. At a minimum, two-thirds of an academic year must 
be a period that begins on the first day of classes and ends on 
the last day of classes or examinations and is a minimum of 20 
weeks of instructional time during which, for an undergraduate 
course of study, a full-time student is expected to complete at 
least 16 semester or trimester hours or 24 quarter hours in an 
educational program whose length is measured in credit hours or 
600 clock hours in an educational program whose length is 
measured in clock hours. For an institution whose academic year 
has been reduced under  668.3, one-third of an academic year is 
the pro-rated equivalent, as measured in weeks and credit or 
clock hours, of at least two-thirds of the institution's academic 
year. 

In  668.2, the Secretary also defines one-third of an 
academic year as a period that is at least one-third of an 
academic year as determined by an institution. At a minimum, 
one-third of an academic year must be a period that begins on the 
first day of classes and ends on the last day of classes or 
examinations and is a minimum of 10 weeks of instructional time 
during which, for an undergraduate course of study, a full-time 
student is expected to complete at least 8 semester or trimester 
hours or 12 quarter hours in an educational program whose length 
is measured in credit hours or 300 clock hours in an educational 
program whose length is measured in clock hours. For an 
institution whose academic year has been reduced under  668.3, 
one-third of an academic year is the pro-rated equivalent, as 
measured in weeks and credit or clock hours, of at least one- 
third of the institution's academic year. 



Comments: 

Several commenters suggested that the definition of an 
academic year in  668.2 should be amended to reflect the 
provision in the Technical Amendments of 1993 specifying that the 
definition of academic year in section 481 of the HEA applies 
only to an undergraduate course of study. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees that a limitation in the 
definition of academic year needs to be included in  668.2. 
However, the Secretary notes that the requirement that an 
academic year require a minimum of 30 weeks of instructional time 
applies to both undergraduate and graduate courses of study. 



Changes: 

A change has been made to clarify that the amount of 
instruction that a full-time student is required to complete 
during an academic year applies only to an undergraduate course 
of study. 



Full-time student. Comments: 

Several commenters believed that the Secretary should 
address the potential for abuse under the definition of 

academic 
year 

for educational programs that are measured in credit hours. 
One commenter suggested that the Secretary establish a weekly 
minimum full-time workload for full-time students in these 
programs by tying quarter hours to actual quarters to prevent an 
institution from claiming to offer a full academic year's worth 
of work over a thirty-week period by giving a full-time student a 
small amount of instruction, which the institution claims to be 
equivalent to 24 semester or 36 quarter hours. The commenter 
also suggested that the Secretary eliminate the use of quarter or 
semester hours for institutions that do not have quarters or 
semesters and instead require those institutions to measure their 
programs in clock hours. 

Two commenters urged the Secretary to reject any mechanism 
where the institution would be responsible for self-measuring the 
quantity of work required because it would be too easy for 
unscrupulous institutions to evade. Instead, the commenters 
recommended that only bona fide courses, related work, research, 
or special studies would count toward whether a student would be 
full-time, and that each institution's quantification would have 
to be approved during the certification process set forth in 
 668.13. One commenter also suggested that the Secretary change 
the procedures and not permit institutions to measure workloads 
for term or semester based schools in clock hours, because the 
clock hour schedules permitted institutions to compress the 
course offerings into too short a time period. 

A few commenters advised that the clock hour/credit hour 
regulation would provide the protection necessary for the weekly 
schedules of students enrolled at institutions offering credit 
hours without terms, and recommended that no further action be 
taken in changing the proposed definition of full-time student. 
Several other commenters stated that they believed the proposed 
definition was sufficient to prevent abuse without further 
additions to establish a minimum full-time course workload. One 
commenter suggested that no stricter definition be adopted for 
full-time students enrolled at institutions offering credit hours 
without terms because this area is currently addressed by 
accrediting agencies, which are in a better position to evaluate 
the variety of delivery systems used by postsecondary 
institutions. One commenter also questioned whether it was fair 
to adopt a more stringent criterion for credit hour programs 
without academic terms rather than adopting uniform criteria and 
standards for full-time students for all sectors of postsecondary 
education. 

One commenter suggested that the proposed definition was 
unfair because it requires the same number of credit hours for a 
student regardless of whether the courses are measured in 
semester hours or quarter hours, resulting in students having to 
perform a greater quantity of work during a quarter calendar if 
they were taking semester hours. Several other commenters 
suggested that the proposed definition was unfair because it 
would prohibit students from taking cooperative employment for 
periods that were less than eighteen weeks. These commenters 
suggested that shorter periods of cooperative education should be 
accepted in conjunction with a smaller number of credits so long 
as the workload was pro-rated to match the academic workload of a 
full-time student. For example, a student taking cooperative 
education for one-fourth of the credits necessary to be a full-time student would have to complete the cooperative
training in 
one-fourth of the time allotted to a full-time student in an 
eighteen week program. Two other commenters stated that the 
proposed definition would establish workloads that could not 
readily be satisfied by part-time students or students that were 
taking evening or weekend classes. These commenters believed 
that students in these circumstances were often making many more 
sacrifices to pursue their education than full-time day students, 
and that it was unfair to reduce or eliminate aid that these 
students currently receive because they do not carry enough 
credits to qualify for comparable aid under the proposed 
regulations. 

One commenter suggested that the in-class attendance should 
be the only component of the student workload considered for this 
provision, and that under that standard the definition for full-time student would require at least 12 hours of attendance
per 
week to correspond to the 12 credit hour workload. 

A few other commenters suggested that the proposed 
definition be clarified to show that only students taking classes 
``entirely'' by correspondence would not be required to meet the 
workload requirements set out in the proposed definition. Others 
suggested that the language for credit hour workloads be amended 
to show that trimester hours would require the equivalent 
workload for semester hours for academic terms and academic 
years. 



Discussion: 

As stated in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, this 
definition of 

full-time student

 is based primarily on the 
longstanding definition found in the Federal Pell Grant and the 
campus-based program regulations. The Secretary believes this 
definition of 

full-time student 

has proved to be appropriate and 
effective and does not believe any substantive changes are 
necessary. The Secretary notes that this definition is now 
applicable for purposes of all Title IV, HEA programs. The 
individual Title IV, HEA program regulations will be amended at a 
later date to remove the definition of 

full-time student.

The Secretary believes that additional changes are 
appropriate in the regulations to prevent institutions from 
establishing elongated instructional schedules that do not 
require an appropriate workload throughout that period for a 
full-time student. Institutions offering credit hour programs 
without terms have more flexibility in shifting the workload 
requirements for their programs over an indefinite period, and 
the Secretary believes that it is appropriate to establish some 
minimum instructional periods that must be used for full-time 
students attending these institutions. No corresponding changes 
need to be made where students are already required to receive a 
minimum amount of clock hours of training per week to be full- 
time students, or where the institution has fixed terms. 

The Secretary also believes it is important to ensure 
through regulations that full-time students are performing 
comparable workloads regardless of the type of institution they 
are attending, and that such work should be ratably allocated 
throughout the period of instruction. The Secretary notes that 
this is an area of abuse that is not fully addressed by the 
implementation of the ``clock hour/credit hour'' regulations. 

Rather than changing the proposed definition of full-time 
student to require measurement of student workloads, a 
modification is being made to require a minimum number of days of 
instruction per week for institutions that offer credit hour 
programs without terms. A discussion of the specific change is 
included in the section of the Analysis of Comments and Changes 

that addresses the definition academic year ( 668.2). 



Changes: 

None. 



Undergraduate student. Comments: 

Several commenters objected to defining an 


undergraduate student 

as a student who has not earned a 
baccalaureate or first professional degree. The commenters noted 
that this would prevent students who were pursuing further 
undergraduate studies from receiving any Title IV, HEA program 
assistance. The commenters noted that this was a departure from 
current departmental practice that permits such a student to 
receive assistance under the Title IV, HEA loan programs. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary recognizes that there are legitimate 
reasons supported by statute for separate definitions of an 


undergraduate student 

based upon the different statutory 
requirements for the various Title IV, HEA program regulations. 
The Secretary believes it is not appropriate at this time to 
include a general definition of an 

undergraduate student 

in the 
Student Assistance General Provisions regulations. 



Changes: 

The definition of 

undergraduate student 

has been 
removed from these final regulations. 



Third-party servicer. Comments: 

Many commenters asked the Secretary not to include 
computer services or software in the examples of activities that 
constitute administration of a Title IV, HEA program, on the 
grounds that this type of service encompasses activities in a 
broad spectrum, from computer software distributors of popular 
commercial spreadsheet programs to computer on-line Federal news 
services. Several commenters stated that computer services are 
simply technological means utilized in administering the 
programs; computer servicers who actually perform administrative 
functions would be covered, therefore there is no need to 
separately include such providers in the definition. Other 
commenters argued for the inclusion of computer services or 
software in the examples of a Title IV-related activity. These 
commenters argued that it was necessary to include providers of 
computer services and software in the definition of third-party 
servicer because many distributors of software certify that their 
computer programs_represented to satisfy Title IV, HEA program 
requirements_comply with all applicable Title IV, HEA program 
requirements. As a result, institutions contracting with a 
provider for the software take for granted that the software is 
in compliance with all Title IV, HEA program requirements. If a 
violation of a Title IV, HEA program requirement occurs because 
of the software, the provider of that software should be held 
responsible. Several commenters argued that those software 
providers could be subject to potential liabilities for Title IV, 
HEA program violations, even though the computer programs of the 
provider could be modified by the user. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees with those commenters who 
either objected to the inclusion of computer services or software 
providers in the examples of Title IV-related activities, or who 
saw no need to separately include such providers. In adopting 
the definition of third-party servicer, the Secretary is not 
including providers of those services or software because the 
Secretary believes that this type of service is simply a 
technological means to assist in carrying out certain 
administrative functions that are already included in the 
proposed definition of a third-party servicer. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comments: 

Two commenters were concerned that a third-party 
servicer could avoid the requirements of these regulations by 
simply not entering into a written contract with an eligible 
institution to administer any aspect of that institution's 
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. The commenters 
recommended that the regulations stipulate that the acceptance of 
fees by the servicer from the institution for administration of 
any aspect of the institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA 
program would constitute a contract with the institution for 
purposes of the definition of third-party servicer under these 
regulations. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary disagrees with the commenters that a 
third-party servicer that contracts with an eligible institution 
could be exempt from these regulations simply by not executing a 
written contract with that institution. A third-party servicer 
is defined as anyone who contracts with an institution, and is 
not limited to only those entering a written contractual 
agreement. Oral contracts, payment of fees for services rendered 
and other arrangements also constitute enforceable contracts. 
The Secretary recognizes these types of contracts and will 
consider an individual or organization employing such a method to 
contract with an institution to administer any aspect of the 
institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs to be a 
third-party servicer and therefore subject to these regulations. 
The Secretary cautions institutions and third-party servicers 
that verbal contracts or other non-written contracts do not 
exempt institutions from documenting in writing the contractual 
obligations of both parties, including the requirements in 
 668.25, and submitting a copy to the Secretary, if so instructed 
by the Secretary. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comments: 

One commenter felt that the activities of Multiple 
Data Entry (MDE) Processors and the Central Processor should be 
included in the examples of what constitutes administration of 
participation in a Title IV, HEA program because the data 
generated by MDEs or the Central Processor is the foundation for 
determining a student's eligibility for Title IV, HEA program 
assistance. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary disagrees with the commenter. The 
Secretary has previously explained in the NPRM published on 
February 17, 1994, that MDEs serve under contract with the 
Department and are already bound by that contract and other 
Department of Education requirements. Therefore, the Secretary 
does not believe it necessary to separately regulate MDE 
activities as part of these regulations. 



Changes: 

None.

Comments: 

One commenter was of the opinion that the activities 
of administering or scoring ability-to-benefit tests should be 
included in the examples of what the Secretary considers to be a 
third-party servicer activity because these activities constitute 
the determination of student eligibility. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees with the commenter that these 
activities could be considered to be an aspect of the 
administration of Title IV, HEA programs and therefore should be 
regulated. However, the Secretary believes that any abuses in 
these types of activities will be protected against in the 
regulations governing the administration of ability-to-benefit 
tests. The Secretary plans to issue an NPRM on this subject 
shortly. Therefore, the Secretary does not believe it necessary 
to regulate administering or scoring ability-to-benefit test 
activities as part of these regulations. 


Changes: 

None. 


Comments: 

A few commenters requested that attorneys litigating 
on behalf of institutions to collect loan funds or interpreting 
statutory or regulatory requirements be excluded from the 
definition of third-party servicer. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary generally considers attorneys not to 
be covered by the definition of a third-party servicer under 
these regulations. The Secretary, in promulgating the definition 
of third-party servicer, applied the definition to a set of 
activities relating to the administration of the Title IV, HEA 
programs, and thus is not regulating distinct entities by their 
identity but rather the activities that individuals or 
organizations perform in contracting with institutions. 
Provision of legal advice is not one of these activities. 
However, it is conceivable that an attorney would be considered a 
third-party servicer under these regulations if the activity of 
the attorney, performed on behalf of an institution, constitutes 
administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. It would not be 
appropriate to state that attorneys are never considered third-party servicers as that would permit services to
escape oversight 
simply by being provided under attorney signature or by non-attorneys working for attorneys or their law firms. 


Changes: 

None. 


Section 668.8 Eligible Program




Definitions. Comments: 

Some commenters believed that the definition of ``equivalent of an associate degree'' would be difficult to 
administer because colleges do not have consistent standards for 
accepting two-year programs for full credit toward a bachelor's 
degree and for qualifying a student for admission into the third 
year of a bachelor's degree program. Some of these commenters 
suggested that any person who completes the equivalent number of 
credit hours necessary to receive an associate degree should be 
included in this definition as long as the person earned those 
credits from an institution that was accredited by a nationally 
recognized accrediting agency. Other commenters suggested that 
any program that leads to an occupational objective that requires 
licensing or certification and equals at least the length of a 
typical associate degree program, should be added to the proposed 
definition. Another commenter expressed support for the 
provision as written in the February 28, 1994 NPRM. 


Discussion: 

As stated in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, this 
definition is modeled after section 1201(a)(3) of the HEA, and is 
designed to measure the educational backgrounds of students 
admitted to programs offered by a proprietary institution of 
higher education and postsecondary vocational institutions. The 
Secretary believes that a student does not have the equivalent of 
an associate degree unless he or she has completed an educational 
program that includes two critical characteristics: the student 
successfully completed at least a two-year program that is 
acceptable for full credit toward a bachelor's degree and the 
student qualifies for admission into the third year of a 
bachelor's degree program. The alternatives suggested by 
commenters lack these characteristics. 
In response to comments about the absence of consistent 
standards, the Secretary notes that inconsistent standards apply 
to students with associate degrees as well. The two-year 
programs completed by students with an associate degree may be 
fully transferable to some institutions offering bachelor's 
degree, but not to other institutions. Institutions that have 
programs leading to a bachelor's degree also have different 
standards for determining a transfer student's standing. 


Changes: 

None. 


Qualitative Factors. Comments: 

Some commenters argued that short-term programs 
(programs of less than 600 clock hours) should not be required to 
be in existence for a year before establishing eligibility 
because the rate of technological change in the workplace 
dictates rapid responses by institutions in offering educational 
programs to meet those changes. Some of these commenters also 
believed that factors related to quality should be determined by 
accrediting agencies. Another commenter suggested that initial 
eligibility for these programs should be based on an institution's 
track record of success rather than the existence of the program 
for one year. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that a good track record of 
success is whether an institution can maintain a new program for 
one year. The Secretary agrees that the quality of these 
programs should continue to be monitored by accrediting agencies, 
but the history of abuse in these programs necessitates Federal 
regulatory standards as well. Institutions are not prevented 
from responding rapidly to the demands of the economy by offering 
new short-term programs, but institutions must be able to 
demonstrate that these new programs can meet the minimum 
placement and completion rate standards before Title IV, HEA 
funds are provided to students enrolled in these programs. 
Obviously, this data cannot be provided unless the program has 
been in existence for a period of time. 


Changes: 

None. 


Comments: 

A number of commenters objected to limiting the length 
of a program to no more than 150 percent of the minimum number of 
clock hours required for training in the recognized occupation 
for which the program prepares students, as established by the 
State in which the program is offered, if the State has 
established such a requirement. Some of these commenters 
observed that the requirement would create inconsistent standards 
because States have different requirements and that maximum 
program lengths should be determined by accrediting agencies. 
Another commenter argued that differing State standards would 
make it difficult to train students from neighboring States if 
those States have higher standards. 
Some commenters believed that ``course stretching'' was a 
frequent source of abuse. They cited examples of institutions' 
combining short programs into one accredited course that does not 
specifically lead to licensure, purely for the purpose of 
exceeding the statutory 600 clock hour minimum. These commenters 
recommended that the standard in the February 28, 1994 NPRM was 
too lenient and that the program length should not exceed the 
minimum State standard. Some commenters suggested that the 
minimum licensing standards of the Federal government should also 
be taken into account in limiting the length of a program. 
Another commenter suggested that exceptions should be made to the 
general standard if the education provided by a particular 
program was better than average. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that 150 percent of the State 
minimum allows enough latitude for institutions to provide 
quality programs and furnishes a sufficient safeguard against the 
abuses of course stretching. Because States have different 
licensing standards, the Secretary does not believe that a single 
standard for a maximum program length is appropriate. The 
argument made by one commenter about training students from 
neighboring States with higher standards only serves to 
illustrate the importance of recognizing each State's 
requirements. Training students who will not be able to meet the 
licensing requirements of the States in which they intend to work 
is a terrible disservice to those students. The Secretary agrees 
that these regulations ought to recognize any minimum standards 
established by various Federal agencies for applicable short-term 
programs. 


Changes: 

This provision is revised to prohibit a short-term 
eligible program from exceeding by 50 percent any applicable 
minimum number of clock hours required by a Federal agency for 
training in the recognized occupation for which the program 
prepares students.

Comments: 

 Some commenters argued that programs with a small 
number of graduates would not provide a statistically valid 
measure for completion or placement rates. 


Discussion: 

 The Secretary believes these rates are statistically 
valid unless fewer than thirty students complete a program in an 
award year. The percentage of educational programs this size 
participating in the Title IV, HEA programs is so small, that the 
issue of statistical validity does not need to be addressed in 
the regulations. 


Changes: 

 None. 


Award Year. Comments: 

 Many commenters suggested that the period of time for 
calculating the placement rate should be based on the most recent 
calendar year or on the award year ending twelve months earlier 
(i.e., for 1995-96, the placement rate would apply to students 
who graduated in 1993-94) instead of the immediately preceding 
award year, to account fully for the 180-day period permitted to 
demonstrate that a graduate has been placed and the 13-week 
period required to count an employed student as placed. The 
ability to count individuals as placements under these 
circumstances becomes increasingly difficult as graduation dates 
approach the end of an award year. Some of these commenters 
believed that this approach would be consistent with the 
reporting procedures of many States and accrediting agencies. 
Other commenters suggested that the burden on institutions 
would be reduced significantly if the formula for calculating 
placement and completion rates were the same as the Department's 
Student-Right-to-Know provisions, and if the same formulas were 
used by accrediting agencies and State licensing agencies. 


Discussion: 

 As noted in the earlier discussion, one reason that 
the Secretary has adopted the requirement for a short-term 
program to be in existence for at least one year is to allow for 
a track record of completion and placement rates. If the 
calculation of these rates were to be based on an earlier award 
or calendar year than the one specified in these regulations, the 
Secretary would need to require that newly established short-term 
programs remain ineligible for an even longer period so that 
track record could be established. The Secretary does not wish 
to discourage the creation of legitimate, high quality short-term 
programs by requiring too great a period of ineligibility for 
those programs. The Secretary notes, of course, that once these 
regulations have been in effect for at least a year, data for 
currently eligible programs, based on earlier years, will be 
available for review. 
The Secretary agrees that a standard rate is desirable, to 
the extent that a standard rate will provide the information the 
Department and other entities seek to obtain. Some rates may 
have to differ in order to achieve the purpose for which they are 
mandated. For example, a rate that is designed purely for 
consumer information purposes may require different data or time 
periods, than a rate that must coincide with student aid program 
calendars or a rate that is used for long-term academic studies. 
The Secretary cannot control the design of placement rates 
required by State agencies or accrediting agencies, but a 
standard rate or rates that can be calculated from the same data 
sources would help to reduce the burden on institutions. The 
Secretary encourages States and accrediting agencies to foster 
the development of uniform standards the Secretary could adopt, 
or adopt the standards in these regulations. 
The Student-Right-to-Know regulations are currently being 
drafted with the intention of developing a completion rate that 
will be useful for all Title IV, HEA programs when the statute so 
permits; but the Student-Right-to-Know regulations will not 
require a placement rate calculation. 


Changes: 

 None. 


Calculation of Completion Rate. Comments: 

 Some commenters suggested that the definition of 
``enrolled'' for purposes of calculating completion rates should be 
amended to reflect only students who begin attending classes. 
Another commenter noted that some institutions do not charge 
new students for any institutional costs during the first month 
that the students attended classes, because administrators at 
these institutions believe that if these students withdrew before 
tuition and fees were assessed, the students could be excluded 
from the calculation of a completion rate. 


Discussion: 

 As stated in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, when 
calculating the completion rate, an institution would subtract 
from the number of regular students who were enrolled in the 
program those students who withdrew, dropped out of, or were 
expelled from the program and were entitled to and actually 
received in a timely manner in accordance with the refund 
requirements of these regulations, a refund of 100 percent of 
their tuition and fees (less any permitted administrative fee) 
under the institution's refund policy. The Secretary believes 
that this provision addresses the commenters concerns. 


Changes: 

 None. 


Comments: 

 Some commenters suggested that students who transfer 
to another program or who withdraw because they have found a new 
job, should be excluded from the completion-rate formula. 


Discussion: 

 The Secretary believes that transfer students and 
students who withdraw for the purpose of starting new jobs or 
withdraw for other reasons are accounted for by allowing up to 30 
percent of the enrolled students to withdraw from the program. 


Changes: 

 None. 


Calculation of Placement Rate. Comments: 

 Many commenters objected to the requirement that a 
student must be employed for at least 13 weeks following 
graduation from an institution to be included in that 
institution's placement-rate calculation. These commenters 
believed that this requirement is overly burdensome because the 
institution would have to track those students for long periods. 
They believed that an institution should not be held accountable 
for factors that are beyond the institution's control, such as 
layoffs, plant closings, illnesses, forced relocations, or the 
motivation of students. Some commenters suggested that instead 
of tracking students (who tend to be very mobile) for 13 weeks, 
evidence of the initial hiring by an employer should suffice. A 
commenter suggested that the period of employment should be 
reduced to 30 days. 


Discussion: 

 As discussed in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the 
Secretary believes that an employment requirement of 13 weeks 
will help stem abuses by institutions that may arrange to have 
students hired for short-term jobs in order to boost placement 
rates. In addition, a period of time beyond the initial hiring 
by an employer should be used to determine that the student 
received adequate training from the institution. The Secretary 
believes that extraneous factors affecting a student's employment 
are accounted for by using a placement rate that excludes up to 
30 percent of the institution's graduates. The 13-week period is 
consistent with the period of time a student must be employed to 
be counted in the institution's placement rate under the 
procedures delineated in  668.17(d) for the appeal of an 
institution's loss of participation due to an unacceptable cohort 
default rate 


Changes: 

 None. 


Comments: 

 A commenter suggested that students who are placed in 
jobs that are not related to their training should be counted, or 
at least excluded from the placement-rate formula. Another 
commenter suggested that placements should be limited to 
graduates who obtained a job in the recognized occupation for 
which they were trained in order to prevent program abuse. 


Discussion: 

 Students who are placed in jobs not related to their 
training should be treated in the formula in the same manner as 
students who are not employed. The placement rate is designed to 
measure the effectiveness of the training provided by the 
institution, and employment in an unrelated job does not 
demonstrate that the training was effective. The Secretary 
believes that graduates who are employed in occupations that are 
comparable and related to the occupation for which they have been 
trained should be included in the numerator of the placement rate 
formula. In these circumstances, the training provided by the 
school is likely to have been a contributing factor in obtaining 
employment. However, the Department may revise this provision in 
the future if there are numerous incidents of abuse in this area.

Comments:

 A number of commenters contended that it would be too 
burdensome for institutions to document the placement rates of 
students because students and employers would have little 
incentive to provide written verification of employment. Some 
commenters believed the substantiation requirement would 
discourage employers from hiring students from institutions that 
solicited documentation. Some commenters recommended that the 
institution should be required to record information, such as the 
name, address, and telephone number of the employer, the job 
title, and the starting date of employment, instead of obtaining 
the documentation proposed in the February 28, 1994 NPRM. A 
State agency, or the Department's reviewers, or an auditor could 
then use this information to verify the placement. Other 
commenters suggested that a written statement from the student 
that his or her employment was a result of the institution's 
training would be sufficient verification; or that an institution 
should merely be required to document its attempt to obtain 
written verification from employers or graduates. 
Many commenters also were concerned about the cost of the 
Secretary's proposed requirement that an institution's auditor 
should review the documentation of placement rates for each 
student in the placement-rate calculation. Some of these 
commenters suggested that the auditor be permitted to verify the 
placement rates by selecting a random sample. Some commenters 
suggested that the Department should administer and pay for its 
own placement substantiation procedures. 


Discussion:

 As stated in the preamble to the February 28, 1994 
NPRM, the Secretary believes that requiring institutions to 
document this data and requiring an auditor to review this data 
will help curb abuse by institutions that may overstate their 
placement rates to achieve and maintain eligibility for short-term programs. In order to address this concern, the
Secretary 
believes that documentation of employment must be made by a 
reliable source and that written statements by the student or the 
institution are not sufficient. The failure of an employer or 
student to respond to requests for documentation is accounted for 
by using a placement rate that excludes up to 30 percent of the 
institution's graduates. 
The Secretary disagrees with comments that the requirement 
of auditing each placement rate is unnecessary or prohibitively 
expensive. The audit will be conducted as part of the 
institution's annual compliance review and specific guidance 
provided in the Department of Education's audit guide should be 
drafted in a manner sufficient to detect abuse and avoid 
unnecessary costs. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 Some commenters suggested that based on auditing 
literature, certified public accountants cannot certify the 
accuracy of an institution's placement-rate calculations, but 
must instead follow the procedures of an attestation engagement. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenters that a 
clarification is necessary. 


Changes:

 This section has been amended to require that an 
institution shall substantiate the calculation of its completion 
and placement rates by having the certified public accountant who 
prepares its audit report required under  668.23 report on the 
institution's calculations based on performing an attestation 
engagement in accordance with the Standards for Attestation 
Engagements of the American Institute of Independent Certified 
Public Accountants (AICPA). Section 668.24 has also been amended 
to reflect the same type of change discussed here. 


Comments:

 Some commenters argued that students who are hired by 
an institution either before or after they receive a degree or 
certificate from that institution, should not be excluded from 
the placement rate calculation. The commenters suggested that 
institutions would be penalized for hiring the most qualified 
candidate and that any abuse in this area could be easily 
detected. Other commenters suggested that graduates who are 
employed by separate businesses that are operated by, or 
financially linked to, an institution's owner(s) should be 
excluded from the placement-rate calculation. Some commenters 
suggested that graduates who were student employees should not be 
subtracted from the number of students who have degrees or 
certificates if they find a position with another employer. 


Discussion:

 Upon further consideration, the Secretary agrees 
that including students who are hired by an institution would 
have a negligible effect on the institution's placement rate, 
particularly if the hiring is based on a legitimate employment 
selection process. 
The Secretary does not agree with the suggestion to exclude 
graduates from an institution's placement-rate formula if they 
are hired by separate businesses that have some financial 
connection to the institution. In many of these cases, the 
potential for abuse is not as great because the economic 
interests of the parties that control the separate businesses do 
not necessarily coincide with the financial interests of the 
institutions. 
The Secretary agrees that student employees who are no 
longer employed by the institution upon graduation and who are 
hired by another employer after graduation, should not be 
excluded from the placement rate calculation. 


Changes:

 The requirement that an institution exclude from the 
calculation of a placement rate students who are hired by the 
institution has been deleted from these regulations. 


Comments:

 Some commenters believed that the placement rate 
calculation may be misinterpreted by some institutions because 
the proposed placement rate calculation requires the school to 
include students in the numerator who, ``on the date of this 
calculation 

are employed,

 or have been employed for at least 13 
weeks following receipt of the credential by the institution.'' 
These commenters suggested that the phrase ``are employed'' will 
be interpreted to mean that any student employed at the time the 
calculation is made, regardless of whether they have met the 13-week standard, can be included in the numerator. 


Discussion:

 Every student must be employed for at least 13 weeks 
in a recognized occupation for which they were trained or in a 
related comparable occupation before that student can be counted 
as placed. The Secretary agrees to clarify this provision. 


Changes:

 A change has been made to clarify that every student 
must be employed for at least 13 weeks in a recognized occupation 
for which they were trained or in a related comparable occupation 
before that student can be counted as placed by inserting a comma 
after the words ``have been employed.'' 


English as a Second Language.

 

Comments:

 Some commenters argued that the purpose of the testing requirement for students who completed a program in English
as a Second Language (ESL) was unclear, and that testing the proficiency of these students was an intrusion on an 
institution's internal academic affairs and a violation of the 
Department of Education Organization Act. Another commenter 
recommended testing students before they enrolled in an ESL 
program to determine whether they needed to improve their 
proficiency skills, as well as testing students who completed the 
program. A commenter suggested that the ESL testing provisions 
should also apply to vocational programs that include ESL 
education within the curriculum. Another commenter expressed 
support for the provision as written in the February 28, 1994 
NPRM.

Discussion:

 As discussed in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the 
purpose of this requirement, which is based on a California law, 
is to curb abuses by institutions. Some institutions have 
received significant amounts of Federal Pell Grant funds for 
students who have not attained an adequate proficiency in written 
and spoken English to use already existing knowledge, training 
and skills. Because this testing requirement is limited to ESL 
programs that are ancillary to an institution's academic 
programs, the Secretary does not believe it is an intrusion on an 
institution's internal academic affairs. 
The suggestions to add a pre-test requirement or to extend 
the testing requirement to vocational programs that include ESL 
courses were not adopted at this time. However, the Secretary 
intends to monitor reports of abuse in these areas to see if 
regulation is necessary. Institutions are encouraged to test all 
students before and after they enroll in ESL courses to determine 
whether the students need to improve their proficiency skills and 
to determine whether the students have attained the desired 
proficiency skills after completing the courses. 


Changes:

 None. 


Subpart B_Standards for Participation in the Title IV, HEA Programs 


Section 668.11 Scope 




Comments:

 A few commenters opposed subjecting a third-party 
servicer to proceedings under subpart G of this part, which 
governs emergency actions, fines, and limitation, suspension, or 
termination of participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. The 
commenters felt that since the Secretary has noted that 
institutions are ultimately responsible for any liabilities 
incurred that the institutions should be responsible for 
monitoring the activities of the organization with which they 
contract. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary disagrees with the commenters who 
argued that third-party servicers should not be subject to 
proceedings under subpart G of this part. The statute 
specifically requires the Secretary to apply subpart G 
proceedings to third-party servicers. The Secretary agrees with 
commenters that institutions have a duty to monitor the actions 
of their third-party servicers, and that an institution is always 
ultimately liable for any violations caused by those servicers, 
but, the Secretary believes that Congress clearly intended for 
the Secretary to directly hold third-party servicers accountable 
for any program violations through the use of all sanctions that 
the Secretary is able to impose. The sanctions under subpart G 
of this part are an appropriate recourse to use to correct 
program violations because a third-party servicer, as an agent of 
an institution, contracts with institutions to provide services 
that parallel an institution's responsibilities under the 
institution's program participation agreement. 


Changes: 

None.

Applications for continued participation.

 

Comments:

 This section of the regulations generated many comments. Some commenters were concerned about the circumstances
under which their institutions might be required to file an application in order to continue to participate in a Title
IV, HEA program. The majority of the comments concerned the need for institutions to be notified enough in advance
of the expiration of their program participation agreements so they could file an application for reapproval and
the corresponding need for the Secretary to act on an institution's renewal application prior to the expiration of
the institution's program participation agreement. 

A number of commenters were concerned that the provision requiring institutions to apply for recertification upon
the request of the Secretary allowed the Secretary too much discretionary authority and would mean that the Secretary
would act in an arbitrary and capricious manner. Many of these commenters believed that the regulations should identify
the specific circumstances or significant events that would trigger a request from the Secretary and should require
the Secretary to explain the reasons for the request. Two commenters recommended further that the regulations make
clear that the Secretary will initiate action only if there is reliable evidence affecting an institution's financial
responsibility or administrative capability. This commenter also said that it should be made clear that such an application
would not be considered an initial application and that if the Secretary were to determine, on the basis of the application,
that the institution should no longer participate in a Title IV, HEA program, the institution would have recourse
to the appeal procedures specified in subpart G of this part. 

Over seventy commenters were very concerned about the recertification process. Their understanding of the process
was that even were an institution to file an application for reapproval in a timely manner, if the Secretary did not
approve the institution prior to the expiration date of its program participation agreement, the institution either
would lose approval altogether or would be provisionally certified. Because provisional certification connotes
lesser status to these commenters and confers fewer appeal rights than full certification, the commenters viewed
provisional certification under these circumstances to be unfair and unacceptable. 

Many commenters provided concrete, constructive recommendations for addressing their concerns. The majority
of these commenters asked that the Secretary notify institutions in advance of the scheduled expiration dates of
the program participation agreements and supply the necessary application forms. One group of commenters suggested
that the Secretary establish time frames for the submission and the processing of applications. The time frames proposed
by the commenters varied greatly, with one commenter urging that the Secretary be required to send applications to
institutions 18 months in advance of the expiration dates of the program participation agreements and another stating
that six months would be sufficient. Other commenters would have the regulations require that the Secretary act on
an application within 45 or 60 days of receipt. The approach taken by another group of commenters was to recommend that
if an institution submitted an application for renewal within a specific time frame, such as a certain number of days
prior to the expiration date of the program participation agreement, the Secretary should extend the certification
of the institution, as necessary, until the Secretary's review is complete. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary finds it necessary to reserve the right to require a participating institution to submit an application
for certification if the Secretary has reason to believe the financial responsibility or administrative capability
of the institution is in question. The Secretary refers those concerned to a discussion of the Secretary's position
on page 9533 of the preamble to the NPRM published on February 28, 1994. The Secretary reiterates that the Secretary
expects to exercise this authority rarely and to advise the affected institution of the reason for the request. An
application submitted under these provisions is not considered an initial application, because the institution
is a participating institution. The institution continues to be governed by the program participation agreement
in effect at the time the institution submits its application until that program participation expires, the institution
signs a new program participation agreement, or the Secretary limits or terminates the institution's program participation
agreement under the procedures in subpart G of this part. 

The Secretary understands the concerns expressed regarding the processing of renewal applications and agrees that
an institution should not be penalized if it files an application in a timely manner but the Secretary is unable to complete
a review of the institution prior to the expiration date of the institution's program participation agreement. For
a full discussion of this issue, see the section of the 

Analysis of Comments and Changes

 that addresses certification procedures ( 668.13). 



Changes:

 None. 



Notification and application requirements for additional locations.

 

Comments:

 There were a number of comments on this section, and they conveyed a wide range of concerns. Many of the commenters were
concerned that institutions would be required to notify the Secretary of each new location, regardless of the percentage
of the educational program offered at the location. Many of these commenters asserted that the provision would prohibit
community colleges from responding to community needs, because community colleges are constantly offering training
and education at new locations. 

Other commenters could discern no reason why the addition of a branch campus or other location at which 100 percent
of an eligible program is offered should trigger a certification review of an entire institution. These commenters
suggested that because accrediting agencies and State licensing bodies review additional locations, there is no
need for the Secretary also to conduct a review. One commenter went so far as to recommend that  668.12(b)(2)
be removed, to guarantee that if the Secretary were to decide to certify a branch campus or other location, the decision
could not trigger a recertification review of the entire institution. 

Commenters were concerned about the effect of these regulations on the ability of institutions to continue to offer
internships on sites apart from their main campuses. Commenters complained about the effect of these provisions
on an institution that contracts with a company to provide training for the company's employees on the site of the company's
facilities. 

A few commenters supported the Secretary's need to monitor the financial responsibility and administrative capability
of institutions that establish locations that offer at least 50 percent of an educational program. Two commenters
recommended that the regulations be expanded to require that a location that offers less than 50 percent of an educational
program be reported to the Secretary if the volume of activity at the location exceeded a certain threshold. 



Discussion:

 The comments reflect a good deal of confusion about the current requirements for reporting the addition of locations,
current application procedures, and the proposed regulations. 

The current Institutional Eligibility regulations, published on April 5, 1988, specify in  600.30(a)(3)
that institutions are to notify the Secretary of any changes in the name or number of locations since the institution's
last eligibility application. As a practical matter, the Secretary has required institutions to report only changes
to those locations at which the institution offered a complete educational program. This policy has been reflected
for several years in the application and instructions. Thus, the notification requirement in these regulations,
and the corresponding requirement in the new Institutional Eligibility regulations at  600.30, are actually
less onerous than the requirements in earlier regulations. Under these final regulations, community colleges and
other institutions that frequently establish outreach locations at which they offer one or two courses need not report
these locations. And, unless the internship portion of a student's program constitutes at least 50 percent of that
program, there would be no need to report the location at which an internship is performed. Similarly, there is no need
to report locations that offer only continuing education classes and do not have students who are eligible to receive
Title IV, HEA program funds.

The Secretary has determined through experience that the addition of a branch campus or other location that offers
a complete educational program can have a major impact on the financial status of the whole institution and the ability
of the whole institution to administer the Title IV, HEA programs. For many years, the Secretary has required institutions
that seek to add a location at which a complete educational program is offered to undergo a certification review so
that the Secretary could ascertain whether the institution has the financial resources and sufficient administrative
capability to support another location. In addition, section 498(b) of the HEA requires the Secretary to have a form
on which the institution describes the relationship between a main campus of an institution and all of its branch campuses.
It follows then that the Secretary cannot scrutinize a branch campus in a vacuum. Thus, this provision is a codification
of the Secretary's longstanding policy and application procedures and new statutory requirements. 

Commenters that discussed employer-sponsored training programs seemed not to understand that if institutions
contract with employers to provide training programs at the work-site or some other off-campus location that employer
is paying for the cost of training and no Title IV, HEA program funds are involved, there is no need for the institution
to notify the Secretary. 

The Secretary has established a requirement that an institution must notify the Secretary of a location that offers
at least 50 percent of an educational program if the institution wishes to have the location included in the institution's
participation in a Title IV, HEA program. The Secretary puts institutions on notice that they may be required to file
a complete recertification application in such situations, but the Secretary expects to make requests for complete
recertification applications only rarely. 




Changes:

 None. 



Notification and application requirements for changes in name, location, or address. Comments: 

Two commenters stated that the Secretary should not require an institution to undergo a recertification review if
the institution changed only its name, address, or location. 



Discussion:

 This section requires only that institutions notify the Secretary of such changes. 



Changes:

 None. 



Required forms and information. Comments:

 A few commenters asserted that the proposed requirement of  668.12(e)(2) for an institution to provide to the
Secretary upon request all information that the Secretary needs to certify an institution was too broad. Their perception
was that the requirement would give the Secretary unlimited access to institutional information under the guise
of a certification review. They recommended that the provision be revised to state that the Secretary would request
only the information and documentation specified on the application form. 




Discussion:

 This provision refers only to information and documentation needed to certify that the institution meets the standards
in this subpart, particularly the factors of financial responsibility and standards of administrative capability.
The application form clearly specifies the information and documents that institutions must submit with their application.
However, the Secretary must retain the flexibility to request additional information or documentation to clarify
or support an institution's response on the application, should that be necessary. The Secretary notes that this
provision would not require an institution to provide information such as tenure information contained in faculty
records. 



Changes:

 None. 



Section 668.13 Certification Procedures 





Requirements for certification. Comments:

 A few commenters objected to the proposal that an institution could be refused full certification that the institution
meets the standards of subpart B and may participate in the Title IV, HEA programs because of a problem identified at
one of its branch campuses. These commenters suggested that it was not fair to restrict the certification for an institution
based upon a problem that was identified at its branch location. 



Discussion:

 The commenters misunderstood the purpose of this provision. Section 498(j) of the HEA requires a branch campus, as
defined by the Secretary, to be certified under the requirements of this subpart to be included in an institution's
participation in a Title IV, HEA program. Thus, a 

branch campus 

must separately demonstrate to the Secretary's satisfaction that it meets, for example, the factors of financial
responsibility and standards of administrative capability. The commenters should note that the Secretary has defined


branch campus

 narrowly, in part for this reason, in the Institutional Eligibility regulations. A more complete discussion of the
implications of meeting that definition is found in those regulations. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comments:

 Several comments were received recommending that an institution's financial aid officer be included in the list
of personnel that are required to have precertification training. 



Discussion:

 Pursuant to the administrative capability standards set out in  668.16, every institution is required to designate
a capable individual that is responsible for administering the Title IV, HEA programs at the institution. This designated
individual, who is usually a financial aid administrator, is required to have precertification training. 



Changes:

 None.

Period of participation. Comments: 

A few commenters suggested that the Secretary provide greater detail in the regulations concerning when an institution
would receive full certification for a period of less than four years. 


Discussion: 

As noted in the discussion for the proposed regulations, the full four year certification period will generally be
used for institutions. There may be a limited number of times when an institution would receive a shorter period of
full certification, based upon the specific circumstances presented. One instance where a shorter period of full
certification would be used is where an institution has submitted a materially complete application for renewal
in a timely manner, but no decision is issued before the institution's certification expires. In that instance, as
explained in the discussion concerning provisional certification below, the institution's full certification
would be extended on a month to month basis until a decision on its application was issued. Other situations will arise
where a certification of less than four years will be appropriate, but it is not feasible to try and identify such infrequent
actions by referencing them specifically in the regulations. 


Changes: 

None. 


Provisional certification. Comments: 

Several commenters were concerned that the proposed implementation of provisional certification in the regulations
was very broad, and would impose hardships on a number of institutions. The commenters suggested that the Secretary
treat the administrative capability and financial responsibility requirements as indicators of instances where
provisional certification could be used, but would not necessarily be required if the institution could demonstrate
that it should be permitted to participate under full certification. Numerous commenters suggested that it was inappropriate
to use provisional certification for institutions whose cohort default rates exceeded the thresholds set out in
the proposed regulations at  668.16. Other commenters recommended that the regulations be amended to clarify
that provisional certification could be renewed. 
Some commenters suggested that the regulations be amended to provide for the provisional certification of all institutions
in a State where no SPRE has been established. These commenters believed that this use of provisional certification
was consistent with the intent of the HEA for the Secretary to monitor institutions more closely in this situation.



Discussion: 

The Secretary believes it is appropriate to use the administrative capability and financial responsibility thresholds
as events that will require provisional certification, rather than as indicators that might or might not result in
provisional certification being required. Provisional certification will be used to permit these institutions
to continue participating in the Title IV, HEA programs while correcting over time the items that were identified
that caused the institution to be placed under provisional certification. The categories and thresholds set out
in the regulations provide sufficient notice to institutions of the standards to which they will be held accountable.
The proposed mechanism for provisional certification also provides administrative efficiency in reviewing applications
for certification, and encourages institutional improvements over time to meet and maintain these standards. 
The Secretary has responded to concerns about the cohort default rate measures by adjusting the administrative capability
thresholds in  668.16 that would trigger a requirement that an institution would receive provisional certification
based upon its reported cohort default rates. See the section of the 

Analysis of Comments and Changes 

that addresses administrative capability ( 668.16). The Secretary intends that institutions that have participated
successfully under provisional certification, but who still do not satisfy certain requirements for full certification,
will be permitted to renew their provisional certification. No specific changes are needed to reflect this procedure
in the regulations, because such decisions will be made in response to the applications for certification that institutions
will submit in response to the expirations of their current certifications.

The Secretary agrees that technical changes are needed to make these regulations conform to the requirements of the
State Postsecondary Review Program in 34 CFR part 667, and has decided to provide some further explanation here of
the consequences to an institution if the State in which the institution is located does not participate in the State
Postsecondary Review Program. 

Section 494(a) of the HEA prohibits the Secretary from designating as eligible to participate in a Title IV, HEA program
any institution seeking initial participation in that Title IV, HEA program, or any participating institution that
has undergone a change of ownership resulting in a change of control, as determined under 34 CFR 600.31, if the institution
is in a State that does not participate in the State Postsecondary Review Program. The Secretary also is prohibited
from designating for initial inclusion in any institution's eligibility for participation a Title IV, HEA programs
branch campus located in a State that does not participate in the State Postsecondary Review Program, even if the institution
itself is in a State that participates in the State Postsecondary Review Program. 

Further, the Secretary may grant no more than provisional certification for participation in a Title IV, HEA program
to any participating institution or branch campus in a State that does not participate in the State Postsecondary
Review Program. 

Currently, all States participate in the State Postsecondary Review Program. The Secretary does not anticipate
that any State will fail to comply with the requirements of the State Postsecondary Review Program to the extent that
the State will cease to participate in the program. Nevertheless, the regulations need to incorporate these statutory
provisions so that institutions may be aware of the potential consequences of a State's failure to participate in
the program. 



Changes: 

A new paragraph (e) is added to provide for denial of certification to initial applicants for participation in a Title
IV, HEA program and to participants that have undergone a change of ownership resulting in a change of control, if the
State in which those applicants or participants are located does not participate in the State Postsecondary Review
Program. Under paragraph (e), the Secretary may provisionally certify a participating institution or branch campus
in that State. Section 668.13(c)(2)(ii) has also been revised to provide that the provisional certification of an
institution under these circumstances expires at the end of the third complete award year following the date of the
provisional certification. 



Comments: 

Several commenters voiced concern over the proposed language in the regulations that would subject institutions
to provisional certification where the financial responsibility and administrative capability was being determined
for the first time. Suggestions were made that schools be exempted from this provision if they had been in operation
for a number of years without problems being identified concerning their financial condition or administrative
capability.

Discussion

: The Secretary believes that the other standards requiring the use of provisional certification are adequate to
identify institutions where greater monitoring and procedural restrictions are appropriate. The Secretary agrees
that longstanding institutions with no previous problems identified in their administrative capability or financial
condition will not require the use of provisional certification where the current audits and application submitted
by the institution satisfies the financial and administrative requirements under the regulations. Furthermore,
since provisional certification is required for initial applicants and for existing institutions whose financial
condition or administrative capability cannot be shown to meet the required standards, there does not appear to be
a corresponding need to require provisional certification if a participating institution satisfies the proposed
standards when the Department reviews its application for the first time. 



Changes

: The provision that provided that the Secretary may provisionally certify an institutions if the financial responsibility
and administrative capability of the institution was being determined for the first time has been deleted from these
regulations. 



Comments

: A number of commenters objected to the proposal that provisional certification be used for all occasions where the
institution undergoes a change in ownership that results in a change of control. Instead, the commenters suggested
that there were numerous instances where a transfer of an institution to a new owner should be viewed as a positive step
that should be encouraged by using full certification, especially where the transfer was to an owner that had already
established a good track record with the Department. Some comments also recommended that transfers to family members
or to employees that had experience operating the institution should not require provisional certification. 



Discussion

: The Secretary agrees that some transfers to family members or to personnel that own stock in an institution who have
also worked for the institution should be treated differently from other changes of ownership that result in a change
of control. These transfers to family members or to certain other owners have been exempted from treatment as a change
of ownership resulting in a change of control in the regulations codified at 34 CFR part 600. In all other situations
where there is a change of ownership resulting in a change of control, the Secretary believes it is appropriate to use
provisional certification in order to provide more protection to the Federal interests while the new owner demonstrates
the ability to operate that institution successfully. Such concern is especially warranted where a financially
troubled institution has been acquired for little or no capital investment by the new owner, because the risk of loss
is minimized if the institution fails as a business investment. Even though it may be a positive step for an institution
to be bought by a new owner who can provide greater resources and experience in its operations, it is also reasonable
to provide for the greater oversight and protection to Title IV, HEA program funds that are available under provisional
certification. Also, the period of provisional certification may be established for a shorter period where the particular
facts so warrant. 



Changes

: None.

: A number of commenters were concerned that an institution that had applied for recertification in a timely manner
would be placed on provisional certification if the Department had not processed the application before the institution's
participation agreement expired. These commenters objected to changing an institution from full certification
to provisional certification where the delays were attributable to the Department's review process rather than
to a tardy application for renewal from the institution. Some remarks were also submitted by these commenters suggesting
that formal notice be required from the Secretary of the expiration date for an institution's period of participation
before any such ending date could become effective. 



Discussion

: The Secretary agrees that delays in processing applications by the Department should not be the cause for transferring
an institution from full certification to provisional certification. In such a circumstance where a complete application
for renewal was timely submitted, it is appropriate to provide for a mechanism that will continue the institution's
full certification on an interim basis. The Secretary has decided to establish a target date for institutions to submit
certification renewal applications at least 90 days before the ending date for the institution's current program
participation agreement. Provided that the application is materially complete when submitted, the institution's
full certification will continue beyond its expiration date on a month-to-month basis until the Department issues
its decision on the application. If the institution's application is not approved for full certification, the program
participation agreement will expire on the last business day of the month in which the decision is sent to the institution.
If the application for full certification is not made at least 90 days before the ending date for the institution's
program participation agreement, the institution will only be permitted to participate under provisional certification
while an application for recertification is pending. When an institution is notified that its application for recertification
was not materially complete when submitted, the Department will exercise reasonable discretion in determining
whether to deny the application as submitted or to request additional information, and to determine whether the institution
may continue to participate under provisional certification while the application is reviewed. 

The Secretary continues to believe that it is appropriate for the institution to monitor the expiration date for its
participation rather than relying upon the Secretary to tell it when it must reapply. Although the Secretary may provide
routine notices to institutions concerning upcoming expiration dates, the institution will be held responsible
for submitting an application for recertification in a timely manner in accordance with the expiration date on its
program participation agreement, regardless of whether the institution receives a notice of expiration from the
Secretary. 



Changes

: Section 668.13(b) is amended to provide that full certification will be extended on a month to month basis following
the expiration of a program participation agreement where the institution's application for recertification was
materially complete, and submitted at least 90 days prior to the expiration date. 



Requirements for provisional certification to participate on a limited basis for institutions that are not financially
responsible

. 

Comments

: A number of commenters stated that an institution should not be placed under provisional certification if the institution
satisfied the criteria for provisional certification to participate on a limited basis for institutions that are
not financially responsible. These commenters believed sufficient protection of Title IV, HEA program funds was
obtained from the required posting of a reduced surety in conjunction with using a funding arrangement other than
the advance payment system without the additional requirement of only granting provisional certification to the
institution. Several of the commenters also argued that any institution meeting these criteria should be considered
to be financially responsible, and therefore not placed under the provisional certification that would trigger
heightened monitoring by the Department and by the other members of the triad. The commenters also observed that institutions
that were in financial difficulties would probably experience further hardship by being required to post a surety
and receive Title IV, HEA program funding through an alternate mechanism. 

A few commenters noted that this provision appeared to require provisional certification if an institution did not
demonstrate financial responsibility under the general standards of financial responsibility set out in  668.15(b),
and that such a construction of the regulation would mean that institutions demonstrating financial responsibility
under the exceptions to the general standards of financial responsibility set out in  668.15(d) could still
be required to use provisional certification.

Some commenters also suggested that the reference to a letter of credit be modified to explain that it would be an irrevocable
letter of credit rather than some other type that the institution could revoke without notice to the Department. These
commenters also suggested that institutions could withhold information about the amount of Title IV, HEA program
funds disbursed through the institution that would otherwise increase the amount of the letter of credit that would
be set based upon the information available to the Department for the institution's prior award years. 

Some commenters suggested that the requirement that an institution show that it has met all of its financial obligations
during the preceding two award years be expanded to acknowledge that normal business practices would permit institutions
to refinance debts to change payment terms or obtain lower interest rates. 

Several commenters also stated that the proposed regulation was unfair because it would require provisional certification
for any institution that had not demonstrated financial responsibility during the preceding five years, regardless
of whether the institution currently demonstrated financial responsibility under its most recent audit. These
commenters believed that such a procedure would be unfair because it could penalize an institution that met current
financial responsibility standards based upon its prior financial condition. Other commenters suggested that
the Secretary should exercise discretion in determining when financial guarantees would be required rather than
making them mandatory whenever an institution triggered these provisions. 



Discussion

: The Secretary disagrees that the standards for provisional certification to participate on a limited basis for
institutions that are not financially responsible should be deemed to constitute a sufficient demonstration of
financial responsibility that would warrant granting full certification to such institutions. Institutions that
are not able to meet the general standards of financial responsibility in  668.15(b) or the exceptions to the
general standards of financial responsibility in  668.15(d) are in a financial situation that is demonstrably
different from their counterparts that do satisfy the requirements under these sections. Institutions that only
meet the standards for provisional certification to participate on a limited basis for institutions that are not
financially responsible warrant the additional monitoring and protection to Title IV, HEA program funds that provisional
certification provides. Even though such funding restrictions and surety postings may be difficult for some institutions
that are already experiencing financial restraints, such protections and the heightened ability to act quickly
to protect Title IV, HEA program funds are essential for improving the Department's oversight and gatekeeping responsibilities.
Provisional certification will permit some institutions to improve their financial operations over time without
compromising their administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. 

The Secretary would like to clarify that any letter of credit that an institution is required to submit to the Secretary
must be in a form and amount acceptable to the Secretary. 

The Secretary agrees with the commenters on the provision requiring an institution to have met all its financial obligations
during the preceding two award years. The Secretary has decided to clarify this provision in the manner in which a similar
provision has been clarified in  668.15 (see the discussion in  668.15 on this issue). 

The Secretary would also like to clarify when third party financial guarantees or assumptions of liabilities by owners
are required. Institutions that demonstrate financial responsibility under the requirements of  668.15(b)
and  668.15(d) and are in compliance with all other requirements of this subpart generally are entitled to full
certification. An institution that, despite meeting the requirements of  668.15(b) and (d), falls within
one of the categories in  668.15(c)(2) is not considered financially responsible and therefore cannot be fully
certified. These categories include a limitation, suspension, or termination by the Secretary or a guaranty agency
of the institution's participation at any time within the previous five years or a settlement to resolve such an action.
Also included are audit or program review findings during the two most recent audits or program reviews amounting
to more than five percent of the institution's Title IV, HEA program funds for a given award year, a citation for failure
to submit acceptable audit reports in a timely fashion during any of the previous five years, and a failure to address
satisfactorily any compliance problems still identified in program reviews or audits after the institution has
exhausted its appeals of those findings. The Secretary considers any of these characteristics sufficiently detrimental
to the integrity of the Title IV, HEA programs to provide that an institution meeting them is not financially responsible.


Further, to emphasize the seriousness with which the Secretary views these institutional failings, to protect Federal
funds, and to deter institutions from acting in a manner that could cause them to fall within one of these categories,
the Secretary will refuse even to provisionally certify such an institution, unless the appropriate additional
financial guarantees and assumptions of liability are furnished. In the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the Secretary had
also proposed to apply this treatment regarding provisional certification to any institution failing the financial
responsibility standards of  668.15 during the previous five years. The Secretary believes that a modification
of this last provision is in order. The Secretary therefore wishes to clarify that any institution that fails to demonstrate
financial responsibility under its current audit, and that has failed to do so at least once under the standards in
effect during the preceding five years (other than for a reason described in  668.15(c)(2)) is also required
to post financial guarantees and furnish assumptions of liability in accordance with  668.13(d)(2). This
additional safeguard is warranted where an institution does not meet the current standard for demonstrating financial
responsibility and has failed to do so at least once during the preceding five years. 

The Secretary believes that it is appropriate to put in place a procedure where such financial guarantees and assumptions
of liability will be required from institutions that come within the provisions in  668.13(d)(2). Rather than
exercising discretion in whether to require such guarantees at all, the Department will examine the specific circumstances
presented by each such institution and set the required amount and terms of the financial guarantees and assumptions
of liability in accordance with the regulation. 



Changes

: The requirements for provisional certification to participate on a limited basis for institutions that are not
financially responsible have been amended to make clear that the criteria of this section are not required for an institution
that meets the exceptions to the general standards of financial responsibility under  668.15(d). The regulations
have been amended to clarify that any required submission of a letter of credit must be in an amount and in a form acceptable
to the Secretary. Section 668.13(d)(2) has been clarified to explain that financial guarantees are only required
if the institution comes within the requirements of  668.15(c)(2), or where the institution fails to demonstrate
financial responsibility under its current audit and has failed to do so at least one other time under the standards
in effect during the preceding five years.

Revocation of provisional certification. Comments: 

A number of commenters complained that the lack of a formal appeal process for revocation of provisional certification
was unfair to the institution because it provided much less due process than is available to other institutions under
the appeal procedures in subpart G of the regulations. Some of these commenters also indicated that they believed
it would be more appropriate to offer provisionally certified institutions the full appeal rights under subpart
G of the regulations, and several commenters believed that more extensive appeal procedures were required to revoke
provisional certification than were described in the regulations.

Some commenters also suggested that a revocation notice should not be made effective upon the date of the mailing,
but either upon receipt by the institution or until a specified number of days after the mailing. A few commenters also
recommended that first class mail be used because it is an accepted means of filing legal documents in the court system,
or that certified mail be used as an alternative to registered mail.

Many commenters also requested that the provision that provides that an institution may request reconsideration
of a revocation of provisional certification be modified to provide that any request for reconsideration of a revocation
of provisional certification be decided by someone other than the person issuing the revocation. These comments
stated that it was important that such requests for reconsideration be made to a different official because it would
be more meaningful than having the request be presented to the person that had already made a decision adverse to the
institution.



Discussion: 

The Secretary disagrees with the commenters that revocations of provisional certification should receive the same
appeal procedures given to fully certified institutions under subpart G of the regulations. Institutions receiving
provisional certification are being given the opportunity to participate under limiting conditions because a heightened
risk to Title IV, HEA program funds has been identified, either by the institution's current financial condition
or through prior problems in the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs by the institution or its owners. Furthermore,
section 498(h) of the HEA provides that provisionally certified institutions may be terminated if the Secretary
determines that an institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement.
This language is significantly different from the requirement in section 487(c)(1)(F) of the HEA that provides that
an adverse action against a fully participating institution be determined after reasonable notice and opportunity
for hearing. The regulations require that the notice revoking the provisional certification contain the basis for
the action, explain to the institution the consequences of such revocation, and detail the procedures required to
request reconsideration of the action. The notice and opportunity to request reconsideration of the decision to
revoke the institution's provisional certification provide adequate protection to the institution that it will
have the opportunity to respond directly to the stated basis for the action, and establish a reasonable mechanism
to resolve the dispute in a fair manner. The Secretary believes that such procedure provides an institution with a
fair opportunity to be heard, and the final agency decision will be subject to Federal court review to ensure that the
action was not arbitrary and capricious.

The Secretary does not agree that a notice of revocation of an institution's provisional certification should be
effective on a date other than the date that the letter is sent to the institution. An institution that participates
under provisional certification does so with the understanding that it is subject to greater scrutiny with fewer
procedural rights when problems are identified. A notice advising the institution that its provisional certification
is revoked will identify the reasons for such action and give the institution an opportunity to request reconsideration
of that decision. The effective date of the revocation is the date that the notice is mailed; this provides greater
protection of Title IV, HEA program funds while still giving the institution an opportunity to have that decision
subsequently set aside.

The Secretary agrees that it would be more appropriate to provide that notices of revocation decisions will be sent
by certified mail, return receipt requested, rather than by registered mail. The Secretary notes that certified
mail is already used to initiate adverse actions against fully participating institutions under subpart G of the
regulations, and therefore believes that it is appropriate to standardize this notice requirement for revocations
of provisional certification. The regulation also provides that, where practical, more expeditious notice may
be provided through facsimile or overnight mail.

The Secretary agrees that the designated department official making the decision concerning an institution's request
for reconsideration of a revocation should be different from, and not subject to supervision by, the official who
initiated the revocation of the institution's provisional certification. This separation of function will ensure
that the official making the final decision for the Department is independent from the supervision of the official
issuing the initial decision, and this procedural protection strengthens the integrity of the review procedures
for revocation of provisional certification.



Changes: 

A change has been made to provide for notices of revocation of provisional certification to be sent by certified mail.
The regulations have been modified to require that the official reviewing a request for reconsideration of provisional
certification must be different from, and not subject to supervision by, the official that issued the notice of revocation.



Section 668.14 Program participation agreement.





Comments: 

Five commenters suggested that an institution's program participation agreement should only cover those branches
or locations which are specifically listed in the institution's notice of eligibility. One commenter indicated
that this provision makes clear that the program participation agreement applies to each branch campus or location
of the institution.



Discussion: 

The provision emphasizes that the program participation agreement applies only to those branch campuses and locations
that meet the applicable requirements of this part; therefore, additional clarification is unnecessary.



Changes: 

None.



Comments: 

Four commenters asserted that the regulations should specify that the terminology ``special arrangement, agreement,
or limitation'' applies only to the Title IV, HEA programs, and not any other programs in which the institution participates.
Two commenters suggested that the proposed regulations marked a radical departure from existing regulations, and
that a ``phase- in'' period was in order.

Discussion: 

The Secretary would like to clarify that any ``special arrangements, agreements, or limitations'' included in an
institution's program participation agreement by the Secretary should apply only to those special arrangements,
agreements, or limitations entered into under the authority of statutes applicable to Title IV of the HEA. Considering
that the language for this section of the regulations is for the most part statutory, institutions have had access
to this information since July 1992 when the Amendments of 1992 were enacted. The Secretary believes that institutions
have had adequate time to set in place any policies or procedures to comply with this section. A ``phase-in'' period
is unnecessary.



Changes:

 Section 668.14(b)(1) has been amended to clarify that an institution must comply with all special arrangements,
agreements, or limitations entered into under the authority of statutes applicable to Title IV of the HEA. Corresponding
changes have been made throughout the sections of 34 CFR 668 and 34 CFR 682 contained in this regulatory package.



Comments:

 One commenter agreed that a mechanism was needed to ensure that an institution's fund requests meet only its immediate
Title IV, HEA program needs, but suggested that such a mechanism should accommodate institutions where funds must
first pass through a State agency, adding to the time frame for expenditure. Four commenters indicated that the proposed
regulations may necessitate changes in institutions' methods of accounting, programming, banking, fund monitoring,
etc. and recommended that institutions should be allowed a reasonable ``phase-in'' period for the requirements,
during which the Secretary should provide significant guidance regarding implementation.



Discussion:

 The Department's requirements regarding immediate cash needs have not changed with these proposed regulations.
They have simply been restated as a criterion of the program participation agreement. These long established rules
are explained in many Department publications, and are included in annual Department training sessions. A ``phase-in''
period for these requirements is unnecessary. As for institutions that must wait for funds to pass through a State
agency, these institutions should have already addressed this issue in an effort to comply with existing Title IV,
HEA program guidance.



Changes:

 None.



Comments:

 A large group of commenters was concerned that the information provided to the Secretary, SPRE, guaranty agency,
accrediting agency or State licensing agency relative to an institution's administrative capability and financial
responsibility may be disclosed to the public, and recommended that the Secretary provide a guarantee that such information
must be kept confidential by the above-listed parties. Three commenters suggested that the Secretary develop a specific
format for the reporting of data and that the data be sent directly to the Secretary for dissemination to any of the above
organizations that might need it.



Discussion:

 The Secretary does not have the authority to create or supersede laws that may relate to disclosure of potentially
sensitive information. Such laws vary from State to State and from agency to agency; it would be inappropriate for
the Secretary to address such an issue. As for data provided directly to the Secretary, if that data were discloseable
under a freedom of information request, the Secretary would have no choice but to release the information if it were
requested.

It is important to note that the provision only requires institutions that have been selected for review under the
State Postsecondary Review Program process to provide the above-referenced information to SPREs. By the nature
of the selection procedures and because of the limited number of institutions which the Secretary anticipates will
meet review-triggering criteria, the Secretary believes most institutions will not be requested to provide this
information and therefore will not need to worry about potential public disclosure.

The Secretary believes a specific format for reporting and a centralized location for collection of data are unnecessary
at this time. As the information must only be provided upon request, each organization can specify exactly what information
is needed from an institution and in what time frame. A format specified by the Secretary might cause some institutions
to be burdened with providing information that is not needed.



Changes:

 Section 668.14(b)(4) has been amended to provide that an institution must provide information relating the administrative
capability and financial responsibility of the information to a SPRE if the institution was referred by the Secretary
under 34 CFR 667.5.



Comments:

 Four commenters recommended that SPREs and guaranty agencies be added as parties to whom institutions must submit
reports of information required by the Secretary. Four commenters also suggested including Federal consolidation
loans in the list of loan programs described in this section.



Discussion:

 Other provisions in the regulations require reports to be provided to SPREs and guaranty agencies. To restate those
requirements here would be redundant. 

Federal consolidation loans are not a Title IV, HEA program in which an institution must be certified for participation
and consequently should not be included in this section.



Changes:

 None.



Comments:

 Three commenters indicated that the proposed regulations placed responsibility on institutions for knowing how
much money students may have borrowed while attending other institutions.



Discussion:

 The commenters are correct. Institutions do have a responsibility to determine the amounts of Title IV, HEA program
funds students have received attending other institutions by obtaining financial aid transcripts from those schools.
Past abuses with this system, caused chiefly by institutions which did not recognize the importance of financial
aid transcripts, have created the need to tie this requirement to an institution's continuing participation in the
Title IV, HEA programs. While the Secretary does not anticipate that an institution would be penalized for information
of which it was not aware, it must be stressed that an institution must do everything in its power to ensure that no loan
is certified for an amount in excess of a student's allowable limits.



Changes:

 None.



Comments:

 Two commenters recommended that applicable institutions not only be required to make graduation and placement statistics
available to prospective students, but also to publish the information in their catalogs. One commenter suggested
that an institution only be required to provide to prospective students the job licensing requirements for its programs
relative to the State in which the school is located.



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes the regulations go far enough in requiring the institutions to make graduation and placement
rates available to prospective students. While some institutions may elect to publish this information in their
catalogs for convenience, such a measure is not required. Concerning the comment on State licensing requirements
for jobs, neither the statute nor the proposed regulations indicate that an institution must provide the criteria
for any State other than that in which the school is located.



Changes:

 None.



Comments:

 Three commenters are concerned that early deadlines for applications for State grants may affect an institution's
ability to inform eligible student loan borrowers about the availability and eligibility of those borrowers for
State grant assistance in the State in which the institution is located. Two commenters are concerned that in having
to inform students from other locations of State grant information pursuant to their States, institutions will be
required to be aware of State grant information for a large number of States.

Discussion: 

If an institution is aware that a student has 
enrolled or applied for financial assistance after the 
application date has passed to receive State grant assistance 
that year in that State, it must simply inform the student that 
he or she is not eligible for those funds, and may apply the 
following year prior to the deadline. Accordingly, the 
institution will then process the student's aid package with no 
consideration of State grant funds for that award year. The 
Secretary does not understand how this requirement could have any 
adverse affect on an institution. In fact, it is the Secretary's 
understanding that many institutions already publish State grant 
application information in their catalogs or disseminate the 
information through their financial aid offices. Regarding 
students from other States, institutions are indeed required to 
inform them of State grant assistance available to them from 
their own State; however, the institutions are not expected to be 
experts on this information, but rather to be sources of general 
information from which students may learn who to contact in their 
State to apply for assistance. The Secretary does not believe 
this requirement is unduly burdensome on institutions. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comments: 

A large group of commenters was concerned that 
requiring newly participating institutions or institutions that 
have changed ownership to implement a default management plan 
equal to Appendix D, for two years, was overly restrictive. Most 
suggested that institutions be allowed to submit an alternate 
plan to the Secretary for approval. Many of the commenters 
recommended that in the case of ownership changes, institutions 
with default rates under a certain percentage (10% or 20%) should 
be exempt from the requirement. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary's proposal that newly participating 
institutions and institutions that have changed ownership use 
Appendix D as a default management plan was made only after 
careful review by the Department showed that Appendix D is 
effective in helping reduce student defaults. Moreover, Appendix 
D is simply a basic default management plan. There is nothing in 
the statute or regulations that would preclude an institution 
from adding elements. In fact, the Secretary applauds such 
creative efforts and believes they may help to further reduce 
student defaults. The Secretary believes institutions with low 
default rates should not be exempted because there is no reason 
to believe under different ownership the rates would remain as 
low. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comments: 

Four commenters want to expand the regulations to 
include Social Security Administration, Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, Law Enforcement Agencies and Direct 
Lending Contractors as parties that are authorized to share 
information pertaining to an institution's Title IV, HEA 
eligibility or participation, or pertaining to fraud and abuse. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary does not have authority to include 
these organizations in the regulations as they do not appear in 
the statute. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comments: 

Many commenters argued that the provisions in this 
section governing an institution's ability to employ or contract 
with individuals or organizations to administer any aspect of the 
Title IV, HEA programs or the receipt of funds under those 
programs go far beyond the scope of section 487(a)(16) of the 
HEA. These commenters pointed out that the statute referred only 
to individuals or organizations that have been convicted, have 
pled 

nolo contendere

 or guilty to a crime, or that have been 
judicially determined to have committed fraud involving Title IV, 
HEA program funds and not to administrative determinations, other 
material violations of law, or misuse of State, local, or Federal 
government funds (other than Title IV, HEA program funds) with 
respect to an institution's ability to employ an individual or 
organization. One commenter supported the Secretary's proposed 
restrictions. Five commenters were concerned that an institution 
may be penalized for hiring or contracting with a party convicted 
of fraud involving government funds or a party that has been 
terminated from participation under the HEA for an infraction 
involving government funds, even if they were unaware of the 
conviction or termination. One commenter was concerned that the 
institution may be penalized if it hired or contracted with such 
a party, even if that person's job was to cut grass or collect 
garbage. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary disagrees with those commenters who 
argued that the provisions in this section restricting an 
institution's ability to employ or contract with certain 
individuals or organizations go beyond the authority of the HEA. 
Section 487(a)(4) expressly requires an institution to agree in 
its program participation agreement to comply with financial and 
fiscal responsibility requirements established by the Secretary. 
These requirements are part of the financial responsibility 
provisions found in  668.15(c). In proposing the additional 
restrictions in the NPRM, the Secretary provided justification 
that these additional safeguards were necessary to protect the 
Title IV, HEA programs and institutions participating in those 
programs. The Secretary still believes those justifications to 
be valid. The regulations state in regard to a participating 
institution's responsibility, it will not ``knowingly'' employ or 
contract with an individual, agency, organization, etc. which has 
violated any laws involving any government funds. The Secretary 
believes the regulations are clear that an institution will not 
be penalized for information of which it is not aware. 
Furthermore, in safeguarding Federal funds, the Secretary is 
concerned with 

any 

parties that may have previously violated a 
law involving government funds, even if these parties now perform 
janitorial or maintenance duties. By the provision, an 
employment or contract relationship with such a party is not 
appropriate, and by ``knowingly'' entering into such a relationship 
an institution may well jeopardize its continued participation in 
the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary believes the 
regulations make this clear as well. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comments: 

Three commenters recommended that the regulations be 
amended to prohibit contracts with institutions or third-party 
servicers that have been terminated for any reason, not just for 
a reason involving government funds. 



Discussion: 

The purpose of this provision is to safeguard 
Federal funds, not to punish institutions or servicers that may 
have been terminated. For that reason, the Secretary believes 
the provision is adequate in its present form to satisfy the 
intent of the statute. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comments: 

Five commenters advised that requiring institutions to 
complete surveys conducted as part of the Integrated 
Postsecondary Education System (IPEDS) in a timely manner and to 
the satisfaction of the Secretary could be burdensome to 
institutions, especially if the school did not have a large staff 
or computer systems capable of collecting information. Three of 
the five commenters recommended that the Secretary design forms 
or specify formats to make data collection easier. One of the 
five commenters suggested that the Secretary accommodate 
institutions not yet computerized with more time to complete the 
surveys.

<PARENT> FR940429-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Discussion: 

The language for this provision is statutory and may 
not be changed by the Secretary. In addition, the Secretary 
believes that any survey conducted as part of IPEDS is necessary 
and will provide valuable information to the Department. Those 
offices that collect IPEDS information work diligently to create 
consistent, easy-to-use forms and formats, not just because this 
makes data collection easier for the institutions, but also 
because it makes tabulating and sorting of the information 
easier. The Secretary does not believe this requirement is 
unduly burdensome to institutions. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comments: 

One commenter suggested that by not allowing 
institutions to impose penalties on students unable to meet their 
financial obligations due to disbursement delays for loan 
proceeds, this provision would force institutions to ``carry'' 
unpaid students indefinitely, creating a financial burden. One 
commenter suggested it was not the intent of the statute for an 
institution to allow an unpaid student to remain enrolled if the 
delay in disbursement of loan proceeds was caused by the 
student's failure to comply with a program requirement. One 
commenter recommended that the regulations stipulate that 
institutions would not be prohibited from withholding academic 
transcripts and other graduate services from students as the 
result of delayed disbursement of Title IV, HEA program funds. 



Discussion: 

The language of this requirement is for the most 
part statutory, and very clear in its intent. The Secretary does 
not believe this requirement will cause a financial burden to 
institutions as this situation should not frequently occur if an 
institution is complying with all applicable regulations. 

It is not probable that a student would deliberately cause 
the delay of his or her loan disbursement by not complying with 
the instructions of the institution or lender; nevertheless, if 
such a situation occurred, the institution would not be 
prohibited from imposing penalties on the student. 

The withholding of a student's academic transcript or other 
graduate services is considered a penalty by the Secretary. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comments: 

A very large number of commenters suggested that the 
proposed regulations went beyond the scope of the statute by 
prohibiting any type of incentive payments, particularly those 
based on ``retention.'' Most of those same commenters, plus 
another large group, felt that token gifts to students and alumni 
should be excluded from this requirement. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that even in incentive 
payment structures based on retention there is room for abuse 
and, in fact, has seen evidence of such abuse. Since July of 
1992 when the Amendments of 1992 were enacted, many institutions 
have opted to change to retention-based pay for admissions 
personnel. In that time, the Secretary has seen evidence of 
lowered satisfactory progress standards and in extreme cases, 
falsified attendance and leave of absence requests, all in an 
effort to keep students enrolled. In many cases, these practices 
were designed by admissions personnel who were duly paid after 
the student passed a retention mark. After that mark, the 
students were dropped. Furthermore, the Secretary has evidence 
that some of these students were admitted using falsified 
ability-to-benefit tests, which further ties the issue of 
retention to enrollment. The Secretary believes that reputable 
and conscientious institutions can develop other creative ways to 
reward their employees that will have no direct or indirect 
relationship to success in securing enrollments. Regarding token 
gifts for students and alumni who refer other students, the 
Secretary, after reviewing the comments, has decided that such 
practices are widespread and will cause no harm if the tokens are 
not monetary, and limits are placed both on their value and 
frequency of distribution. 



Changes: 

The Secretary has amended  668.14(b)(22) to allow that 
token gifts may be given to students or alumni for referring 
other students for admission to the institution, as long as: 

(1) the gift is not money, check or money order; 

(2) no more than one such gift is given to any student or 
alumnus; and 

(3) the value of the gift is no more than twenty-five 
dollars. 



Comments: 

Seven commenters asserted that most institutions that 
offer athletically related student aid are currently audited by 
the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and that the regulations 
should be amended to state that compilations and audits which 
together satisfy NCAA and OMB also satisfy the requirements of 
paragraphs (d) and (e) of the regulation. One commenter 
indicated that the proposed regulations paralleled NCAA audit 
requirements and compliance should not pose a problem for member 
institutions. One commenter pointed out that a ``compilation'' is 
a term defined under Statements on Standards for Accounting and 
Review Services No.1 and only provides a representation without 
any assurances on the statements. The commenter suggested that 
the Secretary require preparation of a schedule, and have that 
schedule audited. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that the requirements of the 
statute and regulations stand on their own. It is up to each 
institution to determine if a particular audit or compilation 
prepared for a different organization satisfies the conditions 
specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of the regulation. The 
Secretary believes it is unwise to give blanket approval to 
audits and compilations which, although at present may satisfy 
the regulation, may not at a later date. Furthermore, the 
language of this provision, as written, covers all institutions, 
even those which are not NCAA members. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comments: 

Seven commenters indicated that by making the 
effective date for participation in the Title IV, HEA programs 
the date that the Secretary signs an institution's program 
participation agreement, there may well be a lapse of time from 
the expiration of the prior program participation agreement 
during which the institution may be ineligible. The commenters 
felt this may create financial problems for both institutions and 
students, and some recommended that program participation be made 
retroactive to the date of application. Some other commenters 
felt program participation should be made retroactive to the date 
of the certification review. 



Discussion: 

The language for this provision is statutory. The 
Secretary has no reason to believe that Congress had any other 
intent when the law was drafted. However, the Secretary 
understands the concern of commenters that an institution's 
program participation agreement might expire after an institution 
has submitted a renewal application but before the Secretary 
signs a new program participation agreement. The Secretary has 
modified  668.13 to address that concern. See the section of the 


Analysis of Comments and Changes

 that addresses certification 
procedures ( 668.13). 



Changes: 

None. 



Section 668.15 Factors of Financial Responsibility 





General

. 

Comments

: A few commenters supported all of the Secretary's proposed regulations in  668.15. One of the commenters 
recommended the inclusion of a debt to net worth ratio in 
considering an institution's financial responsibility. One 
commenter, who disagreed with the Secretary's rationale for 
increasing the current ratio requirement from 1:1 to 1.25:1, 
suggested that the Secretary consider other types of financial 
analysis such as a ``Z Score'' in evaluating an institution's 
financial resources. Another commenter, who also disagreed with 
the Secretary, believed that tangible net worth was not an 
appropriate indicator of financial responsibility and recommended 
that the Secretary consider cash flow statements in his 
evaluation. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary considered a number of alternative 
ratio tests that could be used to evaluate an institution's 
financial condition. While the Secretary does consider minimum 
capitalization an important factor in determining an 
institution's financial responsibility, he has elected not to put 
such a standard into regulation at this time. Based upon the 
limited information presented by in the commenters, the Secretary 
is not convinced that a ``Z Score'' would be an appropriate measure 
of financial responsibility for an institution. However, the 
Secretary will monitor the financial information gathered in 
accordance with these regulations to determine whether it would 
be appropriate to require either additional, or alternative cash 
flow statement criteria as a factor in determining financial 
responsibility. 



Changes

: None.

Comments: 

Many commenters responded to the Secretary's request 
for comments regarding the acceptability of a ``bond rating'' as 
sufficient indicia of a nonprofit institution's financial 
responsibility. The majority of the commenters expressed support 
of the use of a bond rating as a means of evaluating financial 
responsibility. One commenter suggested that the Secretary 
consider an institution to be financially responsible if it is 
able to demonstrate that it has a debt financing arrangement that 
is acceptable to the College Construction Loan Authority (Connie 
Lee). Another commenter believed that the Secretary should 
broaden the definition of acceptable bonds to include other than 
general obligation bonds because certain types of revenue bonds 
issued by pubic nonprofit institutions also have ratings by 
nationally recognized rating agencies. One commenter believed 
that the Secretary should expand the provision to exempt for-profit institutions with an acceptable bond rating.




Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that a superior bond rating 
may serve as an effective proxy for demonstrating an 
institution's financial responsibility. An institution that has 
the capacity to issue a top rated debt security is, in general, 
considered to have the financial resources necessary to meet all 
of its financial obligations. The Secretary believes that the 
debt paying ability of an institution, as determined by a 
comprehensive credit review conducted by a nationally recognized 
statistical rating organization, is representative of the 
institution's financial health. For an institution's bond rating 
to serve as an acceptable proxy, the institution must have the 
financial resources required to obtain a rating at or above the 
second highest level used by the rating organization. 
Furthermore, the Secretary requires that an institution provide 
evidence that the issue has been rated without consideration of 
any insurance, guarantee, or credit enhancement that may have 
been used to lower the institution's cost of capital. The 
Secretary requires that an institution provide an actual rating 
from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. 
Since Connie Lee is not a rating organization, financing 
arrangements that are acceptable to Connie Lee are only eligible 
for consideration to the extent that they are separately rated by 
a nationally recognized rating organization that is acceptable to 
the Secretary. The Secretary agrees with commenters that the 
substitution of a bond rating for an institution's having to 
demonstrate financial responsibility should be expanded to 
include other forms of rated debt such as revenue bonds. The 
Secretary also agrees that this provision should be applied to 
both nonprofit and for-profit institutions. 



Changes: 

Sections 668.15(b)(7)(ii), (b)(8)(ii) and (b)(9)(v) 
have been added to provide that the Secretary shall consider an 
institution to be financially responsible if the institution is 
able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it 
has an outstanding debt obligation which has been rated by a 
nationally recognized statistical rating organization at or above 
the second highest level rated by that organization. To be 
acceptable to the Secretary, an institution's debt must have been 
rated without consideration of any insurance, guarantee, or 
credit enhancement employed by the institution to lower its cost 
of capital. 



General standards of financial responsibility. Comments: 

A few commenters expressed concern that the 
Secretary's requirement that an institution submit an audited 
financial statement without qualification or disclaimer was 
particularly burdensome because the commenters believed an 
institution is likely to be faced with a ``qualified'' statement as 
a result of adopting new accounting standards mandated under FAS 
117. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that the reliability of any 
financial statement is dependent upon the ability of the 
institution's independent auditor to determine and report that 
the information contained within the financial statements is a 
fair representation of the institution's financial resources. 
The auditor will issue a qualified statement if the auditor is 
unable to determine that the information is a fair representation 
because of any uncertainty. It is the institution's 
responsibility to identify the cause of the uncertainty and make 
every reasonable effort to correct it. 



Changes: 

 None.

Comments: 

Many commenters believed that the requirement for an institution to be current on any debt service should be clarified
to take into consideration legitimate disputes that may arise in the normal course of business. Several commenters
believed that a single instance or even a few instances of late payments would not necessarily be indicative of financial
problems. Many commenters believed that an institution should be considered current, despite not having made scheduled
payments, if the institution is currently involved in negotiations with creditors to restructure or reschedule
outstanding debt. A number of commenters suggested that a pattern of late payments on the part of an institution would
be a more reliable indicator of financial difficulty than would a single instance of failure to pay. Many of the commenters
suggested that the Secretary rely on the judgement of the institution's independent auditor in determining whether
or not such a pattern of late payment exists. 



Discussion: 

In general, the Secretary believes that an institution's ability to meet its financial obligations when due is indicative
of financial health. However, the Secretary recognizes that over the normal course of a business cycle an institution
may occasionally delay payment to certain trade creditors as a result of contractual disputes. Alternatively, the
Secretary recognizes that an institution that is experiencing cash flow problems will typically delay payment to
creditors in an effort to conserve cash. Clearly, if the cause of an institution's delay in making payment is contractual
in nature, than the Secretary expects that this would occur infrequently. If the cause is related to insufficient
cash flow, then the Secretary would expect to observe a recurring pattern of late payments to creditors. The Secretary
believes that payments related to long term liabilities such as term loans from financial institutions, bonds, debentures,
or notes payable which become due beyond one year are of significant importance because the institution's assets
are typically pledged, encumbered, or assigned to collateralize such obligations. The Secretary agrees with the
commenters that an institution is current, despite having failed to make scheduled payments, if the institution
has reached an acceptable agreement with creditors to substantially reschedule or restructure the outstanding
debt. However, the Secretary believes that a failure, on the part of the institution, to reach an agreement with creditors
after a reasonable period of time exposes the institution to potential financial and legal problems that may adversely
affect the quality of the institution's educational program. Information about the institution's outstanding
debt is already provided by the institution in its audited financial statement. Furthermore, the institution's
independent auditor has a responsibility to disclose any failure, on the part of the institution, to be in compliance
with loan agreements in existence on the date the institution's balance sheet was prepared.

Changes: 

 Section 668.15(b)(4) is amended to provide that an institution is not considered to be financially responsible if
the institution is not in compliance with all loan agreements in existence on the date the institution's financial
statements are prepared. However, the Secretary considers an institution to be current in its debt service if the
institution can provide evidence that it has reached a mutually acceptable agreement to restructure or reschedule
its obligations. If an institution is unable to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with creditors after 120 days
and the institution's failure to pay its obligations has resulted in a creditor taking legal action to attach the institution's
assets or obtain a judgment, then the institution shall not be considered to be financially responsible. 


Comments: 

Many commenters felt the requirement that an institution maintain a cash reserve was excessive. A few commenters
supported the requirement of the cash reserve and provided suggestions for alternative methods of calculating the
amount of the reserve requirement. A majority of the commenters who expressed a concern believed that the establishment
of a separate reserve account would significantly reduce available working capital funds that might be better applied
to meet other operating expenditures. Many commenters believed that nonprofit institutions should be allowed to
include amounts held in the cash reserve in the calculation of the ratio of current assets to current liabilities.
Some commenters supported the Secretary's position that the cash reserve account should be excluded from the calculation
of the ratio for nonprofit institutions. A number of the commenters thought that a more appropriate requirement would
be a cash reserve that is based on the institution's actual refund experience. A few commenters suggested that the
cash reserve requirement be based on the residual of total unearned tuition liability less accounts receivable,
with an adjustment for refunds made under the 

pro rata 

refund policy. Many commenters suggested that the calculation of the reserve requirement on the basis of deferred
tuition revenue seemed arbitrary and indicated that it would vary greatly among institutions depending on the timing
of enrollments and the preparation of year end financial statements. Other commenters recommended that the Secretary
consider an annual financial statement along with cash flow projections for the next three enrollment periods as
an alternative to the cash reserve. A few commenters believed that the definition of acceptable forms of the cash reserve
should be expanded to include money market instruments, that are highly liquid and trade in an active secondary market.
Overall, the majority of the commenters believed that the provision should be removed. 


Discussion: 

Section 498(c)(5) of the HEA requires the Secretary to establish requirements for an institution to maintain sufficient
cash reserves to ensure repayment of any required refunds. The Secretary proposed that a cash reserve based on the
institution's deferred tuition revenue would be appropriate because the balance of the deferred tuition account
generally reflects amounts collected by, or contractually obligated to be received by, the institution in advance
of providing educational services. The Secretary believed an institution could reasonably expect that some students
would withdraw prior to the completion of their educational program and be entitled to a refund of amounts paid for
services not yet rendered. 
The Secretary believes that the commenters are correct in observing that the balance of deferred tuition revenue
would vary among institutions depending on factors that have little to do with actual refund payments by the institution,
such as enrollment periods and fiscal year ends. The Secretary believes that it would be more consistent with the intent
of the HEA for this provision to match the reserve requirement more closely with an institution's historical refund
experience. The Secretary believes that a cash reserve balance equal to one quarter of the institution's previous
year's total refund expenditure would be sufficient to satisfy the institutions cash reserve requirement because
that amount represents approximately three months potential refund expenditure. 
In order to establish the appropriate amount for the cash reserve, the institution will have to disclose, in a note
to its audited financial statements, the dollar amount of total refunds paid in both the current fiscal year and prior
year. The Secretary does not consider internally generated cash flow projections as reliable indicators of an institution's
ability to meet the cash reserve requirement. The Secretary does not consider liquid investments, such as money market
funds, to be equivalent to cash because such investments do not generally have a maturity date and are therefore more
characteristic of equity investments. 
While the Secretary acknowledges the criticism from the commenters that the establishment of a cash reserve reduces
available working capital, the Secretary points out that the establishment of a reserve account requires the accumulation
of cash on a one-time basis. Contributions to the reserve account would be required only to the extent that enrollment
levels and refund experiences vary. On a continuing basis, the resulting net outflow of working capital would be the
same despite the establishment of a cash reserve. 
The Secretary agrees with the commenters that nonprofit institutions should be treated consistently with for-profit
institutions, and allowed to include the cash reserve in the calculation of the liquidity ratios. The reserve account
is intended to provide an immediately available source of cash that must be available to make refunds at any time. It
is reasonable to expect that if an institution were to close at other than the end of an academic period that the cash
reserve funds would be used to pay the institution's refund liability. Since unpaid refunds are generally recognized
as a current liability it is appropriate to recognize, in the institution's ratio calculation, those assets which
would actually be used to offset the liability in the event of liquidation. 
The regulation will restrict the type of account in which the cash reserve must be kept because it must be maintained
at a certain minimum level at all times. Accordingly, an institution may not hold reserve funds in any type of investment
that is subject to significant price variation. The Secretary believes only cash held in the form of a demand deposit
in a federally insured bank account, or short term investments secured by the full faith and credit of the United States
meet this criteria. 


Changes: 

The Secretary amends the cash reserve requirement in  668.15(b)(5) to require an institution to maintain at
all times, a cash reserve equal to one-quarter of the total dollar amount of refunds paid by the institution in the previous
fiscal year. Such reserves shall be maintained in a cash deposit in a federally insured bank account or, in U.S. Treasury
securities, backed by the full faith and credit of the United States having an original maturity of three months or
less.

Comments: 

Many commenters believed that the requirement that for-profit institutions maintain a ratio of current assets to
current liabilities of 1.25:1 was burdensome and exceeded the scope of the statute. One commenter supported the ratio
requirement and suggested that a current ratio of 1.6:1 up to 2:1 might be a more appropriate standard of financial
responsibility. The majority of commenters who expressed concern regarding the ratio requirement indicated that
they believed the Secretary's justification for applying a higher standard to for-profit institutions was unsupported
and discriminatory. Many commenters believed that the Secretary should not attempt to distinguish between for-profit
and nonprofit institutions. Among the commenters who expressed a concern, most believed that the establishment
of separate ratio tests for each type of institution was not required by the HEA. Some of the commenters believed that
the exclusion of uncollateralized related party receivables from the calculation of current assets was inconsistent
with generally accepted accounting principles. A number of commenters suggested that a phase-in period ranging
from twelve months to more than five years should be granted to allow institutions time to build up working capital
reserves in order to comply with this standard. 


Discussion: 

Many commenters believed that in applying this standard the Secretary was effectively mandating that for-profit
institutions divert available funds away from capital assets such as facilities, supplies, and equipment and into
lower yielding short term investments. While the Secretary recognizes the possibility that a higher current ratio
requirement could theoretically lead to greater inefficiencies in the use of funds, the Secretary believes that
higher levels of working capital afford greater financial flexibility to institutions and thus provide greater
protection against the possibility of unexpected closure. The Secretary believes that Congress intended to ensure
through regulation that students are afforded every reasonable protection with regard to their attendance at an
institution through which they are receiving HEA funds. The Secretary also believes that the numerous fundamental
differences in accounting and funding methods for nonprofit and for-profit institutions provide sufficient justification
for the application of different standards to them. 
However, the Secretary believes that a change in the current ratio requirement is appropriate to take into consideration
differing financial and operating structures while employing similar standards for both for-profit and nonprofit
institutions. In order to implement a uniform standard that may be used for different types of institutions, the Secretary
believes that it is appropriate to exclude certain assets and liabilities from the calculation of the analytical
ratios. As discussed in more detail below, the Secretary believes institutions that are currently in compliance
with the existing standards of financial responsibility will not require a grace period to meet the new standards.



Changes: 

In   668.15(b)(7)(i)(A) and (b)(8)(i)(B), the Secretary has replaced the current ratio requirement
of 1.25:1 with an acid test ratio of 1:1, representing the ratio of the sum of cash and cash equivalents, and current
accounts receivable divided by current liabilities. In applying this standard, the Secretary excludes from the
ratio calculation all unsecured or uncollateralized related party receivables as well as all other assets not specifically
identified in the above ratio calculation. 


Comments: 

Several commenters were concerned that the Secretary is involved in attempting to set accounting standards by requiring
classified statements of financial position for nonprofit institutions reporting under Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement 117 (FASB 117), Financial Statements for Not-for-Profit Organizations. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary is aware that presenting the statement of financial position of a nonprofit institution as a classified
statement of financial position is a matter of management decision. However, during the negotiated rule making process,
the need for comparable financial responsibility and accounting standards became evident. This need must be reconciled
in some manner, despite the varying accounting standards between for-profit and nonprofit entities. The Secretary
does not permit this information to be presented in a supplementary schedule because supplementary schedules are
not subject to audit tests, as are notes to the financial statements. The information concerning current assets and
current liabilities does not have to be included as part of the audit but may be included in the notes to the financial
statements. Preparation of a classified statement of financial position is included as an option under FASB 117.
The Secretary is therefore not setting standards but merely requiring that presentation be made in accordance with
one of those options in particular. 


Changes: 

None. 


Comments: 

Many commenters believed that implementation of the proposed regulations should be delayed for at least a year, with
most commenters expressed stating that the increased current ratio requirement and cash reserve requirement would
require institutions to accumulate additional cash or other liquid assets. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary believes institutions that are in compliance with the current standards for financial responsibility
will not require a significant period of time to implement the proposed changes. For many institutions, the acid test
ratio proposed by the Secretary will measure exactly the same elements as the former current ratio did. The establishment
of a separate cash reserve should not impact the calculation to a great extent because the cash reserve balance will
be included in the ratio calculation. Because the acid test ratio is a more stringent measure of liquidity, the Secretary
only requires that an institution demonstrate parity between its most liquid assets and its current obligations.
The accumulation of significant liquid assets would generally not be required by an institution. The Secretary believes
that it is reasonable to expect that an institution has at least as much cash on hand and current receivables as it does
current obligations. 


Changes: 

None.

Past performance of an institution or persons affiliated with an 
institution. Comments:

 Two commenters were concerned about the proposal to 
expand the requirements whereby an institution is not considered 
to be financially responsible if an individual, who exercises 
substantial control over any other existing institutions or 
defunct institution or third-party servicer, owes a liability for 
a violation of a Title IV requirement, and is not making payments 
according to an agreement established with the Secretary to repay 
the liability. Several commenters wanted all references to a 
member or members of a person's family deleted from the 
regulations citing that people should not be held financially or 
legally responsible for the actions of members of their family 
who have reached their majority. Another commenter was concerned 
about the inclusion of a member of the person's family without 
regard to whether there is any partnership between the 
individuals and felt that this requirement unnecessarily broadens 
the scope of the requirement. Several commenters suggested that 
the percentage of ownership interest used to establish 
substantial control over an institution or third-party servicer 
be set at 50 percent rather than 25 percent stating that a 25 
percent ownership interest does not mean that the person has 
control of the business. 


Discussion:

 Section 498(e)(4)(B) refers to audit findings of 
more than 5 percent of an institution's Title IV, HEA program 
funds for any award year. The Secretary considers this statutory 
provision to be designed to require the consideration of the loss 
of that amount of Title IV, HEA program funds, regardless of 
whether that loss was identified from an audit or as the result 
of a program review. 
The Secretary considers the criteria in the provisions of 
 668.15(c)(2) to be indicative of serious problems with financial 
responsibility. An institution in one of these categories has 
already failed to comply properly with the Title IV, HEA program 
requirements and has had the opportunity, during its appeal 
process or other negotiations with the Department's officials, to 
demonstrate any mitigating circumstances that might have 
justified reducing or eliminating the sanction or finding. The 
Secretary agrees with the commenters who suggested that one of 
the categories of past performance problems should be revised to 
reflect a failure of an institution to resolve satisfactorily any 
significant compliance problem. 
The Secretary is satisfied that citing an institution for a 
failure to submit acceptable required audit reports in a timely 
fashion is a better standard of past performance problems than a 
final determination. A final determination is issued only after 
an acceptable audit report has been submitted and the findings 
have been formally issued to the institution. An institution can 
be cited for failure to submit an audit report in a timely 
fashion, and an institution can have its audit report returned 
because the report is unacceptable. These actions do not imply 
that the institution has committed any other violations of 
Title IV, HEA program requirements, but it is essential for the 
Secretary to have acceptable audit reports on time so that the 
Secretary can evaluate whether the institution is appropriately 
administering its participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. 


Changes:

 The criterion in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section 
has been revised to provide that the failure to resolve 
satisfactorily any significant problem identified in a program 
review or audit report causes an institution not to be considered 
financially responsible. 


Exceptions to the general standards of financial responsibility. 
Comments:

 Three commenters suggested that performance bonds 
should be accepted to meet the standard for surety amounting to 
at least 50 percent of total Title IV HEA program funding under 
the statute. The commenters contended that performance bonds may 
provide equal, if not better, protection to the Secretary than 
letters of credit because it is often possible to collect on 
performance bonds even after the expiration date. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary has determined that the level of 
protection afforded by performance bonds is not sufficient due to 
the relative difficulty in collecting against such instruments 
compared to recoveries under a letter of credit. In some 
instances involving school closures where a performance bond was 
in place, the Secretary might be required to submit and document 
claims on a student-by-student basis before a third party before 
collecting the full amount of institutional liabilities. 
Collection under an irrevocable letter of credit has proven to be 
reliable and effective in protecting the federal interests. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 A number of commenters responded to the Secretary's 
request in the February 28, 1994 NPRM for specific standards that 
might be employed to measure the acceptability of a State's 
tuition recovery fund. Several commenters recommended that the 
Department only require states to certify that the fund can pay 
all required refunds on behalf of schools that close 
precipitously. Some of the commenters recommended that the 
Secretary take into consideration the success of various teach-out measures which exist in the various states. One
commenter 
recommended removal of the exemption because many charges 
associated with attending an institution that are properly 
included in refunds are not considered part of tuition, and would 
not be recoverable by the student in the event an institution 
closes. The commenter went on to recommend that the Secretary 
require an actuarial analysis and certification of full funding 
before considering a fund acceptable. Some of the commenters 
believed that a State's tuition recovery fund should be 
acceptable if the State has taxing authority to require schools 
to contribute to the fund. One commenter provided the Department 
with a number of suggestions including: assessing the extent of 
refund obligation that the fund would cover, the current funding 
level, maximum fund balance, amounts of annual assessments, 
amount of annual claims, the authority of the fund's 
administrator and the historical experience of the fund. One 
commenter believed that the Department would not effectively be 
able to evaluate the State's tuition recovery fund. Another 
commenter suggested that the acceptability of the state's tuition 
recovery fund should be determined by comparing a State fund's 
established maximum payout to an individual institution's annual 
loan volume. 


Discussion:

 In general, the Secretary believes that a State's 
tuition recovery fund will be found to be acceptable where it has 
the backing of the full faith and credit of the State and agrees 
to administer such refund payments in accordance with the 
requirements of the HEA programs. Based upon historical 
experience, State tuition recovery funds have been poorly 
capitalized and fund administrators have little authority to levy 
assessments. Many of the funds will pay refunds only for 
students currently enrolled, and not to students that were owed 
refunds when the institution closed. Other State tuition 
recovery funds have only provided protection to in-state 
residents and, in general, have capped payments at a 
predetermined maximum level without regard to the refund owed 
under the HEA programs. Some problems have also arisen where 
refunds were being made directly to students on a first-come, 
first-served basis that exhausted the available funds without 
apportioning them ratably to the funding sources that should have 
received the refunds for the benefit of those students. 
Given these concerns regarding the acceptability of State 
tuition recovery funds, the Secretary does not believe it is 
appropriate to address these criteria through regulation at this 
time. The Secretary will continue to review this issue to 
determine what standards, if any, may be set out through 
regulation. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 One commenter supported the requirement that an 
institution maintain a minimum cash reserve equal to 10 percent 
of deferred tuition revenue but believed that an institution's 
contributions to a State's tuition recovery fund should be 
included in calculating the reserve requirement. One commenter 
noted that the North Carolina General Statute 115D-90 requires an 
institution to maintain a guaranty bond in an amount equivalent 
to an institution's deferred tuition revenue at peak enrollment. 
The commenter believed that students were already afforded 
reasonable protection under the bond requirement and suggested 
that the cash reserve be required when no other form of 
protection exists. Another commenter believed that the Secretary 
should fully exempt institutions which retain deferred tuition 
amounts through independently administered escrow arrangements.

Discussion:

 Section 498(c)(5) of the HEA requires that all 
institutions maintain a minimum cash reserve. The requirement 
for an institution to maintain a cash reserve does not apply to 
institutions which reside in a State that has a tuition recovery 
fund if that state's tuition recovery fund is acceptable to the 
Secretary. As discussed above, under certain situations an 
institution may be able to demonstrate that the State tuition 
recovery fund to which it contributes will supplant the 
institution's requirement to maintain a separate cash reserve. 
In such an instance, the institution will not be able to treat 
its contributions to the State tuition recovery fund as a portion 
of its current assets. 


Changes:

 None 


Comments:

 One commenter believed that the requirement for an 
institution to demonstrate a positive tangible net worth would 
discourage employee ownership of institutions because amounts 
invested in employee stock ownership plans (ESOP's) are treated 
as intangibles and would be excluded from the calculation of net 
worth. Furthermore, the commenter believed that this particular 
provision was retroactive because intangibles that may have been 
acquired several years ago would still appear on an 
institution's balance sheet. The same commenter believed that 
the expense item representing amortization of intangibles should 
be excluded from the calculation of operating loss in view of the 
Secretary's exclusion of intangible assets from the calculation 
of tangible net worth. Another commenter requested that the 
Secretary consider the market value of assets purchased years ago 
and carried at depreciated book value on the institution's 
financial statement. One commenter believed that intangibles 
should be excluded only if the Secretary has reason to believe 
that the value of these assets does not reflect an arm's length 
valuation. 


Discussion:

 In general, an intangible asset has no physical 
existence and depends on some expected future benefit to derive 
its value. While the Secretary believes that the presence of an 
intangible on an institution's balance sheet can, and often does, 
imply some future economic benefit to the institution, the 
Secretary does not believe that such an asset should be included 
in the institution's net worth calculation to determine whether 
the institution demonstrates financial responsibility for HEA 
program purposes. The Secretary does not believe that it would 
be necessary to exclude the expense item in the calculation of 
operating losses. Generally accepted accounting principles 
require that an institution show asset values at historical cost 
less accumulated depreciation. In the ordinary course of 
business, it would not be possible for the Secretary to make a 
determination regarding the current market value of any asset 
unless that asset was actually sold in an arm's length 
transaction or an actuarial valuation was obtained in a manner 
acceptable to the Secretary. Administrative efficiency and a 
preference for certainty as documented through the audited 
financial statements warrant the exclusion of such items. 


Changes:

 None. 


Documentation of financial responsibility. Comments:

 Two commenters felt that audited financial statements should be submitted only once every four years, when most institutions
are recertified. The commenters believed that the statute allows for this limited reporting. A few commenters 
believed that the submission of an audited financial statement 
should be accepted by the Secretary as sufficient evidence to 
establish an institution's financial responsibility without 
regard to the content of the statements. 


Discussion:

 The statute is clear in making annual audited 
financial statements a requirement. Further, the Secretary 
believes that the Department has a responsibility to verify on an 
annual basis that institutions have sufficient financial strength 
to provide the educational services for which its students are 
contracting. The Secretary has prescribed an acid test ratio in 
accordance with  498(c)(2) of the HEA. The calculation of the 
acid test ratio is based on information contained in an 
institution's audited financial statement as prescribed in 
 498(4). The Secretary believes that the acid test ratio provides 
reliable information about the financial condition of an 
institution. 


Changes: 

None. 


Comments:

 One commenter believed that the requirement that an 
institution submit a financial statement for its two most 
recently complete fiscal years should be clarified by the 
Secretary to require two years of financial information in only 
the first year following the implementation of the regulation 
because annual financial statements would be required thereafter. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary requires the submission of two years 
of financial data on an annual basis. To be considered 
financially responsible, an institution must demonstrate that it 
has not experienced operating losses in either or both of its two 
most recently completed fiscal years that in sum total more than 
ten percent of the institution's total net worth at the beginning 
of the first year in the two year period. The Secretary shall 
make this determination on the basis of financial information 
submitted by the institution in the form of an audited 
comparative financial statement representing each of the 
institution's two most recently completed fiscal years or by 
comparing information provided by the institution in the form of 
two individual audited financial statements, each representing 
one of the institution's two most recently completed fiscal 
years. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 Many commenters believed that the requirement for an 
institution to submit an audited financial statement within four 
months of the institution's fiscal year end was burdensome 
because institutions were also required to perform compliance 
audits during the year at points that did not necessarily 
coincide with the institution's fiscal year end. As a result the 
institution would be required to incur additional audit costs 
that would be unnecessary if both audits could be performed 
simultaneously. To accomplish this, the commenters requested that 
the Secretary extend the period in which audits are due from four 
months to within six months of the institution's fiscal year end. 
Two commenters believed that the requirement for an institution 
to submit an audited financial statement within four months of 
the fiscal year end contradicted the objectives of the Single 
Audit Act, and OMB circular A-128 and A-133, because timing 
differences related to the availability of information would 
result in an institution being required perform both a financial 
audit and a compliance audit. Another commenter noted that 
audits prepared in accordance with the Single Audit Act were 
acceptable under 34 CFR 668.23(f), and suggested that an audit 
prepared in accordance with the Single Audit Act ought to be 
acceptable to the Secretary in other sections of the same 
regulation.

Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that a four month period provides ample opportunity for an institution to accomplish the preparation
and audit of fiscal year end financial statements. The reliability of any financial statement, as a fair representation
of the institution's true financial condition, is largely dependent on the timeliness of the financial report. The
Secretary believes that four months is reasonable and notes that many thousands of publicly traded corporations
make timely submissions under the 3 month time frame set by the Securities and Exchange Commission for the submission
of annual audited financial statements. The Secretary may, however, grant an extension on an individual basis where
the institution demonstrates a sufficient basis for the extension. An institution that is required to report in accordance
with OMB circular A-128 or A-133 under the Single Audit Act will continue to be governed by the reporting
requirements specified under that act. 



Changes: 

The Secretary has added  668.15(e)(3) to show that audits submitted in accordance with the Single Audit Act
meet the reporting requirements under this section. 



Section 668.16 Standards of Administrative Capability





Comments: 

Proposed changes to this section generated many comments. Some commenters asserted that many of the proposed standards
go far beyond the issue of administrative capability. Some argued that the Secretary would exceed the authority of
the HEA if the proposed revisions were retained in final regulations. Some commenters argued that some of the issues
addressed in this section were subject to review by accrediting agencies or SPREs and inclusion in these standards
would result in duplication of effort on the part of the Triad agencies and institutions. Some commenters believed
the proposed standards to be needlessly detailed and complex. Some commenters stated that the proposed standards
were too broad. Some commenters strongly opposed the clarification that institutions would be expected to comply
with all the standards in order to be fully certified. Some commenters noted that there was no effort to weigh the relative
importance of the various proposed elements of administrative capability and recommended that the section be revised
to prioritize the various standards. Some commenters recommend that the elements of administrative capability
in  668.16 be considered indicators, not absolutes. Some commenters requested that the Secretary provide
more specificity in the regulations so that institutions would know precisely what was requested of them and when.




Discussion: 

The Secretary appreciates the many thoughtful comments on the various aspects of regulating in the area of administrative
capability. The Secretary found many of the constructive recommendations made by commenters to be useful in modifying
some standards, crafting more precise language for other standards, and understanding why some proposed standards
are unnecessary or should not be imposed at this time. 

Based on the comments, the Secretary has modified the proposed administrative standards significantly. While specific
changes are discussed in detail in connection with the applicable section, the Secretary believes it may be useful
to note some of the principles and rationale which guided the refinement of the administrative standards. The Secretary
made many changes in sections where commenters pointed out that the same goal could be reached by requiring less detail
or action by those institutions that demonstrated a history of compliance with regulations governing the Title IV,
HEA programs and imposing more on requirements or restrictions on institutions that have either no track record or
have a record of problems administering the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary also made adjustments in those proposed
standards where there was overlap with the responsibilities of accrediting agencies or SPREs. 

The Secretary did not find persuasive the comments of those who urged that the elements be considered as indicators
of administrative capability instead of absolutes, or that the standards be prioritized to indicate relative importance.
Requiring that institutions meet each and every standard is critical to successful enforcement by the Secretary.
If institutions were not required to do so, institutions could argue that they had substantially complied with the
administrative capability standards and it would be difficult for the Department to enforce compliance. The Secretary
has determined that only way to become a more effective gatekeeper is to select critical standards, put institutions
on notice that they are responsible for adhering to them_by requiring that each standard of administrative capability
be met_and taking action when they are not. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comments: 

The majority of commenters believed the Secretary should clarify that an institution must administer the Title IV,
HEA programs in accordance with 

all

 statutory provisions, regulatory provisions, or applicable special arrangement, agreement or limitation. Two
commenters believed the paragraph to be overly broad and unnecessary. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary appreciates the support of those commenters who understand the importance of making it clear that an
institution is expected to comply with all applicable statutes, regulations, and any special agreement or arrangement
into which the institution has entered with the Secretary. The Secretary agrees to clarify that special agreements,
limitations, or arrangements are those entered into under statutes applicable to Title IV of the HEA. 



Changes: 

Section 668.16(a) is amended to clarify that an institution must administer the Title IV, HEA programs in accordance
with all statutory provisions, regulatory provisions, or applicable special arrangements, agreements or limitations
entered into under the authority of statutes applicable to Title IV of the HEA. A conforming change has been made to
 668.14(b)(1). 



Comments: 

Many commenters supported the idea that the Department recognize quality training provided by State, regional,
or national financial aid administrators or guaranty agencies as a factor in the determination of a designated individual's
ability to administer the Title IV, HEA programs at an institution. One commenter noted that while attendance at training
workshops may be beneficial, the workshops have no means of assessing whether attendees have achieved a given level
of knowledge. While a few commenters acknowledged that the caliber of training varies and suggested a system that
recognizes a variety of training options, no one responded to the Secretary's request for criteria to consider in
approving non-Federal training. 

A majority of the commenters recommended that to be deemed a ``capable individual'' an aid administrator should be
required to satisfy a training or certification requirement. Many commenters noted that a continuing education
requirement might be appropriate, also. Some of the commenters who advocated a continuing education requirement
recommended that such training be required to be reported to the Secretary or be attested to by the institution's auditor.


Of those commenters who advocated a certification requirement, most opposed national certification because they
felt it would be costly and might duplicate State certification efforts. However, two commenters did advocate national
certification or credentials. A few commenters opposed certification and noted that one State had discarded certification
several years ago; one commenter noted that the Secretary has not shown any evidence that State-certified training
leads to or correlates with improved administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. One commenter who recommended
that experience, training, or certification be required specified that the requirement should apply to ``at least''
the individual operationally in charge of the financial aid office.

Several commenters provided additional suggestions for factors to use in determining whether an individual is capable:
An individual's record of timeliness and accuracy in administration of Title IV, HEA programs; an individual's years
of experience administering Title IV, HEA programs; an individual's on-going attendance at workshops and seminars
during each award year; and an individual's record of compliance with Title IV, HEA program regulations. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary appreciates the comments from those individuals and organizations that supported making some kind
of training, certification, or continuing education a requirement. The Secretary continues to believe that State
certification, as well as participation in and completion of quality workshops and training programs, are good indicators
of a ``capable individual'' and intends to consider these factors in evaluating capability. However, the Secretary
does not see the need at this time to make training or certification a requirement. 

Despite the lack of response to the solicitation of suggestions on training elements the Secretary might use to evaluate
and approve nondepartmental training, the Secretary believes that quality training programs exist outside the
Department that would be beneficial in determining an individual's capability and will continue to solicit advice
as to how such programs might be identified and approved. To encourage suggestions on appropriate approval of training
programs and to facilitate the use of any training programs approved in the future to evaluate capability, the Secretary
retains, without change, the provision in the final regulations that would accommodate training approved by the
Secretary. 

The Secretary agrees that previous experience and documented success in properly administering Title IV, HEA programs
are germane to the evaluation of an individual's capability. 



Changes: 

Previous experience and documented success in properly administering Title IV, HEA programs are added to the list
of factors in  668.16(b)(1) that the Secretary may consider in determining whether an individual is capable.




Comments: 

The vast majority of commenters opposed strongly the use of any prescriptive staffing standards to evaluate the adequacy
of staffing levels at institutions. Many commenters were concerned that there are too many variables_number and
type of professional programs offered by an institution, level of staff experience, degree of centralized processing,
use of third-party servicers, and diversity of the student body, in addition to the factors listed in  668.16(b)(2)_to
permit an accurate assessment of the adequacy of staff levels. A number of commenters expressed the concern that small
institutions would be penalized if staff levels were stipulated in regulations. Many commenters stated that adequate
staffing should not be an issue unless an institution demonstrates problems administering the Title IV, HEA programs,
as reflected in audits, program reviews, or student complaints. One commenter noted that during the negotiated rulemaking
sessions, non-Federal negotiators explained and stressed the potential negative impact on current aid office staffing
levels that could result from creating an artificial ratio of aid applicants or recipients to financial aid administrators.

A few commenters provided suggestions on how to evaluate the adequacy of staffing levels at institutions or recommended
that the Secretary analyze workload issues and develop appropriate formulae. Other commenters recommended to the
Secretary a recent staffing survey conducted for the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators
(NASFAA) as an appropriate model to use in developing more precise measures of staff adequacy. A few commenters believed
that currently participating institutions should be judged on the basis of their track record, but thought that use
of ratios of aid applicants or recipients to financial aid administrators might be helpful in the assessment of the
administrative capability of institutions applying for participation in the Title IV, HEA programs for the first
time. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that, in general, a currently participating institution's compliance with the other standards
of administrative capability can serve as a reliable indicator that a financial aid office is staffed adequately.
However, if an institution adds a branch campus or other location, starts using or stops using a third-party servicer,
or makes other changes that would have an impact on the administrative capability of the institution, the Secretary
believes it may be necessary to look more closely at the institution's staffing pattern. Further, an institution
that undergoes a change of ownership that results in a change of control may experience a change in its enrollment level
and financial aid office personnel and should be subject to review of its staffing level. 

In general, the Secretary intends to use the list of factors in this section especially to assess the adequacy of staffing
at institutions that make these changes, at institutions that are applying for initial participation, and at institutions
with documented compliance violations. However, the Secretary expects all institutions to be able to demonstrate
that they have an adequate number of qualified persons to administer the Title IV, HEA programs properly. 

In addition to those factors identified in the proposed regulations, the Secretary agrees with those commenters
that the use of third-party servicers could have a significant impact on the institution's ability to administer
the Title IV, HEA programs. 

Given the lack of information available currently about establishing meaningful ratios of staff to student applicants
or recipients, the Secretary is not adding a ratio to the factors used to evaluate even new institutions at this time.




Changes: 

The Secretary has amended  668.16(b)(2) by adding the use of third-party servicers to the list of factors to
be considered in assessing adequacy of staff levels. 



Comments: 

A few commenters argued that requiring communication of information from any institutional office that receives
information that has a bearing on student eligibility for Title IV, HEA program assistance to the person designated
to be responsible for administering Title IV, HEA programs was very labor intensive and should be removed. One commenter
stated that the specifications for interoffice communications bear no relationship to an expected outcome. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary notes that this requirement has existed for some time. The Secretary continues to believe that it is
an appropriate administrative standard inasmuch as proper communication among offices is essential to ensuring
that students are eligible for the amounts of Title IV, HEA program assistance they receive and that the status of borrowers
is updated, when appropriate. 



Changes: 

None.

Comments:

 A dozen commenters objected to the proposed 
requirement that institutions have written procedures or 
information regarding several key aspects of the administration 
of the Title IV, HEA programs. Most of these commenters stated 
that the proposed requirement was burdensome and would create a 
lot of paperwork with no discernible benefit. One commenter 
noted that communications processes and structures are dynamic by 
nature and thus subject to frequent changes. Another commenter 
expressed concern that the Secretary was trying to dictate the 
pattern and frequency of communications among college offices. 
This commenter added that while development of written procedures 
such as those proposed would be good management practice, the 
Secretary should not regulate such practices. Some of the 
commenters recommended that this proposed requirement be removed 
entirely. Other commenters recommended that the requirement be 
imposed only on institutions that did not have a record of 
administering the Title IV, HEA programs successfully or only on 
larger institutions. 
Several commenters suggested that institutions be able to 
show compliance through their computer systems. One commenter, 
concerned that the time required to provide detailed 
documentation would take valuable time away from the smoothly 
running delivery of aid, recommended that general delineation of 
responsibilities be considered sufficient. Another commenter 
recommended that institutions be permitted to work out the method 
and frequency of communication. One commenter asked that the 
Secretary clarify how this provision relates to multi-campus 
institutions if the proposal were retained in final regulations. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary is not persuaded that mandating 
written procedures or information covering certain aspects of 
Title IV, HEA administration is an inappropriate or unnecessary 
administrative standard. However, the Secretary appreciates the 
concern of commenters who perceived certain areas of the proposal 
to be unduly burdensome. The Secretary agrees that the burden to 
an institution of having to prepare written procedures for or 
written information indicating the nature and frequency of 
communication of pertinent information among all the offices that 
have an impact on the administration of the Title IV, HEA 
programs outweighs the benefit that this provision would provide 
to the Secretary. The Secretary also agrees that, unless 
compliance problems relevant to the listed responsibilities are 
identified, institutions may satisfy the requirement that an 
institution have written procedures for or written information 
indicating the responsibilities of the various offices with 
respect to the approval, disbursement, and delivery of Title IV, 
HEA program assistance and the preparation and submission of 
reports to the Secretary by a general written description of the 
responsibilities of the various offices. 


Changes:

 The requirement that an institution has to prepare 
written procedures for or written information indicating the 
nature and frequency of communication of pertinent information 
among all the offices that have an impact on the administration 
of the Title IV, HEA programs has been removed from these 
regulations. 


Comments:

 A number of commenters discussed the issue of 
appropriate separation of awarding and disbursing functions. 
Many of these commenters said the prohibition on having family 
members perform the two functions would be onerous, particularly 
in a small, family-run institution. In a similar vein, some 
commenters noted that in a small institution the owner works and 
has responsibility over all facets of the institution. At small 
institutions, it is very difficult to provide for organizational 
independence. Many commenters suggested deleting the new 
language that references family members and individuals that have 
control over both functions and relying on the annual audit 
process to test for adequate internal controls. 


Discussion:

 This standard was strengthened to provide additional 
deterrence to collusion, which is a big problem at institutions 
that engage in fraud and at many institutions that fail to make 
refunds. The strengthened language also gives the Secretary 
added, needed authority to terminate institutions that engage in 
collusion. 
While the Secretary understands the concern of small family-run institutions that arranging for someone outside
the family to 
perform one or both tasks will be burdensome, the suggestion that 
the Secretary delete the new language and rely on the required 
financial and compliance audit is not realistic. At very small 
institutions, the auditor would probably conclude that there are 
no internal controls because there are only two or three 
employees_often the owners. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments: 

The Secretary received in excess of sixty comments on 
the provisions that address satisfactory academic progress. The 
vast majority of commenters were opposed to the proposed addition 
of  668.16(e)(3)(ii)(B), which stipulates that undergraduate 
students would be expected to complete their educational programs 
within 150% of the published length of the programs as a standard 
for measuring a student's satisfactory academic progress. They 
recommended that the proposed new provision be removed. A few 
commenters argued that implementation of the provision would be 
an infringement of the academic freedom of institutions. Many 
others asserted that requiring this level of detail in an 
institution's satisfactory academic progress standards is 
unwarranted, because it interferes with institutions' academic 
procedures, and argued that the proposed new requirement bears no 
discernible relationship to administrative capability standards. 
A few commenters opposed the inclusion of any satisfactory 
academic progress requirements in the standards for determining 
administrative capability. 
Many commenters were opposed to the proposed new criterion 
governing the maximum time frame because they believed that it 
does not take into consideration the academic career patterns of 
nontraditional students who work and have varying hours, attend 
part-time, or need remedial academic help, often interspersing 
developmental courses with courses taken for credit. One 
commenter contended that this provision would discriminate 
against students who change majors or eligible programs. Some 
commenters argued that implementation of the proposed provision 
would result in the cut-off of Title IV, HEA program funds to 
students in these categories even though the students may be 
serious and highly motivated. Thus, students who would otherwise 
be able to complete an eligible program would be denied that 
opportunity because they could continue with their education only 
if they received Title IV, HEA program assistance. 
Two commenters recommended that students be permitted to 
appeal this provision on a case-by-case basis. One commenter 
concurred with the provision as written and stated the standard 
is part of the current policy of the commenter's institution. 
One commenter stated that the required increments of time for the 
establishment of a maximum time frame in which the student must 
complete his or her educational program do not work for a program 
such as court reporting, where the time it takes students to 
complete a given amount of work may vary from 3 to 12 months. 


Discussion:

 Because students are required by Title IV of the HEA 
to maintain satisfactory progress to receive Title IV, HEA 
program assistance, it is only logical that an institution's 
ability to administer Title IV, HEA programs must be judged, in 
part, on the existence and implementation of an adequate 
satisfactory progress policy. The proposed addition is a 
codification of longstanding policy and is consistent with the 
requirements of the Student-Right-to-Know Act.

As stated in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the establishment 
of a maximum time frame would take into account a student's 
enrollment status. Institutions are currently required to 
monitor enrollment status of students receiving Title IV, HEA 
program funds and 150% of published program length can and should 
be viewed only in the context of an individual student's 
enrollment status. Thus, if a nontraditional student who is 
enrolled in a baccalaureate program that a full-time student is 
expected to complete in four years and a half-time student is 
expected to complete in eight years, vacillates between full-time 
and half-time enrollment, that student would have a computed 
maximum enrollment period somewhere between six and 12 years. 
Further, because the requirement is designed to set an upper 
limit on the period of time for which a student may receive Title 
IV, HEA program assistance, periods of nonenrollment, during 
which the student is not receiving Title IV, HEA program funds, 
would not be counted against the length of time the student is 
pursuing a degree or certificate. Thus, a student who enrolls 
and receives Title IV, HEA program funds sporadically would be 
treated differently from a full-time student who pursues a degree 
or certificate without interruption. 
Paragraph (e)(1)(vii) of this section requires an 
institution to have procedures under which a student may appeal a 
determination that the student is not making satisfactory 
progress. With regard to eligible programs of an academic year 
or less, these regulations make even clearer the longstanding 
requirement that the maximum time frame must be divided into 
increments. Satisfactory academic progress policies are expected 
to measure whether students are progressing satisfactorily toward 
their educational goals and should serve also as a device for 
counseling students about their need to improve their progress, 
if applicable. If maximum time frames are not divided into 
increments, these policies are not serving their purpose. This 
principle applies to programs shorter than an academic year no 
less than to longer programs. 


Changes:

 Section 668.16(e)(3)(B) is amended to clarify that a 
maximum time frame in which a student must complete his or her 
educational program must be no longer than 150 percent of the 
published length of the educational program for full-time 
students. 


Comments:

 Two commenters recommended expanding the requirement 
that an institution must develop and apply an adequate system to 
identify and resolve discrepancies in the information that the 
institution receives to include documentation of a student's 
social security number. They reasoned that resolution of social 
security number discrepancies is an important part of controlling 
fraud and abuse in the Title IV, HEA programs and the ability of 
an institution to obtain appropriate documentation to resolve 
such discrepancies should be considered in determining 
administrative capability. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary concurs with the commenters that 
resolution of social security number discrepancies is essential 
and should be expressly stated in this section. 


Changes:

 Section 668.16(f)(3) is amended to include 
documentation of a student's social security number in the 
information normally available to an institution and for which 
the institution must have a system to identify and resolve 
discrepancies. 


Comments:

 About half the commenters expressed concern, to 
varying degrees, that the proposed reporting requirement is too 
vague and broad and would result in overreporting that would 
overwhelm the Office of Inspector General. Some of these 
commenters recommended that the word ``evidence'' replace 
``information.'' Other commenters suggested that there be some 
kind of internal review or discussion. Several commenters 
recommended that institutions continue to make referrals to local 
law enforcement officials or at least consult with them. Two 
commenters wanted assurance that the institution would be 
protected in the event that it made a referral. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary cannot accept the substitution of 
``evidence'' for ``information'' because that the word ``evidence'' has 
legal ramifications. Evidence is normally determined in a court 
of law when the judge determines what permissible evidence is. 
Institutions may contact the Office of Investigations within the 
Office of Inspector General for advice before making a formal 
referral. The Secretary also cannot accept the suggestion that 
institutions establish an internal review mechanism prior to 
referral as such a mechanism may work to block appropriate 
referrals. However, the Secretary believes that an institution 
should only be required to refer to the Office of the Inspector 
General of the Department of Education 

credible

 information 
indicating fraud and abuse. 
The Secretary sees no problem with institutions making 
concurrent referrals to local law enforcement authorities, but 
cannot support the referral to local authorities as an 
alternative to making referrals to the Office of Inspector 
General. Concurrent referrals can be made with the regulation as 
written; no change is necessary. The Secretary cannot guaranty 
protection to institutions or individuals that make referrals. 


Changes:

 Section 668.16(g) has been amended to clarify that an 
institution must only refer to the Office of the Inspector 
General of the Department of Education 

credible

 information 
indicating fraud and abuse. 


Comments:

 Almost two-thirds of the commenters supported the 
concept of requiring institutions that serve significant numbers 
of students with special needs to have and implement plans for 
providing students with information about how to meet their 
needs, but half of these commenters recommended that the 
requirement be imposed only on institutions with high withdrawal 
rates. Two commenters recommended that institutions be required 
actually to provide the necessary support services. 
Several commenters suggested that students with language 
barriers be considered to have special needs. One commenter 
suggested that students from low socio-economic background, as 
determined by using the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) 
figures under the Federal Need Analysis formula, be determined to 
have special needs. Those commenters who responded to the 
Secretary's request for how to define significant number 
suggested either that 66 percent of total enrollment be used, as 
that would be consistent with the mitigating circumstances 
threshold for appealing determinations of excessive cohort 
default rates, or that percentages of enrollment, for example 
five percent, 10 percent, or 20 percent, be used as thresholds, 
depending on the number of students.

Of the commenters who opposed the proposed requirement, almost half argued that there is no connection between the
proposed regulation and administrative capability and the Secretary therefore should not regulate in this area.
A half dozen commenters believed that students were aware of their own special needs and it was their responsibility
to ensure that these needs were met. Several other commenters believed the proposed requirement was unnecessary
because either institutions that had students with special needs were already attending to those needs, or such students
would already be getting help from appropriate social service agencies. One commenter who objected strongly to the
proposal noted, among other concerns, that students need to learn to become self reliant and that employers with whom
the commenter's institution deal say the institution is already coddling its students too much. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary is persuaded that regulation in this area is unnecessary at this time. 



Changes: 

The provision that provides that an institution that serves significant numbers of students with special needs must
have and implement plans for providing students with information about how to meet their needs has been removed from
these regulations. 



Comments: 

Two commenters supported the provision that would require institutions to have procedures for receiving, investigating,
and resolving student complaints but requested that the Secretary clarify the proposed language. One of these commenters
asked that the Secretary make it clear that institutions would be expected to handle only those complaints related
to the educational programs and support services offered by the institution. The other commenter thought that institutions
should be required to publicize their system for handling complaints and maintain a log of student complaints. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary appreciates the commenters' support; it is good administrative practice to have a mechanism to resolve
student complaints. However, the Secretary has decided the proposed requirement is not an essential administrative
standard as there will be other means of addressing student complaints about an institution. Each SPRE will be setting
up a student complaint system to process student complaints about the postsecondary institutions in its State. Further,
SPREs will be reviewing the handling of student complaints at institutions they review. Accrediting agencies will
also be required to assess student complaints about institutions they consider. 



Changes: 

Proposed  668.16(j) has been removed from these final 
regulations. 



Comments: 

The Secretary received many comments on the proposals 
aimed at institutions with educational programs with the stated 
objective of preparing a student for gainful employment in a 
recognized occupation. Many of the commenters opposed the 
proposed requirements that the institution: (1) demonstrate a 
reasonable relationship between the length of the program and 
occupational entry level requirements and (2) establish the need 
for the training. The commenters believe the responsibility for 
evaluation of program length and the need for training rests with 
the other members of the Triad, principally the accrediting 
agencies. Some of these commenters argued that if the Secretary 
were to regulate in this area, the Secretary would exceed his 
statutory authority and be intervening inappropriately in 
academic affairs. Other commenters asserted that need for or 
length of training programs has nothing to do with ability of 
institutions to administer Title IV, HEA programs. These 
commenters recommended the elimination of this proposed standard. 

While some commenters were concerned that the standard, as 
proposed, is unreasonably vague, other commenters charged that 
the Secretary would be micromanaging if it were implemented. A 
number of these commenters noted that, for several reasons, it 
would be difficult to determine whether program length really is 
appropriate. Many commenters noted that their students are 
prepared and hired for positions that are above entry level. 

Many commenters saw the proposed standard as harmful or 
unworkable because of the use of minimum State standards as a 
measure of appropriate length. One commenter noted that there is 
no provision for evaluation of the method by which a State 
determines the minimum hours. Another commenter said State-mandated hours are too low. Other commenters questioned
what 
would happen if the State sets an inappropriate length. One 
commenter represented an institution that trains students from 
many States, each with different minimum requirements, and argued 
that it would be entirely inappropriate to limit the length of 
that institution's programs based on the minimum standard of the 
State in which the institution is located. Many commenters 
believed that the proposed regulation is unnecessary. One 
commenter suggested that disclosures to prospective students are 
mandated under the Student Right-to-Know Act and that SPRE 
standards will be addressing the abuses of the type described in 
the preamble to the February 28, 1994 NPRM and this provision 
would thus be duplicative. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary proposed this provision to curb 
existing abuses in these areas. The Secretary questions the 
motives of any institution that claims it is necessary to greatly 
exceed the minimum number of clock hours required by the State in 
which the institution is located for adequate training for a 
particular occupation. The Secretary is also concerned with any 
institution that provides training for occupations for which no 
training is necessary, or for which on-the-job training is 
adequate. Although an institution's SPRE and accrediting agency 
may regulate in these general areas, the Secretary believes it is 
necessary to 

specifically

 target areas of past abuse. Further, 
the Secretary believes it is consistent to require an institution 
to demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the length of 
the program and occupational entry level requirements established 
by any Federal agency. See the discussion in the 

Analysis of 
Comments and Changes 

section that addresses the definition of an 
eligible program ( 668.8).

However, the Secretary was persuaded by the commenters who 
asserted that need for or length of training programs is not 
directly linked to the ability of institutions to administer the 
Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary believes that this 
provision is more appropriate as a requirement for participation 
in the Title IV, HEA programs under an institution's program 
participation agreement. 



Changes: 

This provision has been moved to  668.14(b)(26). 
Further, the requirements of this provision have been amended to 
require an institution to demonstrate a reasonable relationship 
between the length of the program and occupational entry level 
requirements established by any Federal agency. 



Comments: 

Almost half the commenters supported the proposals for 
requiring that information on job availability and the relevance 
of courses to any specific State licensing standards be made 
available to students. All of these commenters suggested new 
ideas to clarify and expand the proposed requirements. Most of 
the other commenters asserted that the proposed requirements did 
not pertain to the proper administration of the Title IV, HEA 
programs and noted that accrediting agency and SPRE standards 
will address these areas. These commenters recommended that 
these proposed requirements be removed. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary continues to believe that providing 
adequate and accurate information to students and prospective 
students, so they can make informed decisions, is a function of 
proper administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. However, 
this requirement is covered in the section on the Program 
Participation Agreement,  668.14, and therefore is being removed 
from the administrative capability standards section. 



Changes: 

Proposed paragraph 668.16(l) is removed from these 
final regulations. 



Comments: 

Some commenters stated that the proposed requirement 
on advertising and recruitment practices was an extremely 
important one and recommended that it be strengthened by adding 
reference to oral as well as written statements. The majority of 
commenters asserted that the proposed requirements did not 
pertain to the proper administration of the Title IV, HEA 
programs and noted that accrediting agency and SPRE standards 
will address these areas. These commenters recommended that 
these proposed requirements be removed. 



Discussion: 

While the Secretary continues to believe that 
advertising, promotion and recruitment practices that reflect the 
content and objectives of educational programs accurately is a 
critical aspect of the proper administration of the Title IV, HEA 
programs, the Secretary also recognizes that accrediting agencies 
and SPREs will address these practices and agrees with those 
commenters that recommended that these proposed requirements not 
be included in the final regulations. 



Changes: 

Proposed paragraph 668.16(m) is removed from these 
final regulations. 



Comments: 

One commenter suggested that there might be a timing 
problem for an institution that is in the process of responding 
to an audit report in which liabilities have been identified. 
The commenter recommended that the Secretary expand the proposed 
language that would require that an institution have no 
outstanding liabilities, unless it has made satisfactory 
arrangements to repay them, to allow for liabilities the 
institution is currently in the process of making provisions to 
repay. Another commenter stated that this provision duplicates 
the financial responsibility requirements proposed in 
 668.15(b) (3) and (4) and recommended that it be removed from the 
administrative capability requirements. 



Discussion: 

The one commenter apparently believes that 
liabilities are established at the time an audit report is 
issued. Contrary to the commenter's perception, institutions are 
provided with the opportunity to respond to an issued audit 
report before liabilities are established. However, once the 
audit report and institutional response have been reviewed and a 
final program determination letter establishing liabilities has 
been issued, an institution must either repay the liabilities or 
make satisfactory arrangements to repay. Responding to audit 
reports, making any necessary corrections to institutional 
procedures, and making satisfactory arrangements for the 
repayment of any liabilities established are all fundamental 
responsibilities of participating institutions. However, the 
Secretary agrees that these responsibilities are adequately 
enumerated in the general standards of financial responsibility 
in  668.15(b). 



Changes: 

Proposed  668.16(o) is removed from these regulations. 



Comments: 

The majority of commenters asserted that the proposed 
requirement that an institution show no evidence of significant 
problems identified in reviews of the institution was overly 
broad and imprecise, giving the Secretary unlimited authority to 
deny certification because of evidence of problems in a wide 
variety of areas. They recommended that the proposed regulation 
be rewritten to limit the scope. Many of these commenters were 
concerned that institutions would be penalized even if there were 
a problem unrelated to Title IV, HEA programs matters. One 
example given was that of a university hospital that was found in 
violation of Medicare reimbursement rules. Some commenters were 
concerned that the Secretary would deny certification based on an 
audit finding or other citation that had not yet been reviewed 
and upheld in a final audit determination or similar action. 
They urged that only serious findings upheld in final audit or 
program review determinations or legal proceedings be considered. 

Many commenters expressed concern that the Secretary would 
deny certification to an institution on the basis of a SPRE 
review, even if the SPRE itself thought the institution should 
still receive student aid. Two commenters argued that the 
regulation, as proposed, would affect the institutions involved 
in the Department of Justice investigation of the Overlap Group, 
though they have signed a consent decree. One commenter 
recommended that the provision be removed.

Discussion: 

The proposed regulation was intended to allow the Secretary to consider evidence of problems in administering Title
IV, HEA programs, as documented not only in reports and determinations issued by the Secretary but by other agencies,
identified in proposed  668.16(p)(1), in determining of administrative capability. The Secretary understands
the commenters' concern that this was not clearly stated in the proposed regulation and agrees to clarify that the
Secretary intends to take into account evidence of significant problems that have a bearing on the administration
of the Title IV, HEA programs.
As stated in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the Secretary plans to use problems identified in final reports and determinations
in evaluating an institution's administrative capability. However, the Secretary cannot accede to commenters'
urging that only findings for which institutions have exhausted all appeal procedures be considered. If, for example,
the Office of Inspector General, a guarantee agency, and an institution's accrediting agency all issued final reports
identifying major Title IV, HEA compliance problems, including failure to make appropriate refunds, and a $1 million
liability, it would be unconscionable for the Secretary to fully certify the institution because the institution
had not had time to exhaust the appeal opportunities of the various oversight agencies.


Changes: 

Section 668.16(j) has been amended to specify that the significant problems identified must relate to problems that
affect, as determined by the Secretary, the institution's ability to administer a Title IV, HEA program.


Comments: 

Some commenters supported the proposed requirement that an institution comply with any standards established by
the State in which the institution is located or, if no such standards exist, standards developed by the Secretary
regarding completion rates, placements rates and pass rates on required State examinations. Many other commenters
requested that the Secretary either clarify in final regulations that institutions would be expected to comply with
SPRE standards or explain what other State standards should be adhered to. Most of these commenters also asked the
Secretary to clarify what Federal standards institutions would be expected to comply with if there were no State standards.
The majority of commenters were opposed to the proposed regulation and recommended that it be removed from the final
regulations. Most of these commenters argued that assessment of completion, placement, and licensure pass rates
is within the purview of accrediting agencies and States. Some of these commenters stated that review of such rates,
as proposed, has no bearing on the capability of an institution to administer Title IV, HEA programs. Many commenters
asserted that if the Secretary were to promulgate this regulation, the Secretary would violate the Department of
Education Organization Act as implementation of the regulation would involve the Secretary in assessing the effectiveness
of an institution's academic programs.


Discussion: 

The Secretary notes that in commenting on other sections, such as proposed  668.16(s), which deals with default
rates, commenters urged the Secretary to pay more attention to results indicators, such as completion rates, placement
rates, and the pass rate on State licensure examinations, and give relatively less credence to input indicators.
Further, both the HEA and the Student Right-to-Know Act prescribe the development and use of completion and placement
rates under certain circumstances. Nevertheless, the Secretary believes that at this juncture, it is important
for the SPREs to develop standards in these areas without reference to the establishment of standards by the Secretary.


Changes: 

Proposed  668.16(r) has been removed from these final regulations.



Comments: 

Many commenters argued that the proposal to use a one-year Federal Stafford Loan and Federal SLS programs default
rate of 20 percent as a criterion of administrative capability went beyond the statute and Congressional intent.
Other commenters asserted that use of a single year's default rate would be unfair to institutions with small numbers
of students, and institutions with graduates who default in unusually high numbers in any given year, and recommended
use of two or three consecutive year figures to obtain a more accurate picture of an institution's loan program experience.
Another group of commenters was concerned that use of 20 percent, rather than 25 percent, as a criterion was inconsistent
not only with the statute, but at variance with other provisions for addressing defaults under the Federal Stafford
Loan and Federal SLS programs. Of those individuals and organizations that expressed concern with the use of a one-year,
20 percent figure, many recommended using 25 percent and three years of default rate data instead.
A large number of commenters stated that an institution's default rates are not indicative of an institution's administrative
capability. A majority of these commenters expressed their belief that default rates are more reflective of the characteristics
of the student body served by the institution than of the institution's administrative capability and recommended
that, at the least, the final regulations provide an exemption for institutions that serve a large number of low-income
students. Other commenters argued that default rates are influenced by many factors beyond the control of institutions,
including: erroneous data, errors in calculating rates, collection practices of lenders, inadequate servicing,
regional differences, and borrowers' failure to accept responsibility. Some commenters recommended that the ratio
of borrowers to total student enrollment be taken into consideration. A few others expressed concern that there are
delays in resolution of challenges to default rates and wanted to have it clear that only final default rates would
be used.
A few commenters acknowledged that default rates may be one indication of lack of administrative capability, but
argued that many other factors can and do affect administrative capability.

Some suggested that it would be more appropriate for the Secretary to rely on information such as an institution's
withdrawal, completion or placement rates and pass rates on external testing and certification, in combination
with the default rate, rather than to rely on the default rate alone. Another commenter recommended assessing an institution's
default management activities in conjunction with its default rate.
A number of commenters expressed concern that many poor students would be discriminated against if default rates
were used as an administrative capability criterion. Some commenters noted the default rate exceptions for tribally
controlled community colleges, historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), and Navajo community colleges
and questioned why institutions other than these that serve just as many poor students should be considered poorly
operated institutions as a result of a high default rate.


Discussion: 

The Secretary would like to point out that the use of default rates as a determining factor in the evaluation of an institution's
administrative capability is not new. Although some commenters perceived the proposed use of a 20 percent default
rate to be at variance with current default practices, it should be noted that the Secretary proposed use of a 20 percent
rate because that rate is currently considered as an indicator of impaired administrative capability. Furthermore,
institutions with default rates of 20 percent or more are currently required to submit default management plans.
However the Secretary also sees merit in using 25 percent as the criterion for addressing defaults under the FFEL programs,
as an institution that has a 25 percent rate for three consecutive years is subject to termination from the FFEL programs
and it is therefore consistent for the Secretary to thus provisionally certify or otherwise limit such an institution's
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. Acceptance of a three year time period would also address the concern
of commenters that a one-year rate may not be an accurate indicator of an institution's administrative capability.
Although the Secretary does not agree with those commenters who assert that default rates are not indicative of administrative
capability, as stated in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the Secretary does agree that approval of an institution to participate,
or to continue participation in, Title IV, HEA programs should not rest solely on the institution's having a default
rate below 25 percent. Therefore, if the Secretary identifies no other serious administrative capability problems
that would warrant denying participation approval to an institution with a default rate of 25 percent or more, the
Secretary intends to provisionally certify the institution. As discussed above, the limitations on full certification
will include, at minimum, the prohibition on participation in the FFEL programs.
The Secretary acknowledges that tribally controlled colleges, HBCUs, and Navajo community colleges have been treated
differently, but notes that exceptions to default provisions for these institutions were mandated by Congress.
The Secretary notes that the exception for these institutions will be extended to apply to this provision.


Changes: 

The Secretary accepts commenters views that it is more logical to use a 25 percent default rate over a three year period
and has amended  668.16(m) of these final regulations accordingly. The Secretary has amended  668.17(c)(6)
to specify that this standard will not apply to tribally controlled colleges HBCUs, and Navajo community colleges.


Comments: 

Several commenters contended that the cohort default rate used to determine an institution's administrative capability
should be the same for the Federal Perkins Loan Program as it is for the Federal Stafford Loan and Federal SLS programs.
Two commenters contended that the cohort default rate should be set at 30 percent for the Federal Perkins Loan Program
to be consistent with implementation of the new cohort default rate calculation for the Federal Perkins Loan Program.
One commenter suggested that there be a ``phase-in'' of this requirement to allow institutions the opportunity to
meet the lower default rate. Two commenters recommended that the Secretary provide for an appeal procedure for Federal
Perkins Loan default rates.


Discussion: 

Different cohort default rates apply to determining administrative capability with respect to the Federal Perkins
Loan Program than apply to the Federal Stafford Loan and Federal SLS programs to conform to different standards for
participation in those programs and different sanctions applied for exceeding the rates in those programs.


Changes: 

None.


Comments: 

In response to the Secretary's request for comment on the development of an appropriate default rate for the FDSL Program,
one commenter contended that the rate should be no lower than the cohort default rate for the Federal Stafford Loan
and Federal SLS programs. The commenter believed that if a student does not meet his or her repayment arrangements,
the student should be placed in default. A few commenters believed that a student who is using income contingent repayment
should not be considered in default and should not be removed from the cohort used to determine an institution's default
rate.


Discussion: 

The Secretary is exploring the use of an appropriate default rate for the FDSL Program through the negotiated rulemaking
process. A default rate for the FDSL Program will not be used for the evaluation of an institution's administrative
capability at this time.


Changes: 

None.


Comments: 

The Secretary received over eighty comments on the use and computation of withdrawal rates in the determination of
administrative capability. The majority of commenters had concerns about the calculation of withdrawal rates and
the effect of this standard on institutions serving high-risk populations.
The principal concern with the calculation was that a student who merely completed registration procedures but never
showed up for classes would be treated as a withdrawal. The commenters believed that this would result in artificially
high withdrawal rates. One commenter stated that it is not unusual to have 20 percent of the enrolled students never
start classes. These commenters recommended that only students who actually begin classes be counted. Several other
commenters urged that the calculation of withdrawal rate take into consideration the institution's refund policy.
One of these commenters said that the State of California requires a complete refund of the registration fee up to one
week after classes begin, allowing for a ``no obligation'' look. Another commenter stated that, at another institution,
students are allowed a three week ``look-see'' period during which to make sure the students are satisfied with the
training they are receiving and to allow institution personnel to make sure the student is motivated and capable of
benefiting from the training.
Many commenters expressed concern that withdrawal rates may be more indicative of the type of students being served
rather than of an institution's administrative capability. Some of these commenters asserted that use of a 33 percent
withdrawal rate as an absolute standard would result in discrimination against high-risk minority students, reducing
opportunities available to them. Commenters also asserted that this standard would adversely affect community
colleges that enroll a significantly large number of adult, nontraditional students, many of whom exit and return
to the institution several times during their academic careers, or transfer to other institutions. Another commenter
noted that institutions located near military bases, where transfers of personnel are routine, could experience
high withdrawals of students. One commenter noted that some institutions serve vocational rehabilitation and JTPA
students who are impaired to some degree, and as a result, often drop out of the programs in which they were enrolled.
Most of these commenters recommended that there be some appeal provision or mitigating circumstances exemption.
One commenter said that in addition to the student population served, withdrawal rates were a function of overall
institutional performance and the support services that are provided to students. Two commenters asked how institutions
should determine which students will succeed and which will fail.
Some commenters recommended that a rate other than 33 percent be used as an administrative standard. Many commenters
noted that the proposed 33 percent rate was a stricter standard than that used by JTPA or any State, but made no mention
of what rates States are using. One commenter suggested that if there were any withdrawal rate standard, it should
be set at 40 percent, not 33 percent, as that rate would be consistent with JTPA standards. Other commenters said withdrawal
rates would be fair only if they were based on national averages, comparing similar programs in like-type institutions
or a study of some sort. Yet another commenter said there should be State-established withdrawal rates.

Some commenters argued that withdrawal rates are an academic 
matter and should not be subject to Federal regulation. Other 
commenters questioned the basis for the standard. Some stated 
their belief that an institution's withdrawal rate has nothing to 
do with the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. A few 
commenters said review of withdrawal rates fell within the 
purview of accrediting agencies; others asserted it was no longer 
necessary for the Secretary to review withdrawal rates as the 
SPREs and accrediting agencies will have specific criteria 
relating to completion and placement rates. Others simply said 
they could see no basis for using 33 percent as a standard. 

Quite a few commenters supported the use of withdrawal rates 
in assessing administrative capability, albeit as an indicator 
rather than an absolute. One of the commenters believed the 
language in current regulations was sufficient to allow the 
Secretary to make administrative capability determinations. One 
commenter supported the proposed regulation, as written. Others 
had no problem with the use of a 33 percent rate as an absolute, 
provided that students who register, but never show up, are not 
included in the calculation. One other commenter said the 
proposed rate was too high. 


Discussion: 

For many years, the administrative capability 
regulations have provided for the use of withdrawal rates in 
excess of 33 percent as an indicator of impaired administrative 
capability. The Secretary notes, therefore, that the use of 
withdrawal rates as a determining factor in the evaluation of an 
institution's administrative capability is not new. 
The Secretary does not accept the argument of some 
commenters that withdrawal rates are not an appropriate measure 
of administrative capability. On the contrary, the Secretary 
finds that withdrawal rates are a clear measure of administrative 
capability as they are a function of overall institutional 
performance and the information and support services that an 
institution provides to its students and prospective students. 
The Secretary expects that an institution that has good 
admissions procedures and administers the ability-to-benefit 
provisions properly will have a lower withdrawal rate than one 
which admits students who cannot benefit from the program either 
because they lack the academic ability or do not receive adequate 
support services. An institution that provides proper 
disclosures, such as the institutional and financial assistance 
information required to be provided to students and prospective 
students under subpart D of these regulations, and in the case of 
an institution that advertises job placement rates as a means of 
attracting students, data concerning graduation and employment, 
and applicable State licensing requirements, as required in the 
program participation agreement in  668.14(b)(10), will be 
providing information necessary for prospective students to make 
informed decisions. The Secretary believes that if prospective 
students receive adequate and accurate information, they will not 
drop out of an institution in great numbers. Further, if an 
institution provides the financial aid counseling required in 
 668.16(h), the Secretary expects that students are not likely to 
withdraw because of a lack of understanding about the financial 
resources available to them. 
In sum, an institution that provides students with 
comprehensive, accurate information on the institution and its 
programs, thereby enabling prospective students to make informed 
decisions about applying to the institution, screens students 
adequately from the outset to determine that the student can 
benefit from the program selected, and provides adequate 
counseling to students who apply for Title IV, HEA program 
assistance is expected to have a withdrawal rate below 33 
percent. 
The Secretary notes further that students who withdraw may 
be eligible for a refund, especially now that more stringent 
refund policies have been set forth in these regulations at 
 668.22. Were an institution to have a high withdrawal rate, it 
follows that an institution might experience difficulty complying 
with the refund requirement. By questioning the administrative 
capability of an institution with a high withdrawal rate, the 
Secretary can monitor compliance with the refund requirement. 
The Secretary also believes withdrawal rates are related to 
default rates in the FFEL and Federal Perkins loan programs in 
that students who withdraw are more likely to default. By 
dealing with institutions that have high withdrawal rates, the 
Secretary hopes to reduce dollars lost due to default in the 
future. 
The Secretary agrees that the withdrawal rate calculation 
should not include students that complete registration procedures 
but never begin classes. Similarly, the Secretary agrees that a 
student who receives a 100 percent refund (less any allowable 
administrative fee) should not be counted for the purposes of 
this calculation. 
The Secretary agrees with the commenter who wrote that 
withdrawal rates are a function of overall institutional 
performance and the support services that are provided to 
students. The Secretary believes that transfer students, high- 
risk students, and students who withdraw for other reasons are 
accounted for by allowing up to 33 percent of the students to 
withdraw from the institution. 


Changes: 

This provision is amended in  668.16(l) to provide for 
use of net enrollment figures, after deduction of students who 
were entitled to a 100 percent refund. 


Comments: 

Several commenters objected to this proposed 
requirement that an institution must not otherwise appear to lack 
the ability to administer the Title IV, HEA programs competently 
on the grounds that it is redundant and too open-ended. They 
recommended that it be removed. 


Discussion: 

This paragraph contains language that is in current 
regulations. Obviously, should the Secretary find it necessary 
to invoke this paragraph in support of an action, the Secretary 
would provide the affected institution with detailed information 
that supports the determination that the institution lacks the 
ability to administer the Title IV, HEA programs competently. 


Changes: 

None. 


Section 668.17 Default Reduction Measures





Default rates. Comments: 

A number of commenters suggested that any institution 
with a cohort default rate above 20 percent should be allowed to 
appeal its cohort default rate because that is the minimum 
standard for punitive action against an institution. 


Discussion: 

There are varying types of appeals offered to 
institutions depending on their cohort default rates. An 
institution which has default rates above the thresholds for 
participation in the FFEL programs may appeal on the grounds 
that: (1) The calculation of the rate was erroneous; (2) it 
satisfies the criteria for exceptional mitigating circumstances; 
or (3) the calculation included loans which due to improper 
servicing or collection resulted in an inaccurate or incomplete 
calculation of the cohort default rate. Institutions with cohort 
defaults above 20 percent for the most recent year may challenge 
the calculation of the rate based on allegations of improper loan 
servicing. In addition, an institution which receives 
provisional certification based on a default rate above 25 
percent over a three year period also can show that it meets the 
criteria for exceptional mitigating circumstances and should 
receive full certification under the appropriate regulatory 
standards. For further information on this provision, see the 
section of the 

Analysis of Comments and Changes 

that addresses 
standards of administrative capability ( 668.16). Thus, 
institutions with rates above 20 percent have a significant 
opportunity to challenge their cohort default rate. 


Changes: 

None.

Default management plan. Comments: 

Some commenters asked the Secretary to reconsider the requirement that all institutions with cohort default rates
greater than 20 percent implement a default management plan that 
includes the default reduction measures listed in appendix D to 
the regulations. The commenters asked the Secretary to allow 
institutions to request approval for alternative plans. 


Discussion: 

The commenters misread the regulations. Section 
668.17(b)(1) requires institutions with cohort default rates over 
20 percent but less than or equal to 40 percent to submit and 
implement a default management plan that implements the measures 
described in appendix D, but allows the institution to submit an 
alternative plan for the Secretary's consideration. Institutions 
with cohort default rates above 40 percent must implement the 
measures listed in appendix D. The Secretary believes that these 
latter institutions obviously have failed to otherwise reduce 
their default rates and that their future efforts need to meet 
certain standards. 


Changes: 

None. 


End of participation. Comments: 

One commenter asked the Secretary to shorten the 
guaranty agencies time frame for responding to institutional 
requests for confirmation of default rate information. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that the regulations must 
allow the guaranty agencies' sufficient time to check their 
records in response to questions raised by schools. The 
Secretary does not agree that it would be appropriate to shorten 
the time frame. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments: 

A number of commenters objected to the Secretary's 
proposal to change the effective date of the institution's loss 
of participation under  668.17(c)(3) to the date the institution 
receives notice of the Secretary's determination that its default 
rates exceed the statutory levels. 


Discussion: 

Previous regulations allow an institution with 
excessive cohort default rates to continue to participate until 
eight calendar days after the institution receives the 
Secretary's notification. The Secretary has determined that it 
is inappropriate to allow an institution that has high default 
rates above the statutory limits eight additional days to entice 
students to enroll and receive loans under the FFEL programs. An 
institution which files a timely appeal remains eligible to 
participate during the appeal process. However, there is no 
reason to allow an institution that does not appeal additional 
time to participate in the program. 


Changes: 

None. 


Comments: 

Some commenters asked the Secretary to clarify the 
status of FFEL programs loan proceeds which are disbursed after 
the institution learns that it is no longer eligible to 
participate in the FFEL programs under  668.17, but before the 
lenders or guaranty agencies learn of the loss of participation. 
These commenters also urged the Secretary to provide simultaneous 
notice of the loss of participation to guaranty agencies, lenders 
and other agencies. 


Discussion: 

The rules governing the disbursement of funds after 
an institution's loss of participation are set forth in detail in 
 668.26 of the regulations. The Secretary already provides 
notice of actions against high default rate institutions to 
guaranty agencies simultaneously with or very soon after 
notification is sent to the institution. The Secretary will also 
provide appropriate notification to other interested parties. 


Changes: 

None. 


Comments: 

One commenter suggested that if the Secretary 
initiates a limitation, suspension or termination action based on 
an institution's default rate, the Secretary should notify the 
appropriate SPRE and the institution's accrediting agency. 


Discussion: 

Section 494C(h)(2) of the HEA requires the Secretary 
to notify a SPRE of any limitation, suspension, termination, 
emergency action, or other action that the Department takes 
against an institution. In the regulations governing the 
designation of nationally recognized accrediting agencies, the 
Secretary is including a similar provision. 


Changes: 

None. 


Appeal procedures. Comments: 

Some commenters asked how the Secretary planned to 
implement the amendments to sections 435(a) and 435(m) of the 
HEA, which allow certain institutions with high cohort default 
rates to review certain loan servicing records and appeal the 
calculation of that rate based on allegations of improper loan 
servicing. 


Discussion: 

As noted by the commenters, sections 435(a)(3) and 
435(m)(1)(B) of the HEA were changed by the Technical Amendments 
of 1993. Under the amended law, institutions that are subject to 
the loss of eligibility under the FFEL programs under section 
435(a)(2)(A) of the HEA, subject to loss of eligibility for the 
Federal SLS Program under section 428A(a)(2), or whose cohort 
default rate for the most recent year for which rates have been 
calculated equals or exceeds 20 percent may include in their 
appeal of such rate a defense based on allegations of improper 
loan servicing. The Technical Amendments of 1993 also provide 
that these institutions will have an opportunity to review 
certain loan servicing and collection records maintained by the 
guaranty agencies. The Secretary published a Request for 
Comments in the 

Federal Register

 on March 22, 1994 (59 FR 13606) 
and is reviewing the comments issued in response to that notice. 
The Secretary intends to issue separate regulations to implement 
these provisions shortly. 


Changes: 

None. 


Comments: 

Some commenters complained that the time deadlines for 
cohort default rate appeals are too restrictive and do not 
provide enough time to prepare an appeal. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that the regulations provide 
adequate time for an institution to prepare and submit an appeal 
of the calculation of the cohort default rate. The Secretary 
notes that Congress has enacted strict time limits on the 
institution's appeal of its cohort default rates under section 
435(a) of the HEA and the Secretary's regulations reflect these 
requirements. 


Changes: 

None. 


Comments: 

Many commenters argued that the standards for an 
appeal of the loss of participation in the FFEL programs based on 
exceptional mitigating circumstances in  668.17(d) are too tough. 
The commenters suggested that the completion and placement rate 
requirements should be reduced or that the standards should 
consider the population or community served by the institution. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary notes that section 435(a)(2)(ii) of 
the HEA allows an institution to avoid the loss of participation 
in the FFEL programs if it shows that exceptional mitigating 
circumstances exist. The current regulations are tough but are 
also consistent with this statutory requirement. The HEA clearly 
establishes a presumption that an institution with excessive 
cohort default rates above the statutory levels is not serving 
its students and that its continued participation in the FFEL 
programs is not in the public interest. It is appropriate that 
an institution must meet tough standards to overcome this 
presumption. The Secretary notes that most of the commenters did 
not provide any basis for changing the standard or adopting other 
standards. Therefore, the Secretary will not make any changes to 
those requirements. The Secretary will, however, continue to 
evaluate the exceptional mitigating circumstances standards in 
the regulations and determine whether future changes are 
appropriate. 


Changes: 

None. 


Comments: 

Some commenters asked the Secretary to change the 
proposal that would limit the evidence institutions could use to 
show that they serve students with a disadvantaged economic 
background. The Secretary had proposed to limit institutions to 
showing that the students' qualified for an expected family 
contribution of zero.

Discussion:

 The Secretary has found that an excepted family contribution of zero is an appropriate standard for showing that an
institution serves students with a disadvantaged economic background. Therefore, no change will be made.



Changes:

 None.



Comments:

 One commenter suggested that institutions which ask guaranty agencies to verify data should be required to list the
guaranty date and type of loan as well as the information required by  668.17(d)(7). Another commenter suggested
that the institution should request the information from the Secretary rather than from the guaranty agencies.



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that the guaranty agency will be able to identify the loans in question with the name and social
security of the borrowers involved and that it is unnecessary to provide the guaranty date and loan type. The Secretary
notes that only Federal Stafford and Federal SLS loans are currently included in the calculation of the cohort default
rate. The Secretary also believes that it is appropriate for requests for confirmation of errors to be sent to the guaranty
agency rather than the Secretary. The guaranty agencies have the data which the institution is challenging.



Changes:

 None.



Comments:

 One commenter argued that the Secretary should have a time deadline for issuing decisions on appeals of cohort default
rates filed by institutions and that the institution should win the appeal if the decision is not issued on time. Another
commenter suggested that the institution should not be subject to a sanction if a new reduced cohort default rate is
issued for the institution during the appeal process.



Discussion:

 The Secretary is committed to issuing decisions on appeals from institutions within a reasonable time. Many of the
changes made to these regulations will contribute to this effort. However, the Secretary does not believe that it
is appropriate to allow an institution to avoid responsibility for its default rate because a decision is not issued
within a specified time. The Secretary also does not believe that an institution should automatically be able to escape
responsibility for its high default rate one year by delaying the completion of its appeal until the next year's lower
rate is released.



Changes:

 None.



Comments:

 One commenter asked the Secretary to allow institutions to submit cohort default rate appeals by facsimile rather
than by mail.



Discussion:

 The Secretary has found that cohort default rate appeals frequently involve numerous documents involving detailed
listings of information. Facsimile transmission may well result in blurred documents. In these circumstances,
the Secretary will continue to require appeals to be submitted by mail.



Changes:

 None. 


Definitions. Comments:

 Some commenters noted that the Secretary proposed to eliminate the provision of the regulations that required that,
in calculating the cohort default rates, the Secretary would exclude any loans which, due to improper servicing or
collection would result in an inaccurate calculation of the cohort default rate. The commenters objected to this
change on the grounds that they believe that this change is contrary to Congressional intent in enacting the new law.



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that it is clear that Congress intended to limit the issue of allegations of improper loan servicing
in regard to cohort default rates to appeals from the calculation of such rates. The Secretary notes that the Technical
Amendments of 1993 changed the language of sections 435(a) and 435(m)(1)(B) of the HEA to limit consideration of improper
loan servicing allegations to appeals. Prior to the amendments, the HEA stated that improper servicing would be considered
in calculating the cohort default rate. The Technical Amendments of 1993 eliminated this language and added a new
subsection 435(a)(3) to specifically allow certain schools with high default rates to appeal those rates based on
allegations of improper loan servicing. There is no support for the commenters claim that Congress intended the Secretary
to consider allegations of improper loan servicing before rates are calculated and during the appeal process.



Changes:

 None.



Comments:

 Some commenters urged the Secretary to require guaranty agencies to allow institutions to review the default rate
data prior to submittal of the data to the Secretary and to work with the institutions to ensure correction of the data
before the Secretary publishes the list of institutional cohort default rates. Some commenters argued that publication
of rates without such a process violated due process.



Discussion:

 The Secretary notes that a recent decision of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, 

Career College Association 

v. 

U.S. Department of Education, 

C.A. No. 92-1345-LFO (March 22, 1994) rejected the claim that pre-publication review of cohort default
rate information was required. However, the Technical Amendments of 1993 amended the HEA to provide institutions
an opportunity to review and correct errors in the information provided by the guaranty agency to the Secretary for
calculating cohort default rates. This amendment is not effective until October 1, 1994 and the Department intends
to issue regulations to provide this opportunity shortly.



Changes:

 None.



Comments:

 Some commenters argued that a whole new structure for cohort default rates should be developed. According to these
commenters, there are significant errors in the cohort default rate information and the courts have found that the
Secretary's calculation of such rates is improper. Some commenters said that the Secretary should make every effort
to ensure that default rate information is accurate.

Discussion:

 The Secretary has taken and will continue to take appropriate actions to ensure that guaranty agencies provide correct
information for use in calculating cohort default rates. The Secretary has found that, during the appeal process,
institutions have not generally proven significant errors in the calculation of their cohort default rates. Thus,
the Secretary rejects the commenters' claim that the cohort default rate information is inaccurate. Moreover, the
Secretary does not agree that the courts have reached this conclusion. The commenters are referring to certain preliminary
decisions reached by courts relying on the allegations raised by individual schools. The Secretary strongly objects
to the suggestion that the cohort default rate information is inaccurate. The Secretary also does not believe that
the commenters have shown any facts that support creation of a new appeal structure. However, the Secretary believes
that the changes made by the Technical Amendments of 1993 may resolve some of the commenters' concerns.



Changes:

 None.



Comments:

 One commenter asked why a loan is still counted as in default for purposes of the cohort default rate if the institution
pays off the loan.



Discussion:

 The Secretary does not believe that an institution should be allowed to buy its way out of the sanctions related to high
defaults by its students. The law holds institutions responsible for high default rates and wealthy institutions
should not be able to avoid their responsibility for these high rates by paying off loans.



Changes:

 None.



Comments:

 One commenter suggested that Federal PLUS loans should be included in the calculation of the cohort default rate.



Discussion:

 The definition of ``cohort default rate'' is in section 435(m) of the HEA and includes only Federal Stafford Loans
(both subsidized and unsubsidized), Federal SLS loans and Federal Consolidation Loans which are used to repay Federal
Stafford and SLS loans.



Changes:

 None.



Section 668.22 Institutional Refunds and Repayments.





General. Comments:

 Three commenters believed the specific 

pro rata

 refund requirements should not be limited solely to first-time students who received Title IV, HEA program assistance.



Discussion:

 The Secretary does not intend to extend this requirement beyond the scope of the statute; however, an institution
would not be prohibited from extending the 

pro rata

 refund requirements to other students.



Changes:

 None.



Comments:

 A few commenters contended that cost substantiation is unduly burdensome. The commenters maintained that costs
differ greatly between programs, that indirect expenses such as storage, maintenance, packaging, and shipping
would be difficult to justify, and that cost per student would be difficult to calculate if supplies were bought in
bulk. The commenters argued that for large schools with many programs, the costs would change too frequently to accurately
report and many costs are determined by student choice. The commenters stated that only estimates of costs are possible.
These commenters believed that this provision should apply only to institutions with compliance problems. Two commenters
contended that the free market will determine what costs are reasonable and this provision is beyond the Secretary's
authority. Two commenters believed that this provision should be moved to  668.44 (student consumer information).
Two commenters fully supported the Secretary's proposal, citing firsthand experience with institutions that attempt
to circumvent refund policies by inflating supply costs. One commenter recommended that the Secretary limit this
provision to the substantiation of only books and supplies that are required and that are institutional charges.
One commenter recommended that the provision be limited to requiring institutions to substantiate only the cost
of items that the institution supplies, not of those provided by a third-party organization. One commenter asserted
that accrediting agencies should monitor these costs.



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that cost substantiation is appropriate if the institution wishes to exclude such costs from
the refund calculation. As noted by some commenters, the free market has not worked to contain costs charged to students
for supplies because the students have little, if any, discretion on the supplies that they are required to purchase
for most programs. Furthermore, based upon the Department's experience, some institutions have historically inflated
charges for supplies that students were required to purchase. This predatory pricing for supplies has, in turn, inflated
costs borne by the Title IV, HEA programs and reduced or eliminated refunds that would otherwise have been owed to the
Title IV, HEA programs for students who withdrew. The treatment of supply charges under these regulations will help
curb this abuse without significantly changing the supply charges that can be excluded from the refund calculation
by institutions that fairly price supplies to their students.

As a result of limiting the required cost substantiation to student charges for supplies sold by the institution or
by an affiliated or related entity, the institution is responsible for documenting the costs where a business relationship
exists between the seller and the institution. Furthermore, even if an institution purchases supplies in bulk and
takes advantage of purchasing discounts that cause the costs for such supplies to fluctuate over time, the Secretary
does not believe that it is unduly burdensome to require the institution to document its per-unit cost for the supplies
before it may exclude that amount from the refund calculation. Furthermore, the Secretary does not believe it is appropriate
for the institution to increase the documented supply costs by allocating any portion of the institution's fixed
charges to such calculation. Any such cost recovery for institutional overhead would make the calculation overly
complex, difficult to monitor, and more subject to abuse by some institutions. The procedures under the regulations
permit the institution to recover the actual cost of such supplies, but are not intended to recapture any additional
charges allocable to such items.

The Secretary also believes that the Department is the primary member of the triad that is responsible for monitoring
an institution's ability to comply with the requirements for prompt and accurate refund payments. Although an institution's
accrediting body or cognizant SPRE will have concerns about certain aspects of an institution's adoption and implementation
of its refund policy, HEA has given the Department the primary responsibility for establishing the requirements
for the timing, calculation and procedures for paying refunds to the Title IV, HEA programs.



Changes:

 None.



Comments:

 Six commenters supported the requirement for fair and equitable refunds, but suggested that to be truly equitable,
the requirement should be in force for all students, not just those who receive Title IV, HEA program assistance. Two
commenters supported the Secretary's proposal to limit these refund requirements to affect only recipients of Title
IV, HEA program assistance. Two commenters suggested refund requirements should differ among students based on
the reason for the student's withdrawal. The commenters believed students who officially withdraw for ``legitimate''
reasons, such as medical leave or a family emergency, deserve the benefit of a liberal refund policy. The commenters
believed, however, that students who withdraw without notification or whose reasons for withdrawal are ``irresponsible
or immature'' should be subject to a more stringent, less beneficial refund policy.



Discussion:

 As discussed in the preamble of the February 28, 1994 NPRM, several negotiators asserted that applying the refund
requirements to all students would be too costly for institutions. The Secretary acknowledges that having different
refund policies for students who received Title IV, HEA program assistance could be perceived as inequitable. However,
no institution is prohibited from adopting these refund requirements for all its students. The Secretary believes
Congress clearly intended to treat groups of students in a like manner with regard to refunds, regardless of an individual
student's reason for withdrawal. The Secretary believes a refund policy requiring the assessment of a student's
valid cause for withdrawal would be difficult to regulate and implement, and would require extensive professional
judgment on the part of the institution, thereby excessively increasing the institution's burden.



Changes:

 None.

Comments: 

Six commenters stated that the requirement that an 
institution provide examples of an institution's refund policy to 
prospective students is burdensome and unnecessary. The 
commenters asserted that most students would not understand such 
examples and that the examples would inevitably be misleading 
because the many variables that might apply to a real student's 
withdrawal situation would not be represented. Three commenters 
shared the Secretary's view that prospective and current students 
should receive a written statement containing an institution's 
refund policy, but one commenter believed providing such a 
statement would be burdensome and costly for institutions. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that current and prospective 
students have the right to be informed in writing of an 
institution's refund policies and practices, and that the costs 
of providing such information are part of the normal costs of 
doing business. A particular student's ability to completely 
comprehend such information does not impact that student's right 
to receive the information. Further, the Secretary would expect 
that, in accordance with 34 CFR 668.45(a), an institution would 
have designated an employee or group of employees who must be 
available on a full-time basis to assist students or prospective 
students with any questions they might have in this area. The 
Secretary wishes to clarify that, as discussed in the February 
28, 1994 NPRM, the requirement to provide examples would be met 
if the institution informs students in the written refund policy 
that examples are available and the institution makes the 
examples readily available to current and prospective students on 
request. The Secretary does not believe refund examples must 
include all possible variables to be useful to students. An 
institution is expected to provide reasonable examples of common 
refund situations applicable to its average student population. 



Changes: 

Section 668.22(a)(2) has been amended to clarify that 
the institution must make available to students, upon request, 
examples of the application of the refund policy and inform 
students of the availability of these examples in the written 
statement. 



Fair and equitable refund policy. Comments: 

Many commenters believed the requirement for a fair 
and equitable refund, as interpreted in the February 28, 1994 
NPRM, is needlessly complex, is intrusive upon the rights of 
institutions to determine policy, and extends beyond the intent 
of the law. The commenters believed institutions should not be 
forced to calculate up to three separate refund amounts for each 
withdrawing student, as this would be burdensome and confusing 
both to institution employees and to students, resulting in 
withdrawing students inevitably receiving incorrect information. 
The commenters asserted that an institution should be allowed to 
determine which calculation generally provides the most 
beneficial refund to its average student body population and use 
that calculation consistently for Title IV, HEA program refunds. 
Four commenters believed the Secretary should provide certified 
refund calculation software for institutional use, rather than 
unfairly expecting institutions to create or purchase from a 
private source software that is potentially erroneous. Two 
commenters requested the Secretary commit to providing clear 
notice of revisions and changes to the refund requirements, to 
avoid the inevitable widespread confusion and noncompliance that 
will otherwise result if the February 28, 1994 NPRM is published 
as a final rule. One commenter believed it is inappropriate and 
inefficient to require institutions to implement a policy which 
affects such a small number of individuals, and that institutions 
are capable of developing workable refund policies that are fair 
and reasonable. One commenter supported the Secretary's 
interpretation of the statute and believed withdrawing students 
deserve the benefit of the largest refund possible. 



Discussion: 

The Amendments of 1992 define a fair and equitable 
refund policy as one that provides for at least the largest of 
the amounts provided under applicable State law, nationally 
recognized accrediting agency requirements approved by the 
Secretary, or the 

pro rata 

refund calculation for qualifying 
students, as described in the statute. The Secretary asserts 
that the individual calculation of all possible refunds for each 
withdrawing student is the only possible means by which an 
institution can determine which refund calculation provides the 
largest amount, as required by the statute. The Secretary is 
exploring the development by the Department of software for 
institutional use. The Secretary believes the equity to the 
student provided by the law and the proposed rule override the 
commenters' concerns of burden and potential confusion, and will 
continue to provide ample direction and guidance on refunds to 
institutions in the form of examples, Dear Colleague Letters, and 
the 

Federal Student Financial Aid Handbook. 

Changes: 

None. 



Comments: 

Four commenters believed the requirements of Appendix 
A are too cumbersome and should be replaced with a more 
reasonable policy. Three commenters believed the Appendix A 
requirements are intrusive and extend beyond the scope of the 
statute, resulting in excessive burden and cost for institutions. 
The commenters suggested Appendix A should be a guideline for 
problem-free institutions, required only of institutions with 
demonstrated compliance problems. Two commenters suggested all 
institutions should be required to follow the guidelines of 
Appendix A, thereby eliminating all the other detailed and 
stringent refund requirements proposed in the February 28, 1994 
NPRM. Four commenters asserted that institutions have already 
adopted procedures in line with the Appendix A guidance and that 
further intrusion on the part of the Secretary is unnecessary and 
unjustifiable. The commenters believed institutions have the 
ethical means to decide these issues among themselves and should 
be allowed to do so. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary believes the Amendments of 1992 
clearly give every student who receives Title IV, HEA program 
assistance_not just those students who attend institutions with 
compliance problems_the right to a fair and equitable refund as 
defined in the statute. The Secretary is concerned, as discussed 
in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, with instances wherein an 
institution's State and accrediting agency do not have specific 
refund policies and a particular student is not entitled to a 

pro 
rata 

refund. In such a case, a loophole exists and the law 
offers no alternative standard by which to ensure the student 
receives a fair and equitable refund. Consistent with existing 
FFEL programs regulations, the Secretary intends to provide 
Appendix A as an acceptable refund standard in the absence of all 
other standards. 



Changes: 

None. 



Pro rata Refund. 
Comments: 

Many commenters believed the 60 percent point in time 
(for the purposes of the 

pro rata 

refund requirement), when 
measured in clock hours, should be calculated using the hours 
scheduled instead of the proposed use of hours completed by the 
student. Two commenters specifically referred to the statute's 
concept of elapsed time, stating that the treatment proposed in 
the February 28, 1994 NPRM is in conflict with the Secretary's 
earlier guidance and the intent of the law. All of these 
commenters believed the costs of providing education are fixed 
for each day a class is offered, regardless of an individual 
student's attendance. The commenters further suggested the 
Secretary is openly discriminating against clock-hour 
institutions by allowing credit-hour institutions to figure the 
60 percent point in time using weeks, while insisting that clock-hour institutions consider individual students'
rates of 
progress. Two commenters suggested the Secretary allow clock-hour institutions to include excused absences and
repeated hours 
in the total hours completed by a student. One commenter noted 
that the determination of the 60 percent point in time conflicts 
with the determination of the portion of the enrollment period 
that remains for the purposes of calculating a refund after an 
institution has determined that a 

pro rata 

refund must be 
calculated. This commenter believed these two determinations 
should be simple and consistent with one another.

Discussion: 

 In the case of a program measured in clock hours, 
the Secretary believes it is most reasonable to use the number of 
hours completed by the student in determining what percentage of 
the enrollment period has elapsed. To determine the 60 percent 
point by using scheduled hours could unjustifiably punish a 
student whose progress is slower than the average student, and 
could cause a first-time student whose progress is above average 
to be entitled to a 

pro rata

 refund past the point of 60 percent 
completion. The Secretary acknowledges that this and other 
provisions of the Title IV, HEA program rules differentiate 
between institutions based on whether programs are measured in 
clock or credit hours, and based on whether the institutions use 
standard terms. The Secretary believes this differentiation is 
justifiable and necessary, and is due to the Department's 
extensive efforts to take into account the many variables and 
circumstances found in the postsecondary educational community. 
In accordance with past guidance issued by the Department, 
excused absences may be counted when determining hours completed 
by the student if the institution has a written excused absence 
policy allowing for a reasonable number of absences which do not 
need to be made up to complete the program, and if it is 
documented that the hours were actually scheduled and missed by 
the student prior to the student's withdrawal. The Secretary 
acknowledges that, as discussed in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, 
the determination of the 60 percent point in time is 
intentionally different from the determination of the portion of 
the enrollment period that remains. The Secretary does not 
believe consistency between these two determinations is necessary 
or beneficial. 


Changes: 

 None. 


Comments: 

 Four commenters found the proposed definition of 
unpaid charges for 

pro rata

 purposes to be in conflict with the 
statutory definition. Two commenters believed the statute 
adequately defines unpaid charges and it is unnecessary for the 
Secretary to propose a different or expanded definition. One 
commenter supported the Secretary's proposal to define unpaid 
charges for 

pro rata

 purposes as it was defined for general 
refund purposes in the June 8, 1993 final regulations. One 
commenter suggested that the treatment of unpaid charges should 
be the same in all refund situations, instead of the current 
proposal which differentiates between statutory 

pro rata

 refund 
calculations and all other calculations. This commenter believed 
this discriminates against certain groups of students and thus 
fails to treat all students equitably. 


Discussion: 

 The Secretary does not believe the proposed 
definition of unpaid charges is in conflict with the more general 
statutory definition. The Secretary believes it is appropriate 
to make the definition consistent with the regulatory definition 
already in place. The treatment of unpaid charges for the 
purposes of the statutory 

pro rata

 calculation is prescribed in 
the Amendments of 1992. The Secretary has in the past 
sufficiently justified the treatment of unpaid charges for refund 
calculations other than statutory 

pro rata

 refund calculations. 
The commenter has submitted no evidence of discrimination. 


Changes: 

 None. 


Comments: 

 Three commenters support the Secretary's proposal to 
avoid double-counting certain charges (i.e., administrative fees) 
by excluding them from the 

pro rata

 refund calculation instead of 
subtracting them. Three commenters disagreed with the required 
proration of all educational costs, given that some costs 
incurred by the institution are fixed (i.e., teacher salaries, 
dormitory charges, and physical plant costs) and do not decrease 
when a student withdraws. The commenters asserted that 
institutions required to issue 

pro rata

 refunds will lose money, 
and that the students who remain will experience cost increases 
as a result. Four commenters believed an application fee should 
not be subtracted from a 

pro rata

 refund, because it is not 
really an education cost and because a portion of administrative 
costs are already recouped through the 

pro rata

 refund 
calculation. Two commenters asserted there is no statutory 
support for the Secretary's proposal that an administrative fee 
must be a real and documented charge. One commenter suggested 
the Secretary allow all administrative fees to be subtracted from 
the 

pro rata

 refund calculation. Three commenters believed it is 
intrusive and inappropriate for the Secretary to regulate details 
such as irregularly expended meal credits, passed-through room 
charges, and group health insurance fees. The commenters stated 
that such details should be handled in guidelines, not 
requirements, and should ultimately be left to the discretion of 
individual institutions. One commenter suggested that the costs 
of services voluntarily provided by an institution as a courtesy 
to its students should be excluded from the 

pro rata

 refund 
calculation. Two commenters suggested that the Secretary's 
proposed treatment of group health insurance costs should be 
extended to include other insurance, such as the liability and 
medical malpractice insurance required for medical students or 
group health insurance that is not required by the institution. 
One commenter stated that the exclusion allowed for group health 
insurance fees should be extended to all refund calculations, not 
just statutory 

pro rata

 refund calculations.

Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that it is more reasonable to completely exclude certain costs from the 

pro rata

 refund calculation, in effect allowing the institution to fully retain the money paid for those charges, rather than
include the costs and assess them at a prorated percentage, only to then completely subtract them from the refund,
thereby double-counting them. The Secretary wishes to clarify that the proration of educational costs under the


pro rata

 refund calculation is required by the Amendments of 1992 and it is not the purpose or authority of these regulations
to rescind that requirement. The Secretary agrees that an application fee is not an educational cost for Title IV,
HEA program purposes and that it is therefore not relevant in the calculation of a refund. The Secretary does not believe
that Congress intended to allow institutions to retain from a 

pro rata

 refund amount administrative charges that do not actually exist. The 

pro rata

 refund calculation determines what portion of institutional charges paid can be retained by the institution; the
Secretary believes it is unreasonable to allow the retention of a fee that was not in fact charged or paid. The statutory


pro rata

 calculation provides for the maximum amount of administrative costs that may be retained by the institution. The
Secretary believes certain costs (i.e., passed-through room charges, and group health insurance fees) warrant
treatment other than standard proration and has therefore specifically named such costs and proposed they be excluded
from the calculation. The Secretary believes the specific regulation of the treatment of these costs will avoid institutional
abuse of these allowances and ensure greater equity in the payment of refunds. After further consideration, the Secretary
has found the provision treating irregularly expended meal credits to be unnecessarily complex and not entirely
effective in its intended purpose. No commenters offered support for this provision or any alternative suggestions.
This issue will be reexamined in the future and further input from the financial aid community will be sought. The Secretary
recognizes that some institutions may elect to provide certain services, such as voluntary group health insurance,
as a courtesy to students. The Secretary believes it is necessary to exclude from the 

pro rata

 refund calculation mandatory charges for group health insurance to prevent students from an unavoidable loss of
insurance upon withdrawal. This situation could be avoided if the student had the option of purchasing health insurance
from a source other than the institution. The Secretary does not believe the cost of specialized insurance coverage
such as medical malpractice coverage warrants the same treatment as group health insurance costs, primarily because
such specialized insurance is no longer needed by the student after withdrawal. The statute provides that all refunds
other than 

pro rata

 refunds are to be made in accordance with State or accrediting agency standards. To extend the allowable exclusion
for group health insurance fees to all refund calculations would necessitate an amendment to the law. 

Changes:

 Section 668.22(c)(4) has been amended to reflect that certain fees, listed as allowable subtractions in the February
28, 1994 NPRM, are to be excluded entirely from the 

pro rata

 refund calculation. This section has also been amended to delete from that list of fees the reference to an application
fee.



Comments:

 Several commenters believed the cost of equipment, books and supplies should not be prorated, because possession
of an item cannot be ``split'' between the institution and the student. The commenters believed the proposed treatment
of books and supply costs will unjustifiably enable students to keep supplies they had not fully paid for, and will
force institutions to either function as ``pawn shops'' for the return of such items or bear the costs of supplies they
do not own. The commenters believed such a policy will force institutions to raise book and supply costs for students
who remain or to stop providing supplies altogether, to the obvious detriment of continuing students. Two commenters
believed institutions will be forced to instruct students to obtain supplies from independent vendors, resulting
in great consumer risks for the student. One commenter suggested that the refund amount for equipment, book, and supply
costs should be determined by the manufacturer of the individual products and passed on from the institution to the
student accordingly. Several commenters asserted that equipment, books, and supplies become the sole property
of the student when issued, and suggested the institution be allowed to withhold delivery and billing of such items
until they are needed. The commenters also suggested the Secretary allow institutions to retain the full cost of unreturnable
items issued and of returnable items issued that are not returned, and require institutions to refund in full the cost
of any issued items that are returned and of any items that were not issued but for which the student was charged. Several
commenters stated that the return of certain supplies, books, or equipment is unrealistic and burdensome, regardless
of the condition in which it is returned, and that the regulations should therefore not require institutions to accept
returned items. One commenter supported the Secretary's proposed treatment of charges for returned equipment.



Discussion:

 The Amendments of 1992 require all institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs to refund unearned tuition,
fees, room and board, 

and other charges 

to a student who received Title IV, HEA program assistance and failed to complete the period of enrollment for which
the student was charged. The Secretary does not believe Congress intended to exclude the unearned cost of books, supplies,
and equipment from the refund amount. However, the Secretary agrees that institutions should not be expected to refund
to the student a portion of the cost of unreturnable items that were actually issued to the student and kept by the student.
The Secretary wishes to clarify that the proposed requirements governing books, supplies, and equipment will not
force an institution to accept returned merchandise; rather, the proposed provision allows an institution to state
that an item is returnable and to then retain in full the cost of that item if it is not returned, provided the institution
clearly disclosed in the enrollment agreement any restrictions on the return of equipment, including equipment
that is unreturnable and deadlines for returns.



Changes:

 Section 668.22(c)(5) has been amended to allow an institution to exclude from the 

pro rata

 refund calculation the documented cost of any unreturnable equipment, books, and supplies issued to the student,
if the student was informed in the enrollment agreement that the item is unreturnable and may keep the item, or under
what conditions normally returnable equipment is considered to be unreturnable. A corresponding change has been
made to appendix A.



Comments:

 Several commenters asserted that the definition of a first-time student should be limited to a student attending
any postsecondary institution for the first time. Three commenters disagreed with the Secretary's proposal to include
in the first-time student definition any student who previously enrolled at the institution but received a 100 percent
refund of tuition and fees. One commenter asked the Secretary to amend the first-time student definition to include
students who previously enrolled only in continuing education courses that do not lead to a degree. One commenter
requested the Secretary to issue one consistent definition of a first-time student, instead of expecting institutions
to use different definitions for different Department requirements, such as IPEDS, refund calculations, FFEL programs
counseling, and student consumerism.

Discussion:

 The Secretary believes it is the intent of Congress to extend the benefit of a 

pro rata

 refund calculation to all students attending a particular institution for the first time, not just to those students
who are attending any postsecondary institution for the first time. The Secretary also believes that a student who
enrolled at an institution but received a full 100 percent refund has not had sufficient educational experience at
the institution to be considered anything other than a first-time student. The Secretary does not believe the issue
of continuing education coursework poses a serious problem with the definition of a first-time student for the purposes
of the 

pro rata

 refund calculation. The Secretary recognizes that the definition of first-time student is different for certain
purposes in the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs, and will explore the possibility of creating a single,
consistent definition in the future. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comments:

 Three commenters believed the proposed definition of ``the portion of the enrollment period for which the student
was charged that remains'' is not consistent with the statutory definition of an academic year. The commenters asked
the Secretary to include in the proposed definition an explanation of the term ``week'' and describe the appropriate
handling of a student who attends only a portion of a week. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary does not believe consistency with the statutory definition of an academic year is relevant. The Secretary
does not believe further explanation is necessary, and intends to entrust institutions with the responsibility
for fairly and consistently handling uncertain situations such as a partial week of attendance. 



Changes:

 None. 



Period of Enrollment for Which the Student Has Been Charged. Comments:

 Several commenters suggested alternatives to the Secretary's definition of ``period of enrollment for which the
student was charged.'' Three commenters suggested using only the length of the program, for institutions charging
by the program, or the length of the term, for institutions charging by the term. One commenter suggested the Secretary
require all institutions to use the academic year as the enrollment period. Another commenter suggested the Secretary
require all institutions to use the lesser of a payment period, the program length, or the academic year. Three commenters
believed the proposed definition does not address programs longer than an academic year. Several commenters believed
the Secretary's proposed definition is unfair to institutions charging by the program, forcing them to use the cost
of the entire program in the refund calculation, while only a portion of the financial aid awarded for the entire program
can be counted when calculating the unpaid charges. Such a formula results in excessively high unpaid charges, which
must be subtracted from the amount the institution could otherwise retain. The commenters believed this treatment
is discriminatory against institutions that charge by the program and suggested the Secretary retain the concept
of payment periods, both for assessing charges and considering aid disbursed, and limit those payment periods to
one-third an academic year (as in a quarterly term system), or one-half an academic year (as in a semester term system).
Two commenters believed the determination of the enrollment period for refund purposes should be left to the discretion
of the institution. Two commenters asked that clock-hour institutions using standard terms be treated the same as
credit-hour institutions using standard terms. 




Discussion:

 The Secretary believes the proposed definition of ``period of enrollment for which the student was charged'' is adequate
and applicable to the needs and circumstances of the various types of institutions participating in the Title IV,
HEA programs. The Secretary wishes to clarify that the proposed definition establishes a minimum period of enrollment
(to prohibit institutions from creating artificially short periods of enrollment simply for the purposes of reducing
a student's unpaid charges or eligibility for a 

pro rata

 refund calculation) and does not impose a maximum limit to the period of enrollment. The Secretary recognizes that
institutions charging by the program may have to pay 

pro rata 

refunds to a greater number of students than institutions that charge by the term and may consistently find their students
have high amounts of unpaid charges under the proposed refund calculation, resulting in a reduction in the amount
the institution can retain for non 

pro rata

 refund calculations. The Secretary would like to point out, however, that such a situation exists precisely because
the institution charges the student for the entire cost of the program up-front. It is true the same student could attend
an institution which charges by the term and would, under the proposed refund calculation, owe a smaller amount of
unpaid charges. The term institution, however, does not contract with the student for any amount in excess of the costs
of the term. The adverse affects of the Secretary's proposal, therefore, as claimed by some of the commenters, are
the result of an institution's own decision to contract with the student for the costs of the entire program up-front,
instead of contracting for the costs of a smaller period of study, such as an academic term; this is an institutional
decision over which the Secretary has no control. The Secretary believes the discontinuation of the use of payment
periods and the practice of attribution will greatly simplify the refund requirements, and that this benefit overrides
the commenters' concerns. The Secretary believes it is necessary to define and limit the definition of enrollment
period to ensure equitable refunds to Title IV, HEA program recipients. The Secretary wishes to clarify that, under
the proposed definition, all clock hour institutions are treated the same, regardless of whether they use standard
terms or not, because it has been the experience of the Secretary that these institutions all charge by the program.

Repayments to Title IV, HEA Programs of Institutional Refunds and Repayments. Comments:

 Three commenters believed the treatment of unpaid charges for non

pro rata

 refunds, as prescribed in the June 8, 1993 final regulations, should be rescinded in compliance with the statutory
treatment for 

pro rata

 refund purposes. Two commenters believed the requirement penalizes institutions by reducing the amount of institutional
charges they can retain. Three commenters asserted that the requirement unfairly leaves students owing large balances
to the institution which would otherwise have been paid by Title IV, HEA program assistance, and this result obviously
is not fair and equitable under the statute. Three commenters requested the Secretary include late disbursements
of State, private, and institutional aid as amounts that can be used to reduce a student's unpaid charges, if these
aid sources have published late disbursement policies under which a withdrawing student can be paid. Two commenters
suggested the Secretary include late disbursements of unsubsidized Stafford Loan program funds and all Direct Loan
program funds as amounts that can be used to reduce a student's unpaid charges. Two commenters believed the consideration
of late disbursements when determining unpaid charges is inappropriate and should not be allowed under the refund
requirements. One commenter suggested that, because the requirement to subtract unpaid charges from the amount
the institution can retain does not apply to statutory 

pro rata

 refund calculations, the requirement should also not apply to voluntarily 

pro rata

 refund calculations that are not required by the Amendments of 1992. 



Discussion:

 The public was previously invited to comment on requirement to subtract unpaid charges from the amount the institution
can retain in response to the December 23, 1991 NPRM. The comments and responses on this issue, including the decisions
and rationale of the Secretary, are included in the June 8, 1993 final regulations which included the requirement.
The required treatment of unpaid charges for the purposes of this section, except for the calculation of a 

pro rata

 refund under the statute, reaffirms the basic principle of student financial aid: the family (or student) makes its
contribution first before financial aid is expended. Although some students may have to pay more toward institutional
charges than they originally expected, due to the fact that they withdrew and became ineligible for a portion of the
aid they expected to receive, this is more equitable to those students who have responsibly fulfilled their financial
obligations to the institution. The Secretary does not believe this issue warrants reconsideration in the context
of the February 28, 1994 NPRM. The administration of private and institutional student aid funds is not within the
control of the Secretary. Therefore, the Secretary cannot guarantee the availability or delivery of these funds
and cannot allow institutions to use late disbursements of these funds to reduce a student's unpaid charges. The Secretary
agrees, however, that institutions should be allowed to use late disbursements of State student aid to reduce a student's
unpaid charges, provided the State in question has a standard written late disbursement policy which the institution
follows in calculating unpaid charges and provided the student is eligible to receive the late disbursement in spite
of having withdrawn. The Secretary wishes to clarify that an institution which chooses to count a late disbursement
of State student aid in this manner will be liable for that amount if it is not disbursed to the student within 60 days
after the student's date of withdrawal, as defined in  668.22(i)(1), and will be required to recalculate the
Title IV, HEA program refund and return any additional amounts required to the appropriate Title IV, HEA program accounts
or to the lender within the deadlines specified in  688.22(g). The Secretary agrees that institutions should
be allowed to use allowable late disbursement amounts from unsubsidized Federal Stafford loans and Direct Student
loans to reduce a student's unpaid charges. The Secretary does not believe the treatment of unpaid charges for the
purpose of statutory 

pro rata

 refund calculations should be extended to voluntary 

pro rata

 refund calculations. 



Changes:

 Section 668.22(f)(2)(ii) has been amended to include allowable late disbursements of State student financial assistance,
unsubsidized Federal Stafford loans and loans made under the Federal Direct Student Loan Program. A corresponding
change has been made to  668.22(c)(2). 



Comments:

 Many commenters disagreed with the Secretary's proposal to remove the fraction that is currently used to determine
what portion of the refund must be returned to the Title IV, HEA programs. These commenters believed this change is
grossly unfair and negates the concept of equal partnership between the Federal government, the States, and the institution
in providing student financial assistance. Six commenters believed the proposed treatment will cause all parties
who contribute to a Title IV, HEA program recipient's educational costs_States, institutions, private sources
of aid_to lose their contributed funds to the Title IV, HEA programs in the event of a withdrawal. These commenters
believed these other parties will therefore be reluctant to pay any of their funds to recipients of Title IV, HEA program
assistance. These commenters asserted that such a policy would unfairly penalize State, institutional, and private
sources of aid, and Title IV, HEA program recipients. One commenter reported that State programs are already deciding
to avoid the Title IV, HEA program refund calculation by withholding their monies until after the refund period has
passed; such a practice will be detrimental to Title IV, HEA program recipients who withdraw and owe large balances
that would have been paid by State assistance, had it been disbursed on time. This commenter urged the Secretary to
prevent the negative effects of this policy by amending the definition of ``financial aid'' (for the purposes of calculating
the student's unpaid charges) to include State and private assistance that can reasonably be expected to be awarded,
even if it has not actually been received at the time of withdrawal. One commenter supported the Secretary's rationale
for removing the fraction in relation to refunds, but did not support extending that interpretation to repayments.





Discussion:

 The Secretary wishes to further clarify that the Amendments of 1992 specify in section 485 that refunds must be returned
to the Title IV, HEA programs first. Further, the Technical Amendments of 1993 changed section 485 of the HEA to specify
that refunds may be returned to other sources of student assistance only after the refund is returned to the Title IV,
HEA program funds in the specified order of allocation. The Secretary has no authority to alter this requirement.
The Secretary recognizes that some States, institutions, or private sources of aid may deliberately withhold funds
from otherwise eligible students who have received Title IV, HEA program assistance. This is a decision over which
the Secretary has no control. The Secretary does not believe the definition of ``financial aid'' can be amended in
the manner suggested by one commenter, as such a change would be difficult to regulate. The Secretary feels it is appropriate,
for consistency with the spirit of the law and to reduce administrative burden, to extend the interpretation of the
law to repayments as well as refunds. 




Changes:

 None.

Comments:

 Two commenters support the Secretary's proposal to set 
a minimum dollar amount below which a refund or repayment does not have to be made. One commenter suggested the Secretary
set the same minimum amount for both refunds and repayments. 



Discussion:

 After further consideration, the Secretary believes 
that this proposed provision is inconsistent with the amendment made to section 490 of the HEA that established criminal
penalties for failure to pay refunds, specifically including refunds of less than two hundred dollars. Further,
the Secretary believes that by the time the institution has determined the amount of the refund, most of the administrative
effort and cost has been expended. The Secretary believes that neither the institution nor the student would benefit
from the proposal to allow institutions to forgo making refunds of $25 or less. Also, the Secretary believes that part
of the institution's administrative costs are recouped through the administrative fee that is allowed to be excluded
from the 

pro rata

 refund calculation. 



Changes:

 Section 668.22(f)(3)(iii) has been amended to remove the proposed minimum dollar amount below which a refund would
not have to be made. 



Allocation of Refunds and Overpayments. Comments:

 Three commenters support the Secretary's proposal to mandate the order of return of FFEL programs refund amounts.
One commenter supported the proposed allocation of FFEL programs refunds and believed it will reduce student indebtedness.
Three 
commenters believed including PLUS and unsubsidized Stafford loans in the refund allocation negates the basic principle
of financial aid, that the family (or student) makes its contribution first before financial aid is expended. One
commenter believed PLUS and unsubsidized Stafford loans should be excluded from the refund allocation, because
grant money should not be used to pay back student loans, especially loans that are not need-based. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary wishes to clarify that section 485 of 
the Amendments of 1992 specifies the order of return of refunds to the various sources of aid and to the student. The
statute does not exclude the PLUS or unsubsidized Stafford loan programs from this order of return. For consistency
and reduced administrative burden, the Secretary has proposed the same order 
of return for repayments as is mandated in the law for refunds. The Secretary believes the return order to be logical
and appropriate. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comments:

 Three commenters disagreed with the Secretary's assertion in the preamble of the February 28, 1994 NPRM that refunds
should not be used to eliminate outstanding balances on loans made for prior years. These commenters believed it is
in the best interest of the student to allow a refund to be applied to outstanding loans. 



Discussion:

 The Title IV, HEA programs award financial assistance based on the costs of attendance and the student's need assessment
for a specific period of enrollment in a specific award year. The Secretary believes it is inappropriate to use funds
awarded for the current enrollment period to cover costs from a prior enrollment period. 



Changes:

 None. 



Refund Dates.

 Comments: Four commenters believed the Secretary should be more flexible in terms of how an institution determines
and documents a student's last day of attendance in the case of unofficial 
withdrawal. These commenters asserted that it is unreasonable to expect all institutions to maintain attendance
records. Two commenters suggested institutions be required to determine that a student has unofficially withdrawn
within a certain time frame, to avoid a student's unofficial withdrawal going unnoticed for an unreasonably long
period of time. One commenter believed the proposed provisions should address cases of institution-initiated retroactive
withdrawals. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary wishes to clarify that the concept of 
using the student's last recorded date of attendance for refund purposes is not ``new,'' but has been included in  668.22
of the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations since 1988. All institutions participating in the Title
IV, HEA programs have long been expected to have in place a system by which student attendance can be documented for
the purposes of determining the withdrawal date in cases of unofficial withdrawal. The Secretary agrees that unofficial
withdrawals should be determined within a reasonable time frame, in connection with the proposed definition of ``withdrawal
date.'' The Secretary believes cases of institution-initiated retroactive withdrawals are uncommon and as such
do not warrant regulatory inclusion. 



Changes:

 Section 668.22(i)(1)(ii) has been amended to limit an 
institution's determination of a student's unofficial withdrawal to no later than 30 days after the expiration of
the enrollment period, the academic year, or the program, whichever is earlier. 



Comments:

 One commenter believed the Secretary should not impose 
a deadline for refunds and repayments. Several commenters simply stated the proposed 30-day deadline would be too
difficult to meet, especially for refunds made to lenders, and requested it be extended to 45 or 60 days. Many commenters
stated that the proposal to require refunds be made within 30 days was unreasonable, in light of the proposed 20-day
return period for 
equipment, books, or supplies. These commenters believed it is unfair to allow a student a leisurely 20-day period
in which to return equipment, only to force the institution to rush the calculation and processing of a refund. Seven
commenters stated that the proposed 30-day refund deadline does not take into account the unavoidable delay in determining
unofficial withdrawals. These commenters believed most unofficial withdrawals are not discovered until the end
of the subsequent enrollment periods add-drop period, and that several institutions will therefore consistently
be unable to meet the 
30-day requirement. Three commenters requested that all refund deadlines_for refunds to the program accounts,
to lenders, and to students_be modified to be consistent, suggesting 60 days as a reasonable length of time for a refund
to be made. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary wishes to reiterate that, as discussed 
in the preamble of the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the refund deadline given in  668.22(i)(3) applies 

only

 to refunds made directly to the student. The Secretary believes refund deadlines are appropriate and necessary.
The Secretary would like to clarify that the deadlines for the return of refunds to the Title IV, HEA programs are not
``new.'' These deadlines are not included in the current Student Assistance General Provisions regulations, 
but in the FFEL programs regulations. The Secretary wishes to clarify that  668.22(g)(2)(iv) clearly states
the 30-day refund requirement given in that paragraph applies to all Title IV, HEA programs other than the Federal
Work-Study and FFEL programs. The deadline for refunds to lenders under the FFEL programs is set forth not in this section
of the student aid regulations, but 
in 34 CFR 682.607. The Secretary believes that a 30-day refund deadline, in spite of the 20-day return period for equipment,
is reasonable and sound. The Secretary would like to clarify that  668.22(g)(2)(iv) clearly states the refund
deadline is determined according to either the date the student officially withdraws 

or

 the date the institution determines the student has unofficially withdrawn. The Secretary believes this treatment
sufficiently allows for the time needed to determine unofficial withdrawals. The Secretary believes the refund
deadline for the purposes of the FFEL programs is appropriately longer than the refund deadlines discussed in this
section of the student aid regulations and that this is necessary to account for the added procedures of returning
funds to the lender. 



Changes:

 Section 668.22(i)(2) has been amended to clarify that the deadline in that paragraph is applicable only to refunds
made to students. 



Appendix A 





Comments:

 A few commenters requested the Secretary more 
specifically define several different terms used in appendix A. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes the terms used in Appendix A 
are standard terms of the educational community, having been in common use for several years, and as such, necessitate
no further definition. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comments:

 Three commenters believed that appendix A was originally intended to address proprietary institutions and fails
to recognize or treat the specific circumstances of nonproprietary, term-based institutions. Specifically, these
commenters stated that mandatory proration of all institutional costs disregards the fact that some institutional
costs (such as 
instructor salary and physical plant costs) are fixed and unaffected by the withdrawal of a small number of students.
These commenters requested the Secretary drop appendix A and replace it with requirements that more adequately apply
to both proprietary and nonproprietary institutions. 



Discussion:

 The proration of educational costs is required for 

pro rata

 refund calculations under the Amendments of 1992. The Secretary feels it is reasonable to extend this concept to the
Appendix A requirements, in keeping with Congress' intent to provide a fair and equitable refund to Title IV, HEA program
recipients. The Secretary notes that, in the past, the 
guidelines of appendix A were applicable to 

any

 institution, not just proprietary institutions, if neither an institution's accrediting agency nor its State had
refund standards and the institution did not choose to follow refund policies set by another association of institutions
and approved by the 
Secretary. Appendix A is intended to provide a general and stringent refund standard; the Secretary encourages institutions
and accrediting agencies to work together in developing accrediting agency refund standards which can be used instead
of appendix A standards and which can be better suited to the 
particular needs and circumstances of individual institutions. 



Changes:

 None.

Comments:

 A few commenters suggested various changes to the 
percent of tuition charges that must be refunded for withdrawals which occur during certain portions of the academic
period. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes the refund percentages provided in appendix A are reasonable and appropriate. The commenters
have not given evidence or justification as to why these refund levels should be altered. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comments:

 One commenter suggested that institutions should be 
allowed to deduct a students unpaid charges from a refund due under appendix A. 



Discussion:

 The June 8, 1993 final regulations require that, for 
all refund calculations other than a statutory 

pro rata

 refund calculation, a students unpaid charges be subtracted from the amount an institution could otherwise retain.
The Secretary finds no justification for exempting refund calculations under appendix A from this requirement.




Changes:

 None. 



Comments:

 One commenter believed board charges are adequately 
treated under part VI of appendix A, and should not be discussed separately in part VII. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes housing charges are separate and distinct costs from board charges, even though some institutions
voluntarily choose to link these two costs together. A housing contract prescribes charges for a dormitory or housing
space that presumably cannot be refilled past a certain point; therefore, such charges are expended at the point the
space 
cannot be refilled. Part VI provides for the refund and retention of such charges accordingly. Board charges, however,
are incrementally expended over the length of the period for which the student has been charged; the cost of food the
student has not yet consumed cannot fairly be retained by the institution. The contract concept applied to housing
charges, therefore, is inappropriate when determining the fair refund of board costs. Part VII, therefore, provides
separate and distinct guidance for the refund of board charges. For the purposes of calculating a refund under appendix
A, institutions must treat these two charges separately, in accordance with the appropriate guidelines. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comments:

 One commenter suggested adding specific language to 
Section VIII A to clarify that an administrative fee (of the lesser of $100 or 5 percent of tuition) cannot be retained
in the case of a student whose aid package consisted only of FFEL programs funds, because FFEL programs funds must be
returned in full to the lender if the student withdraws before attending one class. 



Discussion:

 The commenter is correct regarding the requirement 
that FFEL programs funds be returned in full in the circumstance noted. However, the Secretary does not believe this
or other such requirements should be reiterated in appendix A. The first paragraph of appendix A clearly states that
these requirements do not affect an institution's obligation to comply with other Department of Education regulations.




Changes:

 None. 



Comments:

 Five commenters requested the Secretary clarify the 
treatment of unofficial withdrawals under appendix A. Specifically, two of these commenters believed the language
of Section X clearly implies that a students failure to give withdrawal notice in writing would be just cause to deny
the student's refund. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary considers an institution to have met 
the fair and equitable refund requirement if it uses a policy that meets the 

minimum

 requirements of appendix A. Although appendix A does not recognize unofficial withdrawals and recommends against
the institution's acceptance of oral withdrawal notification, an institution is not prohibited from adapting a
more liberal interpretation of this subject into its 
implementation of appendix A requirements. 



Changes:

 None. 



Section 668.23 Audits, Records, and Examinations  





Comments:

 Two commenters suggested including the nationally 
recognized accrediting agencies among the list of agencies with which institutions participating in the Title IV,
HEA programs must cooperate in the conduct of audits, investigations, and program reviews authorized by law. A few
commenters also suggested including the nationally recognized accrediting 
agencies among the list of agencies with which a third-party servicer must cooperate in the conduct of audits, investigations,
and program reviews authorized by law. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenters. Accrediting agencies assist the Secretary in determining institutional
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs and should therefore be included in the list of entities that an institution
must cooperate with. A third-party servicer, acting as an agent of the institution, should be required to cooperate

with any accrediting agency that accredits an institution with which the servicer contracts to administer any aspect
of the institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. 



Changes:

 This section is revised to include nationally recognized accrediting agencies in the list of entities that an institution
and a third-party servicer must cooperate with in the conduct of audits, investigations, or program reviews authorized
by law. 



Comments:

 One commenter was concerned that the requirement for a 
third-party servicer to cooperate with a guaranty agency and other entities in the conduct of audits, investigations,
and program reviews, would give the guaranty agency access to proprietary information of that servicer. The commenter
noted that guaranty agencies directly compete for the services provided by other third-party servicers. The commenter
suggested limiting 
cooperation to only include information that a holder of loans would be required to make available. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary disagrees with the commenter. These 
regulations only require access to a third-party servicer's records to the extent necessary to monitor compliance
with applicable statutes, regulations, special arrangements, agreements, and limitation. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comments:

 Another commenter felt that a third-party servicer should not be required to cooperate with these entities to the
extent that that cooperation includes the copying of computer programs that are the sole property of the servicer.
The commenter felt that any copying would violate copyright laws included in the licensing agreement to the software;
the 
commenter recommended deleting this provision. 



Discussion:

 These regulations require access to a third-party 
servicer's records to the extent necessary to monitor compliance with applicable statutes, regulations, special
arrangements, agreements, and limitations. These regulations do not require, nor does the Secretary expect, a third-party
servicer to violate any copyright laws governing computer programs. Nevertheless, a third-party servicer, like
an institution, is expected to make available for examination and copying all relevant information, including the
computer program. 



Changes:

 None.

Comments: 

Several commenters suggested amending the provisions 
of  668.23(b)(3) governing reasonable access to an institution's 
personnel to allow an institution the basic right to protect its 
interest during a compliance review by having an attorney, a 
management representative, or a tape recorder present when the 
Department of Education conducts an interview with a person 
employed by the institution. A few commenters suggested that 
these provisions violate an employee's constitutional rights to 
counsel. One commenter stated that as a minimum, an institution 
should have the opportunity to build its own record and rebut 
inaccurate charges by having tape recordings of interviews 
between its employees and the Department of Education's 
representatives. Several commenters were against the provisions 
in this section that require a third-party servicer, in the 
conduct of audits, investigations, or program reviews, to allow 
its individual employees_those employees connected with the 
servicer's administration of the Title IV, HEA programs_to be 
questioned in private, without management being present or 
without the questioning being tape recorded. Many of these 
commenters contended that this requirement violated an 
individual's right to due process. One commenter felt that the 
Secretary was overstepping his statutory authority in this 
matter. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary has already responded to similar 
comments in the preamble to final regulations for parts 600 and 
668 that was published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 31, 1991 
(56 FR 36682). The Secretary continues to disagree with these 
views and in the three years since these regulations have been in 
effect has received no evidence that the claims of the commenters 
are justified. With respect to third-party servicers, these 
provisions simply add requirements for third-party servicers that 
parallel current requirements for institutions participating in 
the Title IV, HEA programs. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comments: 

Many commenters recommended that an institution should 
be able to use a third-party servicer's annual compliance audit 
report to satisfy the portion of an institution's audit 
requirement for those areas that the servicer has contracted to 
administer on behalf of the institution. These commenters noted 
that this idea would eliminate duplication of effort by 
independent auditors auditing a third-party servicer's 
activities. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary generally agrees with commenters that 
an institution may use a third-party servicer's audit report to 
cover those areas of an institution's participation in the 
Title IV, HEA programs that the institution has contracted with 
the servicer to administer. However, if an institution is 
required to have audited additional areas of its administration 
or is required to use different procedures in having the audit 
performed than the servicer then the institution may not be able 
to use fully the results of the servicer's audit. An institution 
is always responsible for ensuring that a compliance audit of the 
institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs 
includes all aspects of the institution's participation. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comments: 

Forty-three commenters suggested that an institution 
ought to be permitted to remain under the biennial audit 
requirement if that institution did not have deficiencies in the 
prior audit report of more than five percent of the institution's 
total Title IV, HEA program funds. Many of these commenters 
pointed out that this modification would parallel a similar 
provision in the proposed  668.15 governing financial 
responsibility. At a minimum, the commenters recommended that 
these provisions be modified to reflect that an institution that 
had no deficiencies that required a monetary adjustment be 
permitted to remain under the biennial audit requirement. 
Several commenters asked the Secretary to clarify what are 
considered to be no deficiencies and material exceptions. One 
commenter suggested specifying certain amounts in the use of 
those terms. Three commenters supported the Secretary's proposal 
to provide exceptions to the annual audit requirement for 
third-party servicers that administer small amounts of 
Title IV, HEA program funds. One commenter argued that 
third-party servicers administering less than $250,000 in 
Title IV, HEA program funds should not be excluded from having an 
annual audit performed. One commenter recommended that instead 
of requiring third-party servicers to have performed a compliance 
audit at least every two years if the servicer administers less 
than $1,000,000 in Title IV, HEA program funds, that that 
threshold should be increased to $5,000,000. Three commenters 
urged the Secretary to require all third-party servicers to have 
an annual audit performed. One commenter suggested defining what 
is meant by a material exception. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary has reevaluated his proposal in the 
February 17 and 28, 1994, NPRMs and upon a further examination of 
section 487(c) of the HEA and information surrounding the intent 
of the statute, has determined that the proposals were 
inconsistent with the requirement for an institution to have 
performed, without exception, on an annual basis, a compliance 
audit of the institution's administration of its Title IV, HEA 
programs or a third-party servicer to have performed, without 
exceptions, on an annual basis, a compliance audit of the 
servicer's administration of any aspect of its administration of 
an institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program. The 
Secretary appreciates the comments and suggestions provided with 
respect to the basis for exempting institutions and third-party 
servicers from the annual audit requirement. While the Secretary 
cannot adopt these in the regulations, the Secretary is 
considering them in the development of changes to the Department 
of Education's audit guides. These changes are being designed to 
reduce administrative costs by allowing institutions that meet 
certain performance-based or funding criteria to have performed 
compliance audits under a reviewed or compiled basis rather than 
fully audited.

Changes: 

The provisions that provided for exceptions to the 
annual audit requirements for institutions and third-party 
servicers have been deleted in these final regulations. The 
proposed audit exceptions in this section have been removed. 
This section has been revised to require that all institutions 
have performed an annual compliance audit of the institution's 
administration of its Title IV, HEA programs; and to require that 
all third-party servicers have an annual compliance audit 
performed of every aspect of the servicer's administration of the 
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs of each institution 
with which the servicer has a contract. 


Comments: 

Many commenters suggested amending  668.23(c)(8) to 
establish deadlines for the submission of audit reports, rather 
than allowing the Inspector General to specify these deadlines in 
the audit guides. Several commenters questioned whether the 
Inspector General has the authority to establish this requirement 
without regulations. Another commenter suggested that the 
regulations contain a provision that would require institutions 
to meet the deadlines specified in the audit guide, but stipulate 
that under no circumstances would the institution be required to 
submit its audit report earlier than four months following the 
expiration of the audit period. 


Discussion: 

Upon review of the commenters' concerns, the 
Secretary agrees that because these regulations require that an 
audit report must be submitted in a timely manner, the 
regulations should provide institutions and third-party servicers 
with the specific dates for submission of audit reports. The 
Secretary believes that a period of 120 days from the end of the 
institution's or servicer's fiscal year provides an institution 
or servicer with a sufficient period of time to have an audit 
performed and to submit the audit report to the Department. 


Changes: 

The regulations have been revised to state that an 
institution or third-party servicer must submit its audit within 
120 days of the end of its fiscal year. An institution or 
third-party servicer that has an audit performed under the Single 
Audit Act must submit the audit report in accordance with the 
deadlines specified in that act. 


Comments: 

Many commenters were opposed to the provision that the 
Secretary could require a third-party servicer to release the 
results of an audit to cognizant guaranty agencies, eligible 
lenders under the FFEL programs, State agencies, nationally 
recognized accrediting agencies, and State Postsecondary Review 
Entities on the grounds that these entities are not affected by 
the servicer's actions and release of information in the audit 
report could unnecessarily damage a third-party servicer's 
reputation. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary disagrees with the commenters that the 
referenced entities are not affected by a third-party servicer's 
actions. The Secretary believes that by providing information- 
sharing among the appropriate authorized entities that the 
Secretary relies on to help provide oversight of Title IV, HEA 
program participants, that the Secretary is responding to 
Congressional intent. A third-party servicer acts as an agent of 
the institution and is responsible for administering a portion of 
an institution's participation. As such, the various entities 
involved in program oversight will have a genuine need for access 
to records of, or information about, the servicer. The Secretary 
therefore considers that the audit results of third-party 
servicers must be included in the information available to the 
appropriate oversight bodies monitoring institutional compliance 
with Title IV, HEA requirements. 


Changes: 

The Secretary is revising paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section to include the Secretary of Veteran Affairs in the list 
of entities that the Secretary may require an institution or 
third-party servicer to provide the results of an audit to. 


Comments: 

One commenter felt that an audit guide specifically 
developed for third-party servicers was necessary to comply with 
the requirements of this section. Another commenter was of the 
opinion that the period covered by a third-party servicer's first 
audit should not start until after audit guidance is available 
from the Department of Education. 


Discussion: 

The Department of Education's Office of Inspector 
General is working on developing audit guides applicable for 
compliance audits performed of institutions and third-party 
servicers. The Secretary expects that these guides will be 
available before the initial audit period covered by an audit 
performed of a third-party servicer begins. 


Changes: 

None. 


Comments: 

Regarding the requirement for an institution to 
maintain records on a student's placement if the institution has 
a placement service used by the student, four commenters were 
concerned that application of this requirement to all 
institutions for all types of student employment placement might 
be overreaching and could result in institutions electing to 
terminate their student employment service rather than comply 
with burdensome recordkeeping requirements. Commenters pointed 
out that at some large institutions, student employment centers 
often act as clearinghouses for posting jobs and professional 
career opportunities, but frequently lacked the resources to 
track actual placement. Most often, employment information is 
made available to students and that information is simply removed 
from posting once the employer indicates the position has been 
filled. Commenters maintained that a formal follow-up process on 
student employment is not generally systematic and obtaining 
appropriate documentation would discourage institutions from 
continuing to provide this service to students. Two commenters 
recommended removing this requirement from the regulations. 
Three other commenters suggested that the Department of Education 
revise this provision of the regulations so that it would apply 
only to institutions that are otherwise required to track student 
employment as a condition of Title IV, HEA program eligibility or 
pertains only to those students for which the institution must 
otherwise maintain employment records.

Discussion: 

The Secretary does not intend for this requirement 
to be burdensome to institutions. This provision merely requires 
an institution with a placement service to document that the 
institution does what it claims to do_namely, place students in 
jobs. 


Changes: 

None. 


Comments: 

Two commenters objected to the requirement that an 
institution establish and maintain records that support the 
educational qualifications of each regular student admitted to 
the institution whether or not that student receives Title IV, 
HEA program assistance, that are relevant to the institution's 
admission standards. Both commenters believed that institutions 
should only be required to establish and maintain summary or 
aggregate information on the educational qualifications of 
students admitted to the institution. This aggregate data would 
be available to the Secretary only if the Secretary could 
demonstrate a compelling need to review the information. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary believes this provision is necessary 
to establish whether an institution is in compliance with the 
statutory admission requirements of sections 1201(a) and 481(b) 
and (c) of the HEA for purposes of institutional eligibility and 
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. 


Changes: 

None. 


Comments: 

Two commenters urged the Secretary to include a 
requirement that institutions retain records documenting whether 
and when a student completes his or her educational program. 
This information is needed to verify completion rates. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary has taken these comments under 
consideration, but concluded that other regulatory provisions 
governing the completion rate calculations contain requirements 
to retain documentation to support the computations. 


Changes: 

None. 


Section 668.24 Audit Exceptions and Repayments 




Comments: 

Two commenters supported the Secretary's proposed 
requirement for a third-party servicer to notify all institutions 
for which the servicer provides the same service, in addition to 
those institutions under whose contract the servicer incurred a 
liability for a Title IV, HEA program violation. Other 
commenters felt that this requirement was excessively broad. 
Several of these commenters argued that this requirement would 
unnecessarily damage a third-party servicer's reputation. 
Several commenters noted that the Secretary's proposed 
notification requirements were not all that different from full 
notification of all institutions with which the servicer 
contracts. One commenter suggested that third-party servicers 
should be required to notify institutions receiving the same 
service for which the servicer owes a liability only if that 
liability is material. One commenter recommended that a 
third-party servicer that is assessed a liability should have a 
reasonable amount of time to provide the notification to the 
servicer's clients. Another commenter was of the opinion that 
the Secretary notify all of the institutions with which the 
servicer contracts of the Secretary's determination at the same 
time that the servicer is notified. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary disagrees with the commenters that 
objected to the notification requirements. If a third-party 
servicer is assessed liability for a violation of a Title IV, HEA 
program requirement, any institution for which the servicer 
provides the same service in which the violation was found is 
potentially at risk as a result of the servicer's actions. 
Obviously, each institution under whose contract the servicer 
committed a violation should be notified because the Secretary 
holds that institution responsible for the full amount of the 
liability. In addition, each institution that contracts with the 
servicer for the same service in which the violation was found 
should also be informed of the servicer's violation. The 
Secretary believes that an institution that receives the same 
service should be informed of the servicer's violation of any 
Title IV, HEA program requirement because the servicer may commit 
a similar violation at that institution and the institution could 
be held liable for that violation. This notice will also allow 
an institution to take corrective action without waiting for 
formal action by the Secretary. 
With respect to the commenter who was concerned that 
third-party servicers should have a reasonable amount of time in 
which to notify affected institutions of the Secretary's 
determination to assess a liability against the servicer, the 
Secretary does not believe that that time frame needs to be 
quantified. Servicers are expected promptly to notify affected 
institutions of the Secretary's determination because those 
institutions are also responsible for violations committed by 
their servicers. Servicers that fail to notify institutions may 
jeopardize an institution's ability to provide information to 
show that questioned expenditures were proper or take corrective 
action to mitigate violations caused by a third-party servicer. 
In reviewing a third-party servicer's appeal of the Secretary's 
determination, the Secretary will take into consideration whether 
or not the servicer notified affected institutions promptly of 
the Secretary's determination. 
The Secretary does not agree that it is necessary for the 
Department of Education to provide notice to all of the 
institutions with which a third-party servicer contracts if that 
servicer is assessed a liability. A third-party servicer, as a 
responsible agent of an institution, has an obligation to keep 
that institution informed of any developments that might 
possibility jeopardize the institution's participation in the 
Title IV, HEA programs. If the Secretary seeks to assess 
liability against an institution for a third-party servicer's 
conduct, he will provide the appropriate notice to the affected 
institution. 


Changes: 

None.

Comments:

 Four commenters opposed the provision in this section 
that required an institution to be responsible for payment of any 
liability owed by the institution's third-party servicer for a 
violation of the institution's participation until the amount is 
paid in full. One of these commenters argued that the 
third-party servicer should be held entirely accountable for 
payment of any liabilities incurred for the servicer's violation 
of Title IV, HEA program requirements. 


Discussion:

 In the NPRM published on February 17, 1994, the 
Secretary repeatedly stated that an institution is always 
responsible for the actions of any of its third-party servicers. 
This responsibility includes assuming payment of any liability 
incurred by the servicer as a result of a violation of a 
Title IV, HEA program requirement by the servicer while 
administering aspects of the institution's participation in the 
Title IV, HEA programs. See  668.25(c)(3). No institution will 
be required to answer for servicer violations without the 
opportunity to have such determinations reviewed under the 
procedures established in these regulations. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 Two commenters were concerned with the provision in 
this section governing the ability of the Secretary to perform an 
administrative offset to collect funds owed under the procedures 
of this section. One of these commenters suggested that the 
Secretary only use administrative offset to collect funds if a 
third-party servicer has not entered into an agreement with the 
Secretary to repay those funds. The other commenter thought that 
this provision amounted to the equivalent of an emergency action 
without having to afford an institution or third-party servicer a 
show-cause hearing. Several commenters were opposed to the 
provision in this section governing the ability of the Secretary 
to collect on a surety or third-party guarantee before the 
conclusion of appeal proceedings. These commenters contended 
that this provision assumes that the party is guilty before it is 
proven. Two of the commenters were also opposed to this 
provision on the grounds that audit findings of the Department of 
Education are sometimes insupportable or in error and that to 
collect on a surety or guarantee before those findings can be 
proven wrong is simply improper. 


Discussion:

 The provisions in this section governing additional 
steps that the Secretary may take to collect funds owed under the 
procedures of this section are necessary to allow the Secretary 
to act quickly to protect Federal funds and insure that funds are 
available for collection. Institutions have a distinct financial 
incentive to cause delay and prolong any appeal of audit 
determinations. Some institutions use delays to either hide 
assets or drain assets so that none remain for collection; others 
may attempt to draw increased amounts of Title IV, HEA program 
funds prior to any final determination. The commenters are 
incorrect in stating that administrative offset denies procedural 
protection. Under the Department's offset regulations in 34 CFR 
part 30, the Department provides written notice and an 
opportunity to inspect records and receive an oral hearing. The 
Department may offset prior to completing the procedural 
requirements where failure to offset may substantially prejudice 
its ability to collect. In such cases, the Secretary completes 
the procedural requirements promptly thereafter and returns any 
funds later found not to be owing. 
With respect to comments about the Secretary's ability to 
collect a surety or guarantee before final determinations are 
concluded or all appeal procedures are exhausted, the Secretary 
does not agree with the commenters. Financial surety is provided 
to the Department as a condition of participation to insure that 
funds are available to satisfy liabilities. The Secretary would 
only attempt recourse in cases where there is a need to provide 
relief to students or borrowers affected by the actions of the 
institution or third-party servicer, or where the terms of the 
surety do not guarantee that funds will be available after 
appeals are completed. For example, in the case of an 
institution that has failed to pay refunds owed to students that 
attended that institution, the Secretary believes that the need 
to collect in advance to pay those refunds outweighs deferring 
collection to final determinations or until the exhaustion of all 
appeal procedures are completed. 


Changes: 

The reference to 34 CFR 30.28 is revised to refer to 34 
CFR part 30 to clarify that the procedural protections in that 
part related to administrative offset apply. 


Section 668.25 Contracts Between an Institution and a 
Third-Party Servicer 




Comments:

 Many commenters supported fully the Secretary's 
proposal in this section that requires a third-party servicer to 
assume joint and several liability with an institution for any 
violation by the servicer of any statutory or regulatory 
provision relating to Title IV of the HEA. One of these 
commenters noted that only the assumption of full liability by a 
third-party servicer could ensure the protection of public funds. 
In addition, many commenters supported the application of 
some type of liability on a third-party servicer for the 
servicer's violation of a Title IV, HEA program requirement, 
although most of these commenters recommended that the Secretary 
cap liability at the fees and compensation received by the 
servicer from the institution. A few commenters supported the 
Secretary's compromise to limit the liability of a third-party 
servicer to the fees and compensation received from the 
institution if the servicer was not an affiliate of the 
institution and to assess full joint and several liability 
against the servicer if the servicer was an affiliate of the 
institution. Other commenters believed in the concept of joint 
and several liability for third-party servicers only to the 
extent that it could be unequivocally proven that the servicer is 
the one at fault, or that the violation of a Title IV, HEA 
program requirement was more serious than simple human error.

Many commenters opposed requiring a third-party servicer to 
assume joint and several liability with an institution for a 
violation by the servicer of a Title IV, HEA program requirement. 
These commenters argued that to impose joint and several 
liability on a third-party servicer would (1) lead to increased 
servicing fees to compensate for increased risk assumed by the 
servicer; (2) force out servicers not willing to assume a level 
of risk in excess of the servicer's fees and compensation; and 
(3) interfere in contractual matters that should be left to the 
parties involved. These commenters recommended that instead of 
imposing liability on a third-party servicer, to increase 
accountability of the administration of the Title IV, HEA 
programs, the Secretary should instead focus on an institution's 
administrative capability and financial responsibility to achieve 
greater accountability. 
Several commenters questioned what happens to existing 
contracts with institutions that were negotiated under a 
different assumption of liability. A few of these commenters 
asked the Secretary not to impose retroactive liability for 
contracts that did not incorporate or price for such an event. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary appreciates the support from the 
commenters who agreed that third-party servicers should be 
jointly and severally liable with an institution with which the 
servicer contracts for any violation by the servicer of a 
Title IV, HEA program requirement. The Secretary agrees with 
these commenters that third-party servicer liability is necessary 
to insure compliance with Title IV, HEA program requirements. 
Servicers who must stand behind their work financially are more 
likely to use the high standard of care expected of Title IV, HEA 
program participants. 
The Secretary has reexamined his position with regard to 
adopting the compromise in the NPRM to limit joint and several 
liability to the fees and compensation that a third-party 
servicer has received from the institution if the servicer was 
not an affiliate of the institution. The Secretary does not 
believe that anything less than the full assumption of liability 
can fully protect the interest of Federal tax dollars in the form 
of Title IV, HEA program assistance. Otherwise, servicers have 
no financial incentive to insure complete program compliance. 
With respect to the comment that a third-party servicer should 
not be assessed liability unless it can be proven that the 
servicer is at fault, the Secretary does not consider a 
third-party servicer to be jointly and severally liable with an 
institution unless the servicer is the one that has violated a 
Title IV, HEA program requirement. The Secretary believes that 
if a third-party servicer violates a Title IV, HEA program 
requirement that the servicer should be held liable, along with 
the institution with which the servicer contracts, because a 
violation, even an error, impacts on the integrity of the Federal 
student financial assistance programs, and should be redressed. 
The Secretary disagrees with the comments that requiring 
servicer liability will necessarily increase fees so as to deny 
access to servicing. Some of these commenters noted that some 
servicers may price their service at a low-level to reflect the 
fact that they assume no liability. The Secretary does not 
believe that institutions or federal taxpayers are well served by 
servicers who are unwilling to stand behind the quality of their 
work. As agents of institutions participating in the 
Title IV, HEA programs, servicers are also subject to an 
institution's fiduciary responsibility to use the highest 
standard of care and diligence. By rejecting any responsibility 
for the quality of its work, the Secretary believes any such 
servicer cannot be expected to perform with the required concern 
for the proper expenditure of federal funds. The Secretary notes 
that he received favorable comments from organizations that are 
third-party servicers, or institutions who utilize third-party 
servicers, who did not raise any issue of adverse impact on fees. 
The Secretary has no doubt that these and similar servicers will 
continue to compete effectively for institutional clients at 
competitive prices. The Secretary notes that the higher 
education servicing industry is highly competitive which should 
restrain any excessive fee increases; in fact, by requiring all 
servicers to assume liability, the Secretary believes that this 
requirement should level the playing field by eliminating 
underbidding by those servicers who assume no responsibility for 
the quality of their work. 
The Secretary notes that servicers are not being asked to 
serve as guarantors for their client-institutions, but merely 
being required to answer for the consequences of their own 
conduct. In this regard, if the services they provide have no 
adverse financial impact, there is no financial exposure for such 
a third-party servicer, or reason to increase fees charged. 
With respect to those commenters who contended that the 
liability provision interfered in contractual matters that should 
be left up to the parties involved, the Secretary disagrees. The 
Secretary strongly believes that it is necessary to include this 
provision in the regulations because a third-party servicer 
administers aspects of the Title IV, HEA programs that are funded 
with Federal tax dollars. Therefore, it is entirely appropriate 
to establish requirements to safeguard such funds. Simply 
leaving this area to the parties, leaves open that possibility 
that no minimal care will be exercised by the servicer. An 
institution is free, however, under these regulations to agree to 
indemnify a third-party servicer in the event a third-party 
servicer must make any payment to the Secretary. The Secretary 
notes that these regulations will have the salutary effect of 
requiring institutions and servicers to exercise greater care in 
the selection of their contractual partners. 
The Secretary would like to make clear that a third-party 
servicer and an institution are only jointly and severally liable 
for any violations of any statutory or regulatory provision 
applicable to Title IV of the HEA and not for other types of 
violations. The Secretary is imposing requirements in contracts 
between third-party servicers and institutions only to the extent 
that a third-party servicer or institution administers any aspect 
of the Title IV, HEA programs. 
With respect to the commenters who asked about the impact on 
existing contracts, the Secretary states that third-party 
servicers will have no joint and several liability for periods 
prior to the effective date of these regulations. The Secretary 
expects that once these regulations become effective, all 
contracts between third-party servicers and institutions will 
have to include the requirements provided in  668.25(c), 
including the requirement that a third-party servicer is jointly 
and severally liable with the institution for any violation by 
the servicer of any statutory provision of or applicable to 
Title IV of the HEA, any regulatory prescribed under that 
statutory authority, and any applicable special arrangements, 
agreements, and limitations entered into under the authority of 
statutes pertaining to Title IV of the HEA. This may require 
modification of existing contracts. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 Some of the commenters questioned the provisions of 
this section governing a third-party servicer's responsibility to 
report all suspected instances of fraud to the Department of 
Education's Office of Inspector General. Two of these commenters 
recommended that in order to meet this requirement that 
third-party servicers be given an unqualified privilege exempting 
the servicer from any liability in connection with the referral 
of an institution to the Department of Education's Office of the 
Inspector General. In addition, one of the commenter questioned 
the Secretary's requirement to refer suspected instances of fraud 
or other criminal misconduct in connection with the Title IV, HEA 
programs. The commenter was concerned that if the servicer was 
wrong that the servicer's reputation would be irrevocably 
damaged. One commenter suggested that a third-party servicer 
should only be required to report information indicating fraud 
only where there is proof to substantiate the belief that an 
institution may have engaged in fraud. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary recognizes that third-party servicers 
will not always be privy to sufficient information to identify 
possible fraud or criminal misconduct on the part of an 
institution. However, if there are identifiable circumstances in 
which a reasonable person would believe that an institution has 
deliberately misreported information, recklessly reported 
information without regard for its accuracy, or altered official 
documents, then a third-party servicer should report such 
information to the Office of Inspector General. The servicer is 
not required to reach a firm conclusion as to the impropriety of 
the institution's actions or provide evidence to substantiate 
possible criminal charges, but is required to simply refer the 
matter to the Department of Education's Office of Inspector 
General for appropriate action. Since this referral requirement 
is a required part of any contract between a third-party servicer 
and an institution, an institution has no basis to object to any 
referral made pursuant to this requirement. The Secretary thus 
believes that it is unnecessary to provide an unqualified 
privilege as suggested by some commenters; moreover, such a 
privilege would allow referrals even where there is no reasonable 
basis to believe misconduct has occurred. The Secretary assures 
third-party servicers that a third-party servicer will not be 
held responsible for any violations that the servicer has not 
itself perpetrated or aided and abetted. However, the Secretary 
will regard failure to take appropriate action when there is 
reasonable cause to believe that fraud or criminal misconduct has 
occurred to be a serious violation of these regulations and of a 
participant's fiduciary obligations. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 One commenter supported the concept of the provision 
in this section governing the requirement that an institution 
must notify the Secretary within 10 days of the date that a 
contract between an institution or third-party servicer is 
modified or terminated or within 10 days of the date that a 
third-party servicer, under contract with that institution, goes 
out of business, stops providing services, or files a petition 
for bankruptcy. However, the commenter believed that the burden 
of notifying the Secretary of any changes to the contract should 
rest with the servicer. Many commenters opposed this provision 
and argued that this requirement constituted needless paperwork 
on the part of the institution. These commenters contended that 
any changes to a contract between a third-party servicer would be 
examined in the course of having performed an annual audit.

One commenter recommended that the notification time frame be changed 
from 10 days to 30 days. Another commenter recommended that the 
time frame either be revised to state that the institution must 
notify the Secretary promptly of any changes or, barring that, 
within 90 days. 



Discussion:

 Section 498(b)(3) of the HEA requires an institution 
to submit to the Secretary with its application for participation 
a copy of any contract between the institution and a third-party 
servicer and a description of that servicer; section 487(a)(3) 
requires an institution to submit information related to its 
administrative capability and financial responsibility. The 
Secretary interprets these statutory provisions to require 
institutions to keep the Secretary apprised of any contracts 
between themselves and third-party servicers, including, any 
significant modifications to those contracts, or any terminations 
of those contracts. The Secretary need contract information 
provided by institutions to monitor the responsibilities of 
third-party servicers. For example, if a program review uncovers 
a Title IV, HEA program violation at an institution in an area 
that a third-party servicer has recently contracted to 
administer, the Secretary must have current information to 
identify other institutions where the same servicer may have 
committed the same violation. The Secretary believes that 10 
days constitutes a reasonable time period in which an institution 
must inform the Secretary of any changes or terminations of a 
contract while at the same time providing the Secretary with 
current information on those contracts. This time frame is 
consistent with the other reporting requirements concerning 
institutional eligibility under 34 CFR 600.30, thereby 
facilitating reporting as an institution will not have to track 
different reporting deadlines. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comments:

 One commenter objected to the requirement that a 
third-party servicer return all applicable records to the 
institution if the contract between the servicer and institution 
is terminated, or if the servicer stops providing services, or if 
the servicer files a petition for bankruptcy. The commenter 
believed that these records were the servicer's sole guarantee 
that the institution would pay the servicer any fees or 
compensation still owed to the servicer by the institution. The 
servicer also argued that the absence of these records would 
adversely affect the ability of an independent auditor in the 
event the servicer had a compliance audit performed of its 
administration of the institution's participation in the 
Title IV, HEA programs. 



Discussion:

 If a third-party servicer must return records to an 
institution, these regulations do not prohibit a third-party 
servicer from retaining copies of the original records in order 
to facilitate a compliance audit. The Secretary notes that the 
expense of copying should be unnecessary as an institution must 
provide a third-party servicer's independent auditor with access 
to records pursuant to 34 CFR 668.23(b). 

With respect to the comment specifying that record retention 
was a third-party servicer's sole guarantee that an institution 
owing that servicer unpaid fees or compensation would pay, the 
Secretary strongly objects to any use of Title IV, HEA program 
records as bargaining chips in a pay dispute. Access to those 
records is required for uninterrupted administration of those 
programs. No servicer should hold these records hostage. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comments:

 Several commenters were concerned with the provisions 
in this section that limited a third-party servicer's ability to 
enter into a written contract with an eligible institution if the 
servicer had been limited, suspended, or terminated by the 
Secretary within the past five years. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary understands the commenters' concerns 
but does not believe that those concerns are justified. As the 
Secretary explained in the NPRM, if a third-party servicer is 
found to exhibit indicators of a questionable past performance, 
the servicer would be prohibited from entering into a written 
contract with an institution to administer any aspect of the 
institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
However, notwithstanding this prohibition, the Secretary would 
consider the servicer still eligible to contract with an 
institution if persons or entities with substantial control over 
the servicer agree to be responsible for any potential liability 
arising from the servicer's administration of the Title IV, HEA 
programs.

Section 668.26 End of an Institution's Participation





Comments:

 Several commenters believed that if an institution's 
participation ends, it would be less disruptive to currently 
enrolled students who are receiving Title IV, HEA program 
assistance to allow the students to continue to be enrolled and 
receive Title IV, HEA program assistance until they complete 
their educational program. The commenters suggested that 
immediate termination of all funds under the Title IV, HEA 
programs would likely cause closure of the institution and costs 
to the government resulting from forgiveness of the students' 
loans. A few commenters argued that if an institution's 
participation has ended, it would be unrealistic to require the 
institution to inform immediately the State in which the 
institution is located of its loss of participation in the NEISP 
or SSIG Program, because there would be no one to make the 
notification. The commenters suggested that it would be more 
appropriate for the Secretary to make the notification in this 
case. 



Discussion:

 Commenters misunderstood that immediate termination 
of Title IV, HEA program funds occurs for students at an 
institution whose participation ends but that does not close. 
The availability of those funds continues through the end of the 
payment period or period of enrollment in which the participation 
ends for enrolled students who have received a commitment for 
those funds. To provide funds beyond that point, however, would 
oblige the Secretary in effect to continue an institution's 
participation after the institution no longer qualifies for that 
participation. With regard to the commenters' objections to 
notifying a State upon the loss of an institution's participation 
in the NEISP or SSIG Program, it is no more unreasonable to 
expect an institution to notify the State than to expect the 
institution to notify the Secretary of the loss of participation 
in any other program. Institutions have been complying with this 
requirement for 20 years. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comments:

 Many commenters contended that if the Secretary 
receives a notice from a SPRE that the institution's 
participation should be withdrawn, the institution's 
participation should not end until the institution has had the 
opportunity to appeal to the Secretary or appropriate authority. 
Many commenters believed that an institution's participation 
should not end if the institution's program participation 
agreement expires due to the Secretary's failure to approve the 
application for a renewal of participation in a timely manner. 
One commenter suggested that, if an institution's participation 
is terminated as a result of misuse of funds under the Title IV, 
HEA programs, the Secretary prohibit the institution from 
crediting to a student's account or delivering to the student the 
proceeds of a second or subsequent disbursement of a Federal 
Stafford or Federal SLS loan after the institution's 
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs ends. The commenter 
believes it would be inappropriate to allow an institution that 
had previously misused funds under the Title IV, HEA program to 
disburse additional funds. 

One commenter disagreed with the requirement that, if an 
institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program ends, the 
institution must submit a letter of engagement for an audit of 
all funds received under that program within 45 days. The 
commenter stated that engagement letters are not required under 
generally accepted auditing standards or Government auditing 
standards. 



Discussion:

 Under the State Postsecondary Review Program, a SPRE 
does not inform the Secretary that an institution's participation 
should be terminated until the SPRE has afforded the institution 
its full appeal rights. A further discussion of this process is 
found in the preamble to the regulations for the State 
Postsecondary Review Program. The Secretary agrees with those 
commenters who were concerned about the expiration of an 
institution's participation if the review of a properly completed 
application, submitted in a timely manner, has not been completed 
before the expiration of participation. An explanation of the 
changes made to accommodate this circumstance is found in the 
section of the 

Analysis of Comments and Changes

 that addresses 
certification procedures ( 668.13).

The Secretary appreciates the concern of the commenter that 
an institution terminated for misuse of Title IV, HEA program 
funds ought not be permitted to continue to handle those funds, 
even for a limited period. The Secretary, however, considers 
that the honoring of commitments made to students is equally 
important and, provided that the institution continues to offer 
education, insists that those commitments be honored. The 
Secretary can also take additional steps to safeguard these 
remaining funds when appropriate. The institution remains liable 
for the proper handling of Title IV, HEA program funds even after 
its participation is terminated. Naturally, should the 
institution reapply for participation in a Title IV, HEA program 
or should a person with substantial control over the institution 
also have substantial control over another institution, the way 
that the terminated institution complied with the requirements of 
this section will be a factor in determining the institution's 
readmission into the programs or the person's continued role in 
the administration of the programs. 
The Secretary needs assurance that if an institution's 
participation in a Title IV, HEA program ends, the institution 
will make arrangements for a final audit of the institution's 
administration of the program. A letter of engagement provides 
the Secretary authoritative notification that the institution is 
carrying out its responsibility to end its participation in a way 
that will allow the Secretary to determine whether any further 
liabilities or corrective action is required. Generally accepted 
auditing standards and the GAO's 

Standards for Audit of 
Governmental Organizations, Programs, Activities, and Functions

 
do not prohibit this requirement. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 Two commenters recommended that the Secretary expand 
the exception for institutions that close as a result of a 
natural disaster. They suggested that the exemption apply to an 
institution that closes as a result of fire, a weather emergency, 
or other causes beyond the control of the institution. One 
commenter suggested that an institution that is closed or stops 
providing educational programs for fewer than seven instructional 
days should remain a participating institution. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary adopts the exception for closures as a 
result of a natural disaster because this event is readily 
verifiable. The Secretary acknowledges that other circumstances 
may require an institution to close on a temporary basis, but 
does not consider these other circumstances sufficient to 
establish additional exceptions to the requirements of this 
section, because the period of closure will be too short. In 
most such instances, the institution has recourse to other 
remedies, such as the arrangement for the use of other 
facilities. Indeed, the definition of 

academic year

 for most 
purposes actually recognizes that a week of instructional time 
can include a number of days in which instruction does not occur. 


Changes:

 None. 


Subpart G_Fine, Limitation, Suspension, and Termination 
Proceedings



Section 668.81 Scope and Special Definitions




Comments:

 Several commenters believed that the appeal procedures 
of this section should apply to institutions that were 
provisionally certified if the Secretary revokes the 
institution's provisional certification. Many commenters 
believed that the appeal procedures of this section should apply 
to institutions if the institution's period of participation has 
expired. Several commenters suggested that the Secretary limit, 
suspend, or terminate the eligibility of a third-party servicer 
to contract with an institution only to those services and 
Title IV, HEA programs for which the servicer has been found to 
be in violation and only to those institutions on whose behalf 
the servicer committed the violation. The commenters claimed 
that the servicer's activities and the Secretary's sanctions 
might sometimes concern violations would have no material 
relationship to the servicer's ability to provide other servicing 
functions to institutions which it serves and to other 
institutions unaffected by the original violations. 


Discussion:

 See discussions under the section of the 

Analysis of 
Comments and Changes

 that address certification procedures 
( 668.13). The Secretary does not agree with the commenters' 
suggestion that the Secretary should limit, suspend, or terminate 
the eligibility of a third-party servicer to contract with an 
institution only to those services and Title IV, HEA programs for 
which the servicer has been found to be in violation and only to 
those institutions on whose behalf the servicer committed the 
violation. The Secretary imposes a sanction against a 
third-party servicer for a violation of a Title IV, HEA program 
requirement for a specific reason, to protect the integrity of 
the Title IV, HEA program. The Secretary, if necessary, must 
reserve the right to limit, suspend, or terminate a third-party 
servicer's eligibility to administer any aspect of the Title IV, 
HEA programs for any institution to ensure that further harm does 
not occur to one or all of those programs. However, where 
appropriate, any limitation, suspension or termination action may 
be limited in scope as suggested. 


Changes:

 None. 


Section 668.82 Standard of Conduct 




Comments:

 One commenter believed that individual employees 
should not be responsible for actions beyond their control; 
instead, they should be held responsible for actions that are 
reasonable. For example, to be held responsible for accounting 
errors of other departments may be going beyond what is 
reasonable. Two commenters argued that the servicer is merely 
under contract to provide particular services, and is in no 
position to monitor the institution's compliance with other 
fiduciary matters. They also claimed that establishing a 
fiduciary standard also would establish enormous liability for 
areas beyond the servicer's control. These commenters 
recommended that clarification is needed in the regulations to 
ensure that a third-party servicer could only be held to a 
fiduciary standard for funds under that servicer's direct 
control. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary holds a third-party servicer to a 
fiduciary standard of care and diligence only in the exercise of 
the servicer's Title IV, HEA program responsibilities that the 
servicer has contracted with the institution to perform. The 
Secretary does not expect a third-party servicer to be 
responsible for aspects of administration of the Title IV, HEA 
programs or funds attributed to those programs that the servicer 
has not contracted with an institution to administer. With 
respect to the comment on the responsibility of individual 
employees, the Secretary notes that these regulations apply a 
standard of conduct only to the third-party servicer itself; 
individual employees are not held accountable under this 
provision. However, the Secretary expects a third-party servicer 
to train its employees to perform their duties consistent with 
the servicer's fiduciary obligations. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 One commenter was concerned that the provisions 
governing a third-party servicer's fiduciary duty would limit the 
servicer's ability to acquire its servicing fees from funds 
administered by the servicer.

Discussion:

 A third-party servicer entrusted with Title IV, HEA 
program funds may not use those funds to compensate itself for 
fees owed to the servicer by an institution. As provided in 
 668.18, federal funds may only be used for Title IV, HEA program 
purposes, and may not be hypothecated or used for collateral. 
The only exception would be where an institution has agreed to 
pay to the servicer all or part of the administrative cost 
allowance payable to an institution under the Title IV, HEA 
program regulations. Otherwise, the Secretary will regard any 
effort to take servicing fees directly from federal funds as a 
grave violation of a third-party servicer's fiduciary obligation, 
for which its eligibility to contract with any institution should 
be terminated. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 Several commenters believed that it is unreasonable to 
expect a third-party servicer to be held to the same fiduciary 
standards as the institution. 
Many commenters stated that the proposed language could be 
read to mean that if any employee of a third-party servicer 
(e.g., janitor or painter) has been convicted of or has pled 

nolo 
contendere

 to any crime involving government funds (not 
specifically Federal student aid), the servicer is subject to 
termination. Four of these commenters voiced concern about the 
issue of due process, because the ability to screen all 
applicants is very limited due to laws regarding privacy and 
nondiscrimination in hiring. One of the commenters stated that 
such removal may be prevented by State or Federal laws and 
perhaps expose the servicer to liability. One commenter believed 
that the provisions should be effective only for new contracts, 
because many servicers currently have contracts with 
subcontractors that do not contain the restriction regarding 
removal of an affiliation, and the servicer could be liable for 
breach of contract. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary does not agree with the comment that a 
third-party servicer should not be held to the same fiduciary 
standard as an institution. As an agent of an institution, a 
third-party servicer administers aspects of the institution's 
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. Therefore, it is 
necessary to hold a third-party servicer to the same level of 
fiduciary responsibility as the institution in handling or 
influencing the use of Title IV, HEA program funds. 
The Secretary agrees with those commenters who argued that a 
third-party servicer should not be considered to have violated 
its fiduciary duty with regard to the conduct of any person, 
entity, or officer or employee of an entity with which the 
servicer contracts, if that person or entity does not have 
Title IV-related responsibilities. For example, the Secretary 
would not hold the conduct of a custodian employed by a 
third-party servicer as an element in determining that the 
third-party servicer has violated its fiduciary duty, if that 
custodian had no responsibility for administering a Title IV, HEA 
program. 
With respect to those commenters who were concerned that the 
removal of an agent of a third-party may violate due process or 
may be prohibited by Federal or State law or may be a breach of 
contract, the Secretary does not believe that those prohibitions 
exist. However, the Secretary recommends that third-party 
servicers modify their contract terms to specify that the 
servicer is prohibited from engaging any entity to administer any 
aspect of the Title IV, HEA programs that meets the criteria in 
paragraph (d)(1)(i)(D) of this section. 
The Secretary expects a third-party servicer to apply these 
provisions to existing contracts as well as to any new contracts 
that the servicer may enter. These provisions supersede 
provisions of existing contracts that the servicer may have with 
outside entities. 


Changes:

 Paragraph (d)(1)(i)(D) of this section is revised so 
that a third-party servicer violates its fiduciary duty in 
instances where the servicer uses or contracts with, in a 
capacity that involves the administration of any aspect of the 
Title IV, HEA programs, any other person, agency, or organization 
that has been or whose officers or employees have been convicted 
of, or pled 

nolo contendere

 or guilty to, a crime involving the 
acquisition, use, or expenditure of Federal, State, or local 
government funds, or has been administratively or judicially 
determined to have committed fraud or other material violation of 
law with respect to those funds. 


Comments:

 One commenter suggested that paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B) of 
this section should be amended to exclude those instances in 
which the funds that were fraudulently or criminally obtained or 
spent were repaid. The same commenter believed that this 
provision is too broad in scope, and should be restricted only to 
crime and fraud involving funds covered by the contract between 
the institution and the servicer. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary disagrees with the commenter. A 
person that has been convicted of, pled guilty to, or has been 
determined to have engaged in criminal misconduct or fraud with 
respect to government funds poses a danger to the Title IV, HEA 
programs and the funds appropriated for use by those programs. 
Such a person has violated the public trust by misusing public 
funds. The Secretary does not believe that payment of restitution 
by that person is sufficient to guarantee that the person will 
not repeat the offense. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 Several commenters thought that the requirements in 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section were unreasonable by specifying 
that an institution or third-party servicer would violate its 
fiduciary responsibility if the servicer or a principal or 
affiliate of the servicer violated any Title IV, HEA program 
requirement. The commenters thought that the cure_to sever all 
ties with that servicer, or a principle or affiliate of that 
servicer, or to remove all responsibilities of administration of 
the Title IV, HEA programs_was too punitive in its scope.

Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees with those commenters. An institution or third-party servicer should not be considered to have
automatically violated its fiduciary responsibility if the servicer or a principal or affiliate of that servicer
violates a Title IV, HEA program requirement. The Secretary has recourse to apply the appropriate sanctions in this
subpart against an institution or third-party servicer if the servicer or a principal or affiliate of the servicer
commits a violation of any Title IV, HEA program requirement.



Changes: 

The Secretary removes the provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section.



Section 668.83 Emergency Action





Comments: 

Three commenters stated that no emergency action should be taken until the servicer has been given the opportunity
to defend its actions. One of these commenters remarked that the Secretary could be subject to lawsuit if the servicer
were proved innocent. Two commenters voiced concern that emergency actions could have a severe impact on an institution
or servicer without a promulgation of evidence. One of these commenters suggested that the language be revised to
read, ``Receives verifiable information, determined by the official to be reliable * * *.'' Four
commenters felt that emergency action should only be taken when the errors are intentional or the servicer or institution
refuses to take corrective action. One commenter felt that due process mandates that the burden of proof be on the Secretary
to show cause why an emergency action is necessary, and that the burden should shift only after the Secretary has made
a prima facie case. Several commenters stated that an emergency action against a third-party servicer should not,
as a matter of law, prohibit the servicer from engaging in the administration of any aspect of an institution's participation
in the Title IV, HEA programs, but should only be limited to that aspect where emergency action is absolutely necessitated.
The commenters felt this was necessary to provide a smooth turnover of servicing responsibilities rather than a sudden
halt which could cause chaos, confusion and loss throughout the industry, including the Department of Education,
the institution, and the borrower.



Discussion: 

The HEA specifies that the Secretary shall take an emergency action against a third-party servicer if the Secretary
receives information, determined by the Secretary to be reliable, that a third-party servicer under contract with
an eligible institution is violating any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to Title IV of the HEA, or any
applicable special arrangement, agreement, or limitation and the Secretary determines that immediate action is
necessary to prevent the misuse of Federal funds and the likelihood of loss outweighs the importance of waiting for
the final outcome of a limitation, suspension, or termination action against the servicer. An emergency action is
effective on the date that a notice and statement of the basis of the emergency action is mailed to the third-party servicer.
If a third-party servicer does not think that such action is warranted, the servicer may request a prompt show-cause
hearing. As to the concerns expressed over possible disruption, the Secretary will tailor emergency actions as he
determines necessary to protect federal interests. The Secretary also refers the reader to the discussions of emergency
actions with respect to institutions in the regulations published on March 10, 1993 (58 FR 13336).



Changes: 

None.



Sections 668.84 Fine Proceedings, 668.85 Suspension Proceedings, and 668.86 Limitation or Termination
Proceedings





Comments: 

A few commenters felt that proposed   668.84 (governing fine proceedings), 668.85 (governing suspension
proceedings), and 668.86 (governing limitation and termination proceedings) violate due process and privacy rights
by requiring that a third-party servicer apprise all clients of proposed actions. The commenters thought that notification
at that time is at a minimum premature if not inappropriate and would serve to create adversarial relations between
parties that should have a cooperative working relationship. Several commenters felt that fines should be imposed
only if the violation was ``willful'' or ``knowing.'' Another commenter felt that notification of a fine proceeding
against a third-party servicer should not be sent until the appeal process is completed because it could damage a third-party
servicer's reputation among unaffected parties and could unnecessarily alarm the servicer's client base. One commenter
recommended that the notice be limited to affected clients and suggested that if the Secretary does not want to eliminate
the notice at the beginning of a fine proceeding, the Secretary should be required to send a notice when the decision
to fine has been reversed.



Discussion: 

Quite the contrary to the commenters' views that notification to a third-party servicer's clients at the initiation
of a fine or other proceeding against the servicer violates due process, this provision protects those rights. The
potential consequences to an institution if the institution's agent violates a Title IV, HEA requirement can be severe,
covering the full range of sanctions under this subpart. Thus, notice to an institution allows the institution the
opportunity to participate in the process on behalf of its agent and in its own defense.

In addition, a sanction imposed against the servicer could have an adverse effect on the participation of an institution
that contracts with the servicer, including the severing or limiting of the contractual relationship. Early notice
to affected institutions permits them to judge the potential effect of the action on their participation and to prepare
accordingly. As the Secretary noted in the NPRM, early notice also allows an institution to take corrective action
before the conclusion of a proceeding under this subpart. The Secretary also corrects here two misunderstandings
of these commenters: it is the designated department official, not the third-party servicer, who provides notice
under this subpart; and the designated department official notifies only those institutions affected by the servicer's
violations, not all institutions that contract with the servicer.

The Secretary is sensitive to those who were concerned about how notification in the initiation of a fine proceeding
could affect a third-party servicer's reputation, but notes that information about actions the Secretary takes
with regard to violations of Title IV, HEA program requirements is publicly available and is required by section 494C
of the HEA to be shared at least with SPREs and by 34 CFR part 603 with accrediting agencies. The Secretary has provided,
in  668.90, for notification to all affected institutions that contract with a third-party servicer of the
Secretary's final decision with regard to appeals under this subpart.

In determining whether to impose a fine, the amount of a fine, or whether to impose any other sanction for a violation
of a Title IV, HEA program requirement, the Secretary always considers the extent to which the violation was deliberate.
The Secretary does not consider it necessary to specify that consideration in these regulations.



Changes: 

None.



Comments: 

Several commenters suggested that in the case of a proceeding against an institution, the Secretary should notify
the third-party servicers that contract with that institution, because the functions performed by certain third-party
servicers could continue to be performed inadvertently when, in fact, the Secretary has limited, suspended, or terminated
those activities. The commenters further recommended that in the case of a suspension, limitation, or termination
against an institution the Secretary inform each third-party servicer that contracts with the institution of the
consequences of the action to the servicer. The commenters also request parallel notification provisions concerning
hearings and the submission of written material in the absence of a hearing.



Discussion: 

The Secretary expects an institution to provide immediate notice as necessary to its employees, agents and third-party
servicers to comply with the terms of any action taken by the Department. The Secretary notes that he does not hold a
third-party servicer responsible for violations of Title IV, HEA program requirements committed solely by an institution.
Therefore, the Secretary does not consider it necessary to establish provisions for the notification separately
to third-party servicers in every case.

Comments: 

Two commenters strongly objected to the proposal to include, as a specific basis for any of these proceedings against
an institution or a third-party servicer, a substantial misrepresentation of the institution's educational program,
financial charges, or employability of the institution's graduates by an institution or servicer under contract
with an institution, as applicable. The commenters felt that this proposal would require a third-party servicer
to monitor a client institution's marketing of its educational program, its admissions process and the appropriateness
of the financial charges as well as the statements made, verbal or written, regarding the employability of the institution's
graduates. One commenter suggested that the application of this provision be limited to third-party servicers that
provide services such as marketing for institutions. One commenter suggested that misrepresentation of eligibility
of a location be added to the violations subject to the imposition of a fine.



Discussion: 

These provisions, with respect to third-party servicers, are aimed at just such servicers as those mentioned by one
of the commenters_those that provide marketing or other services designed to represent an institution to prospective
students and the public. However, the provisions can apply equally to any other third-party servicer that, in the
conduct of its activities under a contract with an institution, deliberately misrepresents the nature of the institution's
educational program or other relevant information. These provisions do not require a third-party servicer to take
any special steps to monitor an institution's activities. The servicer being an agent of the institution is expected
simply to avoid misrepresenting the institution. Subpart F of this part describes what constitutes misrepresentation.
Misrepresentation of the eligibility of an institution's educational program clearly falls within the meaning
of the term under subpart F and further may constitute fraud under the provisions of  668.83, providing a potential
basis for an emergency action. In the February 17, 1994, NPRM, the Secretary emphasized the seriousness with which
he regards misrepresentation and the potential danger that misrepresentation poses to the Title IV, HEA programs.
Commenters have not persuaded the Secretary to modify that view.



Changes: 

None.



Comments: 

One commenter felt that the Secretary should not pursue action against a contracting institution until the matter
with the third-party servicer is resolved and also requested that the Secretary not fine both the servicer and the
institution for the same occurrence. The commenter recommended that the proposed effective date of the suspension,
limitation, or termination, which is at least 20 days after the mailing of the notice of intent, be revised to either
30 calendar days or 20 business days to allow sufficient time for preparation of a response. A commenter suggested
that a fine be imposed only for material violations of Title IV, HEA program requirements.



Discussion: 

The Secretary reserves the right to initiate an action against an institution at any point at which the Secretary determines
that the action is necessary. The protection of the Title IV, HEA programs requires this flexibility. Whether to impose
fines on both an institution and a third-party servicer, and the amount of those fines, for the same occurrence depends
on the degree to which each party caused or is otherwise responsible for the violation.

The Secretary considers 20 days generally to be sufficient time for the notified party to prepare a response. The Secretary
notes, however, that this provision establishes a minimum time frame. The Secretary may allow additional time if
the Secretary determines that the circumstances of the proceeding require more.

The Secretary does not consider it advisable to restrict the imposition of fines to material violations of Title IV,
HEA program requirements. However,  668.92 describes generally the factors that the Secretary may consider
in determining the amount of a fine.



Changes: 

None.



Sections 668.87 Prehearing Conference, 668.88 Hearing, 668.89 Authority and Responsibilities of the Hearing
Official, 668.90 Initial and Final Decisions_Appeals, and 668.91 Filing of Requests for Hearings and Appeals; Confirmation
of Mailing and Receipt Dates





Comments: 

Several commenters questioned the absence of criteria in the regulations for the qualification of the hearing officer.
The commenters also suggested that procedures should be established to allow for the participants to inform the hearing
officer of details of the issues given the generally complex issues involved in most cases. The commenters recommended
that the Secretary be required to provide a copy of the transcript described in  668.88(d) to all parties within
ten days of the hearing. Several commenters felt that any decision should be governed by a ``reasonableness'' standard
to limit the liabilities of parties participating or providing servicing of the Title IV, HEA programs in good faith.
The commenters thought that the process should allow for extenuating circumstances and that the hearing official
should have the authority to interpret regulations and to rule them inapplicable. Another commenter believed that
the hearing official should be bound by not only all applicable statutes and regulations but also other guidance deemed
to be in effect by the Secretary to ensure that ``Dear Colleague'' letters and other written guidance from the Department
of Education be included. One commenter believed that any prehearing conference with a third-party servicer should
include any institution that has a contract with that servicer and who could potentially be affected by the Secretary's
action. One commenter suggested that  668.89 be modified to require that the hearing official be bound not only
by ``all applicable statutes and regulations'' but also by all applicable judicial precedent, the Constitution,
Federal statutes of general applicability, including the United States Bankruptcy Code.

One commenter questioned the statement that if the hearing officer finds that a termination is warranted, the Secretary
affirms that decision asking if the Secretary intends to automatically affirm the hearing official's decision.
A few commenters suggested that an institution or third-party servicer should be able to introduce new evidence on
appeal noting that the Secretary should have the opportunity to have complete information that may not have been presented
at the original fact-finding sessions. These commenters thought that the emphasis in resolving the issue should
be on arriving at the most fair and most logical conclusion as opposed to conforming to a stringent pattern or process.
One commenter felt that the Secretary should not have a special process for fraud investigations and there should
not be limitations placed on a hearing official's ability to act. The commenter believed that the proposed procedures
would unfairly limit the due process procedures available to participants in the system and that the current procedures
do not require further modification.

Discussion: 

The Secretary has considered the suggestions from the commenters that some minimum standards be set out in the regulations
to establish qualifications for the hearing officer, but does not believe that any such actions are appropriate.
The hearing official is charged with the responsibility of resolving the issues requested in the appeal, and the parties
bear the responsibility of presenting the issues in controversy. The hearing official meets requirements for experience
and capability in accordance with internal Department procedures, and no additional requirements are needed in
these regulations. Additionally, the hearing official's decisions involving limitations, suspensions, terminations
and fines may be appealed to the Secretary under this subpart. This appeal to the Secretary provides an additional
procedural safeguard that the issue will be resolved fairly in a manner that is consistent with other decisions issued
by the Secretary.
The Secretary does not agree with the suggestion that additional regulations are necessary to permit the participants
to inform the hearing officer of details of the issues due to the generally complex issues involved in some cases. Under
the regulations, any party may request a prehearing conference that would address how the parties could present the
relevant issues to the hearing official. In addition, the parties have the opportunity to make their position known
in the pleadings required by the hearing official.
The Secretary agrees with the commenters that an institution or third-party servicer who is the respondent in an administrative
hearing should be provided with a copy of a transcript when one is prepared by the Department of Education. Under current
procedures, a transcription is routinely made of any adverse action initiated under this subpart, and a copy of the
transcript is provided to the respondent.
The Secretary disagrees with the suggestion that the regulations establish a ``reasonableness'' standard to limit
the liabilities of parties participating or providing servicing of the Title IV, HEA programs in good faith. Institutions
and third-party servicers are fiduciaries that are entrusted with properly administering the Title IV, HEA programs.
Establishing a lesser negligence is inappropriate, particularly given the advance system of Title IV, HEA funding
used by the overwhelming majority of participating institutions. As fiduciaries, these parties are held to one of
the highest standards of accountability, and it is inappropriate to excuse or reduce a liability that is caused by
a subjective good faith belief purportedly held by the institution or third-party servicer. Business decisions
that concern the degree of care and oversight required by institutions and third-party servicers must take into consideration
their responsibility for adhering to the applicable program requirements.
The Secretary also rejects any suggestion that the hearing official be given discretion to refuse to apply applicable
regulations to a dispute. The regulations constitute final determinations by the Secretary concerning the requirements
that must be followed by institutions and third-party servicers to participate in the HEA programs. The hearing official
must apply the regulations as written. This process provides certainty to all parties, and enables the development
and enforcement of a consistent body of administrative rulings.
The Secretary appreciates the suggestion of commenters who urged that guidance issued by the Department in the form
of manuals, handbooks, other publications or Dear Colleague letters should be binding the hearing official in the
same manner as regulations. However, such guidance does not have the same legal force as regulations issued pursuant
to formal rulemaking. The Secretary believes that such guidance does provide a foundation against which the reasonableness
of the institution's or third-party servicer's conduct may be judged. In the context of resolving whether the institution
or third-party servicer violated a regulation or statute, or breached its fiduciary duties, the hearing official
should evaluate the institution's or third-party servicer's actions based upon whether it made a good faith effort
to apply and follow the guidance issued by the Department. The Secretary believes that actions taken contrary to such
guidance would be presumptively improper and should be viewed as such by a hearing official. The Secretary further
believes it will be a rare instance where a party can demonstrate that it fulfilled its fiduciary obligation and complied
with statutory or regulatory requirements while failing to heed or apply guidance issued by the Department of Education
as to the proper application of statutory or regulatory provisions.
The Secretary does not agree that it is necessary to list all possible authority binding on the hearing official. The
parties are free to cite any authority they feel may govern a particular case or issue. Section 668.89(d) is included
to preclude hearing official from ignoring or refusing to apply departmental statutes and regulations. If a hearing
otherwise fails to apply applicable authority, a party may appeal to the Secretary.
The Secretary does not agree that an adverse action initiated against a third-party servicer must necessarily include
any institution that has a contract with that servicer who could potentially be affected by the Secretary's action.
The particular facts in each case will determine the party or parties against whom an adverse action is taken, and in
some instances it may be appropriate for an institution and its servicer to both be named as respondents. In some cases,
a third-party servicer against whom an adverse action is initiated may ask the Department to expand the administrative
action to encompass the institutions that are relevant to the administrative action. Again, the Secretary believes
that the particular facts of each case will have to be considered to determine the appropriate actions, rather than
expanding the scope of the regulations to require such participation by other parties in every case.
The commenter also suggested that such participation by a third-party servicer's customers should be considered
because an adverse ruling would have an impact on every other client for that servicer, especially where a termination
or debarment action were sought. However, the resulting impact of a termination or a debarment of a third-party servicer
on the servicer's customers is not a sufficient basis for these parties to be given a right to be represented in any prehearing
conference. To invite all potentially affected parties to the hearing would complicate the proceedings. The proper
focus of the administrative proceeding is determining whether the limitation, termination, or suspension should
be imposed based upon the cited program violations.

The Secretary has modified the proposed regulation to provide that any initial decision by a hearing official that
is appealed to the Secretary may be affirmed, reversed, remanded to the hearing official, or modified. The Secretary
also notes that the regulations require a hearing official to uphold certain adverse actions when specific findings
are made as set out in  668.90. Although the Secretary reserves the discretion to review such rulings on appeal,
these administrative decisions already reflect the Secretary's judgment that such action is appropriate under
those facts, and modification of any such ruling will be rare.
The Secretary disagrees with the suggestion that an institution or third-party servicer should be able to introduce
new evidence on appeal. The administrative process requires that the relevant information necessary for the decision
will be presented to the hearing official within the time limits set out in the regulations. Any appeal to the Secretary
must be based solely upon that information already in the administrative record and upon items which may be judicially
noticed. Any subsequent opportunity to introduce new evidence on appeal would deprive the hearing official of the
opportunity to have issued a decision based upon a complete record, and could discourage a respondent from placing
its complete case before the hearing official at the appropriate time. This system of resolution is fairer and more
efficient because it provides each party with an opportunity to have their complete case heard by a hearing official
and then, where appropriate, have the initial decision reviewed by the Secretary on appeal.
The Secretary believes that it is appropriate to include fraud as a finding in  668.90 for which an adverse action
must be upheld where the hearing official makes a determination that the underlying activity has occurred. This addition
to the regulation reelects the Secretary's determination that any fraud committed by an institution or third-party
servicer is serious enough to warrant the imposition of the adverse action sought. In such instances, and consistent
with the other items that have been placed into this category in the past such as missed audit submissions, it is appropriate
to limit the discretion of the hearing official in accordance with the Secretary's determination that this category
of finding warrants the adverse action initiated by the designated Department official. Furthermore, the regulation
provides certainty to all parties concerning the gravity of the underlying violation, while providing an institution
or third-party servicer an opportunity to request an administrative appeal to a hearing official concerning whether
the respondent committed fraud.


Changes: 

The regulations have been changed to provide that the Secretary may affirm, reverse, remand to the hearing official,
or modify any initial decision that is appealed to the Secretary. Section 668.88 has also been amended to specify that
no charge is made to provide one copy of the transcript to the hearing to an institution or a third-party servicer.


Section 668.92 Fines




Comments: 

A number of commenters responded to the Secretary's request for comment and agreed that repeated mechanical systemic
unintentional errors should be treated as a single violation for purposes of assessing a fine against a third-party
servicer. However, one commenter argued that total compensation for the value of the error should be expected. Another
commenter suggested that the Secretary should address cases in which the third-party servicer deliberately failed
to implement a regulation or failed to institute programming corrections relating to previously cited findings
identified by an auditor, client, or the Secretary. The commenter believes that in these situations the fines should
be significant based upon the risk of loss due to the servicer's negligence.
Several commenters felt that it would be inappropriate to adjust the amount of a fine simply based upon the size of the
institution or servicer, claiming that a small organization should not benefit and a large organization should not
be penalized solely on their size. One commenter suggested that the purpose of considering the size of the servicer's
business was to take into consideration the dollar value of the violation in comparison to the overall value of the
contracts being serviced by the servicer and suggested that language be added concerning the assessment of materiality
of the violation. A few commenters supported a position that the determination of the size of any fine take into account
the extensiveness and gravity of the violation and should be assessed in direct correlation to any loss of funds. The
commenters also felt that the fines should only be assessed against the party who was directly responsible for the
violation and supported the provision that the servicer may provide evidence that the institution contributed to
the violation.
One commenter felt that any references to special arrangements should be deleted and noted that performing any statutory
and regulatory requirement should cover all applicable situations.


Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees with the commenter who suggested that, in determining the amount of the fine to be assessed against
a third-party servicer for a violation of a Title IV, HEA program requirement, a repeated mechanical systemic unintentional
error need not be counted as a single violation if the servicer had been previously cited for this type of error and had
failed to implement corrections. With respect to the commenter who suggested that in determining the amount of a fine
with respect to a repeated mechanical systemic unintentional error, that the amount of the fine should at least be
equal to the total value caused by the error, the Secretary does not agree with that comment. However, the Secretary
does agree that the determination of the amount of the fine should take into consideration the amount of Title IV, HEA
program funds that were lost due to the error.

<TEXT>
 

With respect to the concerns expressed about the relationship of the amount of a fine to the size of an institution or
of a third-party servicer's business, the Secretary points out that the size of an institution or business has a bearing
on whether the institution or servicer has overextended its capability of properly administering the Title IV, HEA
programs and the extent to which harm has been done to the programs. 


With respect to the commenter who thought that the phrase special arrangement should be deleted from this section,
the Secretary does not agree with that commenter. Special arrangements are based on individual circumstance and
therefore should be taken into consideration. However, as noted elsewhere in the comments and discussion section,
the Secretary clarifies special arrangements to refer to those special arrangements entered into under the authority
of statutes applicable to Title IV of the HEA. 



Changes:

 Paragraph (a)(5) is revised to specify that as one of the criteria in determining the extent to which violations are
caused by a repeated mechanical systemic unintentional error, the total number of violations is considered to be
a single violation, provided the third-party servicer has not previously been cited for this type of error and had
failed to make the appropriate corrections to the system where the violation originated. In determining the amount
of a fine, the Secretary also takes into consideration, as applicable, the financial loss to the Title IV, HEA programs
that was attributable to the repeated mechanical systemic unintentional error. 



Section 668.94 Termination 





Comments:

 One commenter recommended that the regulations be amended to terminate the eligibility to perform some but not all
of the services provided by the third-party servicer, claiming that some functions provided by the servicer may continue
to meet the applicable requirements of the program. This change would recognize that a third-party servicer may provide
multiple and unrelated functions under the Title IV, HEA programs. Many commenters expressed concern about the provision
in  668.94(c) requiring the servicer to return to each institution that contracts with the servicer all records
pertaining to the servicer's administration of that program on behalf of that institution. One commenter suggested
that since the institution may contract with another servicing entity, the records should be passed to the new servicer
as specified by the institution. Many commenters pointed out that the records maintained by the third-party servicer
appear on microfiche, imaging disc, microfilm, or in paper form and the servicer will be able to provide copies of such
records but not the original records. One commenter suggested an expansion to require the servicer to return servicer
notes, related documents, records or copies of such notes, related documents and records that pertain to the servicer's
administration of the program on behalf of the institution. The commenter further suggested that the servicer certify
copies as exact copies whenever required by law. The commenter also suggested that a sentence be added to protect the
proprietary rights of the servicer to data base media, servicing procedures, computer programs, software packages,
servicer forms, and other proprietary information, procedures and materials. Another commenter noted that copies
of records for a single institution's loans may be commingled with records pertaining to other institutions and suggested
that servicers should be permitted to provide records upon request rather than all at once. 




Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenters that it may be appropriate to terminate the eligibility of a third-party
servicer to perform some but not all of the activities under certain circumstances. In other situations, however,
a violation may be so egregious that complete termination from being able to administer any aspect of the institution's
participation is appropriate. The Secretary believes that the regulations provide the needed flexibility to determine
the correct action to be taken. 

Records relating to a third-party servicer's administration of any aspect of an institution's participation in
the Title IV, HEA programs are the institution's property. A third-party servicer may make copies of the original
records that it provides to an institution if the contract between the servicer and institution is terminated. See
the discussion in  668.25 on records. 

The Secretary does not agree that the regulations need to be expanded to cover servicer notes, related documents,
records, or copies of such notes; that is a matter between the institution and the servicer. The Secretary does not
believe that it is necessary to add regulatory language to protect the proprietary rights of the servicer since adequate
protection already exists through copyright laws to serve this purpose. 



Changes:

 None. 



Section 668.95 Reimbursements, Refunds, and Offsets 





Comments:

 Several commenters recommended that the reference to third-party servicer in  668.95(c) be removed because
the servicer generally makes no claims for benefits on its own behalf therefore funds would not be available to be offset.
Another commenter noted that if the Secretary is transmitting funds directly to a third-party servicer on behalf
of institutions, the funds are for multiple institutions and to offset an unaffected institution's funds would not
be reasonable or fair. One commenter requested that the provision in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section that would
have the servicer or institution repay any discounts, premiums, or excess interest paid under 34 CFR part 682 be eliminated
stating that the payment of premiums and discounts are contract issues between two lenders in the FFEL programs and
should not be assessed to other parties or repaid to the Secretary. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary disagrees with those commenters who recommended removing reference to a third-party servicer from
the provision governing the ability of the Secretary to offset any benefits or claims due to an institution or third-party
servicer against any payment that an institution or third-party servicer may owe to the Secretary. A situation may
arise where a third-party servicer makes a claim against the Department of Education for funds owed to the servicer
and the Secretary wants to offset that claim because the servicer has not repaid a liability owed the Department of
Education for a violation of the Title IV, HEA program requirement. 

The Secretary also does not accept the comment that paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section should be removed. This provision
is particularly relevant to an institution's participation in the FFEL programs. 



Changes:

 None. 



Subpart H_Appeal procedures for Audit Determinations and Program Review Determinations 



Section 668.114 Notification of Hearing 






Comments:

 Several commenters suggested that with respect to a third-party servicer's request for review, the hearing official
only notify the institutions to whom the findings were originally disclosed since a third-party servicer may have
added new clients during the period between the publication of the findings and the announcement of the hearing and
the new clients would not be aware of the findings and could be confused by the notice of the hearing. Another commenter
felt only institutions that contract with the servicer of the affected functions should be notified. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that subsequent notices from the hearing official should be sent only to the actual parties to
the proceeding. In the cases of institutions receiving similar services to those at issue in the proceeding, they
need not be notified. As discussed above, the need for notice to other affected institutions is satisfied with notice
of the final determination. Therefore, there is no need to impose the burden on the hearing official of providing notice
to every institution with which a third-party servicer contracts. 



Changes:

 Section 668.114(b) is revised to require notice only to the actual parties to the proceeding. 



Section 668.116 Hearing 





Comments:

 Several commenters recommended that an institution or third-party servicer also have the burden of proving that
the findings are not substantial in nature. The commenters felt that some findings or alleged violations may be irrefutable,
but their effect may be strictly limited, posing immaterial impact on the integrity of the servicer's or lender's
portfolio. One commenter felt that a third-party servicer should only have the burden of proving that the ``expenditures
questioned or disallowed were proper'' to the extent that the servicer contracts with the institution for cash management
of Title IV, HEA program funds and that the Secretary should not question servicing fee income since it is not considered
Title, IV HEA program funds. A few commenters suggested deleting references to the time frames within which an institution
must have provided documentation previously stating that any legitimate documentation regarding the subject at
issue should be admissible and the time frames within which it was previously submitted are irrelevant to their authenticity
or material relationship to the case. Several commenters felt that the transcribed records of the proceeding should
only be made available to the hearing participants and not to any institution that contracts with the servicer. 




Discussion:

 With respect to the suggestion that an institution or third-party servicer need only prove that findings are ``not
substantial,'' the Secretary disagrees that the standard for accountability for Federal funds should be relaxed.
An institution, or its third-party servicer, is a fiduciary and duty bound to use the highest standard of care and diligence
at all times in the administration of the Title IV HEA programs. The suggested language would weaken this standard.
If, as suggested by the commenters, a violation truly has an immaterial impact, then there will no significant liabilities
assessed.

The commenter who felt that a third-party servicer should not have to justify expenditure of its fee income is correct.
Section 668.116(d) only requires proof that Title IV HEA program funds were properly expended. 


With respect to the comments on altering the time periods for submission of documentation by institutions, the Secretary
notes that the purpose of this rulemaking it to make existing regulations applicable to third-party servicers and
not to extensively modify the hearing procedures. The Secretary believes that the present procedures are consistent
with an institution's record-keeping and fiduciary obligations; institution's complying with these obligations
should have, and have had, no difficulty in meeting established deadlines. Further, requiring submission of documentation
with a request for review allows cases to be resolved without hearing. 

With respect to the comment that hearing transcripts need only be provided to the hearing participants, the Secretary
agrees. Further since the records of these proceedings are generally available under the Freedom of Information
Act, the Secretary agrees that reference to availability under that act is unnecessary. Those who are not parties
to the proceedings can request the transcript pursuant to that act, subject to any applicable exceptions to release
of the requested information. 




Changes:

 Section 668.116(g)(2) is revise to require that the hearing transcript be sent only to the parties to the proceeding
and eliminate the reference to the Freedom of Information Act. 



Part 682_Federal Family Education Loan Programs 





Subpart D_Guaranty Agency Programs 



Section 682.401 Basic Program Agreement 






Comments:

 Several commenters suggested that the provision in this section relating to contract submissions be modified so
that a third-party servicer would not be required to submit a copy of its contract to the Secretary unless so requested
by the Secretary. 




Discussion:

 The Secretary understands the commenters concerns that the copy of a third-party servicer's contract with a guaranty
agency contains proprietary information that the servicer does not wish to be made public. Many of the commenters
were concerned that a copy of a third-party servicer's contract would be released under the Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA). The Secretary wishes to assure third-party servicers that trade secrets and confidential commercial
or financial information is not releasable under FOIA. Parties concerned over possible release should, however,
take appropriate precautions by marking submitted contracts as confidential. This provision is intended only to
facilitate oversight and make the Secretary aware of all the services the third-party servicer has contracted to
provide. Although many commenters believed that a third-party servicer could accomplish this by summarizing the
services it has contracted to provide. In order to verify this information, the Secretary would need a copy of the actual
contract. Therefore, the Secretary has decided to retain this requirement in the final rule. 



Changes:

 None. 



Section 682.413 Remedial Actions 





Comments:

 Several commenters objected to a third-party servicer being held jointly and severally liable for any interest benefits
and special allowance its client received on its FFELP loan portfolio when the servicer may not have been responsible
for billing the Department for such monies. Some commenters believed that clarification to this provision is necessary
to ensure that a third-party servicer is not held jointly or severally liable for any violations which it did not commit.




Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenters that a third-party servicer should not be held responsible for any program
violations it did not commit. The regulations do not hold a third-party servicer jointly or severally liable for any
interest benefits or special allowance received by a lender for which the lender was not eligible if that servicer
complied with program regulations. However, a third-party servicer that is not responsible for billing the Department
for interest benefits and special allowance may be responsible for the lender receiving interest benefits and special
allowance for which the lender is not eligible because the servicer has violated other program requirements. The
Secretary believes that a third-party servicer should be responsible for its actions and that holding a third-party
servicer potentially liable for Federal monies expended because it has committed program violations helps accomplish
this. The Secretary also believes that holding lenders and servicers jointly and severally liable is the best way
to protect the Federal fiscal interest. See prior discussion on this issue under  668.25 and in the February
17, 1994 NPRM. 

The Secretary is sensitive that this provision makes a significant change in how responsibility for liabilities
may be covered in contracts that servicers enter with lenders. Therefore, the Secretary has established an order
in which he will attempt to collect such liabilities. The Secretary will first attempt to collect such liabilities
from the lender and, if necessary, offset the lender's first future claim to the Secretary for interest benefits and
special allowance for the amount of the liability. The Secretary believes that this is the most effective and efficient
means to collect a liability and that he will be successful in collecting from the lender in most cases. However, the
situation may arise when the Secretary is not able to collect these monies from a lender because the lender chooses
not to submit further claims, discontinues its participation in the FFEL programs, or becomes insolvent and is taken
over by banking regulators. Because such circumstances may arise, the Secretary retains the option of holding a third-party
servicer jointly and severally liable with a lender for such liabilities. However, the Secretary intends to exercise
his authority to collect a liability from a third-party servicer under this provision only when he is unable to collect
such monies from the lender. 



Changes:

 The Secretary has revised this provision so that the Secretary will not attempt to collect interest benefits or special
allowance from a third-party servicer unless the Secretary is unable to collect from the lender with which the servicer
has contracted. 



Comments:

 Several commenters asked the Secretary to clarify this section to specify when the 30-day period begins that determines
when a lender must repay or make satisfactory arrangements to repay a liability resulting from a third-party servicer's
action before the Secretary will attempt to collect from the servicer. Several commenters also suggested that the
Secretary should attempt to collect such monies by offsetting a lender's claim for interest benefits and special
allowance. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenters that clarification is needed. The Secretary also agrees with the commenters
that offsetting a lender's bill for interest benefits and special allowance for the amount of the liability may prove
to be an effective means to collect the liability from the lender. The Secretary will exercise this option to collect
such liabilities from a lender whenever he believes this method is in the best interests of the FFEL programs and the
Federal fiscal interest.

Changes: 

The Secretary has amended this section to clarify that 
the lender must repay or make satisfactory arrangements to repay 
a liability within 30 days from the date the Secretary originally 
requests such repayment from the lender before the Secretary will 
attempt to collect from the third-party servicer. 



Comments: 

Many commenters suggested that the liability of a 
third-party servicer acting as an agent for a guaranty agency be 
removed because the commenters believed that the servicer does 
not play a role under this provision that would subject it a 
liability. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary does not agree with the commenters. A 
third-party servicer that is administering any aspect of a 
guaranty agency's FFEL programs may be responsible for the 
guaranty agency paying a claim that is not eligible for 
reinsurance. This situation may occur when the servicer is 
negligent in reviewing the history of the loans consolidated in a 
Federal Consolidation loan under 34 CFR 682.206(f) when a default 
claim is submitted that results in the agency subsequently 
receiving reinsurance on such a claim. This would result in a 
liability being created by the servicer's actions. 



Changes: 

None. 



Section 682.416 Requirements for Third-Party Servicers and 
Lenders Contracting With Third-Party Servicers





Standards for administrative capability. 

Comments: 

Many commenters suggested that the Secretary qualify 
the term business systems so that it was clear that such systems 
included combined automatic and manual systems. The commenters 
believed that this term, without qualification, implied only 
computer-supported systems. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees with the commenters that it is 
appropriate to qualify the term ``business systems.'' 



Changes: 

The Secretary has amended this provision to clarify 
that business systems include combined automated and manual 
systems. 



Standards of financial responsibility. Comments: 

Many commenters believed that the financial standards 
the Secretary was proposing for an institution should not be used 
for third-party servicers because a third-party servicer in the 
FFEL programs has different financial obligations and 
responsibilities than an institution. Many commenters believed 
that any requirements related exclusively to functions that are 
not required by FFEL programs servicers should be deleted, such 
as deferred tuition accounts. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees with the commenters in that a 
third-party servicer should not be held responsible for meeting 
financial standards that are unrelated to the functions which it 
is not responsible to perform. The Secretary does not intend to 
require a third-party servicer that is administering aspects of 
the FFEL programs on behalf of a lender or guaranty agency to be 
required to meet financial standards with respect to items that 
are unrelated its contractual obligations with the lender or 
guaranty agency. The Secretary does not agree with the 
commenters that a third-party servicer should not otherwise meet 
financial standards that are similar to those an institution is 
required to meet. The Secretary believes that it was the intent 
of Congress to ensure that the FFEL programs are protected from 
any risk that may involve the servicer's financial status, 
persons responsible for administering or controlling the 
servicer, or the servicer's performance. Therefore, the 
Secretary has decided to require a third-party servicer to meet 
the standards for financial responsibility similar to those 
required of institutions of higher education. 



Changes: 

The Secretary has clarified the regulations so that 
only the provisions of 34 CFR 668.15(b) (1) through (4) and (6) 
through (9) will apply to a third-party servicer under this part. 



Past performance of third-party servicer or persons affiliated 
with servicer. Comments: 

Many commenters believed that these provisions are too 
inclusive and should only include corporate officers of only 
those third-party servicers handling Federal funds. Other 
commenters believed that the Secretary should qualify this 
restriction with respect to entities with which a third-party 
servicer contracts. The commenters suggested that only persons, 
entities, or officers or employees of an entity with which a 
third-party servicer contracts that act in a capacity that 
involves the administration of Title IV, HEA program funds should 
cause the servicer to not be considered financially responsible. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that a third-party servicer 
that has persons affiliated with it that have been convicted of 
or pled 

nolo contendere 

to the crimes described in these sections 
presents an unreasonable risk to the integrity of the FFEL 
programs and places Federal monies at risk. However, the 
Secretary believes that such risk is evident only when a person 
or entity acts in a capacity that involves the administration of 
Title IV, HEA program funds. 



Changes: 

The Secretary has amended this provision to clarify 
that a third-party servicer that contracts with an outside entity 
will not be considered financially responsible if any person, 
entity, or officer or employee of such entity acts in a capacity 
that involves the administration of Title IV, HEA program funds. 



Subpart G_Limitation, Suspension, or Termination of Lender 
Eligibility Under the FFEL Program and the PLUS Program



Section 682.701 Definitions and Terms Used in This Subpart





Comments: 

Many commenters suggested that a suspension of a 
third-party servicer should only apply to that servicer's ability 
to enter into new contracts with Title IV, HEA program 
participants. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary does not agree with the commenters. 
The Secretary believes that when the servicer's actions are 
serious enough to warrant suspending that servicer, it presents 
an unreasonable risk to Federal monies to allow that servicer to 
continue to perform FFEL programs functions for any Title IV, HEA 
program participant for the duration of the suspension. 



Changes: 

None. 



Section 682.704 Emergency Action





Comments: 

Many commenters suggested that an emergency action 
should become effective after a period of time has elapsed after 
the third-party servicer receives notification from the 
Department that it intends to take such action. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary does not agree with the commenters. 
The Secretary believes that an emergency action should be taken 
when continued participation of an entity in the FFEL programs 
seriously jeopardizes the integrity of the FFEL programs and puts 
Federal funds at risk. The Secretary believes that such action 
should be taken immediately when the behavior of the entity 
justifies taking such action. 



Changes: 

None. 



PART 690_FEDERAL PELL GRANT PROGRAM


Section 690.83 Submission of Reports

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940429-0-00237 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940429-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Comments: 

Four commenters believed that  690.83(e) of the 
proposed regulations does not comply with the statute because, in 
implementing section 487(c)(7) of the HEA, it places undue 
restrictions on an institution seeking additional funds which the 
institution would have been eligible to receive if it had met 
Federal Pell Grant Program reporting deadlines. One commenter 
stated that the Secretary had unduly limited the scope of section 
487(c)(7) of the HEA by making the provision of this section 
applicable only to funds received under the Federal Pell Grant 
Program. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that the proposed rule in 
 690.83(e) is in accordance with the program statute. When an 
institution's auditor identifies underreported Federal Pell Grant 
expenditures beyond the normal reporting and reconciliation 
deadlines for the Federal Pell Grant Program,  690.83(e) provides 
a mechanism for an institution to receive credit for having 
properly expended those funds. Congress intended that an 
institution have such a mechanism available. However, the 
Secretary does not believe that Congress intended for such 
accounting recaptures of properly expended funds to continue in 
perpetuity. In order for the Department to complete its own 
accounting for the Federal Pell Grant Program appropriations, 
institutions are expected to timely reconcile the expenditures 
throughout the award year, with a final accounting made on or 
before September 30. The procedures in  690.83(e) will provide a 
further opportunity for an institution to seek credit for having 
properly expended these funds during a prior award year, but the 
Secretary believes it is appropriate to limit the circumstances 
and timing for receiving credit for such prior expenditures. 
Furthermore,  690.83(e) is limited to the Federal Pell Grant 
Program because the auditing procedure permitted under  690.83(e) 
results in an adjustment to the institution's prior year funding 
authorization for the Federal Pell Grant Program. There is no 
corresponding capability to adjust prior year funding for the 
other Title IV, HEA programs. 



Changes: 

None. 



Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 





Comments: 

Several commenters disagreed with the Department's 
computation of the annual public reporting and recordkeeping 
burden contained in the regulations. Another commenter 
questioned whether the Department had complied with the 
requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act and its implementing 
regulations in 5 CFR part 1320. This commenter also believed 
that students should be considered in computing the burden. 



Discussion: 

The Department's computation of the annual public 
reporting and recordkeeping burden in the regulations is an 
estimate based on the best information available. The Department 
identified sections of the regulations containing information 
collection requirements in the preamble to the proposed 
regulations and complied with all applicable requirements of the 
Paperwork Reduction Act and its implementing regulations in 5 CFR 
part 1320. The Department appreciates the additional information 
provided by commenters regarding the estimated burden. To the 
extent that commenters identified specific regulatory provisions 
as imposing burdens or provided estimates of the amount of burden 
imposed, this information has been considered in developing the 
final regulations. The Department did not consider students in 
computing the estimated burden of the information collection 
requirements in the regulations because the regulations govern 
postsecondary institutions participating in the Title IV student 
financial assistance programs. If any burden is imposed on 
students, it is indirect and not subject to computation under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act. As a result of the comments and 
revisions to the regulations, the Department is modifying the 
burden estimates. The total annual reporting and recordkeeping 
burden that would result from the collection of the information 
is 123,485 burden hours for the package. 



Changes: 

None. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 





Comments: 

In the NPRMs, the Secretary certified that the 
proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities. Several commenters 
suggested that this statement was erroneous and that these rules 
will definitely have a significant impact on institutions, 
especially the smaller ones that are not computerized. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary recognizes that the regulations will 
have an impact on small institutions. However, based on 
Department estimates of the impact, the Secretary does not 
believe that the impact will be disproportionately or 
economically significant. The Secretary therefore reaffirms his 
certification that the regulations would not have a significant 
economic impact or a substantial significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. To the extent that 
commenters are able to provide additional information on the 
economic impact of the regulations, the Secretary invites the 
commenters to submit this information so that it may be 
considered in reviewing the regulations to reduce regulatory 
burden. 



Changes: 

None. 



Executive Order 12866 



These final regulations have been reviewed in accordance 
with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the 
Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this 
regulatory action. 

The potential costs associated with the final regulations 
are those resulting from statutory requirements and those 
determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering the 
Title IV, HEA programs effectively and efficiently. Burdens 
specifically associated with information collection requirements 
were identified and explained in the NPRMs that were published on 
February 17 and February 28, 1994, respectively. 

In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both 
quantitative and qualitative_of these regulations, the Secretary 
has determined that the benefits of the regulations justify the 
costs. 

The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory 
action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal 
government in the exercise of their governmental functions. 



Invitation To Comment 



Interested persons are invited to submit comments and 
recommendations regarding these regulations. The Secretary will 
consider any comments received within the designated comment 
period in determining whether to make any changes in these rules. 
After reviewing any comments received during the comment period, 
the Secretary will publish changes to the regulations or will 
publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 indicating that no 
further changes will be made. 



Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 



Sections 668.3, 668.8, 668.12, 668.13, 668.14, 668.15, 
668.16, 668.17, 668.22, 668.23, 668.25, 668.26, 668.90, 668.96, 
668.113, appendix A to 34 CFR part 668, 682.414, 682.416, 
682.711, and 690.83 contain information collection requirements. 
As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the 
Department of Education will submit a copy of these sections to 
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review. (44 
U.S.C. 3504(h)) 

These regulations affect the following types of entities 
that participate in the programs authorized under Title IV of the 
HEA: Individuals, States, large and small businesses, for-profit 
institutions or other for-profit organizations, non-profit 
institutions, and public institutions. The Department needs and 
uses the information to enable the Secretary to improve the 
monitoring and accountability of institutions and third-party 
servicers participating in the Title IV, HEA programs. 

Annual public collecting, reporting, and recordkeeping 
burden for this collection of information is estimated to total 
123,485 hours for 64,695 respondents, including time for 
reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, 
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and 
reviewing the collection of information. These numbers represent 
aggregate totals. For further information contact the Department 
of Education contact person. 

Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments 
on the information collection requirements should direct them to 
the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, room 3002, 
New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503; Attention: 
Daniel J. Chenok. Comments on this burden estimate should be 
submitted by May 31, 1994.

section has previously completed Title IV, HEA program training 
provided or approved by the Secretary, the institution may elect

the requirements established in this section. 

(b) 

General standards of financial responsibility.

 In 
general, the Secretary considers an institution to be financially 
responsible only if it_

(1) Is providing the services described in its official 
publications and statements;

(4) Is current in its debt payments. The institution is 
not considered current in its debt payments if_

(i) The institution is in violation of any existing loan 
agreement at its fiscal year end, as disclosed in a note to its 
audited financial statement; or 

(ii) the institution fails to make a payment in accordance 
with existing debt obligations for more than 120 days, and at 
least one creditor has filed suit to recover those funds; 

(5)(i) Maintains, at all times, a minimum cash reserve for 
the repayment of refunds equal to at least one quarter of the 
total dollar amount of refunds paid by the institution in the 
previous fiscal year. The cash reserve must be maintained in a 
cash reserve fund, consisting of_

(A) A cash deposit in a federally insured bank account; or 

(B) U.S. Treasury securities backed by the full faith and 
credit of the United States of America, having an original 
maturity date of three months or less; and 

(ii) Provides, in notes to its audited financial statement, 
information showing the balance maintained in the fund for the 
institution's two most recently completed fiscal years, the 
institution's refund expenditures for it's previous completed 
fiscal year, and any accrued refunds at each fiscal year end; 

(6) Has not had, as part of the audit report for the 
institution's most recently completed fiscal year_

(i) A statement by the accountant expressing substantial 
doubt about the institution's ability to continue as a going 
concern; or 

(ii) A disclaimed or adverse opinion by the accountant; 

(7) For a for-profit institution_

(i)(A) Demonstrates at the end of its latest fiscal year, 
an acid test ratio of at least 1:1. For purposes of this 
section, the acid test ratio shall be calculated by adding cash 
and cash equivalents to current accounts receivable and dividing 
the sum by total current liabilities. The calculation of the 
acid test ratio shall exclude all unsecured or uncollateralized 
related party receivables. Should application of paragraph 
(b)(5) of this section cause a portion of the institution's cash 
reserves to be classified as a noncurrent asset, those cash 
reserves may be included in cash equivalents in calculating the 
institution's acid test ratio; 

(B) Has not had operating losses over both of its 2 latest 
fiscal years that result in a decrease in tangible net worth in 
excess of 10 percent of the institution's tangible net worth at 
the beginning of the first year of the 2-year period. The 
Secretary may calculate any operating loss for an institution by 
excluding from net income: extraordinary gains or losses; income 
or losses from discontinued operations; prior period adjustment; 
and, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle. 
For purposes of this section, the calculation of tangible net 
worth shall exclude all assets defined as intangible in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and 

(C) Had, for its latest fiscal year, a positive tangible 
net worth. In applying this standard, a positive tangible net 
worth occurs when the institution's tangible assets exceed its 
liabilities. The calculation of tangible net worth shall exclude 
all assets classified as intangible in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles; or 

(ii) Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that 
it has currently issued and outstanding debt obligations that are 
(without insurance, guarantee, or credit enhancement) listed at 
or above the second highest rating level of credit quality given 
by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization; 

(8) For a nonprofit institution_

position in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles or provides the required information in notes to the 
audited financial statements; 

(B) Demonstrates at the end of its latest fiscal year, an 
acid test ratio of at least 1:1. The acid test ratio shall be 
calculated by adding cash and cash equivalents to current 
accounts receivable and dividing the sum by total current 
liabilities. The calculation of the acid test ratio shall 
exclude all unsecured or uncollateralized related party 
receivables. Should application of paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section cause a portion of the institution's cash reserves to be 
classified as a non-current asset, those cash reserves may be 
included in cash equivalents in calculating the institution's 
acid test ratio; 

(C)(

1

) Has, at the end of its latest fiscal year, a 
positive unrestricted current fund balance or positive 
unrestricted net assets. In calculating the unrestricted current 
fund balance or the unrestricted net assets for an institution, 
the Secretary may include funds that are temporarily restricted 
in use by the institution's governing body that can be 
transferred to the current unrestricted fund or added to net 
unrestricted assets at the discretion of the governing body; or 

(

2

) Has not had, an excess of current fund expenditures 
over current fund revenues over both of its 2 latest fiscal years 
that results in a decrease exceeding 10 percent in either the 
unrestricted current fund balance or the unrestricted net assets 
at the beginning of the first year of the 2-year period. The 
Secretary may exclude from net changes in fund balances for the 
operating loss calculation: Extraordinary gains or losses; 
income or losses from discontinued operations; prior period 
adjustment; and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting 
principle. In calculating the institution's unrestricted current 
fund balance or the unrestricted net assets, the Secretary may 
include funds that are temporarily restricted in use by the 
institution's governing body that can be transferred to the 
current unrestricted fund or added to net unrestricted assets at 
the discretion of the governing body; or 

(ii) Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that 
it has currently issued and outstanding debt obligations which 
are (without insurance, guarantee, or credit enhancement) listed 
at or above the second highest rating level of credit quality 
given by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.

(i) Has its liabilities backed by the full faith and credit 
of a State, or by an equivalent governmental entity; 

(ii) Has a positive current unrestricted fund balance if 
reporting under the Single Audit Act; 

(iii) Has a positive unrestricted current fund in the 
State's Higher Education Fund, as presented in the general 
purpose financial statements;

continues to have sufficient resources to meet all of its 
financial obligations; or 

(v) Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that 
it has currently issued and outstanding debt obligations which 
are (without insurance, guarantee, or credit enhancement) listed

Title IV, HEA programs for any award year covered by the audit; 
or 

(B) A program review finding, during its two most recent

acceptable to the Secretary and ensures that the 
institution is able to pay all required refunds; and 

(ii) Contributes to that tuition recovery fund. 

(2) The Secretary considers an institution to be 
financially responsible, even if the institution is not otherwise

its preceding audited financial statement (or, if no prior

) All taxes owed by the institution are current; 

(

2

assets, before extraordinary items and discontinued operations,

increased from the prior fiscal year unless such increases were 
secured and collateralized, and do not exceed 10 percent of the 
prior fiscal year's working capital of the institution;

net assets of a non-profit institution, have not decreased by 
more than 10 percent of the prior year's total equity; 

(

(including bonuses, fringe benefits, employee stock option 
allowances, 401k contributions, deferred compensation allowances) 
has not increased from the prior year at a rate higher than for 
all other employees;

satisfaction of the Secretary that_

(i) There is no reasonable doubt as to its continued 
solvency and ability to deliver quality educational services; 

(ii) It is current in its payment of all current 
liabilities, including student refunds, repayments to the 
Secretary, payroll, and payment of trade creditors and 
withholding taxes; and 

(iii) It has substantial equity in institution-occupied

failure to meet the acid test ratio requirement. 

(4) The Secretary may determine an institution to be 
financially responsible even if the institution is not otherwise 
financially responsible under paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
if_

(i) The institution notifies the Secretary, in accordance 
with 34 CFR 600.30, that the person referenced in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section exercises substantial control over the 
institution; and 

(ii)(A) The person repaid to the Secretary a portion of the 
applicable liability, and the portion repaid equals or exceeds

similar agreement; or 

(

3

) Twenty-five percent, if the person or any member of the

(B) The applicable liability described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is currently being repaid in accordance
with a written agreement with the Secretary; or

(e) 

Documentation of financial responsibility. 

(1) The Secretary determines whether an institution is financially responsible under this section by evaluating
documents submitted by the institution and information obtained from other sources, including outside sources
of credit information. To enable the Secretary to make this determination, the institution shall submit to the Secretary

accountant in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. The Secretary may also require the institution
to submit or otherwise make available, the accountant's work papers. If an institution submits audited consolidated
financial statements of its parent corporation for the Secretary to use in determining the institution's level of
financial responsibility, the consolidated financial statements must be supplemented with consolidating schedules
showing the consolidation of each of the parent corporation's subsidiaries and divisions (each separate institution
participating in the Title IV, HEA programs must be shown separately), intercompany eliminating entries, and derived
consolidated totals. The Secretary may also require the institution to submit additional substantive information.

13. Newly redesignated  668.16 is revised to read as follows:


 668.16 

Standards of administrative capability.


To begin and to continue to participate in any Title IV, HEA program, an institution shall demonstrate to the Secretary
that the institution is capable of adequately administering that program under each of the standards established
in this section. The Secretary considers an institution to have that administrative capability if the institution_
(a) Administers the Title IV, HEA programs in accordance with all statutory provisions of or applicable to Title IV
of the HEA, all applicable regulatory provisions prescribed under that statutory authority, and all applicable
special arrangements, agreements, and limitations entered into under the authority of statutes applicable to Title
IV of the HEA;

of financial aid administrators. The Secretary may consider other factors in determining whether an individual
is capable, including, but not limited to, the individual's successful completion of Title IV, HEA program training
provided or approved by the Secretary, and previous experience and documented success in administering the Title
IV, HEA programs properly;
(2) Uses an adequate number of qualified persons to administer the Title IV, HEA programs in which the institution

Secretary considers whether the institution obtains and 
reviews_
(1) All student aid applications, need analysis documents, 
Statements of Educational Purpose, Statements of Registration 
Status, and eligibility notification documents presented by or on 
behalf of each applicant; 
(2) Any documents, including any copies of State and 
Federal income tax returns, that are normally collected by the 
institution to verify information received from the student or 
other sources; and 
(3) Any other information normally available to the 
institution regarding a student's citizenship, previous 
educational experience, documentation of the student's social 
security number, or other factors relating to the student's 
eligibility for funds under the Title IV, HEA programs; 
(g) Refers to the Office of Inspector General of the 
Department of Education for investigation_
(1) After conducting the review of an application provided 
for under paragraph (f) of this section, any credible information 
indicating that an applicant for Title IV, HEA program assistance 
may have engaged in fraud or other criminal misconduct in 
connection with his or her application. The type of information 
that an institution must refer is that which is relevant to the 
eligibility of the applicant for Title IV, HEA program 
assistance, or the amount of the assistance. Examples of this 
type of information are_
(i) False claims of independent student status; 
(ii) False claims of citizenship; 
(iii) Use of false identities; 
(iv) Forgery of signatures or certifications; and 
(v) False statements of income; and

HEA programs, or the receipt of funds under those programs, may 
have engaged in fraud, misrepresentation, conversion or breach of 
fiduciary responsibility, or other illegal conduct involving the 
Title IV, HEA programs. The type of information that an 
institution must refer is that which is relevant to the 
eligibility and funding of the institution and its students 
through the Title IV, HEA programs; 
(h) Provides adequate financial aid counseling to eligible 
students who apply for Title IV, HEA program assistance. In 
determining whether an institution provides adequate counseling, 
the Secretary considers whether its counseling includes 
information regarding_
(1) The source and amount of each type of aid offered; 
(2) The method by which aid is determined and disbursed, 
delivered, or applied to a student's account; and

14. Newly redesignated  668.17 is revised to read as 
follows: 


 668.17 

Default reduction measures. 


(a) 

Default rates.

 If the Federal Stafford loan and 
Federal SLS cohort default rate for an institution exceeds 20 
percent for any fiscal year, the Secretary notifies the 
institution of that rate and may, after consultation as the 
Secretary deems appropriate with cognizant guaranty agencies take 
one or more of the following actions: 
(1) Initiate a proceeding under subpart G of this part to 
limit, suspend, or terminate the participation of the institution 
in the Title IV, HEA programs, if_
(i) The institution's Federal Stafford loan and Federal SLS 
cohort default rate exceeds 40 percent for any fiscal year after 
1989 and has not been reduced by an increment of at least 5 
percent from its rate for the previous fiscal year (e.g., a 
50-percent rate was not reduced to 45 percent or below); or 
(ii) The institution's Federal Stafford loan and Federal 
SLS cohort default rate exceeds_
(A) 60 percent for fiscal year 1989; 
(B) 55 percent for fiscal year 1990; 
(C) 50 percent for fiscal year 1991; 
(D) 45 percent for fiscal year 1992; or 
(E) 40 percent for any fiscal year after fiscal year 1992. 
(2) To help the Secretary make a preliminary determination 
as to the appropriate action to be taken by the Secretary 
regarding the institution, require the institution to submit to 
the Secretary and one or more guaranty agencies, as defined in 
34 CFR part 682, any information relating to that determination, 
as reasonably required by the Secretary, within a time frame 
specified by the Secretary. 
(b) 

Default management plan.

 If the Federal Stafford loan 
and Federal SLS cohort default rate for an institution_
(1) Is greater than 20 percent but less than or equal to 40 
percent, the institution must submit a default management plan 
that implements the measures described in appendix D to this 
part. An institution that wishes to submit a default management 
plan that deviates from the measures described in appendix D must 
submit a justification for the deviation that includes a 
rationale explaining why the measures from which the plan 
deviates are not appropriate for the institution's specific 
situation. The institution must implement the default management 
plan upon notification from the Secretary that the plan has been 
approved; or 
(2) Exceeds 40 percent for any fiscal year, the institution 
must implement all of the default management reduction measures 
described in appendix D to this part no later than 60 days after 
the institution receives the Secretary's notification of the 
institution's cohort default rate. An institution is not 
required to submit any written plans to the Secretary or a 
guaranty agency unless the Secretary or guaranty agency 
specifically requests the institution to do so. 
(c) 

End of participation.

 (1) Except as provided in 
paragraph (c)(6) of this section, an institution's participation 
in the FFEL programs ends if the Secretary determines that the 
institution's cohort default rate, for each of the three most 
recent fiscal years for which the Secretary has determined the 
institution's rate, is equal to or greater than the applicable 
threshold rates. 
(2) For purposes of the determinations made under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the threshold rates are_
(i) 35 percent for each of fiscal years 1991 and 1992; 
(ii) 30 percent for fiscal year 1993; and 
(iii) 25 percent for fiscal year 1994 and all subsequent 
fiscal years. 
(3) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(7) of this section, 
an institution whose participation ends under paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section may not participate in the FFEL programs beginning 
with the date that the institution receives notification from the 
Secretary that its cohort default rate exceeds the thresholds 
specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and continuing_
(i) For the remainder of the fiscal year in which the 
Secretary determines that the institution's participation has 
ended under paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and 
(ii) For the two subsequent fiscal years. 
(4) An institution whose participation in the FFEL programs 
ends under paragraph (c)(1) of this section may not participate 
in the FFEL programs until the institution_
(i) Receives notification from the Secretary that the 
notice ending the institution's participation is withdrawn 
pursuant to paragraph (d)(6) of this section; or 
(ii) Following the period described in paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section, satisfies the Secretary that the institution meets 
all requirements for participation in the FFEL programs and 
executes a new agreement with the Secretary for participation in 
the FFEL programs. 
(5) If the Secretary withdraws the notification of an 
institution's loss of participation pursuant to paragraph (d)(6) 
of this section, the participation of the institution is restored 
effective as of the date that the institution received 
notification from the Secretary of the loss of participation. 
(6) Until July 1, 1998, the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section and the provisions of  668.16(m) do not apply to 
a historically black college or university within the meaning of 
section 322(2) of the HEA, a tribally controlled community 
college within the meaning of section 2(a)(4) of the Tribally 
Controlled Community College Assistance Act of 1978, or a Navajo 
community college under the Navajo Community College Act. 
(7)(i) If the Secretary's designated department official 
receives written notice from an institution whose participation 
ends under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, within seven 
calendar days from the date on which the institution receives 
notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate 
exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, that the institution intends to appeal the end of 
participation under paragraph (d) of this section, the 
institution may, notwithstanding  668.26(d) continue to 
participate in the FFEL programs until no later than the 30th 
calendar day following the date on which the institution receives 
notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate 
exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, except as provided in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this 
section. 
(ii) If an institution satisfies the conditions in 
paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section for participating in the 
FFEL programs until the 30th calendar day following the date on 
which the institution receives notification from the Secretary 
that its cohort default rate exceeds the thresholds specified in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the institution may, 
notwithstanding  668.26(d), continue to participate in the FFEL 
programs after that date, until the Secretary issues a decision 
on the institution's appeal, if the institution, by the 30th 
calendar day following the date on which the institution receives 
notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate 
exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, files an appeal that is complete in all respects in 
accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. However, the 
appeal of an institution relying on paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this 
section is not considered incomplete by virtue of a guaranty 
agency's not having yet complied with_or having failed to comply 
with_34 CFR 682.401(b)(14), which requires the agency to respond 
to an institution's request for verification of data within 15 
working days, if the institution submitted that request within 10 
working days from the date on which the institution received 
notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate 
exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, and the institution simultaneously submitted a copy of 
that request to the Secretary's designated department official. 
When the institution receives the guaranty agency's response, to 
complete its appeal, the institution must submit the verified 
data to the Secretary's designated department official within 
five working days in order to continue participating in the FFEL 
programs until the Secretary issues a decision on the 
institution's appeal.

(d) 

Appeal procedures. 

(1) An institution may appeal the 
loss of participation in the FFEL programs under paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section by submitting an appeal in writing to the 
Secretary's designated department official that is postmarked no 
later than 30 days after it receives notification of its loss of 
participation. The institution may appeal on the grounds that_
(i)(A) The calculation of the institution's cohort default 
rate for any of the three fiscal years relevant to the end of 
participation is not accurate; and 
(B) A recalculation with corrected data verified by the 
cognizant guaranty agency or agencies would produce a cohort 
default rate for any of those fiscal years that is below the 
threshold percentage specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section; or 
(ii) The institution meets the following criteria: 
(A)(

1

) Fifteen percent or fewer of the institution's 
students who are enrolled on at least a half-time basis receive 
Federal Stafford or Federal SLS loans for any twenty-four month 
period ending not more than six months prior to the date the 
institution submits its appeal; or 
(

2

) For any twenty-four month period ending not more than 
six months prior to the date the institution submits its appeal, 
two-thirds or more of the institution's students who are enrolled 
on at least a half-time basis are individuals from disadvantaged 
economic backgrounds, as established by documentary evidence 
submitted by the institution. Such evidence must relate to 
qualification by those students for an Expected Family 
Contribution (EFC) (formerly institutions were required to use 
the Pell Grant index), as defined in 34 CFR 690.2, of zero for 
the applicable award year or attribution to those students of an 
adjusted gross income of the student and his or her parents or 
spouse, if applicable, reported for the applicable award year of 
less than the poverty level, as determined under criteria 
established by the Department of Health and Human Services. 
(B)(

1

) Two-thirds or more of the institution's students who 
were enrolled on a full-time basis in any twenty-four month 
period ending not more than six months prior to the date the 
institution submits its appeal completed the educational programs 
in which they were enrolled. This rate is calculated by 
comparing the number of students who were classified as full-time 
at their initial enrollment in the institution, and were 
originally scheduled, at the time of enrollment, to complete 
their programs within the relevant twenty-four month period, with 
the number of these students who received a degree, certificate, 
or other recognized educational credential from the institution; 
transferred from the institution to a higher level educational 
program at another institution for which the prior program 
provided substantial preparation; or, at the end of the twenty- 
four month period, remained enrolled and were making satisfactory 
academic progress toward completion of their educational 
programs. The calculation does not include students who did not 
complete their programs because they left the institution to 
serve in the armed forces; and 
(

2

) The institution had a placement rate of two-thirds or 
more with respect to its former students who received a degree, 
certificate, or other recognized educational credential from the 
institution in any twenty-four month period ending not more than 
six months prior to the date the institution submits its appeal. 
This rate is calculated by determining the percentage of all 
those students who, based on evidence submitted by the 
institution, are on that date employed, or had been employed for 
at least 13 weeks following receipt of the credential from the 
institution, in the occupation for which the institution provided 
training, or are enrolled or had been enrolled for at least 13 
weeks following receipt of the credential from the institution, 
in a higher level educational program at another institution for 
which the prior educational program provided substantial 
preparation. 
(2) For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this 
section, a student is originally scheduled, at the time of 
enrollment, to complete the educational program on the date when 
the student will have been enrolled in the program for the amount 
of time normally required to complete the program. The ``amount 
of time normally required to complete the program'' is the period 
of time specified in the institution's enrollment contract, 
catalog, or other materials, for completion of the program by a 
full-time student, or the period of time between the date of 
enrollment and the anticipated graduation date appearing on the 
student's loan application, if any, whichever is less. 
(3) An appeal submitted under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this 
section is considered to be filed in a timely manner if the 
institution submits a letter of appeal by the 30-day deadline 
notifying the Secretary's designated department official that it 
is appealing on this basis, including with that letter a copy of 
the institution's request to each cognizant guaranty agency for 
verification of the cohort default rate data, and submits the 
verified data to the Secretary's designated department official 
within five working days of its receipt from the guaranty agency. 
For purposes of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the 
institution's appeal is not considered complete until the 
institution submits the verified data to the Secretary's 
designated department official. 
(4) The Secretary issues a decision on the institution's 
appeal within 45 days after the institution submits a complete 
appeal that addresses the applicable criteria in 
paragraphs (d)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section to the 
Secretary's designated department official. 
(5) The Secretary's decision is based on the consideration 
of written material submitted by the institution. No oral 
hearing is provided. 
(6) The Secretary withdraws the notification of loss of 
participation in the FFEL programs sent to an institution under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if the Secretary determines 
that the institution's appeal satisfies one of the grounds 
specified in paragraphs (d)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section. 
(7)(i) An institution that appeals under 
paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section must submit a written request 
to the guaranty agency or agencies that guaranteed the loans used 
in the calculation of its cohort default rate to verify the data 
used to calculate its cohort default rate and simultaneously 
provide a copy of that request to the Secretary's designated 
department official. 
(ii) The written request must include the names and social 
security numbers of the borrowers the institution wishes the 
agency to verify and detailed information on the nature of the 
suspected inaccuracy in the data the institution is requesting 
the agency to verify. 
(8) An institution must include in its appeal a 
certification by the institution's chief executive officer that 
all information provided by the institution in support of its 
appeal is true and correct. 
(9) An institution that appeals on the ground that it meets 
the criteria contained in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section 
must include in its appeal the following information: 
(i) For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A)(

1

) of this 
section_
(A) The number of students who were enrolled on at least a 
half-time basis at the institution in the relevant twenty-four month period; and

use the Pell Grant index), if applicable, of each student from a 
disadvantaged economic background who was enrolled on at least a 
half-time basis at the institution in the relevant twenty-four 
month period and the measure and data used to determine that the 
student is from a disadvantaged economic background. 
(iii) For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B)(

1

) of this 
section_
(A) The number of students who were enrolled on a full-time 
basis at the institution in the relevant twenty-four month 
period; 
(B) For each of those former students who received a

(D) For each of those students who remained enrolled and 
was making satisfactory academic progress toward completion of 
the educational program, the student's name, address, and social

social security number, the subsequent institution's name and 
address, the name of the educational program, and the dates the 
former student was so enrolled. 
(e) 

Definitions. 

The following definitions apply to this 
section and  668.90: 
(1)(i)(A) For purposes of the Federal Stafford loan and 
Federal SLS cohort default rate, except as provided in paragraph 
(e)(1)(ii) of this section, the term 

cohort default rate

 means_
(

1

) For any fiscal year in which 30 or more current and 
former students at the institution enter repayment on Federal 
Stafford loans or Federal SLS loans (or on the portion of a loan 
made under the Federal Consolidation Loan Program that is used to 
repay such loans) received for attendance at the institution, the 
percentage of those current and former students who enter 
repayment in that fiscal year on such loans who default before 
the end of the following fiscal year; and 
(

2

) For any fiscal year in which fewer than 30 of the 
institution's current and former students enter repayment on 
Federal Stafford loans or Federal SLS loans (or on the portion of 
a loan made under the Federal Consolidation Loan Program that is 
used to repay such loans) received for attendance at the 
institution, the percentage of those current and former students 
who entered repayment on Federal Stafford loans or Federal SLS 
loans in any of the three most recent fiscal years, who default 
before the end of the fiscal year immediately following the year 
in which they entered repayment. 
(B) In determining the number of students who default 
before the end of that following fiscal year, the Secretary 
includes only loans for which the Secretary or a guaranty agency 
has paid claims for insurance. 
(ii)(A) In the case of a student who has attended and 
borrowed at more than one institution, the student (and his or 
her subsequent repayment or default) is attributed to each 
institution for attendance at which the student received a loan 
that entered repayment in the fiscal year. 
(B) A loan on which a payment is made by the institution, 
its owner, agent, contractor, employee, or any other affiliated 
entity or individual, in order to avoid default by the borrower, 
is considered as in default for purposes of this definition. 
(C) Any loan that has been rehabilitated under section 428F 
of the HEA before the end of that following fiscal year is not 
considered as in default for purposes of this definition. 
(D) For the purposes of this definition, a loan made in 
accordance with section 428A of the HEA (or a loan made under the 
Federal Consolidation Loan Program a portion of which is used to 
repay a Federal SLS loan) shall not be considered to enter 
repayment until after the borrower has ceased to be enrolled in 
an educational program leading to a degree, certificate, or other 
recognized educational credential at the participating 
institution on at least a half-time basis (as determined by the 
institution) and ceased to be in a period of forbearance based on 
such enrollment. Each eligible lender of a loan made under 
section 428A (or a loan made under the Federal Consolidation Loan 
Program a portion of which is used to repay a Federal SLS loan) 
of the HEA shall provide the guaranty agency with the information 
necessary to determine when the loan entered 
repayment for purposes of this definition, and the guaranty 
agency shall provide that information to the Secretary. 
(iii)(A) A cohort default rate of an institution applies to 
all locations of the institution as the institution exists on the 
first day of the fiscal year for which the rate is calculated. 
(B) A cohort default rate of an institution applies to all 
locations of the institution from the date the institution is 
notified of that rate until the institution is notified by the 
Secretary that the rate no longer applies. 
(iv)(A) For an institution that changes its status from 
that of a location of one institution to that of a free-standing 
institution, the Secretary determines the cohort default rate 
based on the institution's status as of October 1 of the fiscal 
year for which a cohort default rate is being calculated. 
(B) For an institution that changes its status from that of 
a free-standing institution to that of a location of another 
institution, the Secretary determines the cohort default rate 
based on the combined number of students who enter repayment 
during the applicable fiscal year and the combined number of 
students who default during the applicable fiscal years from both 
the former free-standing institution and the other institution. 
This cohort default rate applies to the new, consolidated 
institution and all of its current locations. 
(C) For free-standing institutions that merge to form a 
new, consolidated institution, the Secretary determines the 
cohort default rate based on the combined number of students who 
enter repayment during the applicable fiscal year and the 
combined number of students who default during the applicable 
fiscal years from all of the institutions that are merging. This 
cohort default rate applies to the new consolidated institution. 
(D) For a location of one institution that becomes a 
location of another institution, the Secretary determines the 
cohort default rate based on the combined number of students who 
enter repayment during the applicable fiscal year and the number 
of students who default during the applicable fiscal years from 
both of the institutions in their entirety, not limited solely to 
the respective locations. 
(2) 

Fiscal year 

means the period from and including 
October 1 of a calendar year through and including September 30 
of the following calendar year.

15. Section 668.22 is revised to read as follows: 



 668.22 

Institutional refunds and repayments. 


(a) 

General. 

(1) An institution shall have a fair and 
equitable refund policy under which the institution makes a 
refund of unearned tuition, fees, room and board, and other 
charges to a student who received Title IV, HEA program 
assistance, or whose parent received a Federal PLUS loan on 
behalf of the student if the student_
(i) Does not register for the period of enrollment for 
which the student was charged; or 
(ii) Withdraws, drops out, takes an approved leave of 
absence, is expelled from the institution, or otherwise fails to 
complete the program on or after his or her first day of class of 
the period of enrollment for which he or she was charged. 
(2) The institution shall provide a clear and conspicuous 
written statement containing its refund policy, including the 
allocation of refunds and repayments to sources of aid to a 
prospective student prior to the earlier of the student's 
enrollment or the execution of the student's enrollment 
agreement. The institution must make available to students upon 
request examples of the application of this policy and inform 
students of the availability of these examples in the written 
statement. The institution shall make its policy known to 
currently enrolled students. The institution shall include in 
its statement the procedures that a student must follow to obtain 
a refund, but the institution shall return the portion of a 
refund allocable to the Title IV, HEA programs in accordance with 
paragraph (f) of this section whether the student follows those 
procedures or not. If the institution changes its refund policy, 
the institution shall ensure that all students are made aware of 
the new policy.

(3) The ``unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment'' is computed by subtracting the amount paid by the student for
the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged from the scheduled cash payment for the period of enrollment
for which the student has been charged. 

(4) An institution may exclude from the calculation of a 

pro rata

 refund under this paragraph a reasonable administrative fee not to exceed the lesser of_

(ii) One hundred dollars. 

(5)(i) For purposes of this section, ``other charges assessed the student by the institution'' include, but are not

institution specifies in the enrollment agreement a separate charge for equipment that the student actually obtains
or if the institution refers the student to a vendor operated by the institution or an entity affiliated or related
to the institution. 

(ii) The institution may exclude from the calculation of a 

pro rata

 refund under this paragraph the documented cost to the institution of unreturnable equipment issued to the student
in accordance with paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section or of returnable equipment issued to the student in accordance
with paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section if the student does not return the equipment in good condition, allowing
for reasonable wear and tear, within 20 days following the date of the student's withdrawal. For example, equipment
is not considered to be returned in good condition and, therefore, is unreturnable, if the equipment cannot be reused
because of clearly recognized health and sanitary reasons. The institution must clearly and conspicuously disclose
in the enrollment agreement any restrictions on the return of equipment, including equipment that is unreturnable.
The institution must notify the student in writing prior to enrollment that return of the specific equipment involved
will be required within 20 days of the student's withdrawal. 

(iii) An institution may not delay its payment of the portion of a refund allocable under this section to a Title IV,
HEA program or a lender under 34 CFR 682.607 by reason of the process for return of equipment prescribed in paragraph
(c)(5) of this section.

of enrollment for which the student has been charged from the scheduled cash payment for the period of enrollment for

an expenditure made by the institution or servicer or the institution's or servicer's compliance with an applicable
requirement (including the lack of proper documentation), is questioned, the Secretary notifies the institution
or servicer of the questioned expenditure or compliance. 
(2) If the institution or servicer believes that the questioned expenditure or compliance was proper, the institution
or servicer shall notify the Secretary in writing of the institution's or servicer's position and the reasons for
that position. 
(3) The institution's or servicer's response must be based on performing an attestation engagement in accordance
with the Standards for Attestation Engagements of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and must
be received by the Secretary within 45 days of the date of the Secretary's notification to the institution or servicer.

(b)(1) Based on the audit finding and the institution's or third-party servicer's response, the Secretary determines
the amount of liability, if any, owed by the institution or servicer and instructs the institution or servicer as to
the manner of repayment. 
(2) If the Secretary determines that a third-party servicer owes a liability for its administration of an institution's
Title IV, HEA programs, the servicer shall notify each institution under whose contract the servicer owes a liability
of the determination. The servicer shall also notify every institution that contracts with the servicer for the same
service that the Secretary determined that a liability was owed. 
(c)(1) An institution or third-party servicer that must repay funds under the procedures in this section shall repay
those funds at the direction of the Secretary within 45 days of the date of the Secretary's notification, unless_

(i) If an institution or third-party servicer has posted surety or has provided a third-party guarantee and the Secretary
questions expenditures or compliance with applicable requirements and identifies liabilities, then the Secretary
may determine that deferring recourse to the surety or guarantee is not appropriate because_
(A) The need to provide relief to students or borrowers affected by the act or omission giving rise to the liability
outweighs the importance of deferring collection action until completion of available appeal proceedings; or 
(B) The terms of the surety or guarantee do not provide complete assurance that recourse to that protection will be
fully available through the completion of available appeal proceedings; or 
(ii) The Secretary may use administrative offset pursuant to 34 CFR part 30 to collect the funds owed under the procedures
of this section. 
(3) If, under the proceedings in subpart H, liabilities asserted in the Secretary's notification, under paragraph
(a)(1) of this section, to the institution or third-party servicer are upheld, the institution or third-party servicer
shall repay those funds at the direction of the Secretary within 30 days of the final decision under subpart H of this
part unless_
(i) The Secretary permits a longer repayment period; or 
(ii) The Secretary determines that earlier collection action is appropriate pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this
section. 
(d) An institution is held responsible for any liability owed by the institution's third-party servicer for a violation
incurred in servicing any aspect of that institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs and remains responsible
for that amount until that amount is repaid in full.

limitation entered into under the authority of statutes 
applicable to Title IV of the HEA; 
(ii) Determines that immediate action is necessary to 
prevent misuse of Title IV, HEA program funds; and 
(iii) Determines that the likelihood of loss from that

as applicable_
(A) The participation of the institution in one or more 
Title IV, HEA programs; or 
(B) The eligibility of the servicer to contract with any

(3) If the Secretary begins an emergency action against a third-party servicer, the Secretary may also begin an emergency
action against any institution under whose contract a third-party servicer commits the violation.

(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, after an emergency action becomes effective, an institution
or third-party servicer, as applicable, may not_

(i) Make or increase awards or make other commitments of aid to a student under the applicable Title IV, HEA program;

(ii) Disburse either program funds, institutional funds, or other funds as assistance to a student under that Title
IV, HEA program;

(iii) In the case of an emergency action pertaining to participation in the Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, or
Federal SLS Program_

(A) Certify an application for a loan under that program;

(B) Deliver loan proceeds to a student under that program; or

(C) Retain the proceeds of a loan made under that program that are received after the emergency action takes effect;
or

(iv) In the case of an emergency action against a third-party servicer, administer any aspect of any institution's
participation in any Title IV, HEA program.

(2) If the initiating official withdraws, by an emergency action, the authority of the institution or servicer to
commit, disburse, deliver, or cause the commitment, disbursement, or delivery of Title IV, HEA program funds, or
the authority of the servicer to administer any aspect of any institution's participation in any Title IV, HEA program,
except in accordance with a particular procedure specified in the notice of emergency action, the institution or
servicer, as applicable, may not take any action described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section except in accordance
with the procedure specified in the notice.

(e)(1) Upon request by the institution or servicer, as applicable, the Secretary provides the institution or servicer,
as soon as practicable, with an opportunity to show cause that the emergency action is unwarranted or should be modified.

(2) An opportunity to show cause consists of an opportunity to present evidence and argument to a show-cause official.
The initiating official does not act as the show-cause official for any emergency action that the initiating official
has begun. The show-cause official is authorized to grant relief from the emergency action. The institution or servicer
may make its presentation in writing or, upon its request, at an informal meeting with the show-cause official.

(3) The show-cause official may limit the time and manner in which argument and evidence may be presented in order to
avoid unnecessary delay or the presentation of immaterial, irrelevant, or repetitious matter.

(4) The institution or servicer, as applicable, has the burden of persuading the show-cause official that the emergency
action imposed by the notice is unwarranted or should be modified because_

(i) The grounds stated in the notice did not, or no longer, exist;

(ii) The grounds stated in the notice will not cause loss or misuse of Title IV, HEA program funds; or

(iii) The institution or servicer, as applicable, will use procedures that will reliably eliminate the risk of loss
from the misuse described in the notice.

(5) The show-cause official continues, modifies, or revokes the emergency action promptly after consideration
of any argument and evidence presented by the institution or servicer, as applicable, and the initiating official.

(6) The show-cause official notifies the institution or servicer, as applicable, of that official's determination
promptly after the completion of the show-cause meeting or, if no meeting is requested, after the official receives
all the material submitted by the institution in opposition to the emergency action. In the case of a notice to a third-party
servicer, the official also notifies each institution that contracts with the servicer of that determination. The
show-cause official may explain that determination by adopting or modifying the statement of reasons provided in
the notice of emergency action.

(f)(1) An emergency action does not extend more than 30 days after initiated unless the Secretary initiates a limitation,
suspension, or termination proceeding under this part or under 34 CFR part 600 against the institution or servicer,
as applicable, within that 30-day period, in which case the emergency action continues until a final decision is issued
in that proceeding, as provided in  668.90(c), as applicable.

(2) Until a final decision is issued by the Secretary in a proceeding described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section,
the continuation, modification, or revocation of the emergency action is at the sole discretion of the initiating
official, or, if a show-cause proceeding is conducted, the show-cause official.

(3) If an emergency action extends beyond 180 days by virtue of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the institution or
servicer, as applicable, may then submit written material to the show-cause official to demonstrate that because
of facts occurring after the later of the notice by the initiating official or the show-cause meeting, continuation
of the emergency action is unwarranted and the emergency action should be modified or ended. The show-cause official
considers any written material submitted and issues a determination that continues, modifies, or revokes the emergency
action.

(g) The expiration, modification, or revocation of an emergency action against an institution or third-party servicer
does not bar subsequent emergency action against that institution on grounds other than those specifically identified
in the notice imposing the prior emergency action. Separate grounds may include violation by an institution or third-party
servicer of an agreement or limitation imposed or resulting from the prior emergency action.

servicer, each institution that contracts with the servicer. 

(ii) The hearing official may also transmit the notice by 
other, more expeditious means if practical. 

(iii) The hearing official issues the decision within the 
latest of the following dates: 

(A) The 30th day after the last submission is filed with 
the hearing official. 

(B) The 60th day after the last submission is filed with 
the hearing official if the Secretary, upon request of the

case requires additional time for preparation of the decision. 

(C) The 50th day after the last day of the hearing, if the 
hearing official does not request the parties to make any 
posthearing submission. 

(2) The hearing official's initial decision states whether 
the imposition of the fine, limitation, suspension, or 
termination sought by the designated department official is 
warranted, in whole or in part. If the designated department 
official brought a termination action against the institution or 
servicer, the hearing official may, if appropriate, issue an 
initial decision to fine the institution or servicer, as 
applicable, or, rather than terminating the institution's 
participation or servicer's eligibility, as applicable, impose 
one or more limitations on the institution's participation or 
servicer's eligibility. 

(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section_

(i) If, in a termination action against an institution, the 
hearing official finds that the institution has violated the 
provisions of  668.14(b)(18), the hearing official also finds 
that termination of the institution's participation is warranted; 

(ii) If, in a termination action against a third-party

violated the provisions of  668.82(d)(1), the hearing official 
also finds that termination of the institution's participation or 
servicer's eligibility, as applicable, is warranted; 

(iii) If an action brought against an institution or 
third-party servicer involves its failure to provide surety in 
the amount specified by the Secretary under  668.15, the hearing 
official finds that the amount of the surety established by the 
Secretary was appropriate, unless the institution can demonstrate 
that the amount was unreasonable; 

(iv) In a limitation, suspension, or termination proceeding 
commenced on the grounds described in  668.17(a)(1), if the 
hearing official finds that an institution's Federal Stafford 
loan and Federal SLS cohort default rate, as defined in 
 668.17(e), meets the conditions specified in  668.17(a)(1) for 
initiation of limitation, suspension, or termination proceedings, 
the hearing official also finds that the sanction sought by the 
designated department official is warranted, except that the 
hearing official finds that no sanction is warranted if the 
institution demonstrates that it has implemented the default 
reduction measures described in Appendix D to this part; 

(v) In a termination action taken against an institution 
or third-party servicer based on the grounds that the institution 
or servicer failed to comply with the requirements of 
 668.23(c)(3), if the hearing official finds that the institution 
or servicer failed to meet those requirements, the hearing 
official finds that the termination is warranted; 

(vi) In a termination action against an institution based 
on the grounds that the institution is not financially 
responsible under  668.15(c)(1), the hearing official finds that 
the termination is warranted unless the institution demonstrates 
that all applicable conditions described in  668.15(d)(4) have 
been met; and 

(vii) In a termination action against an institution or 
third-party servicer on the grounds that the institution or 
servicer, as applicable, engaged in fraud involving the 
administration of any Title IV, HEA program, the hearing official 
finds that the termination action is warranted if the hearing 
official finds that the institution or servicer, as applicable, 
engaged in that fraud. Examples of fraud include_

(A) Falsification of any document received from a student 
or pertaining to a student's eligibility for assistance under a 
Title IV, HEA program; 

(B) Falsification, including false certifications, of any 
document submitted by the institution or servicer to the 
Department of Education; 

(C) Falsification, including false certifications, of any 
document used for or pertaining to_

(

1

) The legal authority of an institution to provide 
postsecondary education in the State in which the institution is 
located; or 

(

2

) The accreditation or preaccreditation of an institution 
or any of the institution's educational programs or locations; 

(D) Falsification, including false certifications, of any 
document submitted to a guaranty agency under the Federal 
Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, and Federal SLS programs, an 
independent auditor, an eligible institution, or a third-party 
servicer;

(F) Falsification, including false certifications, of any 
document pertaining to the performance of any loan collection 
activity, including activity that is not required by the HEA or 
applicable program regulations. 

(4) The hearing official bases findings of fact only on 
evidence considered at the hearing and on matters given judicial 
notice. If a hearing is conducted solely through written 
submissions, the parties must agree to findings of fact. 

(b) (1) In a suspension proceeding, the Secretary reviews 
the hearing official's initial decision and issues a final 
decision within 20 days after the initial decision. The 
Secretary adopts the initial decision unless it is clearly 
unsupported by the evidence presented at the hearing. 

(2) The Secretary notifies the institution or servicer and, 
in the case of a suspension proceeding against a third-party 
servicer, each institution that contracts with the servicer of 
the final decision. If the Secretary suspends the institution's 
participation or servicer's eligibility, the suspension takes 
effect on the later of_

(i) The day that the institution or servicer receives the 
notice; or 

(ii) The date specified in the designated department 
official's original notice of intent to suspend the institution's 
participation or servicer's eligibility. 

(3) A suspension may not exceed 60 days unless a designated 
department official begins a limitation or termination proceeding 
under this subpart before the expiration of that period. In that 
case, the period may be extended until a final decision is issued 
in that proceeding according to paragraph (c) of this section. 

(c) (1) In a fine, limitation, or termination proceeding, 
the hearing official's initial decision automatically becomes the 
Secretary's final decision 30 days after the initial decision is 
issued and received by both parties unless, within that 30-day 
period, the institution or servicer, as applicable, or the 
designated department official appeals the initial decision to 
the Secretary. 

(2) (i) A party may appeal the hearing official's initial 
decision by submitting to the Secretary, within 30 days after the 
party receives the initial decision, a brief or other written 
statement that explains why the party believes that the Secretary 
should reverse or modify the decision of the hearing official. 

(ii) At the time the party files its appeal submission, the 
party shall provide a copy of that submission to the opposing 
party. 

(iii) The opposing party shall submit its brief or other 
responsive statement to the Secretary, with a copy to the 
appellant, within 30 days after the opposing party receives the 
appellant's brief or written statement. 

(iv) The appealing party may submit proposed findings of 
fact or conclusions of law. However, the proposed findings of 
fact must be supported by_

(A) The evidence introduced into the record at the hearing; 

(B) Stipulations of the parties if the hearing consisted of 
written submissions; or 

(C) Matters that may be judicially noticed. 

(v) Neither party may introduce new evidence on appeal. 

(vi) The initial decision of the hearing official imposing 
a fine or limiting or terminating the institution's participation 
or servicer's eligibility does not take effect pending the 
appeal. 

(vii) The Secretary renders a final decision. The 
Secretary may delegate to a designated department official the 
functions described in paragraph (c)(2) (vii) through (ix) of this 
section. 

(viii) In rendering a final decision, the Secretary 
considers only evidence introduced into the record at the hearing 
and facts agreed to by the parties if the hearing consisted only 
of written submissions and matters that may be judicially 
noticed. 

(ix) If the hearing official finds that a termination is 
warranted pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the 
Secretary may affirm, modify, or reverse the initial decision, or 
may remand the case to the hearing official for further 
proceedings consistent with the Secretary's decision. If the 
Secretary affirms the initial decision without issuing a 
statement of reasons, the Secretary adopts the opinion of the 
hearing official as the decision of the Secretary. If the 
Secretary modifies, remands, or reverses the initial decision, in 
whole or in part, the Secretary's decision states the reasons for 
the action taken.

43. A new Appendix A to part 668 is added to read as 
follows: 



Appendix A to Part 668_Standards for Acceptable Refund Policies by Participating Institutions 



For purposes of  668.22(b)(1)(iv)(A), the Secretary 
considers an institution to have a fair and equitable refund 
policy if the institution uses a policy that meets the minimum 
requirements of this appendix. These requirements do not affect 
an institution's obligation to comply with other Department of 
Education regulations. 

(I) 

The governing board of the institution must review and 
approve the schedule of all institutional charges and refund 
policies applicable to students. 

The pricing of services and 
refund policies have important consequences to students, parents, 
the institution, and society; as such, pricing and refund 
policies must receive board attention and approval. 

(II) 

The institution must seek consumer views in the 
process of establishing and amending charge and refund 
structures. 

Decisions regarding institutional funds are 
ultimately the sole responsibility of the institution's legally 
designated fund custodians. However, consumer concerns do affect 
decision making, and involving consumers in decision making 
related to charges and refunds is an essential approach for 
assessing student needs and creating public awareness of 
institutional requirements. 

(III) 

The institution must publish a current schedule of 
all student charges (including the costs of required supplies and 
equipment), publish a statement of the purpose for such charges 
and related refund policies, have those statements readily 
available free of charge to current and prospective students, and 
substantiate that the costs of required supplies and equipment 
are reasonably related to the cost of providing the supplies and 
equipment to the students. 

Students and parents have a right to 
know what charges they will be expected to pay and what will or 
will not be refunded. They also have a right to know what 
services accompany payment of the charges. Informational 
materials published free for students and prospective students 
are ideal for this purpose. 

(IV) 

The institution must clearly designate all optional 
charges as ``optional'' in all published schedules and related 
materials. 

Charges that are mandatory and charges that are 
optional must be plainly differentiated in all printed materials. 
Statements accompanying the schedule may include institutional 
endorsements of the optional program or service. The institution 
must state clearly in its schedule if a charge is optional for 
some students but required for others. 

(V) 

The institution must clearly identify charges and 
deposits that are nonrefundable as ``nonrefundable'' on all 
published schedules. 

Institutions determine on an individual 
basis which of their charges are refundable or nonrefundable. In 
general, admission fees, application fees, laboratory fees, 
facility and student activity fees, and other similar charges are 
not refundable. These fees are generally charged to cover the 
cost of activities such as processing applications and other 
student information, reserving academic positions and 
establishing the limits of institutional programs and services, 
reserving housing space, and otherwise setting the fixed costs of 
the institution for the coming academic periods. 

Institutions determine on an individual basis which of their 
deposits are refundable or nonrefundable. Some deposits will be 
nonrefundable or will be credited to a student's account (e.g., 
tuition deposits). Others are refundable according to the terms 
of the deposit agreement (e.g., deposits for breakage). 

(VI) 

The institution must refund housing rental charges, 
less a deposit, as long as written notification of cancellation 
is made prior to a well-publicized date that provides reasonable 
opportunity to make the space available to other students. 


Written notification on or before the beginning of the term of 
the contract is necessary to ensure utilization of housing units. 
During the term of the contract, room charges are generally not 
refundable. However, based on the program offered, space 
availability, debt service requirements, State and local laws, 
and other individual circumstances, institutions may provide for 
some more flexible refund guideline for housing. 

(VII) 

The institution must refund board charges in full, 
less a deposit, if written notification of cancellation is made 
prior to a well-publicized date that falls on or before the 
beginning of the term of the contract. 

Subsequent board charges 
should be refunded on a 

pro rata 

basis. It is reasonable to make 
a refund for those goods and services not consumed. The deposit 
should reflect that portion of an institution's costs that are 
fixed for the term of the contract. 

(VIII) 

The institutional refund policy must include the 
following requirements: 

A. The institution must refund 100 percent of the tuition 
charges, less an administrative fee that does not exceed the 
lesser of $100 or 5 percent of the tuition, if the student 
submits written notice of cancellation on or before one week 
preceding the first day of classes for the period of enrollment 
for which the student was charged. 
B. The institution must refund at least 90 percent of the 
tuition charges if the student submits written notice of 
cancellation between the end of the period of time specified in 
(VIII) A. and the end of the first 10 percent (in time) of the 
period of enrollment for which the student was charged. 

C. The institution must refund at least 50 percent of the 
tuition charges if the student submits written notice of 
cancellation between the end of the first 10 percent (in time) of 
the period of enrollment for which the student was charged and 
the end of the first 25 percent (in time) of that period of 
enrollment. 

D. The institution must refund at least 25 percent of the 
tuition charges if the student submits written notice of 
cancellation between the end of the first 25 percent (in time) of 
the period of enrollment for which the student was charged and 
the end of the first 50 percent (in time) of the period of 
enrollment.

E. For purposes of this policy, ``tuition charges'' include, 
but are not limited to, charges for any equipment (including 
books and supplies) issued by an institution to a student if the 
institution specifies in the enrollment agreement a separate 
charge for equipment that the student actually obtains or if the 
institution refers the student to a vendor operated by the 
institution or an entity affiliated or related to the 
institution.

(F) The institution may exclude from the calculation of a 
refund owed under this paragraph the documented cost to the 
institution of unreturnable equipment issued to the student in 
accordance with paragraph (VIII)E of this appendix or of 
returnable equipment issued to the student in accordance with 
paragraph (VIII)E of this appendix if the student does not return 
the equipment in good condition, allowing for reasonable wear and 
tear, within 20 days following the date of the student's 
withdrawal. For example, equipment is not considered to be 
returned in good condition and, therefore, is unreturnable, if 
the equipment cannot be reused because of clearly recognized 
health and sanitary reasons. The institution must clearly and 
conspicuously disclose in the enrollment agreement any 
restrictions on the return of equipment, including equipment that 
is unreturnable. The institution must notify the student in 
writing prior to enrollment that return of the specific equipment 
involved will be required within 20 days of the student's 
withdrawal.

(IX) The institution must assess no penalty charges where 
the institution, as opposed to the student, is in error. 

Penalty 
charges, such as those involving late registration fees, 
change-of-schedule fees, and late payment fees, must not be 
assessed if it is determined that the student is not responsible 
for the action causing the charges to be levied.

(X) 

The institution must advise students that any 
notifications of withdrawal or cancellation and requests for 
refund must be in writing and addressed to the designated 
institution officer. 

A student's written notification of 
withdrawal or cancellation and request for a refund provides an 
accurate record of transactions and also ensures that the request 
will be processed on a timely basis. Acceptance of oral requests 
is an undesirable practice.

(XI) 

The institution must pay or credit refunds due in 
accordance with  668.22(i)(2). 

(XII) The institution must publicize, as a part of its 
dissemination of information on charges and refunds, that an 
appeals process exists for students or parents who believe that 
individual circumstances warrant exceptions from published 
policy. The informational materials must include the name, 
title, and address of the official responsible for handling 
appeals. 

Although charges and refund policies should reflect 
extensive consideration of student and institutional needs, it 
will not be possible to encompass in these structures the variety 
of personal circumstances that may exist or develop. 
Institutions are required to provide a system of due process to 
their students, and charges and refund policies are legitimately 
a part of that process. Students and parents should be informed 
regularly of procedures for requesting information concerning 
exceptions to published policies.

44. Appendix D to part 668 is amended by revising the 
introductory paragraphs to read as follows:



Appendix D to Part 668_Default Reduction Measures



This appendix describes measures that an institution with a 
high default rate under the Federal Stafford Loan and Federal SLS 
programs should find helpful in reducing defaults. An 
institution with a fiscal year default rate that exceeds the 
threshold rate for a limitation, suspension, or termination 
action under  668.17 may avoid that sanction by demonstrating 
that the institution has implemented the measures included in 
this appendix. Other institutions should strongly consider 
taking these steps as well.

To reduce defaults, the Secretary recommends that the 
institution take the following measures:

Standards for administrative capability.

 A third-party 
servicer is considered administratively responsible if it_
(1) Provides the services and administrative resources 
necessary to fulfill its contract with a lender or guaranty 
agency, and conducts all of its contractual obligations that 
apply to the FFEL programs in accordance with FFEL programs

Standards of financial responsibility.

 The Secretary 
applies the provisions of 34 CFR 668.15(b) (1)-(4) and (6)-(9) to 
determine that a third-party servicer is financially responsible 
under this part. References to ``the institution'' in those 
provisions shall be understood to mean the third-party servicer, 
for this purpose. 
(c) 

Special review of third-party servicer.

 (1) The 
Secretary may review a third-party servicer to determine that it 
meets the administrative capability and financial responsibility 
standards in this section. 
(2) In response to a request from the Secretary, the 
servicer shall provide evidence to demonstrate that it meets the 
administrative capability and financial responsibility standards 
in this section. 
(3) The servicer may also provide evidence of why 
administrative action is unwarranted if it is unable to 
demonstrate that it meets the standards of this section. 
(4) Based on the review of the materials provided by the 
servicer, the Secretary determines if the servicer meets the 
standards in this part. If the servicer does not, the Secretary 
may initiate an administrative proceeding under subpart G.

affiliated with servicer.

 Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) 
of this section, a third-party servicer is not financially

criminally acquired, used, or expended have been repaid to the 
United States, and any related financial penalty has been paid; 
(B) The persons who were convicted of, or pled 

nolo 
contendere

(B) Engaging in any activity that is a cause under 
34 CFR 85.305 or 85.405 for debarment or suspension under

subpart 9.4; and 
(2) Upon learning of a conviction, plea, or administrative 
or judicial determination described in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, the servicer does not promptly remove the person, 
agency, or organization from any involvement in the 
administration of the servicer's participation in Title IV, HEA 
programs, including, as applicable, the removal or elimination of 
any substantial control, as determined under 34 CFR 668.15, over 
the servicer. 
(e) 

Independent audits.

 (1) A third-party servicer shall 
arrange for an independent audit of its administration of the 
FFELP loan portfolio unless_

the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Education; 
and 
(iv) Except for the initial audit, be conducted at least

the first full fiscal year. The audit report must be submitted 
to the Secretary within six months of the end of the audit 
period. Each subsequent audit must cover the servicer's 
activities for the one-year period beginning no later than the 
end of the period covered by the preceding audit. 
(3) With regard to a third-party servicer that is a

servicer is under contract to administer on 
behalf of the lender. The records must be maintained in a system that allows ready identification of each loan's current
status.

or guilty plea is grounds for terminating the lender's or servicer's eligibility, respectively, to participate

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary amends the regulations governing the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. The FFEL Program
consists of the Federal Stafford, Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS), Federal PLUS, and the Federal Consolidation
Loan programs. These amendments are needed to implement changes made to the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended
(HEA), by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, and certain technical changes made by the Cash Management Improvement
Act Amendments of 1992, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, and the Higher Education Technical Amendments
of 1993. The regulations amend the FFEL Program loan discharge provisions and enhance the ability of lenders and guaranty
agencies to service and collect FFEL Program loans.

Section 682.411, which requires lenders to warn delinquent borrowers that they may be subject to administrative
wage garnishment and offset against federal or state income tax refunds if they default on their loans, applies to
loans on which the first day of delinquency is on or after 120 days following the date of publication. 



<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Secretary is amending 34 CFR part 682 to implement changes made to the HEA by Public Law 102-325, enacted July
23, 1992, as well as certain changes added by Public Law 103-66, enacted August 10, 1993 and Public Law 103-208,
enacted December 20, 1993. These regulations seek to improve the efficiency of federal student aid programs, and,
by so doing, to improve their capacity to enhance opportunities for postsecondary education. 


On January 14, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for part 682 in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 2486). The NPRM included a discussion of the major issues surrounding the proposed changes which will not be
repeated here. The following list summarizes those issues and identifies the pages of the preamble to the NPRM on which
a discussion of those issues may be found: 
 Amendment to  682.208 to provide for borrower notification when there is a servicing change (page 2488);

 Addition to  682.402 to implement loan discharges if the student could not complete the educational
program because the school closed (page 2491); 
 Addition to  682.402 to implement loan discharges if the student's eligibility to borrow was falsely
certified by the school (pages 2488-2490); 
 Addition to  682.410 to implement administrative wage garnishment of borrowers who owe defaulted loans
(page 2491). 



Executive Order 12866 


These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the Secretary
has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 
The potential costs associated with the regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those determined
by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently, as discussed in those
sections of the preamble that relate to specific sections of the regulations. 
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these regulations, the Secretary
has determined that the benefits of the regulations justify the costs, and do not interfere with State, local, and
tribal governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. 
Substantive revisions to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.


Section 682.202 Permissible Charges by Lenders to Borrowers


 The Secretary has incorporated into the regulations the changes made by Public Law 103-66 and Public
Law 103-208 to origination fees and insurance premiums. Section 682.202(a)(6) of the proposed regulations,
which discussed the refund of excess interest paid on Stafford loans, has been deleted. Those refund provisions were
substantially amended by Public Law 103-208, and will be the subject of future proposed regulations. 


Section 682.208 Due Diligence in Servicing a Loan


 The Secretary has incorporated into the regulations the changes made by Public Law 103-208 to the notification
requirements that apply to the sale or transfer of a loan. 


Section 682.402 Death, Disability, Closed School, False Certification, and Bankruptcy Payments 


 The Secretary has expanded the definition of what constitutes a school's ``false certification of a student's
eligibility to borrow'' to include cases where a school signed a putative borrower's name on the loan application
or the promissory note. The Secretary will also provide relief under these procedures to borrowers who demonstrate
that the school, without authorization by the borrower, endorsed the borrower's loan check or signed the borrower's
authorization for electronic funds transfer, if the student did not receive the loan proceeds, either by actual delivery
of the funds or by application of the loan proceeds to institutional charges owed to the school. 
 The Secretary has partially deleted the requirement that, as a condition of eligibility for a closed school
or false certification discharge, a borrower must assign to and relinquish in favor of the Secretary any right to a
loan refund (up to the amount discharged) from any public fund. However, a borrower will still be required to assign
to and relinquish in favor of the Secretary any right to a loan refund (up to the amount discharged) from any private
fund, including the portion of a public fund that represents funds received from a private party. 
 The Secretary has deleted the requirement for the student to certify that, as a condition of eligibility for
a false certification discharge, he or she was certified by the school on the application for the loan as an eligible
student. 


Section 682.410 Fiscal, Administrative, and Enforcement Requirements


 The regulations have been revised to incorporate the Secretary's guidance sent to guaranty agencies in July
1993 concerning (Pub. L. 102-589). That guidance explained that a guaranty agency was no longer required to
assign loans to the Secretary for federal income tax refund offsets. 
 The Secretary has deleted the provision of the proposed regulations that would have made a self-employed borrower
subject to wage garnishment.

Analysis of Comments and Changes 



In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 40 parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations.
An analysis of the comments and of the changes made to the regulations as a result of those comments follows.

Major issues are grouped according to subject, with references to the appropriate sections of the regulations. Other
substantive issues are discussed under the section of the regulations to which they pertain. Technical and other
minor changes, and suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under the applicable statutory
authority, are not addressed.



Section 682.202 Permissible Charges by Lenders to Borrowers



1. 

Comment: 

A number of commenters noted that Public Law 103-66 and Public Law 103-208 made changes to the statute upon
which the NPRM was based. The commenters recommended that regulatory provisions applying to borrower interest rates,
refunds of excess interest paid, origination fees, and insurance premiums, should be updated to reflect current
law. Some commenters recommended that a separate NPRM be issued to address the complex changes made by Public Law 103-208
to the provisions that mandate the refunding of excess interest.



Discussion: 

To the extent that such changes can be readily made, the Secretary agrees that they should be. The Secretary has decided
to issue a new notice of proposed rulemaking to implement the changes affecting the refund of excess interest paid,
which had been the subject of  682.202(a)(6) of the proposed regulations.



Change: 

The final regulations have been amended to incorporate the changes made by Public Law 103-208 to loan origination
fees and insurance premiums. Interest rate changes will be in a subsequent NPRM. Section 682.202(a)(6) of the proposed
regulations has been deleted, however, the Secretary has reserved that paragraph in these final regulations as the
location for future regulations relating to the refunding of excess interest that is required by section 427A(i)
of the HEA.



Section 682.202(c)(2)



2. 

Comment: 

Some commenters objected to the requirement that a lender must charge an unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan borrower
a 6.5 percent origination/insurance fee. The commenters believed that the lender should have an option to charge
the borrower a lesser amount, as is permitted for a subsidized Federal Stafford Loan.



Discussion: 

Prior to Public Law 103-66, section 428H(f)(1) of the HEA required the lender to charge an unsubsidized Federal
Stafford Loan borrower a 6.5 percent origination/insurance fee. Public Law 103-66 split the combined origination/insurance
fee into two separate components: a 3 percent origination fee that is required to be charged to the borrower, and a 1
percent insurance premium that may be charged to the borrower. The origination and insurance fees applicable to a
subsidized Federal Stafford Loan were also reduced by Public Law 103-66 to 3 percent and 1 percent respectively.
However, the HEA continues to permit a lender to charge a subsidized Federal Stafford Loan borrower a lesser amount
than the maximum loan origination fee, whereas no similar option exists for an unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan
origination fee.



Change: 

The final regulations have been revised to incorporate the reduced fees resulting from Public Law 103-66.



Section 682.202(c)(4)



3. 

Comment: 

Some commenters noted a conflict between  682.202(c)(1) which stated that a lender may charge a borrower an
origination fee on a subsidized Stafford loan, whereas  682.202(c)(4) mandated that the lender shall deduct
a 

pro rata

 portion of such fee from each disbursement of the loan proceeds.



Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees with the commenters.



Change: 

Section 682.202(c)(4) has been amended to clarify that the 

pro rata 

deduction requirement applies only if the lender has chosen to charge an origination fee to the borrower.



Section 682.208 Due Diligence in Servicing a Loan



4. 

Comment: 

A number of commenters favored an expansion in the notification requirements pertaining to an assignment of a loan
or a change in the identity of the party to whom the borrower sends payments or communications concerning the loan.
The commenters believed that the notice required to be sent by the holder of the loan should apply to all borrowers,
and not be limited to only those borrowers in the grace or repayment periods. Some commenters also noted that Public
Law 103-208 made two changes to section 428(b)(2)(F) of the HEA: (1) The transferee (instead of the transferor)
is now required to notify the guaranty agency when a loan is sold or transferred; and (2) the transferor and the transferee
may now notify the borrower of the sale or transfer of a loan either jointly or separately (instead of only separately).

Discussion:

 Section 428(b)(2)(F) of the HEA states that the notification requirements ``* * * shall only apply
if the borrower is in the grace period * * * or is in repayment status.'' 



Change:

 No changes are made with respect to the commenters' first comment. The final regulations have been revised to incorporate
the notification changes resulting from Public Law 103-208. 



Section 682.402 Death, Disability, Closed School, False Certification, and Bankruptcy Payments 

Section 682.402(a) 



5. 

Comment:

 A number of commenters objected to the requirement that, in general, the borrower's loan must be a legally enforceable
debt under applicable law by the holder of the loan to qualify a guaranty agency for a reinsurance payment under the
closed school and false certification discharge provisions. The commenters believed that students should have
their loans discharged, and the Secretary should reimburse guaranty agencies for such discharges, even if the borrower's
debt is legally unenforceable by the holder of the loan. Of particular concern to some commenters were cases where
the school signed the borrower's name on the loan documents or check. While the commenters generally recognized that
the borrower technically does not owe the amount of the unenforceable debt, they were concerned that borrowers may
not have the resources to pursue a legal or administrative determination of loan enforceability. The commenters
also believed that even if the borrower did pursue that avenue, it could take many years to reach a resolution, during
which the borrower would be subject to collection activity, damaged credit rating, and if in default, would be considered
to be ineligible for additional federal student financial aid. 

In a related area, some commenters expressed concern that, under current federal regulations, a borrower would not
receive a closed school or false certification discharge if federal reinsurance on the loan had been lost because
of violations of due diligence or other programmatic requirements committed by the lender or the guarantor. The commenters
believed that Congress intended to help a borrower who was victimized by a school's closing or false certification
of eligibility to borrow, events that are beyond the control of the borrower. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary is persuaded that the term ``falsely certified,'' as used in section 437(c)(1) of the HEA, should be
defined to include certain cases where a school signed the borrower's name on the loan application or promissory note.
The definition of the term ``falsely certified'' is extensively discussed in response to comment 48. Because of the
similarity of such cases to those involving the execution of the application or note by the school in the name of the
borrower, the Secretary concluded that cases in which the school improperly endorsed the borrower's signature on
the loan check or the authorization for electronic funds transfer should also be addressed under these regulatory
procedures, although such misconduct is not by itself a false certification. Under these final regulations, therefore,
the Secretary will provide relief to borrowers in cases of unauthorized endorsements, but except for the instances
in which the school both falsely created a loan application or promissory note for a student and then endorsed the student's
name on the loan check, the lender is responsible for ensuring the authenticity of a borrower's signature on the lender's
loan check, and should continue to bear the risk of an improper endorsement. In those instances, although a borrower
may under the procedure as modified here receive a discharge of any obligation to repay that portion of a loan disbursed
by a check which he or she neither endorsed nor received the proceeds of, the lender will not be permitted to receive
or retain a claim payment for that amount. Because the Secretary considers the lender to have not had routine access
to the written authorization for electronic funds transfer, on the other hand, the lender would not have occasion
to know of an unauthorized execution of that authorization in the name of the borrower, and would not be held at risk
for such unauthorized disbursements under these procedures.

The Secretary also agrees that the loss of federal reinsurance on the loan due to violations of due diligence or other
programmatic requirements committed by the lender or the guarantor should not prevent an eligible borrower from
receiving a closed school or false certification discharge. In such cases, the Secretary will use his authority pursuant
to  682.406(b) to waive his right to refuse to make a reinsurance payment on the loan. Thus, (except in the case
of a falsely endorsed check, as noted above) a lender may receive a claim payment and a guaranty agency may receive a
reinsurance payment on a loan for which an eligible borrower would qualify for a closed school or false certification
discharge, even though violations of program requirements committed by the lender or guarantor may have otherwise
sufficed to cause federal reinsurance on the loan to have been lost. 

During the last few years, Congress and the Secretary have taken steps to combat unscrupulous individuals and program
participants who have used the FFEL Program to exploit innocent students and taxpayers. The discharge of loans owed
by the innocent victims is consistent with those actions. The Department intends to pursue the individuals and organizations
who caused this situation so that the taxpayer can be reimbursed, and future students are protected. 



Change:

 As will be further discussed in response to comment 48, the Secretary has expanded the definition of what constitutes
a school's ``false certification of a student's eligibility to borrow'' to include a loan for which the school signed
the name of an innocent victim on the application for the loan or the promissory note. The regulations will also provide
relief in cases in which the borrower signed the loan application or promissory note, but the school signed the borrower's
name on a loan check or authorization for electronic funds transfer, providing that the student did not receive, directly
or indirectly, the benefits of the loan proceeds disbursed by that loan check or by virtue of the authorization for
electronic funds transfer signed by the school. 

6. 

Comment:

 Some commenters believed that information concerning closed school or false certification discharges should be
made available to the borrower at the time the loan is made or while the student is in school. The commenters believed
that this important information may be easily overlooked by or not reach the borrower after the school has closed or
the student has withdrawn. 



Discussion:

 This information is made available to the student in the common application/promissory note used by all guaranty
agencies. In addition, if a borrower has questions concerning his or her loan obligation, a lender is required under
 682.208(c)(1) to respond within 30 days after receipt of an inquiry from the borrower or any endorser on a loan.




Change:

 None. 



Section 682.402(b)(1) 



7. 

Comment:

 Some commenters believed that the regulations should state that a discharge of a Federal PLUS or Federal Consolidation
Loan because of a borrower's death would apply only if both co-makers of the loan died. 



Discussion:

 This was stated in  682.402(a)(2) of the proposed regulations. Section  682.402(b)(1) addresses the
loan obligation of an individual borrower who dies. 



Change:

 None. 

8. 

Comment:

 Some commenters recommended that the regulations state that the discharge of a Federal PLUS Loan because of the student's
death applies only to student deaths occurring on or after July 23, 1992. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that clarification is needed to reflect the effective date of section 437(d) of the HEA. 



Change:

 The final regulations have been revised accordingly. 



Section 682.402(c)(1) 



9. 

Comment:

 Some commenters objected to the requirement that a Federal Consolidation Loan borrower must provide the disbursement
dates of the underlying loans if the borrower requests a loan discharge for total and permanent disability based on
a condition that pre-dated the Consolidation Loan. The commenters believed that this information is present in the
borrower's Consolidation Loan file and the borrower should not be required to submit information already in the possession
of the lender.

Discussion:

 The regulations are designed to cover all cases, including those in which the information may not be present in the
borrower's loan file, and it may be necessary in some cases, for the borrower to provide this documentation. For example,
the lender's information may be incomplete or destroyed due to fire, flood, theft, 

etc.

 However, in other cases where the lender already possesses this information in the borrower's loan file, the Secretary
agrees that the borrower should not be required to provide the same documentation.



Change:

 Section 682.402(c)(1) has been revised to specify that the borrower's requirement to provide such documentation
only applies if the lender does not already possess it.



Section 682.402(d)(1)(i)



10. 

Comment:

 Some commenters were confused by references to ``the loan'' and thought that a borrower with multiple loans would
not be completely covered under the closed school loan discharge provisions.



Discussion:

 In general, regulatory language is more precise if it is based on the singular form of a noun. In the case of a closed school
loan discharge, this permits each loan to be evaluated individually, and not be dependent on factors associated only
with other loans. If the borrower qualifies for a discharge of more than one loan, then each loan will be discharged.



Change:

 None.

11. 

Comment:

 Some commenters believed that a borrower should be eligible for a closed school loan discharge for the portion of a
Federal Consolidation Loan that repaid a loan that would have otherwise been discharged under the closed school provisions.



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenters. The Secretary has been given authority pursuant to section 437(c)(1) of
the HEA to ``* * * discharge the borrower's liability on the loan * * *''
if the student could not complete the program in which the student was enrolled because of the school's closure. Because
section 437(c) provides for discharge of loans because of events that occur before the borrower enters repayment,
the borrower's liability on the loan is the amount outstanding at that time, before the borrower enters repayment.
If the borrower repays some or all of that amount, the discharge would be ineffective unless it includes relief from
that liability through reimbursement for the amounts paid on the loan, and those amounts include amounts borrowed
through a Consolidation Loan. The Secretary believes that the borrower's Consolidation Loan should be credited
for the amount of the closed school loan discharge that would have been applicable to the borrower's loan before it
was consolidated.



Change:

 The final regulations have been revised accordingly.

12. 

Comment:

 Some commenters believed that the 90-day period prior to a school's closing during which a student who withdrew would
be eligible for a loan discharge is too short for many students who attended correspondence schools. The commenters
noted that such students frequently are considered ``withdrawn'' as of the date of the last lesson submitted by the
student if the student did not submit the next scheduled lesson in accordance with the schedule of lessons established
under  682.602. However, the school may not have been considered to have officially closed until more than 90
days have elapsed from the date the student would be considered to have withdrawn under  682.605(b)(3). The
commenters observed that in many cases, it was the school that withdrew from the student by its failure to grade lessons
or provide subsequent lessons, or to otherwise communicate with a student who attempted to learn if the school was
still operating. The commenters believed that correspondence students, unlike other students who attended a school
at a school's actual location, are not in a position to see an obvious deterioration in the school's ability to provide
education to students.



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that the 90-day period generally is sufficient for all categories of students. The Secretary
notes that correspondence students may actually be in a better position than other students to realize that a school's
ability to provide training and services is deteriorating. The absence of communication from a correspondence school
to a student is an unmistakable sign that the school is not fulfilling its part of the enrollment agreement with the
student. Other types of schools may be able to effectively camouflage their deteriorating capabilities and prevent
students from seeing the true state of the school's fiscal and administrative situation, but a correspondence school
student cannot be so easily deceived. The lack of communication from a school is a clear fact that speaks for itself.
However, the Secretary agrees with the commenters that in some unique circumstances an extension of the 90-day period
may be appropriate.



Change:

 The final regulations have been revised to include a provision for the Secretary to extend the 90-day period if he believes
an extension is appropriate in a particular case. 



Section 682.402(d)(1)(ii)(A)



13. 

Comment:

 Some commenters noted that schools that close will frequently phase-out their operations by sequentially eliminating
individual programs even though the school remains open. The commenters believed that by linking a borrower's eligibility
for a loan discharge to the date that the school ceased to provide educational instruction in all programs, the regulations
would penalize a borrower who withdrew from school because of a terminated or deteriorated program earlier than 90
days before the school officially closed.



Discussion:

 The Secretary has been given authority pursuant to section 437(c)(1) of the HEA to discharge the borrower's liability
on the loan if the student could not complete the program ``* * * due to the closure of the institution.* * *''
The Secretary has no authority to discharge the borrower's loan obligation if the student's program was terminated
but the school did not close.



Change:

 None.

14. 

Comment:

 Some commenters did not understand the reference to ``the designated agency in the state in which the school is located.''
The commenters asked if the agency making the determination that a school had closed would be the guaranty agency,
the state school licensing agency, or some other agency.



Discussion:

 The Secretary understands the commenters' concerns and has concluded that he is in the best position to evaluate the
information provided by various sources concerning whether a school has closed and the date of closure. Therefore,
the determination of a school's closure date will be made by the Secretary and communicated to FFEL Program participants.



Change:

 The regulation has been amended to read ``A school's closure date is the date that the school ceases to provide educational
instruction in all programs, as determined by the Secretary;'' 


Section 682.402(d)(1)(ii)(C)



15. 

Comment:

 Some commenters recommended that the regulations clarify that only a loan made for attendance at an 

eligible

 school could be discharged under the closed school loan discharge provisions. Some commenters also wanted the regulations
to make it clear that the discharge provisions would apply only if the branch or location of the school where the student
actually attended was itself ``eligible.''

Discussion:

 The closed school loan discharge authorized in section 437(c)(1) of the HEA is not restricted only to a loan made for
attendance at an eligible school. The Secretary believes that Congress was aware of instances in which a school or
its branch may have lost eligibility, but the school continued to certify loan applications under an eligible school
identification code. The Secretary believes this is the reason why there is no requirement in section 437(c)(1) of
the HEA that links a borrower's eligibility for a closed school loan discharge to only a loan certified by an eligible
school. 



Change:

 None. 



Section 682.402(d)(2)(iv) 



16. 

Comment:

 Some commenters recommended that the regulations require the holder of a loan discharged under the closed school
loan discharge provision to forward the original promissory note marked ``canceled'' or ``satisfied in full'' to
the borrower within 30 days after discharging the borrower's loan obligation. 



Discussion:

 A loan that is discharged due to the borrower's death, permanent and total disability, or bankruptcy, is considered
``paid in full'' for the purposes of  682.414(a)(2). The Secretary will add a closed school loan discharge to
the definition of the term ``paid in full'' found in  682.414(a)(2), but does not believe it is necessary to otherwise
amend the requirements pertaining to the return of promissory notes (found in  682.414(a)(4) of the current
regulations) in the manner recommended by the commenters. The return of a borrower's promissory note pursuant to
a closed school discharge does not need to be accomplished any differently than the return of a borrower's promissory
note pursuant to any other type of discharge. 



Change:

 Section 682.414(a)(2) has been amended to add a closed school loan discharge. 



Section 682.402(d)(3) 



17. 

Comment:

 Some commenters recommended that the Secretary prescribe a standardized form for the closed school loan discharge
application and associated sworn statement from the borrower. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that this would be helpful. Pursuant to the requirements of section 432(l) of the HEA, the Secretary
will consult with FFEL participants to develop a standardized form. 



Change:

 None. 

18. 

Comment:

 Some commenters objected to the requirement that a borrower who requests a closed school loan discharge must submit
the sworn statement described in the regulations. The commenters believed the sworn statement is unnecessary in
cases where the holder of the loan or the guaranty agency has reliable information in their possession showing that
the borrower was in attendance at the school when it closed or within 90 days before it closed. The commenters believed
the borrower's loan obligation should be discharged based on those existing records. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes the borrower's sworn statement is necessary to adequately protect the interests of the taxpayers.
The information provided on the borrower's sworn statement is not limited to the isolated historical record of the
borrower's attendance at the closed school. For example, the borrower must state whether he or she took advantage
of a teach-out or transferred academic credits from the closed school to another school. The borrower must also agree
to cooperate with the Secretary or the Secretary's designee in enforcement actions in accordance with  682.402(d)(4).
This information, and the borrower's agreement to cooperate, will not be in the possession of the guaranty agency
and must be obtained in the borrower's sworn statement. 

Change: None. 



Section 682.402(d)(3)(ii)(A) 



19. 

Comment:

 Some commenters requested clarification of whether the closed school loan discharge applied to a loan that was partially
disbursed on or after January 1, 1986. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary has been given authority pursuant to section 437(c)(1) of the HEA to discharge the borrower's liability
on a loan ``* * * received, on or after January 1, 1986 ``* * *'' if the student could not
complete the program due to the closure of the school. For purposes of the closed school loan discharge, the Secretary
will consider the borrower's entire loan eligible if any part of it was disbursed by the lender on or after January 1,
1986.

Section 682.402(d)(3)(ii)(C) 



20. 

Comment: 

Some commenters believed that a borrower who was unable to transfer all of the academic credits or hours earned at the
closed school to another school should qualify for a partial loan discharge. 



Discussion: 

If a student chooses to transfer any amount of academic credits or hours earned at the closed school to another school,
and as a result of that action is able to complete the program of study that the student was enrolled in at the closed school,
the student would not meet the requirement contained in section 437(c)(1) of the HEA that restricts a closed school
loan discharge to a student ``* * * unable to complete the program* * *'' because of
the school's closing. Thus, there would be no statutory basis for discharging the borrower's loan obligation. 



Change: 

None. 

21. 

Comment: 

Some commenters believed that a borrower who transferred academic credits or hours earned at the closed school to
another school should not qualify for a discharge if the borrower enrolled in a different program of study at the new
school or enrolled in a similar program but quickly withdrew. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that the borrower is entitled to a loan discharge under the HEA in any case in which a student's
program of education is disrupted by the closing of the school to the extent that the student does not, for any reason,
complete the program. The presumption must be that the school's closing directly hindered the student's achievement
of his or her educational goals. 



Change: 

None. 

22. 

Comment: 

Some commenters recommended that the regulations define the term ``teach-out at another school.'' The commenters
believed that the absence of a definition would result in widespread confusion as to what constitutes a ``teach-out''
for purposes of a closed school loan discharge. The commenters suggested that the key elements of a teach-out are:
(a) No charges additional to the original program cost; (b) identity of subject matter taught; (c) geographic proximity
between the original and teach-out schools; (d) demonstrated compatibility of program structure and scheduling
(

e.g.

, student is able to begin the teach-out within a reasonable time after the school closure, and the completion dates,
class times, and instructional methodology are comparable); and (e) review and approval by the state licensing agency.




Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that a prescriptive regulatory definition of ``teach-out'' is unnecessary. The Secretary
notes that because a student may decline to complete the program through a teach-out at another school for any reason,
it is therefore reasonable to conclude that a student who chooses to participate in a teach-out and completes the program,
has demonstrated an acceptance of those teach-out conditions. In short, a student can be protected from being forced
to accept what he or she believes to be an onerous teach-out condition by simply declining the teach-out. A student
who, even though inconvenienced, chooses to complete his or her program through a teach-out, has received value from
the loan and needs no loan discharge. 

The Secretary asks interested parties to submit information to him concerning the actual costs paid by students who
completed their programs through teach-outs. The Secretary will evaluate those costs to determine if the regulations
should be revised in the future to permit a discharge based on certain circumstances. 



Change: 

None. 



Section 682.402(d)(3)(iv) 



23. 

Comment: 

Some commenters, while believing that borrower cooperation is important in an enforcement action undertaken against
a school or other related parties, were concerned that a borrower may be unable to take time away from work, home, or
other activities to travel to multiple court appearances needed to assist the Secretary or his designee in the enforcement
action. The commenters believed that a borrower should be required to assist in an enforcement action only to the extent
practicable for the borrower. 


Discussion

: It would not be in the interests of the Secretary or the taxpayer to make unreasonable demands on the borrower when
pursuing an enforcement action. It would equally not be in the interests of the Secretary or the taxpayer to create
an opportunity for a borrower to frustrate the Secretary's enforcement action by claiming that he or she was unavailable
to testify. The use of the word ``cooperate'' in the regulations implies a process of two or more parties reasonably
working together toward a common goal, and needs no further elaboration.

Section 682.402(d)(5)(i) 


24. 

Comment: 

Some commenters opposed the requirement that a borrower must assign to and relinquish in favor of the Secretary any
right to a loan refund (up to the amount discharged) from any private or public fund. The commenters were particularly
concerned with the effect they believed this requirement would have upon state tuition recovery funds. The commenters
also believed that the Secretary has no statutory right to any claim against a state tuition recovery fund because
the HEA fails to specifically provide the secretary with that right. The commenters noted that section 437(c)(2)
of the HEA limits the assignment to the Secretary of a borrower's right to a loan refund only to the borrower's rights
``* * * against the institution and its affiliates and principals.'' The commenters contended that
there is no indication that Congress intended the Secretary to have access to state funds or to require states to participate
economically in closed school loan discharges. The commenters believed that the HEA's omission of state tuition
recovery funds (or any other private or public fund) reflects the principal of statutory construction ``

expressio unius est exclusio alterius

'' (the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another). 


Discussion: 

 The Secretary believes that the statutory authority permitting the assignment to the Secretary of a borrower's right
to recover a loan refund from the school, its affiliates, or principals clearly contemplates the recovery of refunds
from private funds. A private fund is funded by parties who are directly or indirectly associated with the school,
and the HEA intends that the Secretary shall have a legal claim to a private tuition recovery fund in the event of a school
closure. Although they may be categorized as ``public funds,'' it is the Secretary's understanding that many state
tuition recovery funds rely in whole, or in part, on private funding provided by a school, its owners, or affiliates.
Therefore, the Secretary believes that a borrower's assignment of recovery rights against a public fund is applicable
only to the extent that a state tuition recovery fund or any other such public fund contains private money. The public
money in those funds should not be considered. 


Change: 

 The final regulations have been revised to exclude the portion of a public fund that represents public money. 
25. 

Comment: 

 Some commenters questioned why a borrower must assign to and relinquish in favor of the Secretary any right to a 

loan

 refund (up to the amount discharged) with respect to the enrollment agreement for the program for which the loan was
received. The commenters believed that the assignment of a borrower's rights pursuant to the enrollment agreement
would not gain anything for the Secretary. They were concerned that the borrower would be forced to surrender some
rights (unspecified) unnecessarily, despite the statement in  682.402(d)(5)(iii) that permits the borrower
(or student) to pursue legal and equitable relief regarding disputes arising from matters otherwise unrelated to
the loan discharged. 


Discussion: 

 The requirement that the borrower must assign to and relinquish in favor of the Secretary any right to a loan refund
(up to the amount discharged) does not preclude the borrower from pursuing legal action against the school or any related
party with respect to the terms of the student's enrollment agreement with the school, or with respect to any other
grievance the student may have against the school or those parties. 


Change: 

 None. 


Section 682.402(d)(6)(i) and (ii) 


26. 

Comment: 

Some commenters believed it was confusing to link guaranty agency requirements to a date other than the actual date
that a school closed. 


Discussion: 

 In some cases, a guaranty agency may not become aware of a school's closure until significantly after the date the school
actually closed. Therefore, the only workable way to create timeframes for guaranty agencies to perform certain
actions, such as notifying lenders to suspend collection efforts, would be to tie those timeframes to the date that
the agency first became aware, or was notified by the Secretary, that a school had closed.

27. 

Comment:

 Some commenters asked why August 29, 1994 was proposed as the effective date for this provision. 


Discussion:

 As a requirement for publishing the NPRM in the 

Federal Register

, a specific date had to be used instead of a generic reference such as ``prior to the effective date of these regulations.''
Therefore, August 29, 1994 was the Secretary's estimation (made prior to the date the NPRM was published) of when the
final regulations would be effective. 


Change:

 This date, and all other dates based on it, will be revised when the actual effective date is known. 


Section 682.402(d)(6)(i)(D) 


28. 

Comment:

 Some commenters believed that the regulations should require a guaranty agency to provide loan-specific information
to lenders so that lenders can more effectively suspend collection efforts against individuals with respect to loans
made at closed schools. The commenters noted that a lender would not be able to identify a PLUS borrower if the guarantor
notified the lender of the school code and closure date only. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that because the loan application retained by the lender will have the name of the school and
the period of enrollment for which the loan was made, the lender should be able to determine which individuals it should
suspend collection efforts against once the lender is notified of the date a school closed. The Secretary encourages
a guaranty agency to provide assistance to a lender that believes it is unable to identify the appropriate PLUS borrowers.



Change:

 None. 


Section 682.402(d)(6)(i)(E) 


29. 

Comment:

 Some commenters recommended that a guaranty agency be required to suspend collection activities on loans that it
holds for borrowers who the agency believes may be eligible for a closed school loan discharge. The commenters noted
that this is a requirement in the analogous regulation in  682.402(e)(6)(iv) and (v) with respect to false certification
discharges. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary had intended that this requirement would be in the NPRM. 


Change:

 The regulations have been amended to require a guaranty agency to take the same actions with respect to a borrower who
may be eligible for a closed school loan discharge as the agency is required to take under  682.402(e)(6)(iv)
and (v) with respect to a borrower who may be eligible for a false certification discharge. 
30. 

Comment:

 Some commenters noted that  682.402(d)(6)(i) of the proposed regulations did not specify what a guaranty agency
would be required to do upon the receipt of a complete application from a borrower whose loan is held by the guaranty
agency. The commenters recommended that the procedures required under  682.402(d)(6)(ii) should also apply
to  682.402(d)(6)(i). 

Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that the requirement for notifying the borrower that he or she does not qualify for a loan discharge
should be in both  682.402(d)(6)(i) and  682.402(d)(6)(ii). 


Change:

 The final regulations have been revised to add this requirement. 


Section 682.402(d)(6)(i)(F) 


31. 

Comment:

 Some commenters objected to the requirement that a guaranty agency must consult with representatives of the closed
school, the school's licensing agency, the accrediting agency, and other appropriate parties to learn the current
address of borrowers whose loans are held by the guaranty agency, and who have been identified as potentially eligible
for a closed school loan discharge. The commenters believed that the skiptracing efforts required under  682.410(b)(6)
are more likely to be successful than contacts with the closed school and its related agencies. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that special efforts should be made to contact borrowers who may be eligible for a closed school
loan discharge, but whose current address is unknown. Therefore, the interests of fairness to all borrowers justifies
the additional skiptracing efforts required by the regulations. 


Change:

 None.

Comment:

 Some commenters believed that a guaranty agency should not be the party that mails a discharge application to a borrower
identified under this subparagraph of the regulations. Instead, the commenters believed it would be more appropriate
for the guaranty agency to mail the application package to the lender or servicer, who would then mail it to the borrower.
The commenters believed that this change would assist the lender in determining when to cease collections and would
also avoid any borrower confusion. 



Discussion:

 This provision of the proposed regulations requires a guaranty agency to ``* * * review 

its records

 of loans that 

it holds

 * * *'' (emphasis added). The lender is not the holder of loans held by the guaranty agency. The guaranty
agency will mail the application package to a borrower whose loan is held by the agency. For loans held by a lender, the
lender will mail the application package to the borrower.

 Some commenters noted that, in the case of a loan held by the guaranty agency, the proposed regulations did not require
the guaranty agency to inform a borrower that the borrower's loan obligation has been discharged. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenters. 



Change:

 The final regulations have been revised to require a guaranty agency, in the case of a borrower whose loan is held by
the agency, to send written notification to the borrower no later than 30 days after the agency determines that the
borrower has satisfied all of the conditions required for discharge of the loan. 



Section 682.402(d)(6)(ii)(E) 



34. 

Comment:

 Some commenters believed it is counterproductive to set time limits that the borrower must meet if there is no penalty
incurred by a borrower who fails to comply with those time limits. The commenters recommended a deletion of the prohibition
against a borrower being denied a closed school loan discharge solely on the basis of the borrower's failure to meet
any time limits set by the lender, guaranty agency, or Secretary. 



Discussion:

 There are no time-driven requirements with respect to the submission of information that a borrower must meet to qualify
for a closed school loan discharge. Perhaps the commenters misinterpreted the lender's requirement in  682.402(d)(7)(ii)
to resume collection efforts against a borrower who failed to submit, within 60 days, the written request and sworn
statement necessary for loan discharge. However, that requirement only has the effect of reactivating collection
efforts, and does not disqualify the borrower from later submitting a complete application for loan discharge. 



Change:

 None. 



Section 682.402(d)(7)(i) 



35. 

Comment:

 Some commenters believed that a lender should not be permitted to suspend collection efforts against a borrower for
whom the lender has received reliable information from a source other than a guaranty agency or the Secretary indicating
that the borrower may be eligible for a closed school loan discharge. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary does not believe that either he or a guaranty agency will always be the first to know that a specific borrower
may be eligible for a closed school loan discharge. For example, the school itself could notify the lender that it had
closed, or a legal aid group working on behalf of students could notify the lender of students who it believed were eligible.
The Secretary believes that it would be in the best interests of the borrower to permit a lender to exercise its judgment
concerning the reliability of the sources of information it receives. 



Change:

 None. 



Section 682.402(d)(7)(ii) 



36. 

Comment:

 Some commenters believed that a lender that resumes collection activity against a borrower who fails to submit the
documentation required for a closed school loan discharge should be required to grant forbearance to the borrower
to absolve the borrower of any delinquency status existing on the loan, including delinquency that occurred before
the date the lender suspended collection activity. The commenters believed that the borrower's delinquency is generally
the result of the borrower's inability to pay due to circumstances caused by the school. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes there is no reason to conclude that a borrower who did not qualify for a closed school loan discharge
should, nevertheless, be presumed to have been harmed by the school to the extent that the borrower could not comply
with the terms of his or her repayment agreement with the lender. 



Change:

 None. 

37. 

Comment:

 Some commenters believed the 60-day administrative forbearance period permitted while a lender awaited the borrower's
submission of documentation is too short. The commenters believed that up to 90 days would be necessary to address
the borrower's questions and for the borrower to submit documentation to the lender. 



Discussion:

 A 60-day period is the standard administrative forbearance period permitted for purposes of awaiting documentation
for other purposes 

e.g., 

death, disability, or bankruptcy cancellations. The Secretary believes that 60 days is more than adequate for the
borrower to submit the request for discharge and sworn statement for a closed school discharge.

Section 682.402(d)(7)(iii) 



38. 

Comment:

 Some commenters objected to the requirement that a payment received by the lender from or on behalf of the borrower
after the lender filed a claim on the loan with the guaranty agency must be forwarded to the guaranty agency within 30
days of its receipt. The commenters contended that the guaranty agency is not the legal holder of the loan until it pays
a claim, and therefore has no right to the payment. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary sees no benefit in having the borrower's payment in the possession of the party that has forwarded other
loan related documents to the guaranty agency. The Secretary is aware of at least two ways for a lender to forward the
borrower's payment to a guaranty agency so that it can be applied to the borrower's outstanding loan balance: the lender
could cash the borrower's check and forward its own check payable to the guaranty agency on behalf of the borrower,
or the lender could forward the borrower's original check to the agency and the agency could hold the check until it
paid the lender's claim. 



Change:

 None. 



Section 682.402(d)(7)(iv) 



39. 

Comment:

 Some commenters believed that in the case of a claim filed by a lender, the guaranty agency, not the lender, should notify
the borrower that a closed school loan discharge has been granted. 



Discussion:

 The borrower had an obligation to repay the loan to the lender. The borrower has no obligation to repay the loan (it has
been discharged) to the guaranty agency. The borrower should be informed by the party to whom the borrower had been
obligated (the lender, if the claim was filed by the lender, or the guaranty agency, if the borrower's loan was held
by the guaranty agency) that the borrower's obligation to repay the loan to that party has been discharged. 



Change:

 None. 

40. 

Comment:

 Some commenters noted that the proposed regulations did not specify the actions that a lender must take when it is informed
by a guaranty agency that a borrower's request for a closed school discharge has been denied. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary had intended that the procedures that applied in the case of a false certification request would apply
to a closed school claim also. 



Change:

 The final regulations have been revised to specify in  682.402(d)(7)(v) the responsibilities of a lender when
it is notified by a guaranty agency that a borrower's request for a closed school discharge has been denied. 



Section 682.402(e) False Certification by a School of a Student's Eligibility to Borrow 



41. 

Comment:

 Some commenters requested the Secretary to specifically state in the regulations what the effect of a false certification
discharge would be on a school's cohort default rate. 



Discussion:

 This issue would be more appropriately addressed in the definition of a school's cohort default rate in 34 CFR Part
668. While the Secretary does not believe that a school that falsely certified a borrower's eligibility should be
allowed to benefit from that false certification by having its default rate reduced as a consequence, he is studying
this issue to determine the appropriate treatment of such cases, and will make a decision when information concerning
actual cases of false certification discharges is available. 



Change:

 None. 



Section 682.402(e)(1) 



42. 

Comment:

 Some commenters believed that a parent should not have a Federal PLUS Loan discharged if the school falsely certified
the eligibility of the student for whom the parent obtained the PLUS Loan. The commenters believed that only loans
obtained directly by the student should be discharged under this section. 



Discussion:

 Section 437(c)(1) of the HEA was amended by (Pub. L. 103-208) to permit a parent to receive a discharge of a PLUS
Loan if the school falsely certified the eligibility of the student for whom the parent obtained the PLUS Loan. 



Change:

 None. 

43. 

Comment:

 Some commenters requested clarification of whether the false certification discharge applied to a loan that was
partially disbursed on or after January 1, 1986. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary has been given authority pursuant to section 437(c)(1) of the HEA to discharge the borrower's liability
on a loan ``* * * received, on or after January 1, 1986 * * *'' if the student's eligibility
to borrow was falsely certified by the school. For purposes of the false certification discharge, the Secretary will
consider the borrower's entire loan eligible if any part of it was disbursed by the lender on or after January 1, 1986.

Change:

 The final regulations have been revised to incorporate this clarification. 

44. 

Comment:

 Some commenters objected to the restriction that a false certification discharge would only apply if the false certification
was made by an ``eligible'' institution. The commenters believed that the HEA intended the false certification discharge
provision to apply to certifications made by both ``eligible'' and ``ineligible'' schools. 



Discussion:

 This was discussed in detail on page 2490 of the NPRM published on January 14, 1994 (FR 59, No. 10). The Secretary has
been given authority pursuant to section 437(c)(1) of the HEA to discharge the borrower's liability on a loan if the
student's eligibility to borrow ``* * * was falsely certified by the 

eligible

 institution * * *. '' (emphasis added.) The statute prescribes the scope of the discharge for false
certification under section 437(c) as extending to those instances in which the ``student's eligibility to borrow
under this part was falsely certified by the 

eligible institution

 * * *.'' 20 U.S.C. 1087(c)(1). 

The commenters proposal would have the effect of ignoring this language, which on its face limits relief to individuals
whose personal eligibility status was falsely certified, rather than to those who contend that they were ineligible
because the school at which they were enrolled was not an ``eligible institution.'' This limitation embodies a congressional
choice to exclude those grounds that were really challenges to the eligibility status of the school itself, and nothing
in the language or the legislative history suggests that this limitation is inadvertent or unintended. Moreover,
institutional eligibility rests directly and indirectly on a host of qualifications. The lack of one or more of these
qualities in a school mistakenly determined to be eligible by the Department would, under the commenters' view, suffice
to make eligible for discharge 

all

 borrowers enrolled at the institution while the deficiency persisted_a period that could stretch over several years_regardless
of whether that deficiency related to the adequacy of the training and skills provided to the borrower. 


The text itself and the legislative history show no intention of such a broad and costly view of the discharge provision.
The Secretary does not, however, consider borrowers who attended schools that allegedly lacked eligibility to be
barred by that alleged deficiency from relief under the false certification provision, but merely that the falsity
on which they would seek relief must relate to a certification about their personal eligibility, and not that of the
allegedly ineligible institution. The Secretary does not have the authority to discharge a loan that was made to a
borrower for attendance at an ineligible school. 



Change

: None. 



Section 682.402(e)(2)(ii) 



45. 

Comment

: Some commenters noted that lenders and guaranty agencies generally are not required to keep loan records longer
than five years after the date a loan is paid in full. In light of the borrower's statutory right to a false certification
discharge for loans received on or after January 1, 1986, the commenters recommended that the regulations prescribe
the procedures to be followed by lenders and guaranty agencies who learn of borrowers who claim to have repaid their
loans in full more than five years ago, but for whom the lender or guaranty agency has no existing records. 



Discussion

: In these cases, the Secretary expects the lender and guaranty agency will examine records reasonably available
to them from other sources. If the lender or guaranty agency are unable to locate records of a loan paid in full more than
five years ago, it would be the responsibility of a borrower who requests a loan discharge to provide the required documentation
needed for a discharge of the loan. 



Change

: None. 



Section 682.402(e)(2)(iv) 



46. 

Comment

: Some commenters recommended that the regulations require the holder of a loan discharged under the false certification
discharge provision to forward the original promissory note marked ``canceled'' or ``satisfied in full'' to the
borrower within 30 days after discharging the borrower's loan obligation.

application and associated sworn statement from the borrower. 



Discussion

Change

Section 682.402(e)(3)(ii)(B) 



48. 

Comment

: Some commenters objected to the proposed regulation that would limit a false certification discharge to only those
cases where a student admitted to a school on the basis of a purported ability to benefit from the school's training
did not meet the applicable requirements for admission on the basis of ability to benefit. The commenters believed
that the HEA did not envision any restriction as to what would constitute a school's false certification of a student's
eligibility to borrow under the FFEL Program. Other commenters believed that some restrictions should apply, and
proposed additional acts and certifications of a school that should be construed as false certifications. Some commenters
were pleased with the regulations as written, and recommended no changes. 



Discussion

: The additional acts and certifications by a school that the commenters proposed were the same as those discussed
in the NPRM published on January 14, 1994 (FR 59, No. 10). For the reasons stated on pages 2488-2490 of the NPRM,
and for the additional reasons discussed earlier in response to comment 5, the Secretary believes that the term ``falsely
certified,'' when used for purposes of a false certification discharge, applies to cases involving a school's invalid
certification that a student had the ability to benefit from the training offered by the school, or cases where the
school signed a person's name on the loan application or the promissory note, and certain cases where the school wrongfully
endorsed a person's name on the loan check, or the borrower's authorization for electronically transferring loan
proceeds. 

The Secretary believes that if the school rather than the student signed a person's name on the loan application or
the promissory note, the putative borrower is not aware that a loan was being applied for and had no intention of entering
into an agreement to repay a loan. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that a borrower who did not sign the application
or promissory note could not have completely understood that a check later presented for endorsement would represent
the proceeds of such a loan, and would not have intended to signify by endorsing such a check or authorization to release
funds that he or she agreed to become obligated to repay a loan. A school that signed a person's name on a precursory document
(the loan application or the promissory note) effectively prevented the person from being fully aware of the relationship
normally apparent to a borrower who first completes an application for a loan and later receives a loan disbursement
as a result of that application. 

The Secretary understands that in some cases, an unscrupulous school may obtain the valid signature of a borrower
on the loan application or promissory note and will later sign the student's name on the loan check or the authorization
for electronic funds transfer. However, despite these actions, a student could have materially benefitted from
the loan proceeds by a reduction of the charges owed to the school or by otherwise receiving proceeds of the loan delivered
by the school. The Secretary believes that a person who signed the loan application and promissory note should be considered
an individual who was aware that he or she requested a loan. Therefore, if the borrower (or student on whose behalf a
parent borrowed a PLUS Loan) was enrolled at the school during the period of time that the loan (or an installment thereof)
was intended to cover, and someone other than the borrower signed the borrower's name on a loan check or authorization
for electronic funds transfer, causing the loan proceeds to be applied to the student's account to satisfy a liability
for tuition and other charges owed to the school, or to be delivered to the borrower, it is reasonable to conclude that
the borrower by that action received the proceeds of the loan he or she had applied. Because that borrower obtained
the benefits of the loan disbursement, even though the borrower realized that he or she did not sign the loan check or
the authorization for electronic funds transfer, that borrower would be legally obligated with respect to that disbursement.
In this case, the Secretary does not believe that a loan discharge was contemplated by Congress. However, if it is determined
that the borrower or student did not benefit from the loan proceeds, the Secretary believes that the borrower should
be relieved of any obligation to repay the amount of the loan proceeds transmitted as a result of a falsely signed loan
check or authorization for electronic funds transfer, and that such relief can be included in the procedures adopted
for discharges under section 437(c) of the HEA.

The Secretary is concerned with the plight of students who have been misled by unscrupulous schools, or who have been
harmed by a school's failure to fulfill its obligations (such as the payment of a refund to the student). Practices
of this sort are violations of 34 CFR part 668, subpart F, which governs misrepresentations by schools. The Secretary
will take a broad range of sanctions against schools to enforce these provisions. The Secretary also notes that recent
changes made to Title IV, Part H of the HEA will reduce the incidence of school malfeasance. Further, the Secretary
will determine if relief can be provided to such students in future regulations or legislative amendments. However,
not all cases of school malfeasance can currently be classified as a school's ``false certification of a student's
eligibility to borrow'' that would permit a borrower to receive a loan discharge under the HEA. For example, although
misrepresentations regarding the school's educational program or its financial or administrative capability,
including the school's placement services or the quality of the school's facilities, faculty, or equipment, may
well have induced the student to enroll at the school, those representations are not part of the process of ``certification''
of the student's eligibility to borrow. 



Change: 

The final regulations have been revised to permit false certification discharges in cases where the school, without
the authorization of the individual, signed a person's name on the loan application or the promissory note. In addition,
the regulations provide relief where the school, without borrower authorization, endorsed the borrower's name
on a loan check or authorization for electronic funds transfer, providing that the student did not receive, directly
or indirectly, the benefits of the loan proceeds disbursed by that loan check or authorization for electronic funds
transfer that was signed by the school. The regulations will include provisions for a borrower to appeal to the Secretary
if the borrower disagrees with a guaranty agency's decision that the signatures in question were signed by the borrower.




Section 682.402(e)(3)(ii)(C) 



49. 

Comment: 

Some commenters believed it was unnecessary for the student to certify that he or she was certified by the school on
the application for the loan as an eligible student. The commenters believed that this information is seldom known
to students because they may never see or understand what the school wrote on the application. The commenters noted
that the student could generally deduce that the school had made such a certification by the fact that a lender made
the loan, but believe that the same deduction could just as easily be made by a guaranty agency or the Secretary. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees with the commenters. 



Change: 

The final regulations have been revised to delete this requirement. 



Section 682.402(e)(3)(ii)(D) 



50. 

Comment: 

Some commenters believed there is no statutory justification for denying a false certification discharge if the
student was able to obtain employment in the occupation for which the student's program was intended to provide training.




Discussion: 

In the case of a discharge based on a school's defective certification that the student had the ability to benefit from
the school's training, this was discussed in detail on pages 2488-2490 of the NPRM published on January 14, 1994
(FR 59, No. 10). The Secretary believes that the ability of a student to obtain employment in the occupation for which
the student's program was intended to provide training is evidence that the student was able to benefit from the education
received, even though the school may have improperly tested, or failed to test, the student's ability to benefit from
the school's training.

Comment:

 Some commenters questioned what would constitute a student's ``reasonable attempt to obtain employment'' and questioned
whether it would be fair to expect the student to be able to document, or even remember such attempts that may have been
made many years ago. 



Discussion:

 In the absence of evidence to the contrary, a student who states that he or she made a ``reasonable attempt to obtain
employment'' will be presumed to have done so. The student is simply being asked to sign a statement to that effect.




Change:

 None. 



Section 682.402(e)(3)(iv) 



52. 

Comment:

 Some commenters, while believing that borrower cooperation is important in an enforcement action undertaken against
a school or other related parties, were concerned that a borrower may be unable to take time away from work, home, or
other activities to travel to multiple court appearances needed to assist the Secretary or his designee in the enforcement
action. The commenters believed that a borrower should be required to assist in an enforcement action only to the extent
practicable for the borrower. 



Discussion:

 The discussion following comment 23 also applies to a false certification discharge. 



Change:

 None. 



Section 682.402(e)(5)(i) 



53. 

Comment:

 Some commenters opposed the requirement that a borrower must assign to and relinquish in favor of the Secretary any
right to a loan refund (up to the amount discharged) from any private or public fund. The commenters were particularly
concerned with the effect they believed this requirement would have upon state tuition recovery funds. The commenters
also believed that the Secretary has no statutory right to any claim against a state tuition recovery fund because
the HEA fails to specifically provide the secretary with that right. The commenters noted that the section 437(c)(2)
of the HEA limits the assignment to the Secretary of a borrower's right to a loan refund only to the borrower's rights
``* * * against the institution and its affiliates and principals.'' The commenters contend
that there is no indication that Congress intended the Secretary to have access to state funds or to require states
to participate economically in false certification discharges. The commenters believed that the HEA's omission
of state tuition recovery funds (or any other private or public fund) reflects the principal of statutory construction


``expressio unius est exclusio alterius'' 

(the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another). 



Discussion:

 The discussion following comment 24 also applies to a false certification discharge. 



Change:

 The final regulations have been revised to exclude the portion of a public fund that represents public money. 

54. 

Comment:

 Some commenters questioned why a borrower must assign to and relinquish in favor of the Secretary any right to a loan
refund (up to the amount discharged) with respect to the enrollment agreement for the program for which the loan was
received. The commenters believed that the assignment of a borrower's rights pursuant to the enrollment agreement
would not gain anything for the Secretary. They were concerned that the borrower would be forced to surrender some
rights (unspecified) unnecessarily, despite the statement in  682.402(e)(5)(iii) that permits the borrower
(or student) to pursue legal and equitable relief regarding disputes arising from matters otherwise unrelated to
the loan discharged. 



Discussion:

 The discussion following comment 25 also applies to a false certification discharge. 



Change:

 None. 



Section 682.402(e)(6)(i) 



55. 

Comment:

 Some commenters objected to the requirement that a guaranty agency must review records available from sources other
than the guarantor after receiving a false certification claim from a lender or a discharge request from a borrower.
The commenters believed this requirement is logistically unrealistic and unnecessarily complicates and delays
the processing of a false certification claim. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that the guaranty agency is in the best position to consult with other knowledgeable parties
concerning a school's alleged false certification of a student's eligibility to borrow. The Secretary believes
that the 90-day time period allows sufficient time for an agency to examine the lender's false certification claim
in light of the information available to the agency and to either pay or return the claim to the lender. 



Change:

 None. 



Section 682.402(e)(7)(ii) 



56. 

Comment:

 Some commenters believed that a lender that resumes collection activity against a borrower who fails to submit the
documentation required for a false certification discharge should be required to grant forbearance to the borrower
to absolve the borrower of any delinquency status existing on the loan, including delinquency that occurred before
the date the lender suspended collection activity. The commenters believed that the borrower's delinquency is generally
the result of the borrower's inability to pay due to circumstances caused by the school. 



Discussion:

 The discussion following comment 36 also applies to a false certification discharge. 



Change:

 None. 



Section 682.402(e)(7)(iii)

Comment:

 Some commenters objected to the requirement that a payment received by the lender from or on behalf of the borrower
after the lender filed a claim on the loan with the guaranty agency must be forwarded to the guaranty agency within 30
days of its receipt. The commenters contended that the guaranty agency is not the legal holder of the loan until it pays
a claim, and therefore has no right to the payment.

59. 

Comment: 

Some commenters believed that any payments received by a guaranty agency from or on behalf of a borrower whose loan
obligation has been discharged should be returned to the borrower or the party who made the payment. 


Discussion: 

If a borrower, or a borrower's representative remits a payment for a loan obligation that has been discharged, even
though he or she previously has had the payment returned with a notice that the obligation has been discharged and no
further payments are required, the Secretary believes it is reasonable to conclude that a subsequent payment from
that individual is an indication that he or she has expressed a desire to repay the discharged loan. The Secretary does
not believe that the borrower's (or his or her representative's) desire to repay the loan should be frustrated or the
taxpayer denied the recovery of such payments.

None. 


Section 682.410(b)(6)(i) 


60. 

Comment: 

Some commenters believed the proposed regulations would prohibit a guaranty agency from attempting an annual IRS
offset against a borrower if the agency had initiated wage garnishment procedures against the borrower. 


Discussion: 

Under the proposed regulations, a guaranty agency was required to attempt an annual IRS offset against a borrower
who owed a defaulted loan if the agency had not attempted to garnish the borrower's wages. Conversely, if an agency
had initiated wage garnishment procedures against the borrower, it was not required to attempt an annual IRS offset,
but could do so if it decided that it would be an appropriate action to take in addition to wage garnishment. Based on
Public Law 102-589, the Secretary will now require a guaranty agency to attempt an annual IRS tax refund offset
against both categories of borrowers. 


Change: 

The final regulations have been revised to incorporate this requirement. 


Section 682.410(b)(6)(vii)(B) 


61. 

Comment: 

Some commenters noted that the Secretary's guidance to guaranty agencies in July 1993 concerning Public Law 102-589
explained that the law no longer required the Secretary to hold a loan to be collected by IRS offset, therefore, a guaranty
agency was no longer required to assign a loan temporarily to the Secretary in order to allow the Secretary to collect
the loan by federal income tax refund offset. The commenters recommended that references to such assignments be deleted
from the regulations. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees with the commenters. 


Change: 

Sections 682.410(b)(5)(vi)(H) and (L),  682.410(b)(6)(i), (iii), (iv)(B), (vii)(A)-(D), (viii)(A), (xii),
and  682.410(b)(7(iv)(B) of the final regulations have been revised, renumbered, or deleted to remove references
to such assignments. 


Section 682.410(b)(10)(i) 


62. 

Comment: 

Some commenters objected to the requirement that a guaranty agency must follow the procedures prescribed in the regulations
if it decided to garnish the wages of a borrower who owed a defaulted loan. The commenters believed that a guaranty agency
that possessed authority under state law to effect a garnishment should be permitted to garnish the borrower's wages
under the state's wage garnishment procedures. 


Discussion: 

The procedures that a guaranty agency must follow when attempting to garnish a borrower's wages are mandated by section
488A of the HEA. Those procedures supersede any state garnishment laws that do not comply with the requirements of
the national wage garnishment authority established by the HEA. 


Change: 

None. 
63. 

Comment: 

Some commenters asked if the wage garnishment procedures would apply against borrowers and employers who were subject
to tribal laws. The commenters noted that section 488A(a) of the HEA does not refer to tribal laws, but simply states
that the garnishment provisions of the HEA apply ``* * *  (N)otwithstanding any provision
of State law * * *.'' The commenters observed that because of the difficulty and low success ratio of
obtaining a judgment through tribal courts, most creditors no longer even make the attempt. 


Discussion: 

Section 488A(a) of the HEA preempts state laws that might prohibit garnishment to collect student loan debts; it does
not preempt such laws of a foreign nation. Certain tribes of American Indians are considered to have the same relationship
with the United States as do foreign nations. Therefore, the laws of those tribes are not preempted by the wage garnishment
provisions of the HEA. 


Change: 

None.

64. 

Comment: 

Some commenters believed the regulations should specify that the amount of a borrower's wages that may be garnished
is the lesser of 10 percent of the borrower's disposable pay or the amount allowed by 15 U.S.C. 1673. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees with the commenters. 


Change: 

The final regulations have been revised to incorporate this clarification. 
65. 

Comment: 

Some commenters believed the regulations should specify the deductions from a borrower's wages that would take precedence
over a wage garnishment order.

Discussion: 

Only a borrower's disposable pay is subject to garnishment. Since ``disposable pay'' is defined as that part of a borrower's
compensation from an employer remaining after the deduction of any amounts required by law to be withheld, any such
deductions ``take precedence'' and will affect the amount recovered from the borrower through garnishment. The
Secretary has no authority to modify the withholding orders issued by other entities legally empowered to garnish
the borrower's pay for other purposes. 


Change: 

None. 


Section 682.410(b)(10)(i)(D) 


66. 

Comment: 

Some commenters believed that a guaranty agency should be permitted to automatically garnish the wages of a borrower
who failed to maintain the terms of a repayment agreement with the guaranty agency. The commenters believed that it
is unnecessary to provide further notice or appeal opportunities to a borrower who has broken the terms of the repayment
agreement. Similarly, other commenters believed that a guaranty agency should be permitted to proceed with wage
garnishment against a borrower who has defaulted on a loan without being required to offer a repayment opportunity
to the borrower. The commenters believed that a borrower who has defaulted on a loan has already had numerous opportunities
to repay the loan. Some commenters suggested that a borrower be limited to only one repayment opportunity. 

Discussion: 

All attempted garnishments must be preceded by a notice to the borrower of the guaranty agency's intention to initiate
garnishment proceedings and an explanation of the borrower's rights, including the right to a hearing. The due process
protection afforded the borrower under the HEA's garnishment rules renders previous repayment arrangements between
the borrower and the agency irrelevant. Each garnishment action must be able to stand on its own as far as compliance
with the requirements of the statute and regulations is concerned. 


Change: 

None. 
67. 

Comment: 

Some commenters believed that the wage garnishment provisions of the HEA applied only to a borrower who entered into
a repayment agreement with the guaranty agency and then later failed to comply with the terms of that agreement. The
commenters believed there is no statutory authority to garnish the wages of a borrower simply because the borrower
has defaulted on the loan obligation and has not made arrangements with the guaranty agency to repay the debt. 


Discussion: 

The HEA permits a guaranty agency to garnish the pay of a borrower who ``* * * is not currently making
required repayment under a repayment agreement * * *.'' A borrower who owes a defaulted loan and has
simply refused to make any repayment arrangement with a guaranty agency would certainly fit that description. Otherwise,
borrowers could shield themselves from wage garnishment by refusing to enter into agreements to repay their loans
to guaranty agencies. The HEA and the regulations are not designed to provide incentives to borrowers who refuse to
repay their debts. 


Change: 

None. 
68. 

Comment: 

Some commenters believed that the terms of the repayment agreement opportunity that a guaranty agency must offer
a borrower prior to wage garnishment must be similar to the terms offered to a borrower under the loan rehabilitation
program, that is, the borrower may not be required to pay more than a reasonable and affordable amount. 


Discussion: 

Section 488A(a)(4) of the HEA states that an individual subject to wage garnishment shall be provided an opportunity
to enter into a written agreement with the guaranty agency under terms agreeable to the guaranty agency. Unlike other
areas of the HEA that contain provisions mandating that the borrower's payment be ``reasonable and affordable,''
the wage garnishment section of the HEA contains no such requirement. The Secretary believes this is because Congress
realized that a borrower who has not repaid his or her loan will have had numerous opportunities to have done so prior
to the initiation of a wage garnishment proceeding. For example, the borrower will have already declined the opportunity
to make payments under the loan rehabilitation program. 
However, since it would make no sense to demand a payment amounts from a borrower who could document that he or she was
unable to pay those amounts, the Secretary encourages a guaranty agency, even at this late point, to attempt to accommodate
a borrower who expresses a willingness to repay the loan but who is unable to do so under the terms proposed by the guaranty
agency because of a documented hardship explained by the borrower. 


Change: 

None. 


Section 682.410(b)(10)(i)(E) 


69. 

Comment: 

Some commenters believed a guaranty agency should be permitted to include a notice to the borrower about wage garnishment
with the agency's other notices to the borrower about hearing opportunities available to the borrower with respect
to IRS offset procedures and credit bureau reporting. The commenters recommended that a guaranty agency not be required
to provide the borrower with an opportunity for a hearing more than once every 12 months. The commenters also believed
that if the borrower had received a hearing and unsuccessfully contested the existence or the amount of the debt, the
borrower need not be provided another hearing on those issues. 


Discussion: 

As permitted under  682.410(b)(5)(vi)(H), a guaranty agency may send a combined notice, or separate notices
to a borrower concerning credit bureau reporting, IRS offset, wage garnishment, and any other enforcement action
that may be taken to collect the debt. However, each garnishment proceeding taken against a borrower must comply with
the notice and due process requirements that are unique to wage garnishment. 


Change: 

None.

Comment

: Some commenters objected to the requirement that a guaranty agency must sue an employer who fails to comply with a
garnishment order. The commenters note that section 488A(a)(6) of the HEA provides an option by stating that a guaranty
agency ``* * * may sue the employer.'' Other commenters recommended that the regulations permit a
guaranty agency to decline to sue an employer who fails to comply with the wage garnishment order if the agency can demonstrate
that the expected cost and probability of success of the litigation did not justify a lawsuit. 



Discussion

: The statutory language provides the authority for a guaranty agency to sue the employer. A guaranty agency is not
required to garnish the wages of borrowers who owe defaulted loans, but if an agency chooses to do so, it must follow
the garnishment procedures prescribed in these regulations. In order to protect the interests of borrowers and taxpayers,
the Secretary believes a guaranty agency should make use of the full extent of the statutory authority available to
it under the HEA to compel an employer to comply with a wage garnishment order. The Secretary cannot envision any realistic
probability that an agency would be unsuccessful in its suit against an employer that was in clear violation of the
garnishment order. Given the expectation of such success, the Secretary believes the agency's litigation efforts
and costs would be minimal. Accordingly, this would be part of the agency's normal performance of its role of ensuring
the maximum collection of defaulted loans, and the Secretary may refuse to make reinsurance payments, or may recover
reinsurance payments already made to an agency that fails to sue an employer that was in clear violation of the garnishment
order.



Change

: None. 

71. 

Comment

: Some commenters did not believe that a self-employed borrower should be considered an ``employer'' for wage garnishment
purposes. The commenters believed that garnishment should be considered a proceeding to seize the wages of a debtor
paid by another party. 



Discussion

: The Secretary agrees with the commenters. 



Change

: The reference to a self-employed borrower in  682.410(b)(10)(i)(F) has been deleted from the final regulations.




Section 682.410(b)(10)(i)(G) 



72. 

Comment

: Some commenters were opposed to the qualified prohibition in the regulations that prevents a guaranty agency from
garnishing the wages of a borrower whom it knows has been involuntarily separated from employment until the borrower
has been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months. The commenters believed that the proposed regulations appear
to condone garnishment as long as the guarantor is not aware that the borrower has been involuntarily separated from
employment and has not been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months. They believed that the HEA does not permit
garnishment under any circumstances until a borrower who has been involuntarily separated from employment has been
reemployed continuously for at least 12 months.

 

Discussion

: The borrower will be informed of his or her rights with respect to wage garnishment in the notice sent to the borrower
at least 30 days before the initiation of garnishment proceedings. That notice will include information about the
exception provided for a borrower who has been involuntarily separated from employment.






Note:

 All garnishments initiated by guaranty agencies on or after March 1, 1994 must comply with the standardized administrative
wage garnishment procedures approved by the Secretary on February 1, 1994. As part of those standardized procedures,
a guaranty agency must send a notice to the borrower prior to initiating garnishment. The standardized notice fully
explains the exception for involuntarily separated borrowers and includes a simple form for the borrower to fill
out to request this exception.

 


If a borrower who meets the conditions necessary for this exception wishes to take advantage of it, the borrower will
be able to do so quite easily, either before the garnishment proceedings are initiated, or during the hearing available
to the borrower. If the borrower chooses not to divulge information concerning an involuntary separation, and there
is no reasonable expectation that the guaranty agency should have known about the borrower's undisclosed involuntary
separation, the Secretary believes that a resulting garnishment of the borrower's wages should not be invalidated
if the borrower later contests the garnishment on those grounds or if the agency later learns that the borrower would
have been eligible for the exception.



Change:

 None. 



Section 682.410(b)(10)(i)(I) 



73. 

Comment

: Some commenters believed the withholding notice sent to a borrower's employer should inform the employer that the
HEA prohibits wage garnishment if the borrower has not been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months. 



Discussion

: All information relating to the borrower's rights will be disclosed to the borrower. The borrower's employer needs
to know only that information necessary for the employer to comply with the withholding order. 



Change

: None. 



Section 682.410(b)(10)(i)(J) 



74. 

Comment

: Some commenters believed that, to avoid a misunderstanding, the regulations should state that the location of a
borrower's wage garnishment hearing is established by the guaranty agency. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenters. 



Change:

 The final regulations have been revised to incorporate this clarification. 

75. 

Comment:

 Some commenters believed that a wage garnishment hearing held by a guaranty agency should be a taped hearing held in
a location accessible to the borrower. The commenters also believed that the borrower should be given the right to
appeal any adverse decision of the guaranty agency to the Secretary, and the borrower should be informed of that right.

Discussion: 

The regulations require a guaranty agency to provide a hearing by a telephone conference with a borrower who requests
that type of hearing. All telephonic costs associated with the hearing will be the responsibility of the guaranty
agency. The Secretary believes this option reasonably accommodates borrowers who either choose to or who are unable
to attend an in-person hearing with the guaranty agency. The Secretary sees no reason to compel a guaranty agency to
tape the hearing, but would not object if an agency wished to do so. The Secretary does not intend to second-guess an
agency's decisions about wage garnishments on a case-by-case basis. However, if the Secretary learns that a guaranty
agency has failed to comply with procedures prescribed by the HEA and the regulations, or has failed to adhere to the
standardized procedures required of all agencies (see note included in the discussion for  682.410(b)(10)(i)(G)
above), the Secretary will take appropriate action. 



Change: 

None. 



Section 682.410(b)(10)(i)(K) 



76. 

Comment: 

Some commenters believed that the regulations should clarify that, absent evidence to the contrary, the borrower
shall be deemed to have received the notice of intent to garnish five days after its mailing date. The commenters believed
this would prevent disputes about the date the borrower received the notice. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees with the commenters.



Change: 

The final regulations have been revised to incorporate this clarification in this paragraph, and the associated
paragraph 682.410(b)(10)(i)(L). 



Section 682.410(b)(10)(i)(L) 



77. 

Comment: 

Some commenters opposed the requirement that a guaranty agency must provide a hearing to a borrower whose written
request for the hearing is received later than 15 days after the borrower received a notice of withholding. The commenters
believed there is no statutory support for any exception to what they perceive to be a rigid 15-day deadline for a borrower
to make such a request. 



Discussion: 

The commenters are incorrect. Section 488A(b) of the HEA specifically requires a guaranty agency to provide a hearing
upon a borrower's request, even if the borrower's request is not made timely. Although the agency is not required to
delay the issuance of a withholding order to the borrower's employer, the agency could do so, as explained in comment
78, if the agency believes a delay would be appropriate. 



Change: 

None. 

78. 

Comment: 

Some commenters believed that even though a borrower's written request for a hearing is submitted late, there could
nevertheless be valid reasons why the guaranty agency should not issue a withholding order to the borrower's employer.
The commenters believed that this section of the regulations conflicted with  682.410(b)(10)(i)(H) which
permits a guaranty agency to delay or cancel the withholding order if the agency receives information that it believes
justifies the delay or cancellation. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees with the commenters. 



Change: 

The final regulations have been revised to permit a guaranty agency to exercise this option. 



Section 682.410(b)(10)(i)(M) 



79. 

Comment: 

Some commenters believed that the regulations should clarify that guaranty agencies may use alternative types of
hearing examiners and are not limited to appointing only an administrative law judge. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary did not intend that the regulations be interpreted in the limited manner that some commenters have done,
or in a manner that the commenters believe that other parties will do. A guaranty agency's hearing official may be any
qualified individual, including an administrative law judge, who is not under the supervision or control of the head
of the guaranty agency. 



Change: 

The final regulations have been revised to incorporate this clarification. 



Assessment of Educational Impact 



The Secretary particularly requests comments on whether the proposed regulations in this document would require
transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United
States.

 682.402 

Death, disability, closed school, false certification, and bankruptcy payments. 


(a) 

General. 

(1) Rules governing the payment of claims based on filing for relief in bankruptcy, and discharge of loans due to death,
total and permanent disability, attendance at a school that closes, and false certification by a school of a borrower's
eligibility for a loan, are set forth in this section. 
(2) If a PLUS loan was obtained by two parents as co-makers, or a Consolidation loan was obtained by a married couple,
and only one of the borrowers dies, becomes totally and permanently disabled, has collection of his or her loan obligation
stayed by a bankruptcy filing, or has that obligation discharged in bankruptcy, the other borrower remains obligated
to repay the loan.

(3) Except for a borrower's loan obligation discharged by the Secretary under the false certification discharge
provision of paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a loan qualifies for payment under this section only to the extent
that the loan is 
legally enforceable under applicable law by the holder of the loan. 
(4) For purposes of this section_
(i) The legal enforceability of a loan is conclusively determined on the basis of a ruling by a court or administrative
tribunal of competent jurisdiction with respect to that loan, or a ruling with respect to another loan in a judgment
that collaterally estops the holder from contesting the enforceability of the loan; 
(ii) A loan is conclusively determined to be legally unenforceable to the extent that the guarantor determines, pursuant
to an objection presented in a proceeding conducted in connection with credit bureau reporting, tax refund offset,
wage garnishment, or in any other administrative proceeding, that the loan is not legally enforceable; and 
(iii) If an objection has been raised by the borrower or another party about the legal enforceability of the loan and
no determination has been made under paragraph (a)(4) (i) or (ii) of this section, the Secretary may authorize the
payment of a claim under this section under conditions the Secretary considers appropriate. If the Secretary determines
in that or any other case that a claim was paid under this section with respect to a loan that was not a legally enforceable
obligation of the borrower, the recipient of that payment must refund that amount of the payment to the Secretary.

(b) 

Death. 

(1) If an individual borrower dies, or, on or after July 23, 1992 the student for whom a parent received a PLUS loan dies,
the obligation of the borrower and any endorser to make any further payments on the loan is discharged. 
(2) In determining that a borrower (or student) has died, the lender may rely on a death certificate or other proof of
death that is acceptable under applicable state law. If a death certificate or other acceptable proof of death is not
available, the borrower's obligation on the loan can be discharged only if the guaranty agency determines that other
evidence establishes that the borrower (or student) has died. 
(3) After receiving information indicating that the borrower (or student) has died, the lender, if it believes the
information to be reliable, shall suspend any collection activity against the borrower and promptly request that
the borrower's representative (or the student's parent in the case of a PLUS loan) provide the documentation described
in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. During the suspension of collection activity, which may not exceed 60 days, the
lender shall diligently attempt to obtain documentation verifying the borrower's (or student's) death. If, despite
diligent attempts, the lender is not able to confirm the borrower's (or student's) death within 60 days, the lender
shall resume collection activity from the point that it had been discontinued and is deemed to have exercised forbearance
as to repayment of the loan during the period when collection activity was suspended.

(4) Once the lender has determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section that the borrower (or student) has died,
the lender may not attempt to collect on the loan from the borrower's estate or from any endorser. 

(5) The lender shall return to the sender any payments received from the estate or paid on behalf of the borrower after
the date of the borrower's (or student's) death. 

(c) 

Total and permanent disability.

 (1) If the lender determines that an individual borrower is totally and permanently disabled, the obligation of the
borrower and any endorser to make any further payments on the loan is discharged. A borrower is not considered totally
and permanently disabled on the basis of a condition that existed at the time he or she applied for the loan, unless the
borrower's condition has substantially deteriorated later, so as to render the borrower totally and permanently
disabled. In the case of a Consolidation loan, the borrower must certify that the condition did not exist prior to the
time the borrower applied for each of the underlying loans, unless the condition has substantially deteriorated,
so as to render the borrower totally and permanently disabled. If the condition existed prior to the date the Consolidation
loan was made, the borrower must provide the lender with the disbursement dates of the underlying loans if the information
does not already appear in the borrower's loan file possessed by the lender.

a current or former borrower's obligation with respect to the loan in accordance with the provisions of paragraph
(e) of this section, if the borrower's (or the student for whom a parent received a PLUS loan) eligibility to receive
the loan was falsely certified by an eligible school. For purposes of a false certification discharge, the term ``borrower''

transfer, unless the student for whom the loan was made received the proceeds of the loan either by actual delivery
of the loan funds or by a credit in the amount of the contested disbursement applied to charges owed to the school for
that portion of the educational program completed by the student. However, the Secretary does not reimburse the lender
with respect to any amount disbursed by means of a check bearing an unauthorized endorsement unless the school also
executed the application or promissory note for that loan for the named borrower without that individual's consent.


(2) 

Relief available pursuant to discharge. 

(i) Discharge under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section relieves the borrower of an existing or past obligation to
repay the loan certified by the school, and any charges imposed or costs incurred by the holder with respect to the loan
that the borrower is, or was, otherwise obligated to pay. 

(ii) A discharge of a loan under paragraph (e) of this section qualifies the borrower for reimbursement of amounts
paid voluntarily or through enforced collection on a loan obligation discharged under paragraph (e) of this section.


(iii) A borrower who has defaulted on a loan discharged under paragraph (e) of this section is not regarded as in default
on the loan after discharge, and is eligible to receive assistance under the Title IV, HEA programs. 

(iv) A discharge of a loan under paragraph (e) of this section is reported by the loan holder to all credit reporting
agencies to which the holder previously reported the status of the loan, so as to delete all adverse credit history
assigned to the loan. 

(v) Discharge under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section qualifies the borrower for relief only with respect to the
amount of the disbursement discharged. 

(3) 

Borrower qualification for discharge. 

In order to qualify for discharge of a loan under paragraph (e) of this section the borrower shall submit to the holder
of the loan a written request and a sworn statement. The statement need not be notarized, but must be made by the borrower
under penalty of perjury, and, in the statement, the borrower shall_

(i) State whether the student has made a claim with respect to the school's false certification with any third party,
such as the holder of a performance bond or a tuition recovery program, and if so, the amount of any payment received
by the borrower (or student) or credited to the borrower's loan obligation;

investigation to the Secretary. 
(ii) If the guaranty agency receives information it believes to be reliable indicating that a borrower whose loan
is held by the agency may be eligible for a discharge under paragraph (e) of this section, the agency shall immediately
suspend any efforts to collect from the borrower on any loan received for the program of study for which the loan was
made (but may continue to receive borrower payments), and inform the borrower of the procedures for requesting a discharge.

the records of the agency and from other sources, including other guaranty agencies, state authorities, and cognizant

Lender Responsibilities.

 (i) If the lender is notified by a guaranty agency or the Secretary, or receives information it believes to be reliable
from another source indicating that a current or former borrower may be eligible for a discharge under paragraph (e)
of this section, the lender shall immediately suspend any efforts to collect from the borrower on any loan received
for the program of study for which the loan was made (but may continue to receive borrower payments) and, within 30 days
of receiving the information or notification, inform the borrower of the procedures for requesting a discharge.


(ii) If the borrower fails to submit the written request and sworn statement described in paragraph (e)(3) of this
section within 60 days of being notified of that option, the lender shall resume collection and shall be deemed to have
exercised forbearance of payment of principal and interest from the date the lender suspended collection activity.
The lender may capitalize, in accordance with  682.202(b), any interest accrued and not paid during that period.


(iii) The lender shall file a claim with the guaranty agency in accordance with  682.402(g) no later than 60 days
after the lender receives the borrower's written request and sworn statement described in paragraph (e)(3) of this
section. If a lender receives a payment made by or on behalf of the borrower on the loan after the lender files a claim
on the loan with the guaranty agency, the lender shall forward the payment to the guaranty agency within 30 days of its
receipt. The lender shall assist the guaranty agency and the borrower in determining whether the borrower is eligible
for discharge of the loan. 

(iv) The lender shall comply with all instructions received from the Secretary or a guaranty agency with respect to
loan discharges under paragraph (e) of this section. 

(v) The lender shall review a claim that the borrower did not endorse and did not receive the proceeds of a loan check.

that the borrower did not endorse the loan check, unless the lender secures persuasive evidence that the proceeds
of the loan were received by the borrower or the student for whom the loan was made, as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(ii).
If the lender determines that the loan check was properly endorsed or the proceeds were received by the borrower or
student, the lender may consider the borrower's objection to repayment as a statement of intention not to repay the
loan, and may file a claim with the guaranty agency for reimbursement on that ground, but shall not report the loan to
credit bureaus as in default until the guaranty agency, or, as applicable, the Secretary, reviews the claim for relief.
By filing such a claim, the lender shall be deemed to have agreed to the following_

(A) If the guarantor or the Secretary determines that the borrower endorsed the loan check or the proceeds of the loan
were received by the borrower or the student, any failure to satisfy due diligence requirements by the lender prior
to the filing of the claim that would have resulted in the loss of reinsurance on the loan in the event of default will
be waived by the Secretary; and 

(B) If the guarantor or the Secretary determines that the borrower did not endorse the loan check and that the proceeds
of the loan were not received by the borrower or the student, the lender will comply with the requirements specified
in paragraph (e)(8)(ii)(B) of this section. 

(vi) Within 30 days after being notified by the guaranty agency that the borrower's request for a discharge has been
denied, the lender shall notify the borrower of the reasons for the denial and, if payments are due, resume collection
against the borrower. The lender shall be deemed to have exercised forbearance of payment of principal and interest
from the date the lender suspended collection activity, and may capitalize, in accordance with  682.202(b),
any interest accrued and not paid during that period. 

(13) 

Requirements for admission on the basis of ability to benefit. 

(i) For periods of enrollment beginning between July 1, 1987 and June 30, 1991, a student who had a general education
