Proposal to reestablish the Advisory Committee on Universal Cotton Standards. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is proposing to reestablish the advisory committee to review official
Universal Standards for American Upland cotton prepared by USDA and make recommendations regarding the establishment

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (Pub. L. 92-463), notice is hereby given that the Secretary of

for U.S. Upland cotton prepared by USDA and make recommendations regarding the establishment or revision of the standards.



The Secretary has determined that the work of the committee is in the public interest and is in connection with the duties

Department on the task assigned, nor does the Department have an alternative means to obtain the technical and practical
expertise needed from private industry.
Equal opportunity practices, in line with USDA policies, will be followed in all appointments to the committee. To
ensure that the recommendations of the committee have taken into account the needs of the diverse groups served by
the Department, membership shall include, to the extent practicable, individuals with demonstrated ability to
represent minorities, women, and persons with disabilities.
Balanced committee membership would be attained domestically and internationally through the following committee
composition:


Representation by Domestic Industry


The U.S. cotton industry's committee membership will be comprised of 12 producers and ginners, 6 representatives
of merchandising firms, and 6 representatives of textile manufacturers. These representatives from the domestic
industry will be appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture.
Each member will have one vote. Accordingly, voting privileges will be divided as follows: (1) U.S. cotton producers
and ginners_12 votes; (2) U.S. merchandising firms_6 votes; (3) U.S. textile manufacturers_6 votes.


Representation by Foreign Signatory Associations


There will be 2 committee members from each of the foreign signatory associations. These committee members will be
designated by the respective associations. Voting privileges will be divided as follows: (1) Foreign signatory
merchant associations_6 votes; (2) Foreign signatory spinner associations_6 votes.

SUMMARY: 

On November 21, 1991, a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the A. M. Timber Sale,
was published in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 58679). The majority of the analysis area for this timber sale falls in an area identified as both a Key Watershed
and Late-Successional Reserve in the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement on Management of Habitat
for Late-Successional and Old-Growth Forest Related Species Within the Range of the Northern Spotted Owl. Because
of the restrictions on timber harvest activities in Late-Successional Reserves and on road construction in unroaded
portions of inventoried roadless areas in Key Watersheds, I have decided to terminate the environmental analysis
process. No draft or final environmental impact statement will be issued for the A. M. Timber Sale.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background



Recent debate has focused on whether United States patent policy is being effectively served by the current standard
of nonobviousness both as it is applied by the Patent and Trademark Office during patent examination and as it has been
interpreted by the Federal courts. Under 35 U.S.C. 103, a patent may not be obtained ``* * * if the differences
between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such the subject matter as a whole would have been
obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which subject matter pertains.''

In 

Graham

 v. 

John Deere & Co.

, 383 U.S. 1 (1966), the Supreme Court defined a three-part test to be followed to determine the nonobviousness of an
invention under 35 U.S.C. 103. Under this test, (1) the scope and content of the prior art are to be determined; (2) the
differences between the prior art and the claims at issue are to be ascertained; and (3) the level of ordinary skill
in the pertinent art is to be resolved. According to the Court, secondary considerations such as commercial success,
long felt but unsolved needs, failure of others, etc., might be utilized to give light to the circumstances surrounding
the origin of the subject matter sought to be patented. The Court noted that as indicia of obviousness or nonobviousness,
secondary considerations may have relevancy.

Some critics have charged that the 

Graham

 v. 

John Deere

 standard of nonobviousness has been changed by decisions of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. For example,
it is argued that secondary considerations have been given too much weight when determining the nonobviousness of
an invention to the extent that an invention with strong commercial success will be found not obvious despite appearing
so in light of prior art. Other critics charge that the scope of the prior art to be considered when evaluating the obviousness
of an invention has been improperly narrowed, precluding obviousness from being established by combining the teachings
of the prior art to produce the claimed invention absent some express teaching or suggestion supporting the combination.

The PTO has the burden of establishing a case of 

prima facie

 obviousness to support a prior art rejection under 35 U.S.C. 103. This burden can be met when the teachings from the
prior art suggest the claimed subject matter to a person of ordinary skill in the art. Once established, the applicant
must present evidence or arguments to rebut the Examiner's 

prime facie

 case. For example, an applicant may argue that there was no teaching or suggestion in the prior art to combine the references
in the manner suggested by the Examiner to render the claimed invention obvious. The applicant may also rebut the Examiner's
case of 

prima facie

 obviousness by demonstrating that the references cited by the Examiner teach away from the claimed invention. Some
critics argue that more guidance is needed to define when a 

prima facie

 case has been established and how it may be successfully rebutted.

It has also suggested that the standard of nonobviousness has been inappropriately lowered. Alleged effects of this
``lowered'' standard include a decrease in the perceived stature of patented inventions (e.g., patents are being
granted on inventions industry views as being trivial, simple or straightforward). Recent debate has also focused
on the propriety of the 

de novo

 standard of review applied by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and whether greater deference should be
given to the obviousness determinations of the PTO and the District Courts on appeal.

To resolve the issues presented, the PTO will conduct a public hearing to examine the issue of nonobviousness in the
context of whether or not the current standard of nonobivousness effectively promotes United States patent policy
and whether a more rigorous standard for awarding U.S. patents should be pursued.



II. Topics for Discussion



The hearing will address the following topics:




1. Justifications and rationale for and against the nonobviousness standard applied by the PTO and the Federal courts,
including:

(a) Is a more rigorous standard of nonobviousness needed? If so, how should the standard be defined?

(b) Should the current standard of nonobviousness be administered differently?

(c) Is the standard of nonobviousness applied differently among the different examining groups within the PTO?

(d) Should the standard of nonobivousness vary according to the field of technology involved?

(e) What role should secondary considerations, such as commercial success, unexpected results, etc., play when
determining the nonobviousness of the invention?

(f) Whether a 

prima facie

 case of obviousness based upon a combination of references should necessarily require ``motivation'' to combine
the teachings of the prior art disclosures? Why or why not? What other standard or standards for evaluating the propriety
of combining the teachings of references might be appropriate?

(g) Is the ``ordinary level of skill'' in the art being interpreted and applied correctly, and if not, what changes
are needed?

(h) Whether obviousness determinations should be subject to 

de novo

 review on appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit? If not, what standard of review should apply?

2. Desirable characteristics of specific guidelines regarding the burden of proof needed to rebut an Examiner's


prima facie

 case of obviousness.

(a) Is there a need for more specific guidelines to govern the burden of proof to be followed in determining the nonobviousness
of an invention? If so, what should they be?

3. Impact of a more rigorous standard of nonobviousness on promoting industrial and technological progress in the
United States and strengthening the national economy.

(a) Would a stricter standard of nonobviousness help or hinder industrial and technological progress in the United
States? If so, how?

(b) Is the current standard of nonobviousness applied by the PTO and interpreted by the Federal courts having a positive
or negative impact on industrial and technological progress in the United States?

(c) Are problems being experienced in particular areas of technology as a result of the standard of nonobviousness
applied by the PTO? If so, what are they?

(d) What would be the effect of a more rigorous standard of nonobviousness on the ability of industry to compete in the
international market?

Environmental Assessment (EA) and Finding of no Significant Impact (FNSI) For Draft Army Red-Cockaded Woodpecker
Management Guidelines



<AGENCY>

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of the Army has prepared an environmental assessment (EA) and made a finding of no significant impact
(FNSI) for draft Army-wide guidelines for the management of the red-cockaded woodpecker (RCW) on federally-owned
Army installations. The RCW is a federally listed endangered species found on Army installations in the southeastern
United States, extending from North Carolina to Louisiana. Currently, the RCW is found on Fort Bragg, North Carolina;
Fort Stewart, Georgia; Fort Jackson, South Carolina; Fort Benning, Georgia; Fort Polk, Louisiana; and Sunny Point
Military Ocean Terminal, North Carolina. The following Army installations do not currently have RCWs but have had
RCWs historically: Fort Gordon, Georgia; Fort McClellan, Alabama; and Louisiana Army Ammunition Point, Louisiana.
The guidelines will be used by Army installations that manage RCW habitat as baseline standards in preparing and revising
installation RCW management plans. The purpose of the guidelines is to ensure effective Army-wide RCW management
in compliance with the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA). The new guidelines will replace existing guidelines
approved in 1984.



As part of the guidelines development process, the Army has prepared an EA and made a FNSI in accordance with the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969. Additionally, the Army has prepared a biological assessment under the ESA
to assess the effects of the guidelines on endangered and threatened species. The Army announced commencement of
the guidelines development process in the 

Federal Register

 on February 16, 1993, and invited public participation (58 FR 8588). The EA addresses the comments received from the
public and scientific community during the process. The EA concludes that the guidelines will not have a significant
effect upon the environment. As a result, the Army has made a FNSI and proposes to approve Army RCW management guidelines,
subject to completion of consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in accordance with the ESA.

<DOCTITLE>Intent To Prepare a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the Proposed Providence River and Harbor Maintenance
Dredging Project</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England Division, DOD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

A draft and final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be prepared for the proposed maintenance dredging in
the Providence River and Harbor in Rhode Island and associated disposal of dredged material. Dredging is required
because shoaling in the channel has created unsafe conditions for navigation. The proposed project is intended to
restore the navigational efficiency and safety of the Providence River and Harbor for the deep draft vessels using
the area. The non-Federal sponsor of this project is the State of Rhode Island. Other Federal and non-Federal dredging
projects will also be considered in the EIS.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background



The Providence River is formed by the junction of two small streams, the Woonasquatucket and Moshassuck Rivers, which
rise in northern Rhode Island. The river flows southerly for one mile to the head of Providence Harbor at Fox Point in
Providence, where it is joined by the Seekonk River. The Corps project consists of a 16.8-mile-long channel beginning
near the head of Providence Harbor and following the river on a southerly course through the communities of East Providence,
Cranston Barrington, Warwick, Bristol, and Portsmouth. Providence River and Harbor together constitute the principal
commercial waterway in Rhode Island.


Initial work on the river and harbor began in the 19th century with the construction of a nine-foot-deep channel near
the head of the harbor. Subsequent improvements involved the construction of a 5.5 mile-long channel, 25 feet deep
and generally 600 feet wide, extending from Fox Point to Bullock Point in east Providence; and extending this channel
5.1 miles southward to North Point (Poppasquash Neck) in Bristol and deepening it to 35 feet through its entire length.

A modification to the project was completed in 1976. This involved extending the channel 6.2 miles southward to the
southeasterly side of Prudence Island, and deepening the entire channel to 40 feet. The channel is generally 600 feet
wide, except for the stretch between Fields Point (near the Providence-Cranston city line) and Fox Point, where it
has varying widths of up to 1700 feet.



Project Description



The proposed maintenance dredging project consists of removing about 3.5 million cubic yards of shoal material between
Fox Point in Providence and Conimicut Point in Warwick, Rhode Island to restore the Federal channel to its authorized
dimensions. An estimated 400,000 cubic yards of material will be removed by non-Federal interests from the berthing
areas served by the Federal channel.

Various public and private entities in Rhode Island have expressed an interest in meeting other dredging needs concurrently
with this project. Thus, the disposal site selected for the Providence River project may also be used for material
dredged from areas not directly abutting the Providence River channel. The best current estimate is that an additional
1.5 million cubic yards may be added to the Federal Providence River and Harbor portion of this project by these activities,
possibly including material from other Federal projects.



Scoping



The Corps will conduct an open scoping and public involvement process with scoping meetings in various locations
throughout the State. All interested Federal, State, and local agencies are invited to attend one or more scoping
meetings. Interested private and public organizations, affected Indian tribes, and individuals are encouraged
to attend the scoping meetings. These meetings will be scheduled for the Spring of 1994.

The alternatives analysis of dredged material disposal sites is expected to be a significant issue that will be addressed
in depth in the EIS. The physical, chemical, biological, and economic effects of disposal will be evaluated in the
EIS. Scoping will be used to identify any other issues not identified to date.



Other Environmental Review and Consultation Requirements



To the fullest extent possible, the EIS will be integrated with analyses and consultation required by the Endangered
Species Act of 1973, as amended (Pub. L. 93-205; 16 U.S.C. 1531, et seq.); the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966, as amended (Pub. L. 89-655; 16 U.S.C. 470, et seq.); the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958,
as amended (Pub. L. 85-624; 16 U.S.C. 661, et seq.) the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended (Pub. L.
92-583; 16 U.S.C. 1451, et seq.); and the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, as amended
(Pub. L. 92-532; 16 U.S.C. 1431, et seq.).



Schedule



The DEIS is anticipated to be available for public review in late Summer of 1994.

Intent To Prepare An Environmental Impact Statement and Floodplain and Wetlands Involvement for the Nez Perce Tribal
Hatchery Project 




AGENCIES:

 Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), Department of Energy (DOE) and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Department
of Interior (DOI). 




<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) under section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321) and Notice of Floodplain and Wetlands Involvement. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 BPA and BIA intend to prepare an EIS on the proposed Nez Perce Tribal Hatchery (NPTH) Project to try and rebuild naturally
reproducing salmon runs in the watersheds of the Clearwater and Salmon River sub-basins. BPA and BIA intend to decide
whether or not to provide funding to construct, operate, and maintain the NPTH in these sub-basins. BIA, as trustee
for Tribal trust resources, will participate as co-lead agency with BPA. The Nez Perce Tribe (NPT) is the primary cooperating
agency. The EIS will evaluate the potential environmental effects of the proposed action to construct and operate
the NPTH and alternatives to the proposed action. This action may involve floodplains and wetlands located in the
State of Idaho and within Nez Perce, Clearwater, and Idaho counties. 




In accordance with DOE regulations for compliance with floodplain and wetlands environmental review requirements
(10 CFR part 1022), BPA and BIA will prepare a floodplains and wetlands assessment and would perform this proposed
action in a manner so as to avoid or minimize potential harm to or within the affected floodplains and wetlands. The
assessment and a floodplain statement of findings will be included in the EIS being prepared for the proposed project
in accordance with NEPA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The proposed Project that is the subject of the EIS consists of several components, including central and auxiliary
salmon incubation and rearing facilities, satellite rearing facilities, and monitoring and evaluation facilities
located in the Clearwater and Salmon River Basins in central Idaho. The proposed NPTH would be consistent with the
Northwest Power Planning Council's (Council) Fish and Wildlife Program Measure 703 (g)(2), calling for construction
of low-capital salmon and steelhead propagation facilities adaptable to Columbia River Basin locales. The Council
envisioned that the NPTH Production Project would help rebuild or re-establish anadromous salmon runs in the Clearwater
and Salmon River sub-basins. The Nez Perce Tribal Government envisioned the NPTH production project as a way of helping
to rebuild a fishery resource that is important to the Tribal culture and allowing rights reserved in the 1855 Treaty
with the United States to be exercised. Further, this action would provide an opportunity for the Federal government
to fulfill its trust responsibility to the NPT. BPA proposes this Project as a means to protect, mitigate, and enhance
Columbia River Basin fish and wildlife resources under the authority of the Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning
and Conservation Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-501). If developed, the NPTH will employ state-of-the-art, technologically
advanced salmon supplementation techniques in an attempt to rebuild naturally reproducing salmon runs in the watersheds
of the Clearwater and Salmon River sub-basins. As requested by the Council, BPA and NPT completed a master plan for
the proposed Project. The Council approved the NPTH Master Plan, requesting final design and construction of the
NPTH, on May 27, 1992. 



A. Proposed Action 




The following need statement has been identified for the NPTH EIS: 


The need is for naturally reproducing salmon at harvestable populations in the upriver Clearwater and Salmon River
sub-basins. 


The established purpose(s) for the proposed NPTH project are manyfold: 


1. Protect, mitigate, and enhance Columbia River Basin anadromous fish resources. 


2. Develop, increase, and reintroduce natural spawning populations of salmon within the Clearwater and Salmon River
sub-basins. 


3. Provide long-term harvest opportunities for Tribal and non-Tribal anglers within Nez Perce Treaty lands. 


4. Sustain long-term fitness and genetic integrity of target fish populations. 


5. Keep ecological and genetic impacts to nontarget fish populations within acceptable limits. 


6. Provide harvest opportunities for Tribal and non-Tribal anglers within four salmon generations (20 years) following
completion of the Project. 


7. Promote NPT management of NPTH production facilities and production areas. 


To meet the underlying need and purpose statements, the proposed action is for BPA and BIA to fund: (1) Construction,
(2) operation and maintenance, and (3) monitoring and evaluation of a NPTH supplementation project within the Clearwater
and Salmon River sub-basins. The NPTH supplementation facilities would consist of a central incubation and rearing
facility on the Clearwater River at Cherry Lane, Idaho; an auxiliary salmon incubation and rearing facility on Sweetwater
Creek near Lewiston, Idaho; 13 satellite juvenile rearing and adult holding facilities located in various tributary
watersheds; and monitoring facilities for juvenile and adult salmon in each watershed where satellites are proposed.
Species targeted for supplementation are spring, summer, and fall chinook salmon (

Oncorhynchus tshawytscha

). 


The central facility would incubate eggs and alevins and rear fry to approximately 50-80 millimeters (2-3
inches) in size to prepare them for final rearing and release at the satellite facilities or in natural stream systems.
The Sweetwater Creek holding facility would be constructed to backup the central facility and rear subyearling or
yearling smolts and, when needed, to hold adult broodstock. 


Satellite facilities used for rearing, acclimation, release, adult holding, monitoring, and evaluation would
also be constructed. They would be located in key tributary watersheds of the Clearwater and Salmon River sub-basins.
Facility locations in the Clearwater sub-basin would be: Lolo Creek (Mainstem Lolo Creek, Yoosa Creek, and Eldorado
Creek); South Fork Clearwater River (Meadow Creek, Mill Creek, Newsome Creek); and the Selway River (Meadow Creek).
Facility locations in the Salmon River sub-basin would be: Slate Creek (Mainstem Slate Creek and Little Slate Creek).



Floodplains and wetlands may be involved at the following central and satellite facility sites:

B. Process to Date 


BPA and BIA have assumed the co-lead agency role for the NPTH EIS. The NPT Department of Fisheries Resource Management
will act as the primary Cooperating Agency. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and U.S. Forest Service (USFS),
Nez Perce National Forest, will also participate as Cooperating Agencies in the NEPA process. 
The Council's Master Plan process involved close coordination among the NPT, BPA, Idaho Department of Fish and Game,
USFWS, and USFS. Several meetings were held by these parties to focus on technical issues that needed resolution and
clarification so that preparation of the Master Plan could proceed. Other meetings between the NPT and the State involved
discussions of harvest and production issues. Discussions in January 1992, led to a Memorandum of Agreement between
the parties on a process for discussing management issues and developing common positions to present in different
forums. The NPT has also met numerous times with field staffs of the USFS and others to review technical elements of
the Master Plan as it developed. Of particular interest to the land managers is the location of the proposed tributary
facilities and constraints that might be needed on current management practices. 


C. Alternatives Proposed for Consideration 


Alternatives thus far identified for evaluation in the EIS are: (1) the proposed action to construct, operate, and
maintain the NPTH Project; and (2) no action (to not undertake action to develop the NPTH Project). Intermediate alternatives
that will feature scaled-down versions of the total project will also be evaluated. Other alternatives will be identified
through the scoping process and will be considered, if appropriate, in the EIS. Those reasonable alternatives that
meet both the stated need and purposes for action will be evaluated in greatest detail. 


D. Identification of Environmental Issues 


BPA and BIA will prepare a DEIS that addresses and fully discloses the potential environmental effects of the proposed
facility and associated operations as well as reasonable alternatives to the proposed action. The principal environmental
issues identified through the Council's Master Plan scoping process for the NPTH include the following: (1) Assessment
of genetic and ecological risks; (2) direct and cumulative effects of hatchery fish on wild fish, particularly Snake
River salmon stocks currently listed as threatened or endangered under the Federal Endangered Species Act; (3) effectiveness
of supplementation as a fishery management tool to rebuild weak stocks; (4) effects on non-target resident fish species;
(5) water quality effects; (6) effects on cultural resources; and (7) monitoring and evaluation concerns. These,
together with any additional issues identified through the scoping process, will be examined in the NPTH EIS.

Wallkill Transport, L.P.; Availability of The 
Environmental Assessment For The Proposed Wallkill Pipeline Project 



April 22, 1994.



The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) has prepared an Environmental Assessment
(EA) on the natural gas pipeline facilities proposed by Wallkill Transport Company, L.P. (Wallkill) in Docket No.
CP93-548-000. 

The EA was prepared to satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. The staff concludes that
approval of the proposed project, with appropriate mitigating measures, would not constitute a major Federal action
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. However, we are requesting specific comments on one
route variation discussed below. 

The EA assesses the potential environmental effects of the construction and operation of the proposed Wallkill Pipeline
Project, including: 

 23.9 miles of new 10-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline; 
 A 6-inch meter run; 
 A 6-inch orifice meter; and 
 Eight pipeline valve assemblies. 

The purpose of the proposed facilities would be to transport up to 30 million cubic feet of natural gas per day from an
existing Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee) pipeline to the planned Wallkill Generating Facility. The
EA also evaluates alternatives to Wallkill's proposal. 

The staff specifically requests comments on the proposed route in the area of Bates Gates Road, near MP 18, versus the

I-84 Variation. The discussion of the variation begins on 
page 39 of the EA. As further discussed in the EA, each of these routes offers advantages and disadvantages which deserve
comment. 

The EA has been placed in the public files of the FERC and is available for public inspection at: Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, 
Division of Public Information, 
941 North Capitol Street, NE., room 3104, 
Washington, DC 20426, 
(202) 208-1371. 

Copies have been mailed to Federal, state and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, newspapers,
and parties to this proceeding. 

A limited number of copies of the EA are available from: 
Ms. Laura Turner, Environmental Project Manager, 
Environmental Review and Compliance Branch II, 
Office of Pipeline Regulation, Room 7312, 
825 North Capitol Street, N.E., 
Washington, DC 20426, 
(202) 208-0916. 

Any person wishing to comment on the EA may do so. Written comments must reference Docket No. CP93-548-000,
and be addressed to: Office of the Secretary, 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
825 North Capitol Street, N.E., 
Washington, D.C. 20426. 
Comments should be filed as soon as possible, but must be received no later than May 16, 1994, to ensure consideration
prior to a Commission decision on this proposal. A copy of any comments should also be sent to Ms. Laura Turner, Environmental
Project Manager. 

Comments will be considered by the Commission but will not serve to make the commentor a party to the proceeding. Any
person seeking to become a party to the proceeding must file a Motion to Intervene according to Rule 214 of the Commission's

<DOCTITLE>Lead Renovation and Remodeling Guidelines; Notice of Availability </DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Availability. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the availability of EPA's final renovation and remodeling (R&R) guidelines document
entitled ``Reducing Lead Hazards When Remodeling Your Home.'' This document was developed pursuant to Title IV,
section 402 (c)(1) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Section 402 (c)(1) specifically mandates that EPA
develop guidelines for homeowners and other persons who may engage in renovation and remodeling activities. EPA
developed the R&R guidelines in response to Congressional concerns about the public's knowledge of lead hazards
when conducting R&R activities in homes. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under the Congressional mandate in section 402(c)(1) of TSCA, EPA has developed guidance for homeowners and building
occupants to alert them to potential lead hazards associated with renovation and remodeling activities. Congress
specifically required that these guidelines be developed for homes and buildings constructed prior to 1978.



On March 18, 1994 (59 FR 12913) EPA announced the availability of the draft R&R Guidelines in the 

Federal Register

. In the announcement, EPA opened a 30-day public comment period and received comments on the R&R Guidelines
document. In addition to soliciting public comment, EPA conducted a series of focus group tests on the draft R&R
guidelines document to evaluate the effectiveness of the reading level, content, and graphic presentation. A summary
of the focus group's test results, copies of the public comments received and EPA's disposition on the comments, may
be viewed in the TSCA Nonconfidential Business Information Center, NE Mall Room B607, Office of Pollution Prevention
and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20460, Telephone 202-260-1595.
When requesting to view the comments, refer to TSCA Docket Number OPPTS-62138.

EPA recognizes that this lead hazard information may be important in some communities that may have a limited ability
to utilize information provided in English. For that reason, EPA is developing a Spanish-language version of the
Guidelines document as well. The Spanish-language R&R guidelines document will be available at a later date.

EPA plans to disseminate the guidelines as mandated under TSCA to State and local government agencies, paint and hardware
stores, employee organizations and trade associations. Individual copies of the final R&R guidelines (in English
only) is now available from the National Lead Information Center Clearinghouse (1-800-424-LEAD).

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is requesting nominations to fill three vacancies on the
Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines (ACCV). The Commission was established by title XXI of the Public Health
Service Act, as enacted by Public Law 99-660 and as subsequently amended, and advises the Secretary, HHS, on
issues related to implementation of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under the authorities that established the Advisory Commission, viz., the Federal Advisory Committee Act of October
6, 1972 (Pub. L. 92-463) and section 2119 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 300aa-19, as added
by Public Law 99-660 and amended, HRSA is requesting nominations for three voting members of the Commission.



The Commission advises the Secretary on the implementation of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program;
on its own initiative or as the result of the filing of a petition, recommends changes in the Vaccine Injury Table; advises
the Secretary in implementing the Secretary's responsibilities under section 2127 regarding the need for childhood
vaccination products that result in fewer or no significant adverse reactions; surveys Federal, State, and local
programs and activities relating to the gathering of information on injuries associated with the administration
of childhood vaccines, including the adverse reaction reporting requirements of section 2125(b), and advises the
Secretary on means to obtain, compile, publish, and use credible data related to the frequency and severity of adverse
reactions associated with childhood vaccines; and recommends to the Director, National Vaccine Program, Office
of the Assistant Secretary for Health, research related to vaccine injuries which should be conducted to carry out
the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.

The Commission consists of nine members appointed by the Secretary as follows: Three health professionals, of whom
two are pediatricians, who are not employees of the United States, and who have expertise in the health care of children,
the epidemiology, etiology, and prevention of childhood diseases, and the adverse reactions associated with vaccines;
three members from the general public, of whom two are legal representatives of children who have suffered a vaccine-related
injury or death; and three attorneys, of whom at least one shall be an attorney whose specialty includes representation
of persons who have suffered a vaccine-related injury or death and one shall be an attorney whose specialty includes
representation of vaccine manufacturers. In addition, the Director of the National Institutes of Health, the Assistant
Secretary for Health, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Commissioner of Food
and Drugs (or the designees of such officials), serve as non-voting ex officio members.

Specifically, HRSA is requesting nominations for three voting members of the Commission representing: (1) A health
professional with special experience in childhood diseases; (2) an attorney whose specialty includes representation
of vaccine manufacturers; and (3) a member of the general public. The third category requires a total of three members
of the general public, of whom at least two are legal representatives (parent or legal guardian) of children who have
suffered a vaccine-related injury or death_by this notice, the Department is soliciting nominations for the third
general public position. Nominees will be invited to serve 3-year terms beginning January 1, 1995, and ending December
31, 1997.

Interested persons may nominate one or more qualified persons for membership on the Advisory Commission. Nominations
shall state that the nominee is willing to serve as a member of the Commission and appears to have no conflict of interest
that would preclude Commission membership. Potential candidates will be asked to provide detailed information
concerning such matters as financial holdings, consultancies, and research grants or contracts to permit evaluation
of possible sources of conflict of interest. A curriculum vitae should be submitted with the nomination.

The Department has special interest in assuring that women, minority groups, and the physically handicapped are
adequately represented on advisory bodies and therefore extends particular encouragement to nominations for appropriately
qualified female, minority, or physically handicapped candidates.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, HUD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice identifies unutilized, underutilized, excess, and surplus Federal property reviewed by HUD for suitability
for possible use to assist the homeless.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991) and section 501 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42
U.S.C. 11411), as amended, HUD is publishing this Notice to identify Federal buildings and other real property that
HUD has reviewed for suitability for use to assist the homeless. The properties were reviewed using information provided
to HUD by Federal landholding agencies regarding unutilized and underutilized buildings and real property controlled
by such agencies or by GSA regarding its inventory of excess or surplus Federal property. This notice is also published
in order to comply with the December 12, 1988 Court Order in 

National Coalition for the Homeless 

v. Veterans Administration, No. 88-2503-OG (D.D.C.).



Properties reviewed are listed in this Notice according to the following categories: Suitable/available, suitable/unavailable,
suitable/to be excess, and unsuitable. The properties listed in the three suitable categories have been reviewed
by the landholding agencies, and each agency has transmitted to HUD: 


(1) Its intention to make the property available for use to assist the homeless;

(2) Its intention to declare the property excess to the agency's needs; or




(3) A statement of the reasons that the property cannot be declared excess or made available for use as facilities to
assist the homeless.


Properties listed as suitable/available will be available exclusively for homeless use for a period of 30 days from
the date of this Notice. Homeless assistance providers interested in any such property should send a written expression
of interest to HHS, addressed to Judy Britman, Division of Health Facilities Planning, U.S. Public Health Service,
HHS, room 17A-10, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857; (301) 443-2265. (This is not a toll-free number.)
HHS will mail to the interested provider an application packet, which will include instructions for completing the
application. In order to maximize the opportunity to utilize a suitable property, providers should submit their
written expressions of interest as soon as possible. For complete details concerning the processing of applications,
the reader is encouraged to refer to the interim rule governing this program 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991).


For properties listed as suitable/to be excess, that property may, if subsequently accepted as excess by GSA, be made
available for use by the homeless in accordance with applicable law, subject to screening for other Federal use. At
the appropriate time, HUD will publish the property in a notice showing it as either suitable/available, or suitable/unavailable.


For properties listed as suitable/unavailable, the landholding agency has decided that the property cannot be declared
excess or made available for use to assist the homeless, and the property will not be available.



Properties listed as unsuitable will not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days from the date of this Notice.
Homeless assistance providers interested in a review by HUD of the determination of unsuitability should call the
toll free information line at 1-800-927-7588 for detailed instructions or write a letter to Barbara
Richards at the address listed at the beginning of this Notice. Included in the request for review should be the property
address (including zip code), the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

, the landholding agency, and the property number.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, proposes that the existing land withdrawal made by
Public Land Order No. 3839, be continued for a period of 20 years pursuant to section 204 of the Federal Land Policy and

by the Secretary of the Interior, the President, and the Congress, who will determine whether or not the withdrawal
will be continued, and if so, for how long.

The final determination on the continuation of the withdrawal will 
be published in the 

Federal Register.

<DOCTITLE>Norfolk & Western Railway Co.; Trackage Rights Exemption; Canadian National Railway Co., CNCP Niagara-Detroit
</DOCTITLE>



Canadian National Railway Company (CNRC) and CNCP Niagara-Detroit

1

 have agreed to expand their existing trackage rights agreement.

2

 Under their supplemental agreement, the trackage rights will allow all overhead traffic now being routed over a joint
NW-CP rail car ferry facility operation adjacent to the said Detroit River Tunnel to be relocated (rerouted)
through said tunnel, thereby increasing the efficiency of U.S.-Canadian rail movements of NW's and CP's traffic
by decreasing the time necessary to move cars across the U.S-Canadian border at Detroit. The expanded trackage rights
are to become effective on May 1, 1994. 





This notice is filed under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(7). If the notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption
is void 

ab initio

. Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke
will not stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: James L. Howe, III, Norfolk
and Western Railway Company, Three Commercial Place, Norfolk, VA 23510-2191. 


As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees adversely affected by the trackage rights will be protected
pursuant to 

Norfolk and Western Ry. Co._Trackage Rights_BN

, 354 I.C.C. 605 (1978), as modified in 

Mendocino Coast Ry., Inc._Lease and Operate

, 360 I.C.C. 653 (1980).

agent of all railroads subscribing to the car-service and car-hire agreement, and on the American Short Line Railroad
Association.

A.C.A. Lumber Co., Beaver, WA; Negative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration


By an application dated March 18, 1994, the company requested administrative reconsideration of the subject petition
for trade adjustment assistance (TAA). The denial notice was signed on March 18, 1994 and published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14876).
Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:
(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;
(2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or
(3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.
The company stated that they could not compete with imported Canadian lumber.
The Department's denial was based on the fact that the ``contributed importantly'' test of the Group Eligibility
Requirements of the Trade Act was not met. The Department's survey showed that when the mill was in full operation (prior
to May 1993), the respondents either did not import or did not increase their imports.
Between May, 1993 and December, 1993 A.C.A. Lumber produced cut lumber on a subcontracting basis. The Department's
survey showed that A.C.A.'s only customer in this period ceased doing business with A.C.A. and placed its cut lumber
orders with foreign producers. The findings also show that the customer sells the lumber produced abroad to customers
in foreign countries and does not import any lumber into the United States.
The worker adjustment assistance program was not intended to provide TAA to workers who are in some way related to import
competition but only for those workers who produce an article and are adversely affected by increased imports of like
or directly competitive articles which contributed importantly to sales or production and employment declines
at the workers' firm.


Conclusion


After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.

at Various Other Locations; Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance



In accordance with section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance applicable to all workers of Halliburton Geophysical Services,
Inc., headquartered in Houston, Texas and operating at various other locations. The notice was issued on October
23, 1992 and published in the

 on November 17, 1992 (57 FR 54256).

At the request of the State Agency, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. New
findings from the company show that on July 1, 1993, Halliburton Energy Services became the successor-in-interest
firm to Halliburton Geophysical Services.

Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification to show the correct name of the worker group.

The amended notice applicable to TA-W-27,776 is hereby issued as follows:




All workers Halliburton Geophysical Services, Inc., a/k/a Halliburton Energy Services, headquartered in Houston,
Texas and operating at various other locations in the below cited states who became totally or partially separated
from employment on or after August 17, 1991 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the

<DOCTITLE>Simmons Upholstered Furniture, Inc., Vancouver, WA; Negative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>



By an application dated March 22, 1994, the workers requested administrative reconsideration of the subject petition
for trade adjustment assistance (TAA). The certification notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 18, 1994 (59 FR 12984).

Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:

(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;

(2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or

(3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.


The investigation files show that the workers produced upholstered furniture; however, only the workers involved
in sewing and cushion filling activities met the worker group eligibility requirements necessary for certification.

Its stated that workers engaged in framing, cutting and upholstering were impacted by foreign imports as much as those
included in the certification_workers in sewing and cushion filling activities.

Other investigation findings show that all the cutting and upholstery operations were transferred to another domestic
plant and that the framing and distribution activities would remain at Vancouver. A domestic shift of production
would not form a basis for a worker group certification.



Conclusion



After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.

<DOCTITLE>Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions</DOCTITLE>



General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.

The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR part 1, appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.

Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.

General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedes decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 

Federal Register

, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.

Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., room S-3014, Washington, DC 20210.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Debarment, Commonwealth Aluminum Corporation.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice advises of the debarment of Commonwealth Aluminum Corporation (hereafter ``Commonwealth Aluminum''),
as an eligible bidder on Government contracts and subcontracts or other modifications of any existing Government
contracts or subcontracts. The debarment is effective immediately.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On February 10, 1994, pursuant to 41 CFR 60-741.29(b)(3), the Acting Assistant Secretary for Employment Standards
(``Assistant Secretary'') issued a Final Decision and Order: (1) Finding Commonwealth Aluminum in violation of
Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 793), and its implementing regulations; and (2)
debarring Commonwealth Aluminum, its officers, subsidiaries, and successors, as eligible bidders on Government
contracts and subcontracts or other modifications of existing Government contracts or subcontracts, if the company
fails to comply with any provision of the Order within the specified time periods. The Final Decision and Order required
Commonwealth to give the complainants, who are identified therein, offers of employment and award them appropriate
seniority and all other applicable benefits in accordance with the Final Decision and Order within 60 days of receipt
of the Order. It is now in excess of 60 days from the date Commonwealth received a certified copy of the Final Decision
and Order. None of the complainants identified in the Final Decision and Order have received offers of employment,
appropriate awards of seniority and all other applicable benefits. Therefore, it is necessary to commence the debarment
process. This debarment will remain in effect until Commonwealth Aluminum satisfies the Assistant Secretary that
it is in compliance with Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act and the regulations and orders issued thereunder which
have been found to have been violated. A copy of the Final Decision and Order is attached.

Date: February 10, 1994
Case No. 82-OFC-6




In the matter of: Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, United States Department of Labor, Plaintiff,
v. Commonwealth Aluminum, Formerly Martin-Marietta Aluminum of Kentucky, Inc., Defendant.

Before: The Acting Assistant Secretary for Employment Standards.



Final Decision and Order



This case arises under Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 793 (1988), and its implementing
regulations at 41 CFR part 60-741 (1992). The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) filed
exceptions to several aspects of the Administrative Law Judge's (ALJ) Recommended Decision and Order (R.D. and O.)
which concluded that the complaint filed by OFCCP should be dismissed in its entirety.



Background



On September 7, 1982, OFCCP filed a complaint alleging that Commonwealth Aluminum
 failed to employ or advance in employment eight qualified handicapped individuals. Administrative Exhibit (A)
1. At the hearing, the complaint relating to William J. Shelton was dismissed for ``failure of proof.'' R.D. and O.
at 2.





Commonwealth owns and operates an aluminum processing facility near Lewisport, Kentucky. All applicants for employment
are required to have a pre-employment physical examination, which includes back x-rays. 

Id.

 at 3. If the x-rays reveal evidence of spondylolisthesis, severe scoliosis, discogenic disease or severe arthritis,
the applicant is subject to rejection. Plaintiff's Exhibit (P)-26. If the physical examination discloses
conditions which are surgically correctable, it is Commonwealth's policy to suspend the individual's employment
application pending treatment. R.D. and O. at 3. See P-3, 5.

Job applicants Gregory Gray and David Worthington filed complaints with OFCCP alleging that Commonwealth did not
employ them because they were handicapped. P-37, 38. OFCCP investigators examined Commonwealth's hiring
policies and asked if there were other job applicants who were rejected during the same general time period for failure
to pass the pre-employment physical examination. Commonwealth provided a list which included Robert Etnire, Thomas
Marshall, Wilda Matthis, William Shelton, Kenneth Sherrard, and William Zellers. R.D. and O. at 3.

Commonwealth suspended Gray's application pending surgical correction of a hearing loss. P-3, 5. Complainant
Worthington was blind in the left eye, had sixty percent hearing loss in the left ear and an eighteen percent permanent
back disability. P-7. Commonwealth rejected his application
 because he was too much of a safety risk in view of his multiple impairments. Transcript (T.) 296, 918. The applications
of Matthis and Sherrard were rejected because of scoliosis. P-3; T. at 539. Commonwealth rejected Etnire's
application
 because of degenerative changes in the lumbar spine, P-18, and Zeller's application because of spondylolisthesis.
T. 637. Marshall's application was suspended until he had a hernia surgically corrected. T. 613, 814.






The ALJ concluded that OFCCP could not seek individual relief on behalf of Complainants Etnire, Marshall, Matthis,
Sherrard and Zellers because none of them filed a complaint. R.D. and O. at 5-11. Assuming that OFCCP had met its
burden of establishing that Complainant Worthington was a handicapped individual, the ALJ noted that he had accepted
employment with Commonwealth following his initial rejection and thereafter voluntarily terminated his employment.
The ALJ concluded that an order to reemploy Worthington would be inappropriate and there was, therefore, no need to
consider if Worthington would be entitled to retroactive seniority. Since OFCCP was not seeking back pay for Worthington,
the ALJ decided that OFCCP had failed to state a claim upon which individual relief could be granted in his behalf. 

Id.

 at 12.

<TEXT>
 

As to Complainant Gray, who had a hearing loss, the ALJ found that he was not substantially limited in his employment
opportunities because Commonwealth suspended only one opportunity. Moreover, the ALJ concluded that Congress
did not intend to include correctable impairments, such as Gray's hearing loss, in the definition of ``handicapped
individual.'' Finally, the ALJ found Commonwealth did not regard Gray as handicapped in that it would have reconsidered
him for employment if he had his hearing loss surgically corrected. The ALJ concluded that OFCCP had failed to prove
that Gray was handicapped and therefore could not seek individual relief in his behalf. 

Id.

 at 12-15.

In addition to individual relief, the ALJ noted that OFCCP sought a cease and desist order and debarment of Commonwealth
for violation of its affirmative action duties. He stated that the merits of the contentions relating to five Complainants
who did not file complaints could be considered as evidence of a failure to establish an effective affirmative action
program. Because Complainant Marshall's hernia was correctable, the ALJ found that he was not handicapped and there
was no duty of affirmative action owned to him. Concerning Complainants Matthis, Sherrard and Zellers, the ALJ noted
that they had back impairments and, given the contraindications for heavy manual labor positions for these individuals,
they are not qualified for the jobs for which they applied. As to Complainant Etnire, who was rejected in 1980 because
his x-ray showed a back condition and hired in 1981 after passing a subsequent physical examination, the ALJ stated
that at best the evidence shows a mistaken, but apparently good faith belief that he was not qualified for employment
in 1980. 

Id.

 at 15-17.

Based on the record as a whole, the ALJ found that the evidence was insufficient to establish a violation of Commonwealth's
affirmative action duties. In view of the foregoing, he recommended that OFCCP's complaint be dismissed in its entirety.


Id.,

 at 17.



Discussion



I. Conciliation Efforts



Although the ALJ did not reach this issue because he recommended dismissal of other grounds, R.D. and O. at n.2, Commonwealth
argues that, if the issue is considered, the complaint should be dismissed for OFCCP's failure to conciliate. Commonwealth's
Response to OFCCP's Exceptions (Com. Resp.) at 19. While conceding that there were several conferences and negotiations,
Commonwealth alleges that of OFCCP generally failed to communicate any offers of settlement to any of the complainants
as required by its own Federal Contract Compliance Manual. Com. Resp. at 20-21. The pertinent section at the
time of this action provided the ``[g]enerally, the complainant should not be present during the conciliation sessions.
However, the EOS [Equal Oppportunity Specialist] should keep the complainant informed of the progress, in order
to gather further input and to discuss proposed settlements.'' Ch. 6-120.5.

Commonwealth contends that this section places OFCCP in a position similar to that of a lawyer who represents his client.
Com. Resp. at 21. The first part of the quoted language, however, belies that assertion as it provides the complainant
shall not be present, a clear indication that the complainant is a not a party to the action and need not be consulted
on settlement matters in the same manner as a client. Rather, the Manual provision is more properly viewed as providing
guidance to EOS concerning how to facilitate the conciliation process. As such it confers no rights upon parties to
an action under the Act. 

Cf. OFCCP 

v. 

National City Bank of Cleveland.

 30 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. [BNA] 6, 9 (Sec'y Final Dec. and Order Sept. 9, 1982) (OFCCP vindicates government interest
in terms of contract but does not represent individual complainants or class members). In any event, there is no basis
for concluding that the Compliance Manual confers rights upon a Section 503 defendant which could be raised as defense
to a Section 503 complaint.

Commonwealth also alleges that it was never advised that the conciliation process had reached an impasse except with
respect to Complainant Gray and further that OFCCP never explained how the rejection for employment of Complainants
Etnire, Marshall, Matthis, Sherrard and Zellers violated Section 503. 

Id.

 at 23-26. Although, as Commonwealth argues, the letter notifying Commonwealth that the complaint was being
forwarded for enforcement refers only to Complainant Gray, Defendant's Exhibit (D)-3, Commonwealth was aware
that OFCCP was seeking relief from the other similarly situated individuals in conjunction with Gray's complaint.
In its response to the Gray complaint, Commonwealth questioned the connection between the Gray case and the other
cases, but nevertheless offered employment opportunities to the other individuals as part of a settlement. 

See

 D-5. There is no evidence that a settlement had been reached as to them. Accordingly, it should have known that
the enforcement action would include individuals as well as Gray. As for the alleged failure to explain the violations
relative to the other individuals, Commonwealth could have inquiried about the nature of the violations during the
conciliation process. For all of the foregoing reasons, I conclude that OFCCP properly discharged its duty to conciliate
under 41 CFR 60-741.26(g)(2).

II. Jurisdiction to Consider Alleged Discrimination Against Individuals Who Did Not File a Complaint



OFCCP, while arguing that it may seek individual relief even if no complaint has been filed, see OFCCP's Exceptions
at 6-15, contends in the alternative that it may seek relief, during a complaint investigation, on behalf of
individuals who did not file a complaint. 

Id.

 at 15-20. While both Section 503(b) of the Act and the implementing regulation, 41 CFR 60-741.26, provide
that an individual may file a complaint alleging handicap discrimination, neither the Assistant Secretary for Employment
Standards nor the courts has addressed whether a complaint must be filed for each individual for whom OFCCP seeks relief.

Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.  2000e-5 (1988), which requires that a charge by filed
before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission can take enforcement action, it has been held that the purpose
of the charge is to trigger the investigatory and conciliatory procedures of the EEOC. 

EEOC 

v. 

General Electric Co.,

 532 F.2d 359, 364 (4th Cir. 1976) (charge provides EEOC with jurisdictional springboard to investigate and investigation
may disclose other illegal practices which provide basis for reasonable cause determination). In this setting it
is nonsensical to require each of the plaintiffs to file individual administrative charges with EEOC, even though
no class action has been filed. 

Allen 

v. 

Amalgamated Transit Union Local 788,

 554 F.2d 876, 882-83 (8th Cir.), 

cert. denied,

 434 U.S. 891 (1977). Similarly, under the National Labor Relations Act, the purpose of a charge is to set a Board inquiry
in motion, and acts not specifically mentioned in the charge may be investigated and subject to enforcement if they
are sufficiently related to the specific acts alleged. See 

N.L.R.B. 

v. 

Central Power & Light Co.,

 425 F.2d 1318, 1320 (5th Cir. 1970). 

Cf. United States Dept. of Labor

 v. 

Honeywell, Inc.,

 77-OFCCP-3, Sec'y Dec. and Order June 2, 1993, slip op. at 16 (complaint may include discrimination like
or reasonably related to original charges).

The Rehabilitation Act and regulations promulgated under it are to be interpreted broadly. 

Gilbert 

v. 

Frank, 

949 F.2d 637, 641 (2d Cir. 1991). In view of the foregoing, I conclude that, similar to Title VII and the National Labor
Relations Act, once a complaint is filed, OFCCP may seek relief on behalf of individuals found to have been subject
to handicap discrimination even if they have not filed a complaint.





III. Individual Discrimination Claims


In an individual discrimination case under Section 503, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing a prima facie
case by showing that the complainant was a handicapped individual who was qualified for the job, applied for the job,
and was rejected. 

Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs 

v. 

United Parcel Service, Inc., 

Case No. 87-OFC-17, Dep. Ass't. Sec. Dec., Nov. 22, 1991, slip op. at 8. Actual ability to perform the job
is the only test for determining if an individual is qualified. 

The Department of Labor, OFCCP 

v. 

Texas Industries, Inc., 

Case No. 80-OFCCP-28, Ass't Sec. Dec., June 7, 1988, slip op. at 14. In determining if a handicapped individual
is qualified to do a job the employer must gather all relevant information regarding work history and medical history.


Mantolete 

v. 

Bolger, 

767 F.2d 1416, 1423 (9th Cir. 1985);
 

Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs 

v. 

Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, 

Case No. 84-OFC-8, Acting Ass't Sec. Dec., Mar. 30, 1989, slip op. at 24 (WMATA).




While risk of injury may, in some cases, justify the refusal to hire an otherwise qualified handicapped person, mere
elevated risk of injury, without more, is not sufficient.
 

Mantolete, 

767 F.2d at 1422; 

WMATA, 

slip. op. at 23. The issue is whether hiring the complainant posed a reasonable probability of substantial harm. 

Mantolete, 

767 F.2d at 1422; 

WMATA, 

slip op. at 23. Further, where a contractor applies physical or mental job qualification requirements which tend
to screen out qualified handicapped individuals, the job requirements must be job related and consistent with business
necessity and safe performance of the job. 41 CFR 60-741.6(c)(2). 

Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs 

v. 

PPG Industries, Inc., 

Case No. 86-OFC-9, Dep'y. Ass't Sec. Dec., Jan. 9, 1989, slip op. at 14. The contractor has the burden of
demonstrating compliance with this standard. 

PPG Industries, 

slip op. at 14.






A. Gregory Gray. 

The ALJ held that Complainant Gray was not covered by the Act because ``Congress did not intend to include correctable
and temporary impairments in the definition of `handicapped individual' [but] intended to apply the handicap definition
to more severe or permanent impairments.'' R.D. and O. at 14-15. The ALJ also held that Mr. Gray's condition did
not significantly limit his employment opportunities, indicating that he was not ``substantially limited'' within
the Act's definition. OFCCP excepted to the exclusion of Mr. Gray from coverage under the Act on the grounds that correctable
conditions are covered, and that substantial limitation in any major life activity, not limited to employment as
the ALJ held, establishes coverage.

Mr. Gray's physician described his condition as ``modified radical mastoidectomy of the right ear [with] [a] small
pinpoint perforation of the right drum [and] some granular tissue of the anterior aspect of the drum.'' Exhibit 11
to Deposition of Gregory C. Gray. An audiological evaluation found ``[s]peech discrimination in [the right] ear
is very good [although] [t]here is conductive loss [of hearing] in the right ear.'' 

Id.

 The doctor suggested that Mr. Gray ``is a candidate for middle ear exploration and possible ossicular chain reconstruction
for restoration of some of the conductive loss,'' but noted that ``in view of the fact that he is wearing an aid in the
right ear, this brings his hearing to essentially normal.'' 

Id.



As the Acting Assistant Secretary pointed out in 

Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs

 v. 

Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.

, Case No. 84-OFC-8, Final Dec. and Remand Ord. Mar. 30, 1989, slip op. at 16, applying the ``substantially
limited'' clause of the definition of handicapped individual requires fulfilling Congressional intent that the
Act be broadly construed without allowing the definition to become so open ended that the Act becomes trivialized.
Coverage of individuals with ``temporary'' or ``correctable'' conditions, therefore, requires difficult line
drawing. There can be no doubt, for example, that an individual with cancer which is operable or treatable with radiation
or chemotherapy nevertheless is covered by the Act. 

Cf.

 45 CFR part 84, appendix A, section A-3. Similarly, an individual with a condition such as diabetes or epilepsy
controllable with medication is a handicapped individual under section 503. See 

Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs

 v. 

PPG Industries, Inc.

, Case No. 86-OFC-9, Sec'y. Dec. and Remand Order on Remedy Jan. 9, 1989, slip op. at 16. On the other hand,
courts have hesitated to extend the Act to simple, temporary conditions or injuries which can reasonably be expected
to limit an individual's activities only for a short period of time. See, 

e.g., Evans

 v. 

City of Dallas

, 861 F.2d 846, 852-53 (5th Cir. 1988) (knee injury correctable by surgery not within scope of Act); 

Peagle

 v. 

Department of the Interior

, 813 F. Supp. 61, 64 (D.D.C. 1993) (back strain and pain due to Degenerative Disc Syndrome treatable by simple bed rest
not covered); 

Vissaraga

 v. 

Garrett

, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9164, at *13 (N.D. Cal. June 16, 1992) (back strain and sprain not a handicap); 

Grimard

 v. 

Carlson

, 567 F.2d 1171, 1174 (5th Cir. 1988) (fractured and dislocated ankle not a handicap).

I agree with OFCCP that a Congressional committee report, cited by the ALJ, on a proposed amendment in 1979 to Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that did not pass, carries little weight in discerning the intent of Congress five
years earlier when it amended the Rehabilitation Act to include the current definition of handicapped individual.
The legislative history of the recently enacted Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. 12101-12213 (Supp.
II 1991) is more relevant here because Congress explicitly stated that ``[t]he definition of the term `disability'
* * * is comparable to the definition of the term `individual with handicaps' in section 7(8)(B) of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.'' H.R. Rep. No. 485 part 2, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 50 (1990), 

reprinted in

 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 267, 332.






Congress used the specific example of an individual like Mr. Gray to illustrate application of the term ``substantially
limits'' and to distinguish ``minor, trivial impairments'' from those that restrict ``the conditions, manner,
or duration under which [important life activities] can be performed in comparison to most people.'' The report explained
further that ``[w]hether a person has a disability should be assessed without regard to the availability of mitigating
measures, such as reasonable accommodations or auxiliary aids. For example, a person who is hard of hearing is substantially
limited in the major life activity of hearing, even though the loss may be corrected through the use of a hearing aid.''


Id.

 at 52.

In addition, I find no basis in the Act to permit a contractor to require an employee or applicant for employment to undergo
a treatment, operation or drug regimen before being considered for employment or being entitled to other terms, conditions
or privileges of employment. That decision is a private one to be made by each individual with a handicap in consultation
with his or her physician and other health professionals.
 Indeed, Commonwealth has an obligation under the duty to make reasonable accommodation ``to permit an individual
with a disability the opportunity to provide and utilize equipment, aids or services that an employer is not required
to provide as a reasonable accommodation.'' 29 CFR part 1630, app.,  1630.2(o) Reasonable Accommodation (1992).
Of course, handicapped applicants or employees must be qualified, with reasonable accommodation, but a contractor
must consider each handicapped individual as he finds him.





For the same reason, I reject Commonwealth's contention that the reference in the regulations to the American Medical
Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, 41 CFR 60-741.7(d) (1990), requires a handicapped
individual to undergo any particular treatment or surgical operation. The Guides define permanent impairment as
an abnormality or loss after maximum medical rehabilitation has been achieved. But it is implicit that the appropriate
rehabilitation regimen has been undertaken voluntarily by the patient with the advice of his physician.

The record is clear that Mr. Gray was qualified for the dross handler position for which Commonwealth considered him.
He had worked at several laboring jobs and Commonwealth rejected him solely because of his hearing condition. P-2,
5; R.D. and O. at 4.

Commonwealth contend that its exclusion of Mr. Gray from consideration for employment was job related and consistent
with business necessity
 and safe performance of the job. Com. Resp. at 45. I reject that contention because, at the time of the hearing, Commonwealth
employed two other individuals with uncorrectable hearing losses. D-13. Inasmuch as there is no apparent reason
for differentiating correctable and uncorrectable hearing loss with respect to job relatedness or safety concerns,
I conclude that Commonwealth violated section 503 of the At when it refused to hire Gray unless he had his hearing loss
surgically corrected.




B. 

David Worthington.

 OFCCP contends that there is no indication that its case in regard to Complainant Worthington was settled when he was
hired by Commonwealth or that Mr. Worthington intended to terminate his employment voluntarily in December 1981.
OFCCP therefore argues that it may seek retroactive seniority and back pay on behalf of Worthington. Exceptions at
43. The record establishes that OFCCP was not seeking back pay for Mr. Worthington, and was not entitled to receive
back pay on his behalf because Worthington was earning more elsewhere than he could have at Commonwealth. T. at 683;
P-36. See R.D. and O. at 12. Inasmuch as OFCCP is not asking that Mr. Worthington be reinstated, the request for
retroactive seniority is moot. Irrespective of whether the case has been settled, OFCCP has failed, as the AJL found,
to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. I therefore accept the ALJ's recommendation that the complaint be
dismissed as to Complainant Worthington.
C. 

Wilda Matthis.

 The ALJ found there was no question that Complainant Matthis had moderate scoliosis, R.D. and O. at 16, and Commonwealth
does not dispute that she was handicapped. Based on the contraindication for heavy manual labor, however, the ALJ
found that she was not qualified for the manual labor position for which she applied. 

Id.

 at 5, 16. The test of whether a handicapped individual is qualified is if the individual possesses the ability to perform
the job. 

Texas Industries,

 slip op. at 14. The record establishes that Ms. Matthis worked as an automotive parts dispatcher at Sears where she
inspected cars, pulled wheels, and carried pipes, mufflers and brakes. P-2. Inasmuch as this constitutes manual
labor and there is no other evidence that she could not perform manual labor, I find that she was qualified to work in
a manual labor position at Commonwealth. Since she was rejected for employment because of her scoliosis, OFCCP established
a prima facie case of handicap discrimination as to Ms. Matthis.
Commonwealth contends that its job qualification requirements, which is this case caused Ms. Matthis to be rejected
for employment in part because of radiographic evidence of a back abnormality, are job related and consistent with
business necessity and safe job performance. Com. Resp. at 69-76. The job qualifications as applied essentially
screened out Ms. Matthis because of an increased risk of injury. As such, they must be examined with special care. 

Bentivegna,

 694 F.2d at 622. The evidence in this case fails to justify refusing employment to Ms. Matthis because it does not establish
a reasonable probability of substantial harm, 

Mantolete,

 767 F.2d at 1422, or even predict that any injury would ever happen if she were employed in a manual labor position. 

Texas Industries,

 slip op. at 21. An orthopedist reported Ms. Mathis had ``asymptomatic idiopathic scoliosis [which would not] limit
[her] activities.'' p. 21. See T. at 447, 975; PX 3; DX 23. I find that Commonwealth violated Section 503 by refusing
to hire Complainant Matthis.
D. 

Kenneth Sherrard.

 The ALJ noted that Complainant Sherrard had severe scoliosis, R.D. and O. at 16, and Commonwealth concedes that he
is obviously handicapped. Com. Resp. at 61. As with Ms. Matthis, and ALJ found that Mr. Sherrard was not qualified for
employment in mechanical maintenance which involves heavy manual labor. R.D. and O. at 5, 16. At the time of his application,
Sherrard had worked for ten years as a maintenance mechanic, P-2, and an orthopedist recommended that he could
continue working in that capacity. P. 17. I find that Mr. Sherrard was qualified to perform the job for which he applied
at Commonwealth and, because he was rejected for employment based on his scoliosis, OFCCP made a prima facie case of
handicap discrimination as to him.

Commonwealth's job qualifications also screened out Mr. Sherrard because of an increased risk of injury. The evidence
as to Mr. Sherrard does not support refusing him employment because all it states it that he should avoid heavy lifting,
T. at 984, and it does not establish a probability of substantial harm or predict if any injury will occur. I therefore
conclude that Commonwealth violated Section 503 by refusing to hire Mr. Sherrard.



E. Robert Etnire. 

The ALJ made no finding regarding whether Complainant Etnire was handicapped, but it is clear that Commonwealth regarded
him as handicapped because he was foreclosed generally from positions involving manual labor from the time of his
initial application for employment, April 29, 1980, until he was hired by Commonwealth on June 29, 1981. 

Forrisi, 

794 F.2d at 935. Etnire's application for employment discloses that he worked in mechanical maintenance, the same
position for which he applied at Commonwealth, from 1970 to 1979, at which time the plant where he was working closed.
PX 2. I find that he was therefore qualified to work in mechanical maintenance at Commonwealth and, because his application
was rejected due to degenerative changes in the lumbar spine, OFCCP has made a prima facie case of handicap discrimination
as to Mr. Etnire.

The ALJ stated that, at best, the evidence shows a mistaken but good faith belief that Mr. Etnire was not qualified for
employment in 1980. R.D. and O at 17. Good faith, however, is not a defense, as the Act is directed particularly at unintentional
conduct. 

Nathanson, 

926 F.2d at 1384. In addition, the contractor has the obligation to ``gather all relevant information regarding the
applicant's work history and medical history and independently assess both the probability and severity of potential
injury.'' 

PPG Industries., 

slip op. at 17 quoting 

Mantolete 

v. 

Bolger, 

767 F.2d at 1423. Accordingly, I find that Commonwealth violated Section 503 by failing to hire Complainant Etnire
in 1980. 



F. William Zellers. 

Commonwealth contends that Complainant Zellers is not handicapped because he did not regard himself as handicapped
and because his spondylolisthesis did not substantially limit any major life activities, particularly in view of
his continued self-employment in the construction business.
 Comm. Resp. at 63-64. Where, as here, an employer regards an individual as being foreclosed generally from heavy
manual labor positions, that individual is considered handicapped. 

Forrisi, 

794 F.2d at 935. 

E.E. Black, 

497 F. Supp. at 1097-1102; 

Texas Industries, 

slip op. at 8. The record in this case establishes that Mr. Zellers worked in the supervision and maintenance of construction
equipment from 1953 until the time of his application with Commonwealth, P-2, and that this was considered heavy
labor. T. at 627. Mr. Zellers was therefore, contrary to the ALJ's conclusion, R.D. and O. at 16, qualified to work in
electrical or mechanical maintenance at Commonwealth, see 

Texas Industries, 

slip op at 14, and, inasmuch as his application was rejected because of his spondylolisthesis, OFCCP has established
a prima facie case as to Mr. Zellers.





As with some of the other complainants, Commonwealth's job qualifications screened out Zellers based on an increased
risk of injury. The evidence does not justify refusing him employment because all it states is that he is at a higher
risk for disabling back pains, T. at 440, but does not show a probability of substantial harm or predict if an injury
will ever occur. An orthopedist reported that Mr. Zellers had ``asymptomatic spondylolisthesis [with] no evidence
of a herniated disc or spinal stenosis. Considering his previous work history and lack of any previous symptoms [there
was] no reason to limit [his] function.'' p. 21. I find that Commonwealth violated Section 503 when it refused to hire
Complaint Zellers.



G. Thomas Marshall. 

The ALJ concluded that Complainant Marshall was not a handicapped individual because his hernia was temporary and
correctable. R.D. and O. at 16. For the reasons discussed in  A above, I reject this conclusion and find that Mr.
Marshall was handicapped because Commonwealth regarded him as being foreclosed generally from employment with
them. 

Forrisi, 

794 F.2d at 935. Mr. Marshall's employment application disclosed that he worked as chief electrician for two years
prior to applying at Commonwealth. PX 2. I therefore find that he was qualified to work at Commonwealth in an electrical
maintenance position. Because Mr. Marshall was denied employment until he had surgery, I conclude that OFCCP has
made a prima facie case as to him.

Commonwealth notes that Mr. Marshall's hernia was discovered on July 18, 1980, and that between then and September
1980, Mr. Marshall saw Dr. Schell, had the surgery and visited Commonwealth to seek reinstatement of his application.
Comm. Resp. at 52. From this, Commonwealth argues that ``it is obvious that Dr. Schell thought Mr. Marshall needed
survery immediately'' and it was therefore entitled to exclude Mr. Marshall because the risk of future injury was
imminent.

<PARENT> FR940429-2-00062 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The difficulty with this argument is that there is no evidentiary support for the premise. Given Commonwealth's policy
concerning correctable conditions, the more likely inference is that Mr. Marshall scheduled the surgery early so
that he could have his employment application reinstated as soon as possible. See T. 612. The most that can be determined
based on the record is that Mr. Marshall's hernia presented an elevated risk of injury at some point in the future. Mr.
Marshall was working as Chief Electrician at another company when he applied for work with Commonwealth. His job involved
stooping, bending and lifting up to 80 pound weights, T. 592, but he was not aware that he had an inguinal hernia. T. 593.
Because the hernia has characterized as ``early'', PX 3, no reasonable probability of substantial harm has been shown
for employing Complainant Marshall at the time he applied and I therefore find that Commonwealth has violated Section
503 by failing to hire him.



IV. Individual Relief



In addition to seeking offers to employment
 for those subjected to handicap discrimination, OFCCP requests back pay and retroactive seniority. Commonwealth
argues that back pay is not authorized by the Act and regulations. While Section 501 authorizes back pay by incorporating
that remedy from Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Commonwealth notes that Section 504 incorporates the remedy
from Title VI which does not have a provision relating to back pay. Because Section 503 does not provide for back pay
awards, Commonwealth maintains that, as under Section 504, a back pay remedy is not available. Com. Resp., at 76-77.





The Supreme Court, however, has held that Section 504 authorizes a plaintiff to bring an equitable action for back
pay, because, although not specially listed therein, back pay is an available remedy under Title VI. 

Consolidated Rail Corp.

 V. 

Darrone,

 465 U.S. 624, 630-31 (1984). It is therefore apparent that the absence of any mention of back pay in Section 503
does not preclude its availability as a remedy for violations. The Assistant Secretary has so held, finding that back
pay is within the directive of Section 503(b) to ``take such action thereon as the facts and circumstances warrant
* * *'' 

Texas Industries,

 slip op. at 31. 

See

 also 

Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs

 v. 

Exide Corporation,

 Case No. 84-OFC-11, Acting Ass't Sec. Dec., Apr. 30, 1991, slip op. at 17. In addition, the Secretary has
recently held that back pay may be ordered under the parallel contact compliance program, Executive Order No. 11,246,
although there is no explicit reference to back pay in the Executive Order. 

United States Dep't of Labor

 v. 

Honeywell, Inc.,

 Sec'y Dec. and Order June 2, 1993, slip op. at 26-34.

Commonwealth also contends that there is no authority for awarding retroactive seniority because the Section 503
remedies are tailored for compliance with affirmative action obligations rather than for private remedies and the
absence of a private right of action under Section 503 means there is no private remedy available. Com. Resp. at 80-81.
I disagree. The cases cited by Commonwealth, while stating that there is no private right of action under Section 503,
nowhere hold that OFCCP cannot seek a remedy on behalf of a complainant.
 The Assistant Secretary has consistently held that retroactive seniority is an appropriate remedy for a Section
503 violation.

 See, 

e.g., WMATA,

 slip op. at 29; 

PPG Industries,

 slip op. at 35.






Commonwealth nevertheless argues that retroactive seniority should not be awarded in this case because the union
was not jointed as a party. Com. Resp. at 81. See 

EEOC

 v. 

Safeway Stores, Inc.,

 714 F.2d 567, 577 (5th Cir. 1983), 

cert. denied,

 467 U.S. 1204 (1984). While 

Safeway

 holds that a union must have the opportunity to participate in the proceedings where the relief ordered violates the
seniority provisions of a collective bargaining agreement, 714 F.2d at 577, 579, that decision, in my view, goes beyond
the requirements of applicable Supreme Court precedent.

In

W.R. Grace & Co. 

v. 

Local Union 759, United Rubber Workers of America

, 461 U.S. 757, 771 (1983), the Court held, in a Title VII case, that by entering into a conciliation agreement, the EEOC
and the employer cannot alter a collective bargaining agreement without the union's consent. In that case, the conciliation
agreement implemented a quota system under which the percentage of women would not be reduced during layoffs notwithstanding
the fact that some women would be retained while having less seniority than their male counterparts. The Court held
that absent a judicial determination the EEOC and an employer cannot alter a collective bargaining agreement without
the union's consent. 461 U.S. at 770-72.

In 

Safeway, 

the EEOC attempted to distinguish 

W.R. Grace 

by arguing that the conciliation agreement in 

Safeway

 did not result in the ``wholesale destruction'' of a collective bargaining agreement. Rather, the seniority system
would remain intact with discriminatees being afforded their rightful place, the place they would have occupied
but for the discrimination. The court rejected that argument, stating that ``we cannot agree that a difference in
the degree of conflict with collective bargaining structure, beyond de minimis, [sic] can affect our ultimate decision.''
714 F.2d at 578.

Conciliation agreements, which are a form of contract and which purport to amend or alter another contract, the collective
bargaining agreement, without the consent of one party, the union, must be distinguished from the retroactive award
of seniority after an adjudication of discrimination. 

Holsey 

v. 

Armour & Co.

, 743 F.2d 199, 218 (4th Cir. 1984), 

cert. denied, 

470 U.S. 1028 (1985). There is a presumption in favor of the rightful place seniority remedy. 

Franks 

v. 

Bowman Transportation Co.

, 424 U.S. 747, 779 n. 41 (1976). 

E.E.O.C.

 v. 

Pneumatics, Inc.

, 779 F.2d 21, 23 (8th Cir. 1985). Indeed, the Supreme Court explicitly declined to decide in 

W.R. Grace

 whether an arbitration award for violation of the seniority provisions of a collective bargaining agreement ``could
be enforced in the face of a valid judicial alteration of seniority provisions pursuant to 

Franks 

v. 

Bowman

 [] to provide relief to discriminatees under Title VII or other law.'' 461 U.S. at 767 n.9. I conclude have the authority
under Section 503, after a finding of discrimination, to award retroactive seniority without participation of the
union in the proceedings.

Averring that the record is not complete enough to calculate the relief due complainants, OFCCP requests a remand
to the ALJ for a determination of the appropriate relief. Exceptions at 68. In accordance with this opinion, Commonwealth
is ordered to make offers of employment, in positions comparable to the ones for which they applied, to Complainants
Gregory Gray, Wilda Matthis, Kenneth Sherrard, William Zellers and Thomas Marshall. In addition, seniority must
be awarded retroactive to the date complainants would have been hired but for the illegal discrimination. Complainant
Robert Etnire is to be granted additional seniority from the date he would have been hired in 1980 until his actual date
of hire, June 29, 1981. The case is remanded to the ALJ to compute the amount of back pay due these complainants, taking
into account the seniority they would have accrued if hired.



Conclusions and Order



For the foregoing reasons, I hold that Commonwealth violated Section 503 of the Act when it refused to hired Complainants
Gray, Matthis, Sherrard, Zellers and Marshall and by declining to hire Complainant Etnire when he first applied.
 Commonwealth is ordered to give the complainants, with the exception of Etnire, offers of employment within 60 days
of receipt of this order. All complainants are to be awarded appropriate seniority and all other applicable benefits
in accordance with this opinion. The case is remanded to the ALJ for calculation of back pay due complainants and submission
of a supplemental recommended decision.





If Defendant Commonwealth Aluminum fails to comply with any provision of this order within the specified time periods,
Defendant, its officers, subsidiaries, and successors shall be ineligible for the award of any government contracts
or subcontracts, and shall be ineligible for extensions or other modifications of any existing Government contracts
or subcontracts, until Defendant has satisfied the Assistant Secretary of Labor that it is in compliance with the
provisions of Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the regulations and orders issued thereunder which
have been found to have been violated in this case.

So Ordered.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicant's Representations




1. Applicant is a periodic payment plan, which registered as a unit investment trust on July 30, 1958 by filing a notification
of registration on Form N-8A pursuant to section 8(a) of the Act. On the same day, applicant filed a registration
statement on Form S-6 under the Securities Act of 1933 to register its securities. The registration statement
was declared effective on or about April 12, 1961, and applicant's initial public offering commenced soon thereafter.

2. Applicant consisted of Insurted Systematic Investment Plans and Single Payment Plans (collectively, the ``Plans'')
under which payments by planholders were invested in shares of Pioneer Fund, an open-end investment company. Each
Plan was established and governed by the terms of (a) an individual agreement among the investor, and depositor, Pioneer
Plans Corporation, and (b) a custody agreement between a sponsor and the custodian, State Street Bank. The individual
agreements and the custody agreement were governed by the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

3. On December 20, 1990, the board of directors of Pioneering Services Corporation approved a plan of conversion which
would convert each Plan to a Pioneer Fund Open Account. This vote subsequently was ratified by a written action of directors
dated as of February 22, 1994.

4. Planholders who had completed their contractual Plan payments at the time of conversion were notified of the conversion
by letter dated January 2, 1991. On the same day, planholders who had not completed their contractual payments were
given the right to purchase shares of Pioneer Fund at a reduced sales charge of 2% to complete their Plans. This charge
was lower than the amounts that would have been required to complete their Plan obligations.

5. On January 5, 1991, Pioneer Plans Corporation converted each Single Payment Plan and Insured Systematic Investment
Plan to a Pioneer Fund Open Account. Upon the effectiveness of the conversion, the entire share balance of each Plan
was transferred to a Pioneer Fund Open Account registered in the name of the holder of the converted Plan. The conversion
had no effect on the value of the assets held in the Plans (

i.e.

, shares of Pioneer Fund).

6. Pioneering Services Corporation paid all expenses in connection with the conversion. Expenses were incurred
to pay the manager of the project, and mailing and printing costs.

7. Applicant has no debts or other liabilities outstanding, and is not a party to any litigation or administrative
proceeding. Applicant had no planholders at the time of filing of the application.

8. Applicant is not now engaged, nor does it propose to engage, in any business activities other than those necessary
for the winding up of its affairs. Applicant presently has no legal existence under the state laws pursuant to which
it was created.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; American Stock Exchange; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Relating to Amendments
to Rule 170 Pertaining to Specialists' Liquidating Transactions</DOCTITLE>


April 22, 1994.





I. Introduction



On August 13, 1992, the American Stock Exchange (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC''or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to amend Amex Rule 170 to permit a specialist to effect a liquidating transaction on a zero minus
tick, in the case of a ``long'' position, or a zero plus tick, when covering a ``short'' position, without Floor Official
approval. The Amex also proposes to amend this Rule to set forth the affirmative action that specialists would be required
to take subsequent to effecting various types of liquidating transactions. The Amex proposes to implement the proposed
rule change for a one-year pilot period.





The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32804 (August 25, 1993),
58 FR 45926 (August 31, 1993). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposed rule change
for a one year period.


II. Description of the Proposal




Amex Rule 170, which is the primary Amex rule governing the functions of specialists, restricts a specialist's purchases
or sales of his or her specialty stock to those dealings that are reasonably necessary to permit the specialist to maintain
a fair and orderly market.






A specialist's dealer responsibilities consist of ``affirmative'' and ``negative'' obligations. In accordance
with their affirmative obligations, specialists are obligated to trade for their own accounts to minimize order
disparities and contribute to continuity and depth in the market.
 Conversely, pursuant to their negative obligations, specialists are precluded from trading for their own accounts
unless such dealing is necessary for the maintenance of a fair and orderly market.
 In view of these obligations, the price trend in a security should be determined not by specialist trading, but by the
movements of the incoming orders that initiate the trades. Amex Rule 170.02, which contains one of the specalist's
``negative'' obligations, sets forth distinct prohibitions against specialist trades on destablizing ticks (i.e.,
purchases on plus or zero plus ticks and sales on minus or zero minus ticks).
 Rule 170.02 also provides that, unless a specialist has Floor Official approval, he or she should avoid liquidation
of all, or substantially all, of a position by selling stock at prices below the last different price (on a direct minus
or zero minus tick) or by purchasing stock at prices above the last different price (on a direct plus or zero plus tick),
unless the transaction is reasonably necessary in relation to the specialist's overall position in his or her specialty
stocks.

The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 170.02 regarding how specialists can ``reliquify'' a dealer position. When reliquifying,
a specialist is reducing a large inventory position in order to be able to fully participate on the contra side of the
market during periods of substantial buying or selling interest. The amended rule would permit a specialist, when
reliquifying, to sell ``long'' inventory stock on a zero minus tick, or purchase stock to ``cover'' a ``short'' position
on a zero plus tick, without Floor Official approval. In addition, the Amex proposes to amend Rule 170.02 to emphasize
the specialist's affirmative role in providing stabilizing dealer participation to the marketplace, especially
during periods of volatile or unusual market activity, involving significant price movement in a security, where
reliquification may be required to facilitate the maintenance of a fair and orderly market. In this regard, Rule 170.02
would be amended on a one year pilot basis to provide that:




Liquidations involving the principal selling of any

 specialty stock on a direct minus tick, or the purchasing of such stock on a direct plus tick will require Floor Official
approval, and should be effected only in conjunction with the specialist's re-entering the market on the opposite
side of the market from the liquidating transaction where the imbalance indicates that the immediate succeeding
transactions would result in a lower price following the sale (or higher price following the purchase).

During volatile or unusual market conditions involving significant price movement in a security, the specialist
should re-enter the market following a liquidation transaction which was effected by selling stock on a direct minus
or zero minus tick, or purchasing stock on a direct plus or zero plus tick and, at a minimum, participate as a dealer to
the extent of his or her usual level of dealer participation in the subject security.

During such periods, a series of such liquidating transactions effected within a brief period of time should be accompanied
by the specialist's re-entry in the market and effecting transactions which reflect a significant degree of dealer
participation.




The Exchange believes that its proposed amendments to Rule 170.02 will provide specialists with the ability to respond
to periods of extreme market volatility, particularly those characterized by high volume and selling pressure,
by permitting him or her to liquidate large dealer positions acquired as a result of such selling pressure. In addition,
the Exchange believes that the amendments would reinforce the specialist's affirmative obligation to maintain
a fair and orderly market by providing stabilizing dealer participation to the marketplace, and would reinforce
his or her negative obligations in that a specialist would not be able to liquidate in the absence of a large dealer position,
but could only do so if reasonably necessary to maintain a fair and orderly market.

The Exchange proposes to implement the proposed rule change as a one-year pilot, and will monitor compliance with
the requirements of the Rule through existing surveillance procedures. In particular, the Exchange stated that
liquidation transactions effected by specialists on direct plus or minus destabilizing ticks will initially be
reviewed as to whether the requisite Floor Official approval was obtained, and will be subjected to a further review
with respect to the specialist's dealer participation levels, re-entry into the market in terms of timing and support,
and whether the transactions were counter to the market trend. The Exchange stated that it would provide the Commission
with a report summarizing the results of its surveillance prior to the conclusion of the pilot period.

The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed
to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and
open market, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest, by enabling specialists to facilitate
orderly and continuous markets during periods of unusual volatility of price changes.



III. Discussion



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with sections 6(b) (5)
and 11 of the Act.
 The Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(5) requirements that the rules of an exchange
be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of
a free and open market, and, in general, protect investors and the public interest. The Commission also believes that
the proposal is consistent with section 11(b) of the Act and Rule 11b-1 thereunder,
 which allow exchanges to promulgate rules relating to specialists in order to maintain fair and orderly markets.

Both the Act and Exchange rules reflect the crucial role played by specialists in providing stability, liquidity,
and continuity in the Exhange's auction market. Recognizing the importance of the specialist in the auction market,
the Act, as well as Exchange rules, impose stringent obligations upon specialist.
 Primary among the obligations are the requirements to maintain fair and olderly markets and to restrict specialist
dealings to those that are ``reasonably necessary'' in order to maintain a fair and orderly market.
 






The importance of specialist performance to the quality of Exchange markets was highlighted during the 1987 and 1989
market breaks. In the Division of Market Regulation's (``Division'') report on the October 1987 market break (``1987
Market Break Report''), the Division examined specialist performance on the Amex on October 19 and 20, 1987.
 The Division found that, although some Amex specialists appeared to perform well under adverse conditions, others
did not.
 






The Division also examined Amex specialist performance during the volatile conditions of October 13 and 16, 1989
(``October 1989 Report''), and found that specialist performance during the time was similar in many respects to
the pattern of specialist performance during the October 1987 Market Break.
 Specifically, the Division found that, during these two periods of adverse market conditions, specialists were
confronted with extreme volume and volatility.
 






Both the 1987 Market Break Report and the October 1998 Report reaffirmed the importance of specialist participation
in countering market trends during periods of market volatility. At the same time, the reports emphasized the importance
the Commission placed on the Amex's ability to ensure that all specialists comply with their affirmative and negative
market making obligations during such periods. 

One area of specialist performance specifically reviewed by the October 1989 Report involved specialist's compliance
with their obligation to maintain and orderly market by buying and selling stocks for their own accounts to relieve
imbalances between supply and demand. In the October 1989 Report, the Division requested that the Amex examine the
language of Rule 170.02.
 Amex Rule 170.02 states that, unless a specialist has the prior approval of a Floor Official, he or she should avoid
liquidation of all or substantially all of position by selling stock at prices below the last different price or by
purchasing stock at prices above the last different price unless such transactions are reasonably necessary in relation
to the specialist's overall position in the stocks in which he or she is registered. The Division indicated that Rule
170.02 appeared to provide specialists with unnecessarily broad latitude for effecting transactions on destabilizing
tricks.








The proposed rule change is responsive to the request regarding Rule 170.02 as well as the conclusions of the two market
break reports. The Amex, recognizing that market conditions may necessitate that a specialist participate heavily
in a rapidly declining market, has proposed amendments to Rule 170.02 to provide specialists with flexibility in
liquidating specialty stock positions in order to facilitate their ability to maintain fair and orderly markets,
particularly during unusual market conditions. At the same time, the amendments also would strengthen the specialist's
concomitant obligation to participate as dealer on the opposite side of the market after a liquidating transaction.

Under the amended Rule, a specialist may liquidate a position by selling stock on a direct minus tick or by purchasing
stock on a direct plus tick only if such transactions are reasonably necessary for the maintenance of a fair and orderly
market and only if the specialist has obtained the prior approval of a Floor Official. Liquidations on a zero minus
or a zero plus tick, which previously required Floor Official approval, can be effected under the pilot procedures
without a Floor Official's approval, but continue to be subject to the restriction that they be effected only when
reasonably necessary to maintain a fair and orderly market. In addition, the specialist must maintain a fair and orderly
market during the liquidation.

Both the Act and Exchange rules reflect the crucial role played by specialists in providing stability, liquidity,
and continuity in the Exchange's auction market. Recognizing the importance of the specialist in the auction market,
the Act, as well as Exchange rules, impose stringent obligations upon

After the liquidation, a specialist is required to re-enter the market on the opposite side of the market from the liquidating
transaction to offset any imbalances between supply and demand. During any period of volatile or unusual market conditions
resulting in a significant price movement in a specialist's specialty stock, the specialist's re-entry into the
market must reflect, at a minimum, his or her usual level of dealer participation in the specialty stock. In addition,
during such periods of volatile market conditions or unusual price movements, re-entry into the market following
a series of transactions must reflect a significant level of dealer participation.

Thus, the amendments to Rule 170.02 would reinforce the specialist's affirmative obligation to maintain a fair and
orderly market by providing stabilizing dealer participation to the marketplace, especially during periods of
volatile or unusual market activity. For example, during periods of high market volatility, not only would specialists
continue to be obligated to temper disparities between supply and demand, but would specifically have to reenter
the market after a liquidating transaction. Similarly, the amendments to Rule 170.02 would reinforce the negative
market making obligations of specialists. For example, a specialist would not be permitted to reliquify in the absence
of a large dealer position; rather he or she would only be able to do so if reasonably necessary to enable him or her to
maintain fair and orderly market. Thus, the new amendments to Rule 170.02 would not allow the specialist to use the
rule as a vehicle for trading.

During future periods of market volatility, accompanied by increasing volume and selling pressure, specialists
may be under extreme pressure to keep the markets orderly and continuous by entering the market as buyers. In these
instances, the Commission believes that the amendments to Rule 170.02 should assist specialists in tempering sudden
price movements and keeping any general price movements orderly, thereby furthering the maintenance of fair and
orderly markets consistent with Sections 6 and 11 under the Act.

The Commission emphasizes that reliquifications are not precluded during periods of significant price movements,
but they should be accompanied by the necessary dealer participation against the trend of the market, even in situations
where continuity and depth reflect variations that may normally be experienced in the stock.

In addition, the Commission believes that approval of the Amex proposal for a one year pilot period will provide the
Commission and Exchange an opportunity to monitor the operation of the rule during periods of unusual or volatile
market conditions. This one year period also will allow the Commission and the Exchange the opportunity to monitor
specialist compliance with the new rule to ensure that specialists are properly assuming their responsibilities
of re-entering the market following liquifying transactions.

Finally, in its rule filing, the Amex indicated that, during the one year pilot period, the Exchange would monitor
compliance with the requirements of the Rule. Specifically, the Amex stated that liquidation transactions effected
by specialists on direct plus or minus destabilizing ticks will initially be reviewed as to whether the requisite
Floor Official approval was obtained, and will be subjected to a further review with respect to the specialist's dealer
participation levels, re-entry into the market in terms of timing and support, and whether to transactions were counter
to the market trend. The Exchange also stated that it would provide the Commission with a report summarizing the results
of its surveillance prior to the conclusion of the pilot period. In this regard, the Commission requests that the Exchange
submit a report, by January 22, 1995, setting forth the criteria developed by the Exchange to determine whether any
reliquifications by specialists were necessary and appropriate in connection with fair and orderly markets and
providing information gathered regarding the Exchange's monitoring of liquidation transactions effected by specialists
on any destabilizing tick. In addition, the Commission requests that the Amex provide, among other things, the following
information in its report:

(1) A review of all liquidation transactions effected by specialists on any destabilizing ticks; 

(2) A review of liquidating transactions by specialists to determine that the required Floor Official approval was
obtained where necessary;

(3) And a review of liquidating transactions in light of dealer participation levels and re-entry into the market
in terms of timing and support (e.g., whether the specialist's transactions were counter to the market trend).



It therefore is ordered,

 pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change is approved for a one year pilot period ending on April 22, 1995.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange, Inc. Amending its Schedule of Fees and Charges Relating to Charges on Stock Execution Machines. </DOCTITLE>



April 21, 1994. 



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notices hereby
given that on March 29, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On April 21, 1994, the Phlx submitted to the Commission
Amendment No. 1 to the proposal.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Phlx is proposing to amend its Schedule of Fees and Charges respecting the charges of non-exchange sponsored stock
execution equipment
 operated by Phlx members on the Phix floor. The proposed amendment would provide a 50 percent credit on the fees charged
on each stock execution machine operated by any member firm for each 2,500 trades such member executes on the PHlx in
a non-specialist account.





II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments if received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. 



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




1. Purpose



Since 1990, the Exchange has imposed a proprietary stock execution machine charge of $250.
 Effective for the Exchange's April 1994 billing cycle, the Phix shall provide a monthly credit of 50 percent of the
fees charged for each stock execution machine operated by a member per each 2,500 trades executed by such member of
the Phlx. The credit shall not exceed 50 percent of the total stock execution machine billing charges per member operating
such machine.

<DOCNO> FR940429-2-00097 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940429-2-00071 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Accordingly, a member firm with three stock execution machines, executing 7,500 trades in a non-specialist account,
would be entitled to a credit of $375.00. In this example, the charges for the stock execution machines would be $750
($250 fee multiplied by the 3 machines) minus the credit of $375 (1/2 [$250 fee] multiplied by 3 machines. If, however,
in the above example the member firm had operated only two stock execution machines, the credit given would be $250
because the credit per member would be capped at 50 percent of the member's total stock execution machine billing charges.
Thus, in the latter case, the total charges would be $250, which equals the total fees ($500) minus the credit per each
machine (2 multiplied by $125).
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to amend the Phlx's current schedule of fees and charges and to also enhance
the Exchange's equity floor as a highly attractive floor of execution for a member firm's business.


2. Statutory Basis


The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act in that it provides for the equitable allocation
of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its members and other persons using its facilities.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others


No written comments were either solicited or received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


The foregoing rule change establishes or changes a due, fee or other charge imposed by the Exchange and therefore has
become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder.
At any time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the
protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of the filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the Phlx. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Phlx-94-19 and should be submitted by May
20, 1994.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Secretary of State's Advisory Committee on Private International Law; Study Group on International Procurement;
Meeting</DOCTITLE>



A Study Group of the Secretary of State's Advisory Committee on Private International Law will hold a meeting at 9:30
a.m. until 2 p.m. on Wednesday, May 18th, 1994 in Washington, DC at the International Law Institute, 1615 New Hampshire
Avenue NW.

The Study Group will review proposed provisions of a model law for the procurement of services which is under consideration
by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). UNCITRAL will meet for possible final adoption
of the proposed rules in June 1994. Participants in the Study Group meeting will be asked to provide technical advice
and to make recommendations for possible U.S. positions for the UNCITRAL session.

UNCITRAL recently completed the Model Law on Procurement of Goods and Construction at its Plenary Session in May 1993,
which was endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly by resolution 48-33 on December 9, 1993. The text of
the Model Law is printed in the annual report of the Commission's work, U.N. Doc. A/48/17 Annex I and 33 I.L.M. 445 (March
1994). A Guide to Enactment was also prepared to accompany the Model Law (U.N. Doc. A/CN.9/393). The proposed additional
model law provisions covering procurement of services and corresponding changes to the Guide to Enactment are set
out in an annex to the report of the Commission's most recent Working Group meeting on this subject, held at the U.N.
in March 1994 (U.N. Docs. A/CN.9/392 and 394).

The Study Group will review the proposed scope of the UNCITRAL project, including rules on requests for proposals
and other procurement methods for acquisition of services, open access to markets, competitive or restricted bidding,
and related matters.

Copies of the U.N. Documents referred to above and other relevant information may be obtained by contacting Harold
S. Burman by fax at (202) 653-9854 or writing the Office of the Assistant Legal Adviser for Private International
Law, L/PIL, Suite 501, 2100 ``K'' Street NW., Washington, DC 20037-7180.

The Study Group will also review the status of two related international projects, the UNCITRAL Legal Guide on International
Countertrade Transactions, which is now available as United Nations Publication Sales No. E.93.V.7, and the UNIDROIT
Principles for International Commercial Contracts, which is expected to become final in May 1994.

Members of the general public may attend the meeting up to the capacity of the meeting room. The office indicated above
should be notified not later than Thursday, May 12th of the name, affiliation, address and phone number of persons
wishing to attend. In order to facilitate planning for the meeting, members of the public are requested to indicate
whether they expect to comment on particular issues. Persons interested but unable to attend the meeting are welcome
to submit comments or proposals to the address indicated above. Persons wishing to be placed on the mailing list for
notices for meetings of the Study group and for further information on documents on this subject relating to UNCITRAL's
work should so advise the above Office.

<DOCTITLE>Noise Exposure Map Notice; Receipt of Noise Compatibility Program and Request for Review, Laredo International
Airport, Laredo, TX</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its determination that the noise exposure maps submitted by
the City of Laredo, Texas for Laredo International Airport under the provisions of Title I of the Aviation Safety and
Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96-193) and 14 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) part 150 are in compliance
with applicable requirements. The FAA also announces that it is reviewing a proposed noise compatibility program
that was submitted for Laredo International Airport under part 150 in conjunction with the noise exposure map, and
that this program will be approved or disapproved on or before October 15, 1994




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice announces that the FAA finds that the noise exposure maps submitted for Laredo International Airport
are in compliance with applicable requirements of part 150, effective April 18, 1994. Further, FAA is reviewing a
proposed noise compatibility program for that airport which will be approved or disapproved on or before October
15, 1994. This notice also announces the availability of this program for public review and comment.




Under section 103 of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the
Act''), an airport operator may submit to the FAA noise exposure maps which meet applicable regulations and which
depict noncompatible land uses as of the date of submission of such maps, a description of projected aircraft operations,
and the ways in which such operations will affect such maps. The Act requires such maps to be developed in consultation
with interested and affected parties in the local community, government agencies, and persons using the airport.

An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by FAA to be in compliance with the requirements
of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part 150, promulgated pursuant to Title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility
program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing
noncompatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatible uses.





The City of Laredo, Texas, submitted to the FAA on March 15, 1994, noise exposure maps, descriptions and other documentation
which were produced from 1992 to February 1994 during the development of the Laredo International Airport FAR part
150 Airport Noise Compatibility Plan. It was requested that the FAA review this material as the noise exposure maps,
as described in section 103(a)(1) of the Act, and that the noise mitigation measures, to be implemented jointly by
the airport and surrounding communities, be approved as a noise compatibility program under section 104(b) of the
Act.




The FAA has completed its review of the noise exposure maps and related descriptions submitted by City of Laredo, Texas.
The specific maps under consideration are Figures 6A, 6B, and 10A in the submission. The FAA has determined that these
maps for Laredo International Airport are in compliance with applicable requirements. This determination is effective
on April 18, 1994. FAA's determination on an airport operator's noise exposure maps is limited to a finding that the
maps were developed in accordance with the procedures contained in appendix A of FAR Part 150. Such determination
does not constitute approval of the applicant's data, information or plans, or a commitment to approve a noise compatibility
program or to fund the implementation of that program.

If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific properties to noise exposure contours depicted
on a noise exposure map submitted under section 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involved in any way
in determining the relative locations of specific properties with regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting
the noise exposure maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which properties should be covered by the provisions
of section 107 of the Act. These functions are inseparable from the ultimate land use control and planning responsibilities
of local government. These local responsibilities are not changed in any way under part 150 or through FAA's review
of noise exposure maps.

Therefore, the responsibility for the detailed overlaying of noise exposure contours onto the map depicting properties
on the surface rests exclusively with the airport operator which submitted those maps, or with those public agencies
and planning agencies with which consultation is required under section 103 of the Act. The FAA has relied on the certification
by the airport operator, under section 150.21 of FAR part 150, that the statutorily required consultation has been
accomplished.

The FAA has formally received the noise compatibility program for Laredo International Airport, Texas, also effective
on April 18, 1994. Preliminary review of the submitted material indicates that it conforms to the requirements for
the submittal of noise compatibility programs, but that further review will be necessary prior to approval or disapproval
of the program. The formal review period, limited by law to a maximum of 180 days, will be completed on or before October
15, 1994.

The FAA's detailed evaluation will be conducted under the provisions of 14 CFR part 150,  150.33. The primary
considerations in the evaluation process are whether the proposed measures may reduce the level of aviation safety,
create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, or be reasonably consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing
existing noncompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses.

Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed program with specific reference to these factors. All comment,
other than those properly addressed to local land use authorities, will be considered by the FAA to the extent practicable.
Copies of the noise exposure maps, the FAA's evaluation of the maps, and the proposed noise compatibility program
are available for examination at the following locations:

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its determination that the noise exposure maps submitted by
the City of Manassas Airport Board for the Manassas Regional Airport under the provisions of Title I of the Aviation
Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96-193) and 14 CFR part 150 are in compliance with applicable requirements.
The FAA also announces that it is reviewing a proposed noise compatibility program, that was submitted for Manassas
Regional Airport under part 150 in conjunction with the noise exposure maps, and that this program will be approved
or disapproved on or before October 21, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice announces that the FAA finds that the noise exposure maps submitted for the Manassas Regional Airport
are in compliance with applicable requirements of part 150, effective March 21, 1994.


Further, the FAA is reviewing a proposed noise compatibility program for the airport which will be approved or disapproved
on or before October 21, 1994. This notice also announces the availability of this program for public review and comment.


Under section 103 of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the
Act''), an airport operator may submit to the FAA noise exposure maps which meet applicable regulations and which
depict non-compatible land uses as of the date of submission of such maps, a description of projected aircraft operations.
and the way in which such operations will affect such maps. The Act requires such maps to be developed in consultation
with interested and affected parties in the local community, government agencies and persons using the airport.

An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by FAA to be in compliance with the requirements
of FAR part 150, promulgated pursuant to Title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility program for FAA approval
which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing non-compatible uses
and for the prevention of the introduction of additional con-compatible uses.

The City of Manassas submitted to the FAA on February 24, 1992, noise exposure maps, descriptions and other documentation
which were produced during an airport noise compatibility planning study. It was requested that the FAA review this
material as the noise exposure maps, as described in section 103(a)(1) of the Act, and that the noise mitigation measures,
to be implemented jointly by the airport and surrounding communities, be approved as a noise compatibility program
under section 104(b) of the Act.

The FAA has completed its review of the noise exposure maps and related descriptions submitted by the City of Manassas.
The specific maps under consideration are the noise exposure maps: Figure X-1 Existing (1992) Noise Exposure
Map (page 56) and Figure X-2 Future (1997) Noise Exposure Map (page 57) of the February 1992 submission as amended.

The FAA has determined that these maps for Manassas Regional Airport are in compliance with applicable requirements.
This determination is effective on March 21, 1994. FAA's determination on an airport operator's noise exposure maps
is limited to finding that the maps were developed in accordance with the procedures contained in appendix A of FAR
part 150. Such determination does not constitute approval of the applicant's data, information or plans, or a commitment
to approve a noise compatibility program or to fund the implementation of that program.

<DOCTITLE>Index of Administrator's Decisions and Orders in Civil Penalty Actions; Publication</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of publication.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice constitutes the required quarterly publication of an index of the Administrator's decisions and orders
in civil penalty cases. The FAA is publishing an index by order number, an index by subject matter, and case digests
that contain identifying information about the final decisions and orders issued by the Administrator. Publication
of these indexes and digests is intended to increase the public's awareness of the Administrator's decisions and
orders and to assist litigants and practitioners in their research and review of decisions and orders that may have
precedential value in a particular civil penalty action. Publication of the index by order number, as supplemented
by the index by subject matter, ensures that the agency is in compliance with statutory indexing requirements.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Administrative Procedure Act requires Federal agencies to maintain and make available for public inspection
and copying current indexes containing identifying information regarding materials required to be made available
or published. 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2). In a notice issued on July 11, 1990, and published in the 

Federal Register

 (55 FR 29148; July 17, 1990), the FAA announced the public availability of several indexes and summaries that provide
identifying information about the decisions and orders issued by the Administrator under the FAA's civil penalty
assessment authority and the rules of practice governing hearings and appeals of civil penalty actions. 14 CFR part
13, subpart G. The FAA maintains an index of the Administrator's decisions and orders in civil penalty actions organized
by order number and containing identifying information about each decision or order. The FAA also maintains a subject-matter
index, and digests organized by order number.


In a notice issued on October 26, 1990, the FAA published these indexes and digests for all decisions and orders issued
by the Administrator through September 30, 1990. 55 FR 45984; October 31, 1990. The FAA announced in that notice that
it would publish supplements to these indexes and digests on a quarterly basis (

i.e., 

in January, April, July, and October of each year). The FAA announced further in that notice that only the subject-matter
index would be published cumulatively, and that both the order number index and the digests would be non-cumulative.

Since that first index was issued on October 26, 1990 (55 FR 45984; October 31, 1990), the FAA has issued supplementary
notices containing the quarterly indexes of the Administrator's civil penalty decisions as follows:




In the notice published on January 19, 1993, the Administrator announced that for the convenience of the users of these
indexes, the order number index published at the end of the year would reflect all of the civil penalty decisions for
that year. 58 FR 5044; 1/19/93. The order number indexes for the first, second, and third quarters would be non-cumulative.
As noted at the beginning of the digests, the digests do not constitute legal authority, and should not be cited or relied
upon as such. The digests are not intended to serve as a substitute for proper legal research. Parties, attorneys,
and other interested persons should always consult the full text of the Administrator's decisions before citing
them in any context.
The Administrator's final decisions and orders, indexes, and digests are available for public inspection and copying
at all FAA legal offices. (The addresses of the FAA legal offices are listed at the end of this notice.)
In addition, the Administrator's decisions and orders have been published by commercial publishers and are available
on computer databases. (Information about these commercial publications and computer databases is provided at
the end of this notice.)

Digests



(Current as of March 31, 1994)




The digests of the Administrator's final decisions and orders are arranged by order number, and briefly summarize
key points of the decision. The following compilation includes all final decisions and orders issued by the Administrator
from January 1, 1994, to March 31, 1994. The FAA will publish noncumulative supplements to these digests on a quarterly
basis (

i.e.,

 January, April, July, and October of each year).

These digests do not constitute legal authority, and should not be cited or relied upon as such. The digests are not
intended to serve as a substitute for proper legal research. Parties, attorneys, and other interested persons should
always consult the full text of the Administrator's decisions before citing them in any context.




In the Matter of Delta Air Lines, Inc., Order No. 94-1 (2/18/94).






Unauthorized Access.

 The law judge's finding that Respondent did not violate Section V.A.2 of the Air Carrier Standard Security Program
is reversed.




In the Matter of Mary Woodhouse, Order No. 94-2 (3/10/94).






Duty of Hot Air Balloon Repairman.

 The law judge's finding that Respondent violated the Federal Aviation Regulations when she certified a hot air balloon
as airworthy with unauthorized fuel manifolds is affirmed. Respondent should have questioned the owner, the manufacturer,
or the FAA concerning the origin of the fuel manifolds when the aircraft manual, maintenance log, and type certificate
data sheet contained no information on fuel manifolds. However, the law judge's finding that Respondent violated
the regulations by certifying the balloon as airworthy with unauthorized fuel tanks is reversed because Complainant
failed to establish the number of fuel tanks authorized by the balloon's type design.




In the Matter of Valley Air Services, Inc., Order No. 94-3 (3/10/94).






Expert Testimony.

 The law judge erred to the extent he used a simple credibility test to evaluate the expert testimony in this case. Expert
testimony is not evaluated on the basis of its credibility but on its logic, depth, and persuasiveness.



Failure of Proof.

 Complainant failed to bear its burden of proving that Respondent violated the regulations when it welded the cracked
spinners on its Piper Chieftain aircraft.




In the Matter of Northwest Aircraft Rental Inc., Order No. 94-4 (3/10/94).






Impeachment of Witnesses.

 A written summary of the informal conference was admissible for the limited purpose of impeachment.



Financial Hardship.

 Where Respondent did not raise the issue of financial hardship at the hearing, it failed to preserve the matter for
consideration on appeal. Respondent did not show that the evidence of financial hardship that he sought to introduce
on appeal was not available during the hearing.




In the Matter of Merritt A. Grant, Order No. 94-5 (3/10/94).






Failure to File Timely Answer.

 The law judge did not err in dismissing Respondent's request for hearing on the ground that Respondent failed to file
a timely answer.



Sanction.

 A $1,000 civil penalty is deemed appropriate under the new sanction policy where Respondent attempted to bring an
unloaded firearm with accessible ammunition and two hunting knives on an aircraft.




In the Matter of Raymond B. Strohl, Order No. 94-6 (3/10/94).






Request for Hearing Construed to Cover Instant Case.

 Respondent's request for hearing, which technically covered only a separate civil penalty action, is construed
as a timely request for hearing in the instant case as well. Respondent did not apparently understand that there were
two civil penalty actions brought against him. His confusion was understandable, given that the notices and proposed
notices of proposed civil penalty in the two cases were so strikingly similar. Complainant is granted 30 days from
the date of service of this order to file a complaint.




In the Matter of Eric Hereth, Order No. 94-7 (3/10/94).






Untimely Complaint.

 Where the request for hearing and the final notice of proposed civil penalty were withdrawn, and a complaint was subsequently
filed without the withdrawn documents being reissued, the complaint was not untimely filed. The withdrawn request
for hearing and the final notice of proposed civil penalty were necessarily reactivated and refiled with the complaint,
or the complaint would have been null.



Jurisdictional Bar.

 An untimely complaint is not a jurisdictional bar to a civil penalty action. An untimely complaint may be excused upon
a finding of good cause.




In the Matter of Raul Nunez, Order No. 94-8 (3/10/94).






Failure to File Answer.

 Respondent did not show good cause for his failure to file an answer to the complaint. The law judge's dismissal of Respondent's
request for hearing is affirmed.




In the Matter of B&G Instruments, Order No. 94-9 (3/29/94).






Withdrawal of Appeal.

 Complainant withdrew its notice of appeal fom the initial decision. Complainant's appeal is dismissed.




In the Matter of John G. Boyle, Order No. 94-10 (3/29/94).






Withdrawal of Appeal.

 Complainant withdrew its notice of appeal fom the initial decision. Complainant's appeal is dismissed.

Commercial Reporting Services of the Administrator's Civil Penalty Decisions and Orders


In June 1991, as a public service, the FAA began releasing to commercial publishers the Administrator's decisions
and orders in civil penalty cases. The goal was to make these decisions and orders more accessible to the public. The
Administrator's decisions and orders in civil penalty cases are now available in the following commercial publications:



Avlex, published by Aviation Daily, 1156 15th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005, (202) 822-4669; and
Civil Penalty Cases Digest Service, published by Hawkins Publishing Company, Inc., P.O. Box 480, Mayo, MD 21106,
(410) 798-1677, and
Federal Aviation Decisions, Clark Boardman Callaghan, 50 Broad Street East, Rochester, NY 14694, (716) 546-1490.



The decisions and orders may be obtained on disk from Aviation Records, Inc., P.O. Box 172, Battle Ground, WA 98604,
(206) 896-0376. Aeroflight Publications, P.O. Box 854, 433 Main Street, Gruver, TX 79040, (806) 733-2483,
is placing the decisions of CD-ROM. Finally, the Administrator's decisions and orders in civil penalty cases are
available on the following computer databases: Compuserve; Fedix; and Genie.
The FAA has stated previously that publication of the subject-matter index and the digests may be discontinued once
a commercial reporting service publishes similar information in a timely and accurate manner. No decision has been
made yet on this matter, and for the time being, the FAA will continue to prepare and publish the subject-matter index
and digests.

I. Purpose and Substantive Description



A. Authority and Background 



(1) Authority 



(a) Section 802 of the Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) (42 USC 8011) created a new CHSP.


(b) Section 604 and 672 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 amended the CHSP. 

(c) A final common rule for the CHSP is published elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register

. 



(2) Background 



The CHSP was originally authorized and funded as a demonstration program under the Congregate Housing Services Act
of 1978 (1978 Act) (42 USC 8001). It provided congregate housing and coordinated supportive services for elderly
handicapped or non-elderly handicapped individuals to allow them to maintain their independence and avoid costly
and unnecessary institutionalization. Congress appropriated funds for Fiscal Years 1979 through 1982, to remain
available until expended. Since then, Congress has provided funds on an annual basis to continue funding grantees
that previously received assistance. The demonstration became a permanent program in 1987. 

Based upon the experience of the grantees funded under the demonstration, Congress created a new CHSP as one of the
components of NAHA, which was enacted on November 28, 1990 and amended in 1992. HUD, in coordination with the Farmers
Home Administration (FmHA) of the Department of Agriculture, administers the CHSP under a Common Rule in accordance
with the statute. This Notice announces the availability of both HUD and FmHA funds for the CHSP and invites applications
from both HUD and FmHA applicants.

<DOCNO> FR940429-2-00126 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940429-2-00089 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The CHSP is a program with two components: A retrofit and renovation component which has not yet been implemented and
a supportive services component. RETROFITTING AND RENOVATION OF FACILITIES ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING UNDER THIS
NOFA. 

Funds are available under the supportive services component for five-year, renewable, congregate services grants
for frail elderly persons, persons with disabilities, and temporarily disabled individuals living in eligible
housing for the elderly. The program serves as a means of preventing unnecessary institutionalization and encouraging
deinstitutionalization of those potentially eligible residents who do not need an institutionalized setting.
It also improves the capacity of management to assess the supportive service needs of eligible residents, and to either
ensure the coordination and delivery of supportive services from third party providers or provide the services directly
in order to meet the minimum needs of eligible residents. 

HUD and FmHA are interested in using the services funds in the most cost-efficient manner and with appropriate targeting.
Thus, a number of changes have been made from last year's program to increase efficiency, target the program more effectively
and attempt to make the limited funds available to more applicants. The major changes are to: 

(a) stress the service coordination/case management aspects of the program by making the service coordinator a clearly
mandated function, whether funded wholly or in part by CHSP, or funded by a third party; (The more coordinators that
are funded, the larger the number of projects whose residents will ultimately benefit from supportive services in
the community.) 

(b) target the available funds to meals and service coordination/case management and limit funds for additional
supportive services, by capping the amount of funds that an applicant may receive for other supportive services thus
allowing more potential grants; (Thus, an applicant may receive a maximum of $1,200/person/year in HUD funds for
supportive services other than case management/service coordination and the mandatory meals program.) 

(c) focus on projects nearly fully occupied this year. (Occupied projects more readily are able to plan programs for
existing needs and get them operational in the most effective manner and the shortest time. Thus, CHSP is offered this
year only to projects which are at least 85 percent occupied as of the date of the CHSP application to HUD.) 

Additionally, HUD and FmHA are clarifying the meals requirement. While the current requirement that each CHSP provide
at least one hot meal per day in a group setting for some or all of the participants who are assessed as needing such assistance
is not changed, additional meals can be available for frail elderly or non-elderly disabled participants who are
assessed with a need for them. Such additional meals can be either hot or cold and may be home delivered. 

The CHSP will ensure the long-term provision of supportive services in a manner which insures the program participant's
freedom of choice and which respects the dignity of the persons served. It will also provide readily available and
efficient services with emphasis on providing only those services minimally necessary to maintain independent
living, but maintaining a continuum of support for individual program participants over time. 



B. Allocation Amounts 



The Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations
Act, 1993 (P.L. 102-389) appropriated $21,000,000 in FY 1993. Approximately $14,500,000 of these funds remained
after the FY 1993 competition and the refunding of the 53 existing grantees for an additional 24 months. Additionally,
the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations
Act, 1994 (P.L. 103-124) made available $25,000,000 for the CHSP, all of which is included in the NOFA. Together
with the carryover funds, $39,500,000 is available for new grants. In consultation with FmHA, the dollars are allocated
as follows: 




_Approximately 20 percent ($7,900,000) of the total funds are available to applicants with FmHA projects. 

_The remainder, approximately 80 percent ($31,600,000) is for applicants with HUD projects. 



1. HUD Projects 



Applicants for HUD projects may apply for grants from the available $31,600,000. The formula for the HUD allocation
is stated below: 

a. Compute the total number of section 8 New Construction/substantial rehabilitation elderly, section 202, section
221(d) elderly, section 236 elderly and PIH/IHA elderly units in each Region for the nation as a whole. 

b. Calculate the proportion of the national total represented by each Region's share. 

c. Divide the available dollars proportionally in accordance with the Regional share of the elderly housing inventory,
as follows:

<PARENT> FR940429-2-00089 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



The funds for the CHSP will be awarded by HUD through 10 Regional competitions, in which applicants are selected to
receive supportive services grants by HUD. The funding process is further described in Section II. of this NOFA.


2. FmHA Projects


Applicants for FmHA projects may apply for grants from the available $7,900,000.
The funds for the CHSP will be awarded by FmHA through a national competition, in which applicants are selected to receive
supportive services grants by FmHA Headquarters. HUD will fund the grants, and administer them with FmHA assistance.
The funding process is further described in Section II. of this NOFA.


C. Eligibility


1. General


Applicants must submit applications for HUD projects to HUD field offices and applications for FmHA projects to FmHA
Headquarters and State offices. Applicants may apply for either HUD and/or FmHA dollars. Applications may only be

Projects submitted by eligible applicants under this NOFA are limited to eligible housing for the elderly, as defined
below.


2. Eligible Applicants


Eligible applicants are States, Indian Tribes, units of general local government, PHA/IHAs or local non-profit
housing sponsors as defined in 7 CFR 1944.252 and 24 CFR 700.105. Local non-profit housing sponsors and PHA/IHAs may
only apply on behalf of projects they own. For-profit owners of eligible housing for the elderly may not apply directly
for CHSP grants; the request must be submitted under an application by a State, Indian tribe or unit of general local
government (but NOT under an application submitted by a local non-profit sponsor or a PHA/IHA).


3. Eligible Housing Projects


Eligible projects under this NOFA must be eligible housing for the elderly as defined in 7 CFR 1944.252 and 24 CFR 700.105,
and must be 85 percent occupied as of the date of the application deadline for funding under this NOFA. For-profit owners
of eligible housing for the elderly may not apply directly for CHSP grants; the request may be submitted under an application
by a State, Indian tribe or unit of general local government (but NOT under an application submitted by a local non-profit
sponsor or a PHA/IHA).


4. Services Required by the CHSP


Each application must provide documentation that it will provide or is already providing the following required
services.

and,
b. A service coordinator to provide case management and other activities as required by section 700.220 and 225 or
1944.257 and 258 of the common rule.


5. Funding Limits


There is a limit on the amount of dollars HUD/FmHA will approve for supportive services 

other than case management/ service coordination and meals. 

This limit is $1,200 in HUD funds per person per year in FY 1994. (Costs for meals and case management/service coordination
are not capped, but follow normal market considerations for that jurisdiction.) The proposed amount for case management/service
coordination together with the capped amount for other services and a limited amount make up the 40 percent that HUD
will pay as its share of the grant.
THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FUNDS WHICH WILL BE GRANTED TO ANY ONE APPLICANT UNDER THIS NOFA is $2,000,000, subject to Section

C. Packaging of Applications 



Applications must be submitted on the basis of ``one application_one project''. A HUD PHA/IHA project is defined
either by number or by distinct building name; HUD Multifamily and FmHA projects are defined by a project number and/or
a Section 8 contract number. The applicant's portion of the application submission is ``Part A'' and the project's
portion of the application with project and program information is ``Part B.''

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940429-2-00130 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940429-2-00089 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

FmHA applicants must submit an original ``Part A and one or more Part Bs'' to FmHA Headquarters; A copy of each Part A
and Part B must be submitted to the appropriate FmHA State offices. 

An applicant submitting one application for one project only must submit one Part A and one Part B. (For example, the
Smalltown Housing and Redevelopment Authority submits one application for one project ``Pleasant Valley Towers''
to the HUD Omaha Field Office. That application must contain one Part A and one Part B.) 

Applicants submitting applications for multiple projects must submit a separate application for each project,
in each jurisdiction in which it is submitting applications. 

However, for multiple applications from the same applicant in the same jurisdiction, only one copy of Part A is submitted.
Thus, an applicant submitting three applications in one jurisdiction must submit one Part A and three Part Bs (e.g.,
the North Carolina Office on Aging is submitting three applications for three HUD projects to the HUD Greensboro office.
It submits one Part A to that office, with a Part B for each of the three separate projects.) 

However, if an applicant is submitting applications to more than one HUD Field office or FmHA State office or to both
HUD and FmHA, it must submit one ``Part A'' and the appropriate number of ``Part Bs'' in EACH jurisdiction. For example,
the Ohio Office of Aging is submitting two applications for two HUD projects to the Cleveland HUD Office, one application
for one HUD project to the Columbus HUD Office and one FmHA application to the FmHA Columbus State office. An original
Part A must be submitted to EACH of the three Offices, with two Part Bs to the Cleveland Office, one Part B to the HUD Columbus
office and one Part B to the FmHA Columbus Office. 

Each Part A and each Part B must be in separate folders. Each Part must be appropriately tabbed and numbered according
to the instructions in the Application Package. 



D. Submission of Applications 



1. Submission of Applications to HUD 



All applicants shall submit an original and THREE copies (a FAX copy of the application is NOT acceptable) of the CHSP
application to the Director of Housing Management in the HUD Field Office which has jurisdiction over the project
at the address noted in Attachment 1 of the NOFA by 3 p.m., Local Time, on or before July 13, 1994. In the case of IHAs, the
submission is to the Director of Housing Management in the HUD Field Office in which is located the Office of Native
American Programs which has jurisdiction over that project. The deadline date is firm as to date and hour. 

In the interest of fairness to all applicants requesting CHSP funds, HUD will treat as ineligible for consideration
any request which is received after the deadline. 

Applicants making requests for CHSP funds should take this practice into account and make early submission of their
materials to avoid any risk of lost eligibility brought about by unanticipated delivery-related problems. 

Applications received after the date and time stated herein will not be accepted, and will be returned to the applicant.


Each application package must be identified on the envelope or wrapper as follows: Director of Housing Management,
CHSP FY 1994 Application Package, Due by 3 p.m., Local Time July 13, 1994.

Determination whether an application is received in a timely manner is solely the responsibility of the receiving
HUD Field Office. 



2. Submission of Applications to FmHA 



All applicants shall submit an original and TWO copies (a FAX copy of the application is NOT acceptable) of the CHSP
application to FmHA Headquarters by 3 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, on or before July 13, 1994. The deadline date is
firm as to date and hour. The Address is: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Farmers Home Administration, ATTN: Sue M.
Harris-Green, South Building, room 5343, 14th and Independence Ave, SW., Washington, DC 20250. 

One copy of the application must also be submitted to the FmHA State office which has jurisdiction over the project.


In the interest of fairness to all applicants requesting CHSP funds, the FmHA will treat as ineligible for consideration
any request which is received by FmHA Headquarters after the deadline.

E. Eligibility Review 



HUD Field Office/FmHA State office staff will review 
all timely applications for eligibility. Both applicants and projects will be reviewed to determine that the applicant
entity and the project included in the application, if different, is eligible under the terms of this NOFA and the common
rule to participate in the FY 1994 CHSP. 

Applicants must submit a copy of their charter or other evidence of legal status and of their authority to run a CHSP,
or evidence of non-profit status as a local non-profit housing sponsor, as appropriate. Applicants that are applying
as local non-profit housing sponsors or PHA/IHAs must ALSO submit proof of ownership of the project submitted in the
application. 

Applicants must also submit proof of project eligibility, as shown by a copy of the regulatory agreement, the HAP contract,
or other document which shows the project's legal identity. 

All proofs of eligibility or ownership must be legally signed and dated on or before the application deadline. 

Eligibility will also include determination that the application was submitted to the appropriate HUD or FmHA office.


Applicants and/or projects which are not eligible or have been submitted to the incorrect HUD field office/FmHA State
office will be rejected and so notified by the appropriate office at this time. Applications which pass eligibility
review will proceed to threshold/technical deficiency review. If eligibility material is missing, it will be treated
as a deficiency, subject to sections II.F(4) and III below. 



F. Threshold and Technical Deficiency Review 



1. General. HUD Field Offices/FmHA Headquarters staff will review applications for threshold and technical acceptability
concurrently. 

2. First, each application will be checked for completeness. Any application missing three or more exhibits other
than certifications will be rejected by the HUD Field Office/FmHA Headquarters, with the applicant being notified.


3. Second, the applications will be checked for threshold eligibility. During this review, an applicant (or project
in the case of an application from a governmental jurisdiction) will be rejected if: 

a. The project is not 85 percent occupied; 

b. It has not met the match requirement (i.e., there is a lack of clear and documented evidence of at least a 
50 percent eligible match for the supportive services from the applicant or project owners, or from third party providers,
for the first year of the five-year grant).

<DOCNO> FR940429-2-00132 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940429-2-00089 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Indicators of clear and documented evidence are: 
(i) There is a separate match letter on letterhead of the provider from each provider of match; 
(ii) Match letters show committed dollar levels at least equal to the dollar level in the first year budget; 
(iii) The match items provided are firm commitments not contingent upon any other action (e.g., state or county legislation,
board of directors or local county legislation/approval); and 
(iv) For match other than in-kind, the required certification for new or expanded services is included. 

c. It has not submitted a participant fee-collection plan that proposes to collect at least 10 percent of the cost of
the CHSP (up to 20 percent of adjusted incomes or the cost of providing the services, whichever is less). 

d. The proposal includes a retrofit or renovation component in the budget subject to section 802(a)(2) of the Act.


e. The meals program does not provide at least one hot meal a day in a group setting SEVEN

 days a week, for some or all of the participants. (The meals program may be an existing program; it may be funded fully
or in part with funds 

other

 than the CHSP.) 

f. A service coordinator is NOT included as 
part of the services program. (The coordinator may be paid fully or in part from funds other than the CHSP.) 

g. There is:

 


_A pending civil rights suit against the applicant (or project owner, if different) brought by the Department of Justice;


_An outstanding finding of non-compliance as a result of formal administrative proceedings under any of the statutes,
regulations, or other requirements listed in the civil rights certification, unless the applicant is operating
under a HUD-approved compliance agreement designed to correct the area(s) of noncompliance, or, in cases of noncompliance
with state or local statutes, regulations or other requirements, is operating under a compliance agreement approved
by the appropriate state or local agency designed to correct the area(s) of non-compliance. 

_A charge issued by the Secretary concerned against the applicant (or project owner, if different) under Section
810(g) of the Fair Housing Act as implemented by 24 CFR 103.400. 

_A pending denial of application processing by HUD or by FmHA under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, under the
Attorney General's guidelines (28 CFR 50.3), or the HUD Title VI regulations (24 CFR 1.8) and procedures (HUD Handbook
8040.1), or under Section 504 of the rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the HUD Section 504 regulations (24 CFR 8.57); or,


_An adjudication adverse to the applicant (or the project owner, if different) of a civil rights violation in a civil
action brought against it under any of the statutes, regulations or other requirements listed in the civil rights
certification, unless the sponsor is operating in compliance with a court order designed to correct the area(s) of
noncompliance. 




h. There exist serious, unaddressed or outstanding Inspector General audit findings or HUD Headquarters/Field
Office/FmHA State Office Management monitoring review findings for any of the applicant's (or project's, if different)
ongoing management operations or in connection with its administration of existing grants; 

i. There exist serious, unaddressed or 
outstanding Inspector General audit findings or HUD Headquarters/Field Office/FmHA State Office FH&EO monitoring
review findings for any of the applicant's (or project's, if different) ongoing management operations or in connection
with its administration of existing grants; or, 

j. The applicant (or project owner, if different) is involved with litigation which could seriously jeopardize its
ability to administer the CHSP. 

If an applicant (or project within an application) is determined to be the subject of a rejection on the basis of one
or more of the above criteria, the HUD field office or FmHA Headquarters staff shall reject the application; the review
cannot be completed nor the application scored. 

If the applicant agency is a governmental jurisdiction supporting one or more projects in multiple applications
and the applicant agency is rejected, all projects submitted by that applicant agency will be disqualified. However,
any individual project may be rejected without disqualifying the applicant agency, if a different legal entity.


All applicants whose application(s) have been rejected by HUD field offices or FmHA Headquarters will be notified
that they have been rejected, in writing, at the time the decision to reject is made. 

4. Third, applicants will be reviewed for technical completeness (deficiency review). 

During the technical review process, if HUD or FmHA determines that an application is missing up to two exhibits (other
than certifications), or has certain technical deficiencies, the applicant will be given 14 calendar days from the
date of written notification in which to correct such deficiencies. 

The purpose of this process is to assist an applicant in completing a fundable proposal, and not to provide an opportunity
for an application to be substantively improved, once it has been submitted. Curable, technical deficiencies relate
to submission of a limited number of missing items, submission of items that are not necessary for HUD review under
threshold review or selection criteria/ranking factors, e.g., a missing certification, inadvertent blank spot
in certain forms and certifications or missing signature; substantive items for which information exists elsewhere
in the application showing that the items have been created (e.g., an annual first year budget summary is missing,
but there are sufficient program budgets to determine what the annual budget is; or revision of match letters to include
missing data, when the amount of resources is clearly indicated); or, missing match letters in certain instances
(see next paragraph). 

Submission of missing items or correction of technical deficiencies does not allow additional time to complete,
amend or correct the application to overcome any substantive defects in the original submission. Thus, missing match
letters, or corrected match letters adding the required certification of new or expanded qualifying resources must
be submitted together with proof that the match was available to the applicant on or before the application deadline
(e.g., copy of dated Board resolution approving the allocation of the match dollars). Also, missing documents dealing
with applicant or project eligibility (e.g., articles of incorporation) must be dated on or before the application
deadline date. 

The HUD Field Office or FmHA Headquarters will request documents as necessary to correct technical deficiencies
in any CHSP application. (A FAX copy of an original document may NOT be submitted to meet any technical deficiency correction
request.) A response to a letter request from HUD or FmHA to an applicant for correction of technical deficiencies
must be received by the requesting HUD Field Office/FmHA Headquarters, by 3 p.m., Local Time on the 14th calendar day
following the date on the request letter to the applicant. This means (for example) that if the deficiency letter to
the applicant is dated June 15, 1994, the response must be received by 3 p.m., Local Time, in the HUD Field Office or FmHA
Headquarters on June 29, 1994. Information provided after 3 p.m. on the fourteenth day of the correction period will
be rejected as non-responsive. In any such situation, the application, or the appropriate project, will be rejected.


All applicants are encouraged to review the Table of Contents provided in the application package. The Table of Contents
identifies all technical exhibits needed for application processing. Filling in the appropriate page number indicates
that the exhibit has been prepared. 

5. HUD/FmHA reserves the right to reduce the amount of funding requested in any application. Examples of reasons to
reduce initial funding requests during HUD Field office/FmHA Headquarters review include, but are not limited to:
(a) activities proposed in any project are not eligible or not approved by HUD or FmHA; (b) HUD or FmHA determines that
the cost of any particular component of a proposed program is more than necessary to make the activity feasible; and,
(c) the cost of the grant is reduced to meet the funding limits of Section I.C(5). 

Reductions may take place in the Field offices as part of the review process. 

6. Once threshold and technical reviews have been completed, HUD Field offices, or the FmHA Headquarters (as appropriate)
will score all selection criteria. 

HUD Field offices will send preliminary scores and full reports to the HUD Regional offices. The Regional offices
will: (a) Review all materials and preliminary ratings for accuracy and conformance to program policy; (b) make corrections,
if necessary; (c) integrate the Field Office recommendations; (d) do final rating and ranking; and, (e) select projects.


Within each HUD Regional allocation and the FmHA Headquarters allocation, applications will be rank-ordered by
score.

G. Final Selection 



1. General 



HUD recognizes that the Regional role stated herein may have to be modified later in the fiscal year, depending on the
reorganization and the manner in which the transition to the Field organization takes place. If necessary there will
be appropriate notification to the procedures stated in this Notice. 

All eligible applications, other than those noted as rejects, will be rank-ordered by score in either the FmHA Headquarters
or each HUD Regional Office. 



2. Final Reductions in Funding Within Applications 



HUD/FmHA reserves the right to additionally reduce the amount of funding requested in any application at time of selection
to reduce the cost of the grant to meet the funding limits of section I.C(5). 

Reductions may also take place after selection and announcement of award, as part of final negotiations. 



3. Ranking of Projects 



a. 

Ranking of FmHA Projects.

 FmHA Headquarters will select applicants by rank-order until all CHSP funds allocated have been exhausted. If there
is more than one unfunded application at the next-highest score (in a tie) and there are insufficient funds to cover
both, funding will be decided subject to section II.F.4, below. Further selections will be made until any residual
funds are insufficient to fund another FmHA project. 

If there is a residual amount after all eligible applications in rank order are funded, the next application(s) on
the list which contain funding requests above the level of the residual may be skipped over to reach a fundable project
lower down on the list which is within the level of the residual amount. The first remaining fundable but unfunded project
on the list which is within the residual limit must be funded, as well as any subsequent projects which are still within
any remaining residual. 

If funds remain available after ranking all the approvable FmHA projects, these funds will be utilized by HUD Headquarters
for reallocation to HUD projects which were approvable but unfunded (see subsection II.G(3)(b), below). The FmHA
Headquarters reserves the right to reduce any proposed amount of CHSP funds requested. 

b. 

Ranking of HUD projects.

 HUD will select applicants in rank-order in each Region until the funds allotted to that Region are exhausted. 

If there is more than one unfunded application at the next-highest score (in a tie) and there are insufficient funds
to cover both, funding will be decided subject to section II.G.4, below. Further selections will be made until any
residual funds are insufficient to fund another HUD project. 

If there is a residual amount after most eligible applications are funded in rank order, the next application(s) on
the list which contain funding requests above the level of the residual may be skipped over to reach a fundable project
lower down on the list which is within the level of the residual amount. The first remaining fundable but unfunded project
on the list which is within the residual limit must be funded, as well as any subsequent projects which are still within
any remaining residual. 

Regions (and FmHA) will return any excess funds to Headquarters. Headquarters will integrate by score order all approvable
but not funded applications sent in from Regions in which there were too many projects to fund from within the Regional
allocation. Headquarters will then fund additional projects in rank order from this score ranking using residual
funds, consistent with section II.G(4), below. 

If there are insufficient fundable applications, any excess funds will be made available to approvable but unfunded
FmHA applicants. 



4. Tie Scores 



In the event of a tie score among the last-to-be-considered applications in either FmHA Headquarters or in a HUD Regional
allocation, the application that scores higher on Selection Criteria Numbers b, f, g, and i will be selected, if that
application is within the limits of the remaining dollars or can be so modified. If there is still a tie score among two
or more applications, one of the tied applications will be selected by lottery. 



5. Multi-Project Grants 



HUD and FmHA reserve the right to aggregate into one grant award multiple applications from a single applicant in any
jurisdiction. 



6. Self-Monitoring 



HUD and FmHA reserve the right to require self-monitoring of those applications approved for States, Indian tribes
and units of general local government (NOT PHA/IHAs). In such cases, HUD/FmHA will add an amount equal to one percent
of the total HUD grant approved, for monitoring costs, under which certain responsibilities will be delegated to
that agency subject to 24 CFR 700.325 or 7 CFR 1944.270. As this is a HUD or FmHA-directed add-on, it may bring the total
award granted to more than the limit stated in section I.C(5). 



7. Excess Funds 



In the event that funds still remain after completion of the selection process, such funds will be allotted to the HUD
Headquarters Reserve Fund, subject to section 700.405 of the Joint Common Rule. 



H. Awarding of Grants 



Once selections are made, the HUD Field Office, or FmHA Headquarters, as appropriate, will negotiate the final amount
of the grant with the selected applicant. Once agreement is reached on all issues, a grant award will be prepared and
sent to the HUD or FmHA applicant for signature. Once the signed grant award is returned to HUD, it will be executed by
an appropriate HUD Official. 

If an applicant cannot complete negotiations so that a grant can be executed before September 30, 1994, 

and

 the reserved dollars revert to the Treasury, the grant award may be canceled. 



III. Checklist of Application Submission Requirements 



The checklist specifies the required information that must be submitted as part of an application, and identifies
those materials necessary to pass eligibility and threshold requirements. Other items including forms and certifications
may be corrected during the technical deficiency correction period, subject to section II.F(4) of this Notice. 


The Checklist is the Table of Contents in the application package; the check is done by filling in the appropriate application
page number in the blank space. 



IV. Other Matters 



A. Environmental Impact 



A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332).
The Finding is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket
Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, room 10276, 451 Seventh Street,
SW., Washington, DC 20410. 



B. Family Executive Order 



The General Counsel of HUD, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, 

The Family

, has determined that the policies contained in this NOFA will have some significant impact on the maintenance and
general well-being of families. The revised CHSP can be expected to provide supportive services which can prevent
or postpone unnecessary or premature institutionalization, and reduce unnecessary stress and financial burdens
on participants' families by allowing them to remain in their apartments. Because the impact on family concerns is
wholly beneficial, no further review under the executive order is considered necessary. 



C. Federalism Executive Order 



The General Counsel of HUD, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of the Executive Order 12612, 

Federalism

, has determined that the policies contained in this NOFA do not have Federalism implications, and, thus, are not subject
to review under the order. These guidelines are limited to providing the procedures under which HUD would make rental
assistance available to applicants under a program designed to provide housing assistance and supportive services
to frail elderly individuals. The program involves intergovernmental cooperation, but in no manner will involve
federal incursion upon local or state decision making, or the administration of local or state law. 



D. Section 102 of the HUD Reform Act_Accountability in the Provision of HUD Assistance 



1. Documentation and Public Access 






</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940429-2-00134 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940429-2-00089 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this
NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including
any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than
thirty days after the award for assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients
of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly 

Federal Register

 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b) and the
notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942) for further information on these requirements.) 



2. Disclosures 



HUD will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (Form HUD-2880) submitted
in connection with this NOFA. Update reports (also Form HUD-2880) will be made available along with the applicants'
disclosure reports, but in no case for a period of less than three years. All reports_both applicant disclosures and
updates_will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (95 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing
regulations at 24 CFR part 15. (See 24 CFR, subpart C, and the notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942) for further information on disclosure requirements.) 



3. Subsidy-Layering Determinations 



24 CFR 12.52 requires HUD to certify that the amount of HUD assistance is not more than necessary to make the assisted
activity feasible after taking into account other government assistance. HUD will make the decision with respect
to each certification available free of charge, for a three-year period. (See the notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942) and the guidelines published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 25, 1994 (59 FR 9332) for further information on this certification.) Additional information about applications,
HUD certifications and assistance adjustments, both before assistance is provided or subsequently, are to be made
under the Freedom of Information Act (24 CFR part 15). 



E. Section 103 of the HUD Reform Act_Prohibition of Advance Disclosures of Funding Decisions



HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the Reform Act was published on May 13, 1991 (56 FR 22088) and became effective
on June 12, 1991. That regulation, codified as 24 CFR part 4, applies to the funding competition announced today. The
requirements of the rule continue to apply until the announcement of the selection of successful applicants. Also,
refer to (58 FR 61016), a final rule amending part 4 regarding the regulations of certain conduct by HUD employees and
by applicants for HUD assistance during the selection process for the award of financial assistance by HUD. 

HUD and FmHA employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are restrained
by part 4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD or FmHA) concerning
funding decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for
assistance in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR part 4.


Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics, (202) 708-3815. (This is not a toll-free
number.) The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well. However, a HUD
or FmHA employee who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can be discussed with
persons outside the Department, should contact his or her Regional or Field Office Counsel, or Headquarters Counsel
for the program to which the question pertains. 



F. Section 112 of the HUD Reform Act 



Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (section 112 of the Reform Act) contains two provisions
dealing with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure
requirements on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance
or the taking of a management action by the Department 

and

 those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence
the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of
assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. 

Section 13 was implemented by final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 17, 1991 (56 FR 22912), as 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in
these ways, they are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of the rule. 

Any questions regarding the rule should be directed to: Acting Director, Office of Ethics, room 2158, Department
of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410. Telephone: (202) 708-3815;
TDD: (202) 708-1112. (These are not toll-free numbers.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be
obtained from the local HUD office. 



G. Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities



The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) and
the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of Federal contracts, grants,
or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the Federal Government
in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding of contracts, grants,
cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification regarding lobbying.
Under 24 CFR part 87 and 7 CFR part 1944, subpart G, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding
$100,000 must certify that no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the
assistance. 

Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs) established by an Indian tribe as a result of the exercise of the tribe's sovereign
power are excluded from coverage of the Byrd Amendment, but IHAs established under State law are not excluded from
the statute's coverage. 

IHAs established by an Indian tribe as a result of the tribe's sovereign power are excluded from coverage of the Byrd
Amendment, but IHAs established under State law are 

not

 excluded from the statute's coverage. 



Required Reporting 



A certification is required at the time application for funds is made that federally appropriated funds are not being
or have not been used in violation of section 319 and the 

disclosure

 will be made of payments for lobbying with other than federally appropriated funds. Also, there is a standard disclosure
form, SF-LLL, ``Disclosure Form to Report Lobbying'', which must be used to disclose lobbying with other than
federally appropriated funds at the time of application.

Public Reporting Burden 


The information collection requirements contained in this NOFA have been submitted to the Office of Management and
Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520). The Department has determined that
the following provisions contain information collection requirements. 


Revised Congregate Services Housing Program



14 responses are estimated from each respondent.

5.10 hours is the estimated average response time for each respondent per response.

Total Respondents time is 9,675.

Estimate of cost to the respondents is $15.00 per hour.

Total respondents time @ $15/hour=9675 x $15=$145,125.
