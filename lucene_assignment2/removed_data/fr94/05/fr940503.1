 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) proposes to amend its regulations governing mutual to stock conversions and
stock issuances by savings association subsidiaries of mutual holding companies (MHC stock offerings). The proposed
amendment requires the OTS, in connection with its review of conversion applications and MHC stock offering applications,
to consider the extent to which the transaction will affect the convenience and needs of the communities to be served
by the applicant. Under the proposal, in determining whether to approve these types of applications, the OTS will
consider the applicant's record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and other factors relating
to the convenience and needs of the communities served by the applicant.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


Background 




The OTS recently has undertaken a comprehensive review of its conversion regulations. By Order No. 94-48, dated
April 7, 1994, the OTS adopted significant amendments to its mutual to stock conversion regulations, 12 CFR part 563b,
and mutual holding company regulations, 12 CFR part 575, to revise, update and clarify the regulations in a number
of areas. In connection with its review of the conversion regulations, one of the issues the OTS considered was whether
the convenience and needs of the local communities should be a factor in determining whether to approve these conversions.



The reasons for mutual associations' conversion to stock form have changed over the years. During the 1980s, most
mutual savings associations were marginally capitalized and many were insolvent. During this period, conversion
transactions were a primary method for undercapitalized savings associations to raise capital and avoid being closed
by the regulators. The conversion enabled an association to stay in business and continue to serve the community's
credit needs.

Now, however, most mutual associations are healthy. While a relatively small number of capital deficient mutual
associations undertake conversions primarily to recapitalize, most healthy mutual thrifts now convert for other
reasons. These reasons include financing the expansion of their operations and taking advantage of the benefits
available to a public company, such as the ability to establish stock benefit plans for management and employees.

The OTS is aware that account holders and consumer groups recently have voiced significant concerns regarding the
conversion of well-capitalized associations, particularly in light of the compensation and stock benefits that
management typically receives in such transactions. Such groups also have expressed concerns regarding the proper
deployment of conversion proceeds, 

i.e.

, the extent to which the capital raised in such transactions should be used to support credit and loan programs and
related services tailored to the community's credit needs. In addition, management of many well-capitalized converting
associations recently have expressed concern to the OTS that their institutions do not need_or are unable efficiently
to deploy_substantial amounts of the capital required to be raised under current regulations.
 Managers of such associations also have voiced concern about the negative impact of what they view as ``excess capital''
on the price/earnings ratio of the converted association's stock. 





The OTS is responding to these concerns by issuing an interim final regulation that, among other things, restricts
management benefit plans and requires converting institutions to file with the OTS a business plan that adequately
addresses the deployment of conversion proceeds.
 The interim rule, which appears elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, solicits public comment on the conversion regulations, both as to the amendments adopted there and the issues on
which comment is specifically sought, and as to any other current provisions of the conversion regulations as they
relate to the interim rule. 





As noted in the interim final rule, a convenience and needs standard has not, to date, been applied to mutual stock conversions
of savings associations. Similarly, a convenience and needs standard generally has not been applied to MHC stock
offerings.
 Upon review of this area, however, the OTS is proposing to apply a convenience and needs standard to these transactions
for the reasons discussed below. 





First, the OTS has broad authority under sections 5(i)(1) and 5(i)(2) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (HOLA) to regulate
mutual to stock conversions by savings associations, and under section 10(o)(7) of the HOLA to regulate mutual holding
companies.
 These authorities give the agency considerable discretion in reviewing a conversion application or MHC stock offering
application. For example, the OTS has exercised this authority to determine whether a transaction is in the best interests
of depositors, the association and the Savings Association Insurance Fund.
 The OTS believes that inherent in this broad grant of authority is the ability to assess the impact of a proposed transaction
on the convenience and needs of the communities to be served by a savings association. 






Second, section 4(a)(3) of the HOLA supports the adoption of the proposed regulations addressing housing credit
needs.
 Section 4(a)(3) of the HOLA provides that the Director ``shall exercise all powers granted to the Director under this
chapter so as to encourage savings associations to provide credit for housing safely and soundly.'' The powers granted
to the Director include the general regulatory authority under sections 5(i)(1), 5(i)(2), and 10(o)(7) of the HOLA
mentioned above. Because savings associations are predominantly housing lenders, the admonition in section 4(a)(3)
of the HOLA that the Director use his or her statutory powers to encourage savings associations to provide credit for
housing provides a substantial additional basis for the Director to assess community needs when reviewing applications.






Third, the OTS believes it is appropriate to apply a convenience and needs standard to conversion transactions and
MHC stock offerings as a part of the OTS's responsibility to consider the ongoing CRA performance of savings associations.
The CRA expresses Congress's judgment that regulated financial institutions must demonstrate that their deposit
facilities serve the convenience and needs of the communities in which they are chartered to do business and that regulated
financial institutions have continuing and affirmative obligations to help meet the credit needs of those local
communities.

In this regard, the federal banking agencies recently conducted a comprehensive review of their CRA regulations
in order to provide clearer guidance to financial institutions on the nature and extent of their CRA obligations,
the methods by which their performance will be assessed, and the manner in which the CRA will be enforced. This review
was undertaken in response to the President's July 1993 request that the federal financial institution supervisory
agencies reform the CRA examination and enforcement system. The President asked, among other things, that in undertaking
this effort, the regulators seek to promote consistency and even-handedness, to improve CRA performance evaluations
and to institute more effective sanctions against institutions with consistently poor CRA performance.
 The addition of a convenience and needs factor to the mutual to stock conversion standards and the standards for MHC
stock offerings is wholly consistent with the larger Presidential and regulatory initiatives on the CRA.
 The OTS's assessment of the CRA performance record of each association that is subject to the regulations promulgated
under sections 5(i) and 10(o) of the HOLA furthers its responsibility under section 4(a)(3) of the HOLA to encourage
thrifts to provide housing credit safely and soundly.
 







The proposed convenience and needs standard, like the convenience and needs standards governing transactions subject
to the Bank Merger Act,
 certain holding company applications,
 and certain non-routine corporate transactions under current OTS regulations,
 is intended to encourage savings associations to devote their resources to lending programs and related customer
services that are designed to address the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income
communities, consistent with safety and soundness. Such programs and services are an integral part of a mutual association's
traditional role of providing ``credit for housing,'' as envisioned by section 4(a)(3) of the HOLA. Thus, the OTS
believes the proposed regulations will enhance the OTS's ability to ensure that savings associations undertaking
these transactions recognize their responsibility to consider their community's credit needs. 







Proposed Amendments 



The proposal would add a new  563b.11 to the OTS conversion regulations that would require the OTS, in reviewing
a conversion application, to examine the extent to which the proposed conversion will affect the convenience and
needs of the communities to be served by the converted savings association. 

As part of this examination, the OTS will review the applicant's record under the CRA regulations at 12 CFR part 563e
and related CRA policies. Under the proposal, the OTS would give substantial weight to an applicant's previous CRA
record, consistent with the long-standing policy of the OTS.
 For example, if an applicant in its most recent CRA examination received a rating of ``substantial noncompliance,''
 the OTS likely would not approve the application.

<TEXT>
 

Under the proposal, the OTS also would scrutinize the business plans of the applicant. Applicants must demonstrate
that their plans for deployment of proceeds will help meet the credit and lending needs of the communities served by
the applicant. Under the proposed convenience and needs standard, where an applicant's business plan does not adequately
address this issue, the OTS may deny the application or impose additional conditions of approval. While commitments
in an applicant's business plan to allocate resources to community development projects or credit-related programs
generally indicate responsiveness to the convenience and needs of the community, the OTS will not necessarily view
such commitments as remedying CRA-related deficiencies. Performance under those commitments, however, would
be considered in evaluating the association's CRA record. The OTS also will consider other relevant factors relating
to the association's performance in meeting the convenience and needs of the community. 

The proposal also would add a new  575.7(a)(7) to the OTS's mutual holding company regulations, and renumber
current  575.7(a)(7) as 575.7(a)(8). The proposed new section would set forth an additional approval requirement
for stock issuances by a savings association subsidiary of a mutual holding company, requiring that the transaction
meet the convenience and needs standard of proposed  563b.11. 



Solicitation of Comments 



The OTS solicits comment on all aspects of the proposed regulations. The OTS particularly invites comments on whether
the proceeds from conversions or MHC stock offerings should be directed to specific types of activities and, if so,
what portion should be used for what types of activities. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is certified that this proposal will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not
required. 



Executive Order 12866 



The OTS has determined that this rule does not constitute a ``significant regulatory action'' for purposes of Executive
Order 12866.

Special Conditions: Learjet Inc., Model 45 Airplane, Lightning and High-Intensity Radiated Fields


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed special conditions.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document proposes special conditions for the Learjet Inc. (Lear) Model 45 airplane. This new airplane will utilize
new avionics/electronic systems that provide critical data to the flightcrew. The applicable regulations do not
contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the protection of these systems from the effects of lightning
and high-intensity radiated fields. These proposed special conditions contain the additional safety standards
that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing
airworthiness standards.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Comments Invited


Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of these proposed special conditions by submitting such
written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the regulatory docket or notice
number and be submitted in duplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the
closing date for comments will be considered by the Administrator before further rulemaking action is taken on these
proposals. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of comments received. All comments submitted
will be available in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons, both before and after the closing date
for comments. A report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA personnel concerning this rulemaking
will be filed in the docket. Persons wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response
to this notice must submit with those comments a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement
is made: ``Comments to Docket No. NM-95.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.


Background


On January 27, 1992, Learjet Inc. (Lear), 8220 West Harry Street, Wichita, KS 67209-2942, P.O. Box 7707, Wichita,
KS 67277-7707, applied for a new type certificate in the transport airplane category for the Model 45 airplane.
The Learjet Model 45 is a T-tail, low wing, medium sized business jet powered by two Garrett TFE 731-20 turbofan
engines mounted on pylons extending from the aft fuselage. Each engine will be capable of delivering 3,500 lbs. thrust
(3,650 lbs. thrust with auto performance reserve). The airplane will be capable of operating with two flight crewmembers
and a maximum of ten passengers (standard is eight passengers).


Type Certification Basis


Under the provisions of  21.17 of the FAR, Learjet must show, except as provided in  25.2, that the Model
45 meets the applicable provisions of part 25, effective February 1, 1965, as amended by Amendments 25-1 through
25-75. In addition, the proposed certification basis for the Model 45 includes part 34, effective September
10, 1990, plus any amendments in effect at the time of certification; and part 36, effective December 1, 1969, as amended
by Amendments 36-1 through the amendment in effect at the time of certification. The special conditions that
may be developed as a result of this notice will form an additional part of the type certification basis. In addition,
the certification basis may include other special conditions that are not relevant to these proposed special conditions.
If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25, as amended) do not contain
adequate or appropriate safety standards for the Learjet Model 45 because of a novel or unusual design feature, special
conditions are prescribed under the provisions of  21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established
in the regulations.
Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with  11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as
required by   11.28 and 11.29, and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with  21.17(a)(2).
Special conditions are initially applicable to the model for which they are issued. Should the type certificate for
that model be amended later to include any other model that incorporates the same novel or unusual design feature,
or should any other model already included on the same type certificate be modified to incorporate the same novel or
unusual design feature, the special conditions would also apply to the other model under the provisions of  21.101(a)(1).

Novel or Unusual Design Features



The Model 45 incorporates new avionic/electronic installations, including primary flight displays, an electronically
controlled braking system, digital electronic engine controls, an engine indication and crew alerting system (EICAS),
multifunction display, and a digital autopilot/flight director system. These systems may be vulnerable to lightning
and high-intensity radiated fields external to the airplane.



Discussion



The existing lightning protection airworthiness certification requirements are insufficient to provide an acceptable
level of safety with new technology avionic and electronic systems. There are two regulations that specifically
pertain to lightning protection: one for the airframe in general ( 25.581), and the other for fuel system protection
( 25.954). There are, however, no regulations that deal specifically with protection of electrical and electronic
systems from lightning. The loss of a critical function of these systems due to lightning would prevent continued
safe flight and landing of the airplane. Although the loss of an essential function would not prevent continued safe
flight and landing, it could significantly impact the safety level of the airplane.

There is also no specific regulation that addresses protection requirements for electrical and electronic systems
from HIRF. Increased power levels from ground based radio transmitters and the growing use of sensitive electrical
and electronic systems to command and control airplanes have made it necessary to provide adequate protection.

To ensure that a level of safety is achieved equivalent to that intended by the regulations incorporated by reference,
special conditions are proposed for the Lear Model 45, which would require that new technology electrical and electronic
systems be designed and installed to preclude component damage and interruption of function due to both the direct
and indirect effects of lightning and HIRF.



Lightning



To provide a means of compliance with these proposed special conditions, clarification of the threat definition
of lightning is needed. The following ``threat definition,'' based on FAA Advisory Circular 20-136, Protection
of Aircraft Electrical/Electronics Systems Against the Indirect Effects of Lightning, dated March 5, 1990, is proposed
as a basis to use in demonstrating compliance with the lightning protection special condition, with the exception
of the multiple burst environment, which has been changed to agree with the latest recommendation from the Society
of Automotive Engineers (SAE) AE4L lightning committee.

The lightning current waveforms (Components A, D, and H) defined below, along with the voltage waveforms in AC 20-53A,
will provide a consistent and reasonable standard that is acceptable for use in evaluating the effects of lightning
on the airplane. These waveforms depict threats that are external to the airplane. The effect of these threats on the
airplane and its systems depends upon several factors, including installation configuration, materials, shielding,
airplane geometry, etc. Therefore, test (including tests on the completed airplane or an adequate simulation) and/or
verified analyses need to be conducted in order to obtain the resultant internal threat to the installed systems.
The electronic systems may then be evaluated with this internal threat in order to determine their susceptibility
to upset and/or malfunction.

To evaluate the induced effects to these systems, three considerations are required:

1. 

First Return Stroke:

 (Severe Strike_Component A, or Restrike-Component D). This external threat needs to be evaluated to obtain the resultant
internal threat and to verify that the level of the induced currents and voltages is sufficiently below the equipment
``hardness'' level.

2. 

Multiple Stroke Flash:

 (1/2 Component D). A lightning strike is often composed of a number of successive strokes, referred to as multiple
strokes. Although multiple strokes are not necessarily a salient factor in a damage assessment, they can be the primary
factor in a system upset analysis. Multiple strokes can induce a sequence of transients over an extended period of
time. While a single event upset of input/output signals may not affect system performance, multiple signal upsets
over an extended period of time (2 seconds) may affect the systems under consideration. Repetitive pulse testing
and/or analysis needs to be carried out in response to the multiple stroke environment to demonstrate that the system
response meets the safety objective. This external multiple stroke environment consists of 24 pulses and is described
as a single Component A followed by 23 randomly spaced restrikes of 1/2 magnitude of Component D (peak amplitude of
50,000 amps). The 23 restrikes are distributed over a period of up to 2 seconds according to the following constraints:
(1) The minimum time between subsequent strokes is 10ms, and (2) the maximum time between subsequent strokes is 200ms.
An analysis or test needs to be accomplished in order to obtain the resultant internal threat environment for the system
under evaluation.

3. 

Multiple Burst:

 (Component H). In-flight data gathering projects have shown bursts of multiple, low amplitude, fast rates of rise,
short duration pulses accompanying the airplane lightning strike process. While insufficient energy exists in
these pulses to cause physical damage, it is possible that transients resulting from this environment may cause upset
to some digital processing systems.

The representation of this interference environment is a repetition of short duration, low amplitude, high peak
rate of rise, double exponential pulses that represent the multiple bursts of current pulses observed in these flight
data gathering projects. This component is intended for an analytical (or test) assessment of functional upset of
the system. Again, it is necessary that this component be translated into an internal environmental threat in order
to be used. This ``Multiple Burst'' consists of repetitive Component H waveforms in 3 sets of 20 pulses each. The minimum
time between individual Component H pulses within a burst is 50 microseconds, the maximum is 1,000 microseconds.
The 3 bursts are distributed according to the following constraints: (1) The minimum period between bursts is 30ms,
and (2) the maximum period between bursts is 300ms. The individual ``Multiple Burst'' Component H waveform is defined
below.

The following current waveforms constitute the ``Severe Strike'' (Component A), ``Restrike'' (Component D), ``Multiple
Stroke'' (1/2 Component D), and the ``Multiple Burst'' (Component H).

These components are defined by the following double exponential equation:




i(t)=I

High-Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF)



With the trend toward increased power levels from ground based transmitters, plus the advent of space and satellite
communications, coupled with electronic command and control of the airplane, the immunity of critical digital avionics
systems to HIRF must be established.

It is not possible to precisely define the HIRF to which the airplane will be exposed in service. There is also uncertainty
concerning the effectiveness of airframe shielding for HIRF. Furthermore, coupling of electromagnetic energy
to cockpit-installed equipment through the cockpit window apertures is undefined. Based on surveys and analysis
of existing HIRF emitters, an adequate level of protection exists when compliance with the HIRF protection special
condition is shown with either paragraphs 1 or 2 below:

1. A minimum threat of 100 volts per meter peak electric field strength from 10 KHz to 18 GHz.
a. The threat must be applied to the system elements and their associated wiring harnesses without the benefit of airframe
shielding.

b. Demonstration of this level of protection is established through system tests and analysis.

2. A threat external to the airframe of the following field strengths for the frequency ranges indicated.






The envelope given in paragraph 2 above is a revision to the envelope used in previously issued special conditions
in other certification projects. It is based on new data and SAE AE4R subcommittee recommendations. This revised
envelope includes data from Western Europe and the U.S.

As discussed above, the proposed special conditions would be applicable initially to the Learjet Model 45. Should
Learjet apply at a later date for a change to the type certificate to include another model incorporating the same novel
or unusual design feature, these special conditions would apply to that model as well under the provisions of  21.101(a)(1).



Conclusion



This action affects only certain design features on the Learject Model 45 airplane. It is not a rule of general applicability
and affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these features on the airplane.

The Proposed Special Conditions



Accordingly, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes the following special conditions as part of the
type certification basis for the Learjet Model 45 series airplanes.

1. 

Lightning Protection: 

(a) Each electrical and electronic system that performs critical functions must be designed and installed to ensure
that the operation and operational capability of these systems to perform critical functions are not adversely affected
when the airplane is exposed to lightning.

(b) Each essential function of electrical or electronic systems or installations must be protected to ensure that
the function can be recovered in a timely manner after the airplane has been exposed to lightning.

2. 

Protection from unwanted effects of high-intensity radiated fields (HIRF). 

Each electrical and electronic system that performs critical functions must be designed and installed to ensure
that the operation and operational capability of these systems to perform critical functions are not adversely affected
when the airplane is exposed to high-intensity radiated fields.

3. For the purpose of these special conditions, the following definitions apply:



Critical Functions. 

Functions whose failure would contribute to or cause a failure condition that would prevent the continued safe flight
and landing of the airplane.



Essential Functions. 

Functions whose failure could contribute to or cause a failure condition that would significantly impact the safety
of the airplane or the ability of the flightcrew to cope with adverse operating conditions.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice proposes the supersedure o
f an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CF6-45/-50/
-80A series turbofan engines, that currently requires a one-time ultrasonic and eddy current inspection of
the high pressure compressor rotor (HPCR) stage 3-9 spool for cracks. This action would retain the inspection
requirements of the current AD, but would accelerate the inspection schedule, and introduce a repetitive inspection
requirement. This proposal is prompted by a review of the inspection results to date, which indicate that the crack
occurrence rate is higher than initially projected. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent
an uncontained HPCR stage 3-9 spool failure, which could result in damage to the aircraft.

Discussion 



On October 25, 1991, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued airworthiness directive (AD) 91-20-01,
Amendment 39-8035 (56 FR 55230), to require a one-time ultrasonic and eddy current inspection of the high pressure
compressor rotor (HPCR) stage 3-9 spool for cracks. That action was prompted by two reports of spools found cracked
in service. That condition, if not corrected, could result in an uncontained HPCR stage 3-9 spool failure, which
could result in damage to the aircraft. 

Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has received reports of five additional spools found cracked in service. Investigation
indicates that the cracks initiated in sub-surface origins in the stage 9 bore region of the spool. These cracks form
from metallurgical anomalies that result from reduced forging work associated with the sixteen inch billet material
used in the manufacture of certain HPCR stage 3-9 spools. 

Based on the investigation findings, and the higher than projected crack occurrence rates, the FAA has determined
that the inspection schedule in the current AD should be accelerated, and a repetitive inspection requirement be
implemented. 

The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of GE CF6-50 Service Bulletin (SB) No. 72-1000,
Revision 2, dated September 9, 1993, and GE CF6-80A SB No. 72-583, Revision 4, dated September 15, 1993,
which describe procedures for the ultrasonic and eddy current inspection of the HPCR stage 3-9 spool. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 91-20-01, would retain the one-time ultrasonic and eddy current
inspection of the HPCR stage 3-9 spool for cracks as required in the current AD, but would accelerate the inspection
schedule, and introduce a repetitive ultrasonic and eddy current inspection requirement. 

There are approximately 462 GE CF6-45/-50/-80A series engines of the affected design in the worldwide
fleet. The FAA estimates that 67 engines installed in aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD,
that it would take approximately 584 work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average
labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $127,412 per engine. Based on these figures,
and assuming that 3 of the inspected spools will require replacement, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S.
operators is estimated to be $2,534,276. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation: (1) Is not a ``major rule'' under Executive
Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation
prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Saab Model
SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B airplanes. This proposal would require repetitive inspections to detect cracking of the
tray stop spindle and backrest spindle bosses on the inboard sections of certain seats; and replacement of the inboard
sections, if necessary. This proposal would also require repair and identification of the modification plate, which
would terminate the requirement to inspect repetitively. This proposal is prompted by reports of fatigue cracking
in the vicinity of the tray stop spindle and backrest spindle bosses, which could lead to excessive movement and eventual
failure of the backrest on these seats during aft loading. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to
prevent failure of the backrest on these seats, which could inhibit emergency egress.

Discussion 


The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Flight Equipment and Engineering Limited (FEEL) Model 121 series
seats that are installed on Saab Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B airplanes. The CAA advises that several operators
of Saab Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB SF340B airplanes found fatigue cracking in the vicinity of the tray stop spindle
and backrest spindle bosses. Cracking in this area may weaken the machined component that attaches the backrest of
the seats to the main spars of the airplane and may lead to excessive movement and eventual failure of the backrest on
these seats during aft loading. This condition, if not 
corrected, could result in failure of the backrest of these seats, which could inhibit emergency egress. 
FEEL has issued Service Bulletin 25-20-1287, Revision 3, dated March 1993, that describes procedures
for a detailed visual inspection to detect cracking of the tray stop spindle and backrest spindle bosses on the inboard
section of certain Model 121 series seats; replacement of the inboard section with a section having the same part number,
if necessary, and repetitively inspecting; and identification of the newly installed section. 
FEEL has also issued Service Bulletin 25-20-1294, Revision 1, dated May 1993, that describes procedures
for repair by replacing the inboard section of certain Model 121 series seats with a newly designed, stronger inboard
section, and replacing the front beam with a serviceable beam, if necessary; and identification of the newly installed
section. This repair and identification procedure would eliminate the need to inspect the inboard sections repetitively.

The CAA classified these service bulletins as mandatory and issued CAA Airworthiness Directives 006-03-93
and 017-03-93 in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom.

This airplane model is manufactured in Sweden and is type certificated for 
operation in the United States under the provisions of  21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable
bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA
informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a detailed visual inspection to detect cracking
of the tray stop spindle and backrest spindle bosses on the inboard section of certain Model 121 series seats; replacement
of the inboard sections with sections having the same part number and repetitively inspecting, if necessary; and
identification of the newly installed section. This proposal would require repair (including the installation
of stronger inboard sections) and identification of the stronger inboard sections (accomplishment of the actions
specified in FEEL Service Bulletin 25-20-1294), which would terminate the requirement to inspect repetitively.
The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously.

The FAA estimates that 73 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
2 work hours (1 work hour per seat to inspect and 1 work hour per seat to replace, with 34 seats per airplane) to accomplish
the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would be provided by the manufacturer
at no cost to the operator. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated
to be $273,020, or $3,740 per airplane. 
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Securities and Exchange Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Extension of comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Securities and Exchange Commission is extending the date by which comments must be received on proposed rule 17a-23
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') from April 19, 1994 to May 19, 1994. The proposed rule would establish
recordkeeping and reporting requirements for broker-dealer sponsors of certain automated securities trading
systems (``broker-dealer trading systems'' or ``BDTSs'').



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On February 9, 1994, the Commission published proposed rule 17a-23 under the Act.
 The proposal would establish a uniform recordkeeping and reporting structure for broker-dealer sponsors of broker-dealer
trading systems, requiring those broker-dealer sponsors to make available to the Commission and the appropriate
self-regulatory organization (``SRO''), system-specific information about activity occurring in those systems.
The Commission is extending the comment period on the proposal from April 19, 1994 to May 19, 1994 in order to receive
the benefit of comments from the greatest possible number of interested persons.





The proposal raises a number of complex issues with respect to the regulation of broker-dealer trading systems, including
the consistency of the proposal with the policies underlying the Act and the appropriate scope of the requirements
imposed under the proposal. The Commission has received only two comments on the proposal to date. Accordingly, the
Commission is concerned that the current comment period may not permit interested persons sufficient time to address
these issues in a thorough manner.
 Moreover, the lack of a sufficient volume of comments to comprise an adequate record potentially undermines the quality
of any determination the Commission ultimately may make with respect to the proposal.
 Accordingly, in order to receive the benefit of comments from the greatest possible number of interested persons,
the Commission is extending the comment period on the proposal from April 19, 1994 to May 19, 1994.







Dated: April 26, 1994.

Definition of Sewage Facilities for Tax-exempt Bond Purposes


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking and notice of public hearing.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains proposed regulations on the definition of sewage facilities. The proposed regulations reflect
changes to the law made by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and affect taxpayers who seek tax-exempt bond financing for sewage
facilities. This document also provides notice of a public hearing on these proposed regulations.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


Section 103(a) generally provides that the interest on obligations of a State or political subdivision thereof is
excluded from gross income. Section 103(b)(1) provides, however, that section 103(a) does not apply to any private
activity bond unless the bond is a qualified bond. Section 141(e) defines a qualified bond to include an exempt facility
bond which, under section 142(a)(5), includes an issue at least 95 percent of the net proceeds of which are used to provide
sewage facilities.
Until the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (1986 Act), both sewage disposal facilities and water pollution control facilities
constituted exempt facilities under former sections 103(b)(4)(E) and 103(b)(4)(F), respectively, the predecessors
to existing section 142. Section 1.103-8(f)(2)(i) defines sewage disposal facilities to mean any property
used for the collection, storage, treatment, utilization, processing, or final disposal of sewage.
The 1986 Act eliminated the exempt facility exemptions for air and water pollution control facilities, while retaining
the exemption for sewage disposal facilities (renamed sewage facilities by the 1986 Act) under section 142(a)(5).
Neither section 142 nor the regulations issued under section 103(b)(4) define sewage. As a result, it has become important
to define the facilities eligible for private activity bond financing as sewage facilities under section 142(a)(5).


Explanation of Provisions


Definition of Sewage Facility


The proposed regulations define a sewage facility for purposes of section 142(a)(5). A facility may satisfy the definition
of a sewage facility regardless whether wastewater originates from a domestic, a commercial, or an industrial source.
The proposed regulations, in effect, generally distinguish between sewage treatment facilities and water pollution
control facilities. The proposed regulations define sewage facilities by reference to the operations historically
performed at most publicly-owned treatment works (POTW). On the other hand, because toxic, priority, and nonconventional
pollutants are more in the nature of water pollutants, the regulations consider treatment of these pollutants as
ordinarily not performed in sewage facilities.
The proposed regulations provide that sewage facilities include property used for the secondary treatment of wastewater
but only to the extent the treatment is for wastewater having an average daily raw wasteload concentration of biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD) that does not exceed 350 milligrams per liter as oxygen. Thus, to the extent the wastewater treated
by the property has an average daily raw wasteload concentration of BOD exceeding 350 milligrams per liter as oxygen,
then the property used for the secondary treatment of the excess is not a sewage facility. The limitation is intended
to reasonably approximate the upper limit of the average daily raw wasteload concentration for most POTWs.
The proposed regulations further provide that any property used for the preliminary and/or primary treatment of
wastewater used in connection with secondary treatment qualifies as a sewage facility. Sewage facilities also include
related property used for the collection, storage, use, processing, or final disposal of wastewater or sewage sludge
and property functionally related and subordinate to a sewage facility.
Generally, other treatment of wastewater is not sewage treatment. Thus, for example, sewage facilities, including
functionally related and subordinate property, do not include property used for the pretreatment, advanced treatment,
or tertiary treatment of wastewater, whether or not the treatment is necessary for preliminary, primary, or secondary
treatment.
For property that has both a sewage treatment function and another function, such as pretreatment or, in certain cases,
secondary treatment of wastewater having an average daily raw wasteload concentration of BOD in excess of 350 milligrams
per liter as oxygen, the proposed regulations provide an allocation rule to permit the portion of the property allocable
to sewage treatment to be financed as part of an exempt facility issue.
The IRS solicits comments on how best to address technological advances to wastewater treatment processes within
the definition of sewage facilities.

Special Analyses 


It has been determined that this notice of proposed 
rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in 
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. 
It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to 
these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility 
Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the 
Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be 
submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business 
Administration for comment on its impact on small business. 



Comments and Public Hearing



Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final 
regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments 
(a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted 
timely to the IRS. All comments will be available for public 
inspection and copying. 
A public hearing has been scheduled for July 26, 1994, at 
10 a.m., in the Commissioner's Conference Room, Internal 
Revenue Building, room 3313, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW., 
Washington, DC. Because of access restrictions, visitors will 
not be admitted beyond the Internal Revenue Building lobby more 
than 15 minutes before the hearing starts. 
The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing. 
Persons that wish to present oral comments at the hearing 
must submit written comments and an outline of the topics to be 
discussed and the time to be devoted to each topic (signed 
original and eight (8) copies) by July 5, 1994. 
A period of 10 minutes will be allotted to each person for 
making comments. 
An agenda showing the scheduling of the speakers will be 
prepared after the deadline for receiving outlines has passed. 
Copies of the agenda will be available free of charge at the 
hearing. 


Drafting Information 


The principal author of these regulations is Joanne E. 
Johnson, Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Passthroughs and 
Special Industries). However, other personnel from the IRS and 
Treasury Department participated in their development.

Exempt facility bonds: Sewage facilities. 


(a) 

In general.

 Under section 103(a), a private activity 
bond is a tax-exempt bond only if it is a qualified bond. 
Qualified bonds include exempt facility bonds, defined as any 
bond issued as part of an issue 95 percent or more of the net 
proceeds of which are used to provide a facility specified in 
section 142. One type of facility specified in section 142(a) is 
a sewage facility. This section defines the term 

sewage facility

 for purposes of section 142(a). 
(b) 

Definitions

_(1) 

Sewage facility defined.

 A sewage 
facility is property_
(i) Used for the secondary treatment of wastewater but, for 
property treating wastewater reasonably expected to have an 
average daily raw wasteload concentration of biochemical oxygen 
demand (BOD) that exceeds 350 milligrams per liter as oxygen, 
only to the extent the treatment is for wastewater having an 
average daily raw wasteload concentration of BOD that does not 
exceed 350 milligrams per liter as oxygen (see paragraph (d) of 
this section regarding permissible allocations of costs); 
(ii) Used for the preliminary and/or primary treatment of 
wastewater but only to the extent used in connection with 
secondary treatment (without regard to the BOD limitation 
described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section);

(iii) Used for the collection, storage, use, processing, or 
final disposal of_
(A) Wastewater, which property is necessary for such 
preliminary, primary, or secondary treatment; or 
(B) Sewage sludge removed during such preliminary, primary, 
or secondary treatment; and 
(iv) Functionally related and subordinate to property 
described in this paragraph (b)(1). 
(2) 

Other applicable definitions

_(i) 

Advanced or tertiary 
treatment

 generally means the treatment of wastewater after 
secondary treatment. Advanced or tertiary treatment ranges from 
biological treatment extensions to physical-chemical separation 
techniques such as denitrification, ammonia stripping, carbon 
adsorption, and chemical precipitation. 
(ii) 

Nonconventional pollutants

 are any pollutants that are 
not listed in 40 CFR 401.15, 401.16, part 423, app. A. 
(iii) 

Preliminary treatment

 generally means treatment that 
removes large extraneous matter from incoming wastewater and 
renders the incoming wastewater more amenable to subsequent 
treatment and handling. 
(iv) 

Pretreatmen

t means processes that equalize flow and 
loadings, or that precondition wastewater to neutralize or remove 
toxic, priority, nonconventional pollutants, and other wastes 
that could adversely affect sewers or inhibit preliminary, 
primary, or secondary treatment operations. 
(v) 

Primary treatment

 means treatment that removes material 
that floats or will settle, usually by screens or settling tanks. 
(vi) 

Priority pollutants

 are those pollutants listed in 40 
CFR part 423, app. A. 
(vii) 

Secondary treatment

 means the stage in sewage 
treatment in which a bacterial process (or an equivalent process) 
consumes the organic parts of wastes, usually by trickling 
filters or an activated sludge process. 
(viii) 

Sewage sludge

 means sludge as defined in 40 CFR 
122.2. 
(ix) 

Toxic pollutants

 are those pollutants listed in 40 CFR 
401.15. 
(c) 

Other property not included in the definition of a 
sewage facility.

 Property other than property described in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not a sewage facility. Thus, 
for example, property is not a sewage facility, or functionally 
related and subordinate property, if the property is used for 
pretreatment, advanced treatment, or tertiary treatment of 
wastewater (whether or not this treatment is necessary to perform 
preliminary, primary, or secondary treatment), or the related 
collection, storage, use, processing, or final disposal of the 
wastewater. In addition, property used to treat, process, or use 
wastewater subsequent to the time the wastewater can be 
discharged into navigable waters is not a sewage facility. 
(d) 

Allocation of costs.

 In the case of property that has 
both a use described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
(a sewage treatment function) and a use other than sewage 
treatment, only the portion of the cost of the property allocable 
to the sewage treatment function is taken into account as an 
expenditure to provide sewage facilities. The portion of the 
cost of property allocable to the sewage treatment function is 
determined by allocating the cost of that property between the 
property's sewage treatment function and any other uses by any 
method which, based on all the facts and circumstances, 
reasonably reflects a separation of costs for each use of the 
property. 
(e) 

Effective date.

 This section applies to issues of bonds 
issued 60 days after publication of the final regulations in the

Field Citation Program



<AGENCY>

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Clean Air Act, as amended (the Act), authorizes EPA to implement a field citation program, as part of the Agency's
recently-granted authority for the administrative assessment of civil penalties.



The Act authorizes EPA to issue field citations for appropriate minor violations, defined in today
s proposal as those violations determined to be minor in nature after consideration of various specified factors.
EPA also proposes a maximum penalty of $5,000 per day for each violation cited, and a maximum cumulative penalty in
the range of $15,000 to $25,000 per citation.

Upon receipt of a field citation, a respondent must either pay the proposed penalty or submit a request for a hearing.
Hearing procedures are also proposed in this document. 
EPA expects to implement this program such that in the great majority of cases the issuance of a field citation will
lead to a quick correction of a clear violation and a payment of the assessed penalty.

This preamble discusses the major issues raised by today's proposed action, and EPA's justification for each proposed
provision. Sections II and III, which follow this introduction, contain a brief outline of the proposal
s statutory authority and background. Section IV outlines the major program considerations and the rationale for
EPA's proposal on each, while Section V presents a section-by-section analysis of the proposed rule. The final section
in this preamble, Section VI, outlines specific regulatory impact analyses. 


II. Statutory Authority 


Today's rule is proposed under authority of sections 113(d) and 301(a) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7413(d) and 7601(a)).



III. Background of Proposed Rule 


Prior to the passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990,
 EPA enforced Clean Air Act provisions through civil or criminal judicial enforcement actions and the issuance of
administrative orders for compliance.
 The 1990 Amendments expanded EPA's range of enforcement tools by authorizing EPA to issue administrative penalty
orders (section 113(d)(1) of the Act) and to administratively assess civil penalties through field citations issued
for minor violations (section 113(d)(3) of the Act). EPA expects that these new enforcement options will enhance
the Agency's ability to enforce the Act. Where appropriate, EPA will be able to respond quickly to a violation by issuing
an administrative penalty order or a field citation, rather than commencing a civil judicial enforcement action
for penalties. While civil and criminal judicial enforcement actions will remain an important component of EPA's
enforcement program, EPA's new administrative authorities will enable it to effectively pursue a broad range of
violations without the expenditure of resources associated with judicial action. 





Section 113(d)(3) of the Act authorizes EPA to implement a field citation program to enforce the Act through regulations
which establish appropriate minor violations for which field citations may be issued. The Act requires that the Agency
consult with the Attorney General and the States, that the maximum civil penalty for a minor violation not exceed $5,000
per day of violation, and that field citations be issued only by EPA officers or employees designated by the Administrator.

Section 113(d)(3) of the Act also provides that any person to whom a field citation is issued may elect either to pay
the proposed penalty or to request a hearing in accordance with procedures specified in the regulations. It further
provides that the penalty assessed in the field citation becomes final if a request for a hearing is not made within
the time specified in the implementing regulations. The Act specifies that hearings shall not be subject to the requirements
of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 554 or 556, but shall provide a reasonable opportunity to be heard
and to present evidence. 
The Act also specifies that payment of a field citation penalty shall not be a defense to further enforcement by the
United States or a State to correct a violation, or to assess the statutory maximum penalty pursuant to other authorities
in the Act, if the violation continues. 


IV. Program Considerations 


A. Appropriate Minor Violations for Issuance of Field Citations 


EPA expects the field citation program to exhibit several important characteristics. First, field citations should
be issued for violations that are clear cut and truly minor in nature. Second, field citations should, in general,
be issued shortly after a violation is discovered, if not upon discovery. Third, the amount of the penalty assessed
and other aspects of the program should induce quick correction of the violation and payment of the penalty. As required
by section 113(d)(3), EPA is proposing a definition of minor violation for which field citations may be issued. This
definition is designed to help implement these goals. 
EPA considered several regulatory options for establishing appropriate minor violations as directed in the statute.
One option was inclusion in the rule of a comprehensive list of all possible violations suitable for field citations.
This approach would appear to have several advantages. Explicitly listing each minor violation in the rule would
provide clear, objective criteria for the issuance of field citations, thereby limiting inspector discretion.
An inspector would need only check the list of appropriate minor violations to determine whether a field citation
could be issued. This approach would appear to both streamline the program and help to achieve national consistency
in its application. 
A major problem with this option became clear, however, when attempts were made to develop such a list of ``minor violations.''
Almost any violation might be considered significant or minor depending on the circumstances. A regulatory list
of all or nearly all possible minor violations would therefore be too long to be of any real use, or in the alternative,
would exclude violations which, given the right circumstances, would properly be considered minor. 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940503-1-00027 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940503-1-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, it became clear that an exercise of discretion was almost unavoidable in determining whether a violation
was minor. This was inherent in the view that the specific circumstances, along with the kind of violation, were critical
in determining whether or not it was minor. 

Thus, the option of listing all or nearly all minor violations in the regulations would result in a list that was either
too long or too short to be of significant value. It would also not provide a mechanism for channeling the exercise of
discretion that appears inherent in the decision on whether a violation is minor, and consequently would not appear
to foster national consistency. 

A second option considered by EPA would define as minor those violations limited to particular categories of regulatory
requirements (e.g., recordkeeping, reporting, labeling, monitoring, workpractice standards, etc.). This option,
however, exhibits the same basic problems as the first option. Here again, violations within these broad categories
could be considered significant or minor depending on the circumstances. This second approach still did not provide
a method for determining when a violation in one of the broad categories would be considered minor. 

Given the importance of the specific circumstances of a violation in categorizing it as significant or minor, EPA
considered and is today proposing a third option. In today
s proposal a minor violation would be defined as one that is minor in nature, in light of a list of factors that must be
considered as a whole. This list contains such factors as whether the violation is readily recognizable by an officer
or employee of EPA; the risk and degree of environmental harm resulting from the violation; the time, effort, or expense
required to correct the violation; the frequency and duration of the violation; and the importance of the violated
requirement to the regulatory program. For example, determinations that the violation is manifest; that it poses
little risk of environmental harm; that it has not been identified in a previous enforcement action against the respondent;
that it occurred once or only for a short period of time; or that correcting it should require little time, effort, or
expense would be indicators of the minor nature of a violation. 

EPA recognizes that this list is not exhaustive of all factors that may be relevant to whether a violation is minor in
nature. Therefore, the definition includes a provision for consideration of other appropriate factors. However,
the list is indicative of the types of factors that EPA will consider in determining whether a violation is minor. 

While EPA considers these factors as relevant to determining whether or not a violation is minor in nature, information
may not be available on all of these factors when decisions are made regarding the propriety of issuing a field citation.
If information is not available for any of the factors noted in the proposed list of factors, then that factor would
be treated as neutral on the issue of whether a violation is minor in nature. In addition, EPA
s proposal calls for evaluating the factors as a whole. Specific requirements are not proposed for each of the factors
individually, i.e., EPA has not proposed a specific time requirement for ``duration of violation'' or a dollar amount
for ``expense required to correct a violation.'' The specific circumstances of the violation would be considered
in light of all of these factors taken as a whole. 

A final factor has been added to the definition of minor violation to make clear that EPA reserves all rights to determine
the appropriate enforcement response to a violation. A violation is not a minor violation under the definition proposed
today unless it is minor in nature as described above, and unless the Agency, in its descretion, decides to address
it as a minor violation. This is to make it clear that the field citation regulations proposed today do not provide a
basis for respondents to claim that an alleged violation is minor in nature and therefore EPA's only available enforcement
mechanism is issuance of a field citation. Today's proposed regulations are not intended to limit in any way EPA's
ability to fully exercise its enforcement discretion. The Agency reserves the right to determine what, if any, enforcement
approach is appropriate in a specific case. EPA believes this is consistent with Congressional intent for the field
citation program, as section 113(d)(3) provides that ``[t]he Administrator may implement * * * a
field citation program through regulations establishing appropriate minor violations for which field citations
* * * 

may

 be issued by officers or employees designated by the Administrator.'' (emphasis supplied)

<TEXT>
 

It is important to note that there are circumstances under which EPA might conclude that a field citation is not the
most appropriate enforcement response. For example, if a person or source is the subject of an ongoing EPA investigation
or if a person or source has an aggregation of many minor violations, each of which, if considered individually, would
be suitable for a field citation, EPA may appropriately decide to address those violations through its section 113(d)
administrative penalty authority or through its section 113(b) civil judicial authority. A more detailed description
of the process for determining whether a violation is minor will be presented in the guidance document to be developed
for implementing this rule. 



B. Maximum Penalty 



Under section 113(d)(3), civil penalties assessed in a field citation may not exceed ``$5,000 per day of violation.''
EPA proposes to interpret this provision such that the maximum $5,000 penalty applies for each day, for each separate
violation cited in the field citation. This interpretation is consistent with the statutory text and structure of
section 113, and is supported by its legislative history. 

EPA's proposed interpretation of the phrase ``per day of violation'' as used in section 113(d)(3) is quite reasonable,
given EPA's long history of interpreting an identical penalty provision in this manner, the civil penalty provision
of section 113(b) as it stood prior to enactment of the 1990 amendments.
 That prior interpretation has found support in several judicial decisions.
 By using the same language as previously found in section 113(b), Congress clearly authorized EPA to continue this
interpretation for purposes of the new field citation program. 






This interpretation is also consistent with Congress' apparent objectives for the field citation program as indicated
by various provisions in section 113 relating to field citations. Congress limited the field citation program to
``appropriate minor violations,'' established a maximum penalty amount of ``$5,000 per day of violation,'' provided
a right to a non-APA hearing, and required that penalties in this program be assessed after consideration of the penalty
assessment criteria of section 113(e). These provisions indicate that Congress wanted to provide EPA with a flexible
enforcement tool that would focus on the less significant, presumably simpler and less complex violations, with
assessment of significantly lower penalties than expected through two other civil penalty provisions of section
113, administrative penalty orders (section 113(d)(1)) and judicial civil penalty actions (section 113(b)). 

EPA's proposed interpretation of the maximum penalty amount for the field citation program, $5,000 per day for each
violation, will lead to significantly lower penalty assessments in comparison to these other two programs, primarily
because of the large reduction in the maximum penalty from $25,000 to $5,000, the minor nature of the violations, and
the penalty assessment criteria in section 113(e). Interpreting ``per day of violation'' to mean per day for each
violation allows EPA to fairly and flexibly implement a field citation program in a manner consistent with Congress'
apparent objectives for this program. While a more restrictive interpretation, such as $5,000 per day of violation
no matter how many different violations on a specific day, might lead to even lower penalty assessments in certain
cases, Congress' apparent objectives for the field citation program can be met without adopting this approach. In
fact, a more restrictive interpretation might hinder implementation of these goals. 

First, an interpretation that ``per day of violation'' in section 113(d)(3) imposes a maximum penalty of $5,000 not
withstanding the number of violations in a day would in certain cases minimize if not remove the Agency's ability to
fully account for important differences between violators when assessing penalties under this program. Two violators
with different numbers of minor violations on the same day would both face the same maximum penalty, possibly removing
EPA's ability to reflect this difference in the amount of penalty imposed. This would appear to run counter to the requirement
in section 113(e) that EPA consider such differences when assessing penalties under section 113(d)(3). Second,
in that situation there would be an incentive for EPA to issue an administrative penalty order in lieu of a field citation,
to avoid the apparent unfairness resulting from the limitation in discretion embodied in the more restrictive interpretation.

It is unlikely that Congress intended either of these results, and EPA's proposed interpretation avoids them without
in any way sacrificing full implementation of Congress' goals for this program. The Agency will be able to fully consider
all the factors required under section 113(e), including the number of violations, and the field citation program
will still involve significantly lower penalty amounts than the other civil penalty programs in section 113.

EPA's interpretation is supported by the legislative history in section 113(d)(3). The field citation provisions
finally adopted by Congress originated in the House of Representatives. While an early version of the provision called
for a maximum penalty of ``$5,000 per day for each violation,'' this was changed without explanation to a maximum penalty
of ``5,000 per day of violation.''
 While the House Committee Report fails to explain this change in language, it is important to note that the phrase ``per
day of violation'' had long been interpreted by the Agency as establishing a maximum civil penalty for each day, for
each separate violation. Various judicial decisions were consistent with this interpretation.
 Congress' adoption of language with a long-standing Agency interpretation is strong evidence that despite the difference
in language between section 113(a) and section 113(d)(3), Congress did not preclude EPA's proposed interpretation
but instead authorized the Agency to adopt the same interpretation for the field citation program that EPA had long
employed for the maximum penalty provision found in the pre-1990 version of section 113(a).






The legislative history in the Senate also makes it clear that Congress intended to authorize EPA's proposed interpretation.
In the Senate, the bill reported out by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works authorized a field citation
program with a maximum civil penalty of ``$5,000 per day for each violation.''
 The bill passed by the Senate contained a very different provision, establishing a $5,000 maximum ``per inspection.''
 In conference, the Senate's clear mandate for a maximum dollar amount, no matter the number of violations, was rejected
in favor of the version passed by the House. This indicates that Congress did not intend to mandate a similar interpretation
for the field citation program.

Finally, EPA's interpretation is supported by the legislative history of title II's enforcement provisions. As
reported out of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, sections 211(d)(1) and 205(c) of the Act authorized
administrative assessment of civil penalties of no more than ``$25,000 per day of violation.''
 In describing this authority, the Committee Report states that ``[t]his section of the bill changes the section 211(d)
penalty amount * * * to a maximum penalty of $25,000 per day of violation. This penalty amount applies
to 

each day for each violation.

'' (emphasis supplied)
 This shows that when Congress used the term ``per day of violation'' in amending section 113 it had no intention of barring
an EPA interpretation that such term meant ``per day for each violation.''






On a separate issue, EPA considered several different ways to structure the field citation program so that as clear
a line as possible would be drawn indicating when it was appropriate to issue a field citation, and when one of the other
civil penalty authorities would be more appropriate. This is important, among other things, given the decentralized
nature of this program and the authority to issue citations in the field. One option considered was issuance of internal
Agency guidance on this point. As discussed in section D of this notice, EPA does intend to issue guidance on a wide variety
of matters related to this program, and an important component of this will include guidance on when to issue a citation
and when to employ other enforcement tools open to the Agency.

EPA also considered and is proposing establishing a maximum cumulative dollar amount that may be assessed in an individual
citation. This would have the advantage of providing an objective indication in the regulations themselves that
a more serious compliance problem exists and other, more stringent enforcement mechanisms would generally be more
appropriate. This maximum penalty amount could be reached by, for example, a combination of many violations (whether
occurring on the same or separate days), with low amounts per violation, or a smaller number of violations combined
with larger penalty amounts per violation. Either of these circumstances would serve to indicate that a stronger
enforcement approach may well be appropriate. While such a cap could be included in internal Agency guidance, a regulatory
cap will provide greater structure for this program, at least initially.

As a variation on the above, EPA considered establishing a maximum number of violations that could be included in an
individual citation. This option, however, might preclude issuance of a field citation where the number of violations
exceeded the maximum, even if the violations were all very minor and would receive a low penalty assessment. For this
reason EPA is not currently proposing this form of a cap.

EPA is proposing that the maximum cumulative penalty in an individual citation not exceed a dollar amount in the range
of $15,000 to $25,000. EPA invites comment on this range, and whether such a dollar cap should be in the regulations
or in Agency guidance. EPA is also considering and invites comment on whether the penalty cap should ``sunset'' after
a pre-set time period, ranging from one or two years to a longer period. Before the cap expired of its own terms, EPA would
reevaluate whether it should continue, and if appropriate, would revise the regulations to extend the cap or some
more useful version thereof.



C. Penalty Assessment Policy



The regulations proposed today define minor violation, establish the maximum penalty amount per violation, and
address matters concerning hearings to contest assessment of a civil penalty through a field citation. EPA plans
to develop detailed guidance that will address many of the other issues concerning implementation of the field citation
program. The following section discusses important aspects of EPA's planned guidance on the penalty amounts to be
assessed by field citations.

Penalty assessment under the field citation program will be designed to achieve expeditious compliance with the
applicable Clean Air Act requirements. Although only minor violations of the Act will be subject to the program, the
penalties must be significant enough to deter violations and to ensure a high rate of compliance. On the other hand,
penalties will generally be significantly lower than amounts that could be assessed through other enforcement means.
EPA plans to incorporate these objectives into a field citation penalty assessment policy, which will become a component
of the Agency's Clean Air Act civil penalty assessment policy.

The penalty assessment guidance will explain how the Agency intends to evaluate the penalty assessment criteria
in section 113(e) of the Act when determining penalty amounts. The Agency is considering assigning standardized
penalty amounts to specific categories of violations. These standard amounts might then be modified by means of a
penalty matrix, which would take into account such factors as the seriousness of the violation; the degree of environmental
harm; or other appropriate criteria.

EPA expects that its penalty assessment guidance will limit the discretion of inspectors and others in setting penalty
amounts. For example, any matrix approach as described above would constrain the person issuing the field citation
to operate within the limits of the matrix. In addition, EPA expects the guidance will establish that where the amount
of a penalty would be based on specific characteristics of the violation and the person issuing the citation has not
obtained evidence relating to one of the characteristics, then that characteristic would be treated as neutral for
purposes of penalty assessment.

D. Program Implementation 



In addition to guidance on the penalty amounts assessed 
through the field citation program, EPA plans to issue guidance 
addressing a wide variety of other implementation issues. This 
guidance would be carefully designed to spell out and restrict 
the day-to-day practice under this program. EPA believes this 
approach will facilitate achievement of the goals for this 
program, and still provide the flexibility necessary for an 
enforcement program designed to address a wide variety of factual 
circumstances. This section describes EPA's current ideas on 
certain elements of this program guidance. 

Field citations may be issued either in the field or from 
an EPA office. Violations of reporting requirements, for 
example, will typically involve desk issuance since discovery of 
these violations normally occurs not in the field, but in an 
office designated to receive such reports. Even where a 
violation is discovered in the field, an inspector may elect to 
return to the office for further review or discussion with 
management prior to issuing a field citation. In order to 
promote consistency, inspectors will be encouraged to return to 
the office for clarification whenever there is any doubt 
regarding the nature of a violation or the appropriate penalty 
amount. During the initial phase of program implementation, the 
Agency anticipates that most field citations will be issued from 
an EPA office, based on field inspections. After a suitable 
period of experience with the program, it is expected that the 
majority of inspection-based citations will be issued on-site. 
The Agency will then establish guidelines for particular 
situations in which office-only issuance would still be 
recommended, e.g., based on penalties exceeding a specified 
dollar amount, or for other relevant considerations. Although 
State and local employees may not issue federal field citations 
pursuant to this regulation, EPA employees may rely on 
information gathered during State and local inspections as a 
basis for issuing field citations. 

Following discovery of a minor violation and issuance of a 
field citation, the respondent will have thirty days in which to 
either pay the assessed penalty or to request a hearing. EPA 
reserves the right to revoke a field citation, in whole or in 
part, at any time prior to payment of the assessed penalty. 

EPA believes this authority is a necessary safeguard in this 
program. It will allow a reevaluation, before the process has 
gone very far, of whether a citation should have been issued. 
For example, this could involve a reevaluation of whether a filed 
citation is the most appropriate enforcement tool, or could 
involve the early resolution of a citation issued in error. 

As noted above, EPA will prepare detailed guidance for the 
implementation of the field citation program. The guidance will 
cover such broad areas as coordination of inspections with State 
and local agencies, desk issuance as opposed to field issuance, 
determination of whether a violation is minor, and calculation of 
penalty amounts. The guidance will also cover such issues as how 
to revoke a field citation, and how field citations will be 
recorded and tracked. Finally, the guidance will include 
procedures for determining appropriate penalty amounts, and an 
actual sample of the design and format of the field citation. 



E. Field Citations as Distinguished From Other Enforcement 
Authorities 



Under section 113(b) of the Act, the Agency is authorized to 
commence civil judicial enforcement actions against certain 
violators to assess and recover civil penalties of up to $25,000 
per day for each violation, and/or to seek temporary or permanent 
injunctions. Civil actions under section 113(b) are most 
advantageous when: 

(1) A compliance schedule or other injunctive relief is 
necessary and an administrative compliance order under section 
113(a) is either unavailable or inappropriate; 

(2) The violator's compliance history indicates that the 
compliance schedule should be subject to court supervision and 
contempt remedies; or 

(3) Substantial civil penalties are appropriate. 

In 1990, Congress amended section 113 of the Act, providing 
new authority for the Administrator to issue administrative 
penalty orders under section 113(d)(1). These administrative 
penalty orders, which may assess civil penalties of up to $25,000 
per day of violation, may be issued where: 

(1) The total penalty sought does not exceed $200,000; and 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940503-1-00032 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940503-1-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) The first alleged date of violation occurred no more 
than twelve months prior to initiation of the administrative 
action. The Administrator and the Attorney General may, however, 
jointly determine that an administrative penalty action is 
appropriate for either a larger penalty or a longer period of 
violation. 


Administrative penalties under section 113(d)(1) are most advantageous where: 


(1) The violator does not have a compliance history of 
multiple or repeat violations; and 

(2) Court-supervised injunctive relief is not appropriate. 
Additionally, civil judicial action is preferred over 
administrative action where extensive post-filing discovery will 
be necessary to fully develop the circumstances associated with 
one or more violations, and where new legal issues are presented 
by a case. 


The field citation program under section 113(d)(3) is another new enforcement authority provided by the November
15, 1990 Amendments. As indicated elsewhere in this preamble, the field citation program involves the issuance of
citations that 
assess civil penalties, not exceeding $5,000 per day of 
violation, for minor violations of the Act. 


The focus of the field citation program will be to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements that often remain
unaddressed due to limited Agency resources. The opportunity for streamlined, expedited enforcement to address
minor violations should save Agency resources, reduce court backlogs, and send a clear enforcement message to violators
that minor violations will not be overlooked. 



F. Role of Inspectors 




1. Issuance by Officers/Employees 




Under the Act, field citations ``may be issued by officers or employees designated by the Administrator.'' It is the
Agency's position that section 113(d)(3) does not authorize delegation of section 113 field citation authority
to State and local officials. The legislative history supports this 
interpretation.
 Comments on the Agency's position, including 
any alternative legal analyses or interpretations of the statute, 
are invited. 





2. Training and Guidance for Inspectors and Enforcement 
Officers 




The success of the field citation program will depend on well-trained inspectors and enforcement officers, skilled
at both recognizing minor violations and determining appropriate penalty amounts. Before implementing this program,
EPA will offer a number of Regional inspector training sessions to ensure that inspectors and enforcement personnel
are completely familiar with the program and understand the limits of its applicability. In 
particular, employees will be trained to identify minor violations based on the criteria set forth in this regulation.
They will also be trained to identify circumstances in which particular violations might indicate a more serious
compliance problem that should be handled through a more stringent 
enforcement action. 


In addition to training, inspectors and enforcement officers will be given a detailed guidance document containing
recommended penalty ranges associated with specific categories of violations. In this way, inspectors will have
a ready reference if they are unsure about a particular violation. Moreover, the establishment of appropriate penalty
amounts in guidance will help to ensure 
national consistency. Whenever there are doubts regarding how to characterize a suspected violation, inspectors
will be directed to return to the office for further evaluation and consultation. 




G. Rules Governing Hearings on Field Citations 




In addition to authorizing EPA to implement a field citation program, section 113(d)(3) of the Act addresses certain
basic procedural issues involving hearings on field citations. First, it provides that any person to whom a civil
penalty is assessed through a field citation may elect either to pay the civil penalty or to request a hearing on the
field citation. Any 
request for a hearing must be within the time period prescribed by the Administrator through regulation, and if a hearing
is not requested within such time then the penalty assessment in the field citation becomes final. Second, this section
explicitly provides that the hearing on a field citation shall not be subject to the Administrative Procedure Act
(APA) provisions on 
formal adjudications (5 U.S.C. 554 or 556), but shall provide a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present evidence.



EPA is proposing three distinct alternatives to implement these statutory provisions and establish fair and reasonable
procedures to govern hearings on field citations. These alternatives are: (1) EPA's consolidated, APA penalty assessment
procedures under 40 CFR part 22, with appropriate revisions; (2) EPA's proposed consolidated, non-APA penalty assessment
procedures under 40 CFR part 28, with appropriate revisions; and (3) new streamlined administrative procedures
contained in today's proposal. The following section discusses and evaluates each of these alternatives. The Agency
requests comment on the propriety of each of these penalty assessment procedures. 


Procedures for the assessment of field citation penalties must reasonably implement the requirements of section
113(d)(3), including providing a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present evidence, and must also satisfy
procedural due process considerations under the Constitution. Determining compliance with both of these requirements
requires a close comparison between the proposed procedures, the factual and legal situations 
that are expected to arise under this program, and the interests at issue, both private and governmental.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940503-1-00033 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940503-1-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Congress specifically limited field citations to minor 
violations, as defined by the Agency. While EPA's proposed 
definition of minor violation does not specify each and every 
violation that might be considered minor, it does set clear 
limits on the kinds of violations that will be considered minor 
violations. The many different kinds of violations that may meet 
the definition of minor violation will exhibit common features. 
For example, the typical minor violation will involve a clear and 
straightforward violation, both factually and legally, of limited 
frequency or duration and limited environmental impact. The 
factual and legal issues that EPA expects to arise in field 
citation assessments are, overall, expected to be simple and 
uncomplicated. 
The basic private interest at stake is the assessment of 
civil penalties of up to a maximum of $5,000 per day for each 
violation, as well as the resources needed to contest such 
assessments where considered appropriate. The maximum penalty is 
significantly lower than the maximum administrative or judicial 
civil penalties authorized under sections 113, 205 and 211 of the 
Act. 
The primary governmental interest is implementation of a 
program that fairly fills a gap in EPA's enforcement programs, 
without undue drain on EPA's limited enforcement resources. EPA 
believes this interest is best served by addressing minor 
violations in a straightforward and direct manner, somewhat akin 
to a traffic enforcement program. The deterrence effect from 
this program will come in large part from the issuance of a 
citation immediately upon or shortly after detection of a 
violation, with final assessment of the penalty occurring shortly 
after issuance of the citation. 
EPA has considered these and other factors in evaluating the 
three options proposed today for hearing procedures, and believes 
all three fully implement Congressional intent and satisfy due 
process requirements. The three options draw different balances 
between complexity and simplicity, formality and informality, but 
are all designed to implement a program aimed at simple and 
uncomplicated violations, involving penalties significantly lower 
than others authorized in the Act, and requiring straightforward, 
quick and fair adjudication to obtain the desired deterrent 
effect without undue drain on limited Agency resources. 


1. Modified 40 CFR Part 22_Consolidated Rules of Practice 
Governing the Administrative Assessment of Civil Penalties 
and the Revocation or Suspension of Permits 


Under the first Agency proposal, administrative hearings on 
field citations would be conducted pursuant to the procedures 
established by EPA
s consolidated APA rules of practice for the 
administrative assessment of civil penalties, 40 CFR part 22. In 
a separate rulemaking, the Agency would propose to amend part 22, 
where appropriate, to make that regulation applicable to field 
citations.

Basis for Hearing Procedures 



Although the Act explicitly indicates that hearings in field 
citation cases are not subject to the provisions for formal APA 
adjudication, it does not prohibit the Agency from exercising its 
discretion and providing such procedural rights. There are two 
primary benefits in using part 22 to govern hearings on field 
citations: (1) It would consolidate Clean Air Act administrative 
penalty hearings under one set of procedural rules, minimizing 
the need for the Agency and the regulated community to learn and 
become proficient in more than one set of procedures; and (2) it 
would use a penalty assessment procedure with which both the 
Agency and the regulated community have a great deal of 
experience. 


The Act as amended in 1990 authorizes the Administrator to 
issue administrative penalty orders under section 113(d)(1). 
These administrative penalty orders, which may assess civil 
penalties of up to $25,000 per day of violation, are generally 
limited to situations where the total penalty sought does not 
exceed $200,000 and where the first alleged date of violation 
occurred no more than twelve months prior to initiation of the 
administrative action. Similar authority was provided under 
sections 205(c) and 211(d)(1) of the Act. 

The penalties contained in administrative penalty orders 
issued under section 113(d)(1) are assessed pursuant to the part 
22 procedures, as are administrative penalties assessed under 
sections 205(c) and 211(d)(1). Part 22 was amended to 
incorporate these provisions on February 4, 1992 (57 FR 4318). 
Thus, using part 22 to govern hearings on field citations issued 
under section 113(d)(3) would consolidate all of the Clean Air 
Act administrative penalty hearings under one set of procedures. 

Additionally, the Agency has used part 22 for assessing 
administrative penalties under other environmental statutes since 
1980. Consequently, both the regulated community and the Agency 
have considerable experience with these procedures, thereby 
simplifying the implementation of the field citation program. As 
discussed later, minor revisions to part 22 procedures would be 
adopted to account for certain statutory provisions in section 
113(d)(3) and to account for the types of violations and 
penalties associated with field citations. 



Proposed Hearing Procedures 



Under part 22, the field citation would be issued by an EPA 
officer or employee as an administrative complaint. Within 
twenty days after service of the citation, the Respondent must 
file an answer. In the answer, the Respondent may contest the 
facts in the complaint, the size of the penalty, or claim that 
the Respondent is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. If 
requested by the Respondent, a hearing will be held on the issues 
raised in the citation and answer. The Presiding Officer has the 
discretion to allow the Respondent to amend his answer. A 
default order, which allows the full proposed penalty to be 
collected, may be issued upon motion if the Respondent fails to 
file an answer. 

The Respondent may simultaneously pursue informal settlement 
and a hearing. During settlement negotiations, the parties may 
informally exchange information, if appropriate. For example, 
the Agency may supply copies of the documentation used to support 
its case and the Respondent might provide any evidence that would 
tend to disprove the allegations or to mitigate the penalty. A 
written Consent Agreement and a proposed Consent Order are 
submitted for approval by the Regional Administrator, if the 
parties reach a settlement of the claim. 

Either party may file a preliminary motion for an 
accelerated decision if no genuine issues of material fact exist. 
The Respondent may file a motion for dismissal of the citation. 

A mandatory prehearing conference is held to simplify 
issues; to limit the number of potential witnesses; and to 
address other matters that may expedite the hearing. An exchange 
of witness lists and documents occurs at the prehearing 
conference. 

The hearing is held for the presentation of evidence and 
testimony concerning the facts relating to the violation and to 
the size of the penalty. Except as otherwise provided by the 
Presiding Officer, witnesses are to be examined orally, under 
oath or affirmation, at the hearing. The parties have the right 
to cross-examine witnesses who testify at the hearing. The 
Presiding Officer may take notice of any matter judicially 
noticed in the Federal courts and of any facts falling within the 
specialized knowledge and expertise of the Agency.

<DOCNO> FR940503-1-00035 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940503-1-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

At the hearing, the Agency has the burden of going forward 
and proving that the violation occurred and that the proposed 
penalty is appropriate. After a prima facie case is established, 
the Respondent has the burden of presenting and going forward 
with any defense to the allegations in the citation. The matters 
in controversy are determined by the Presiding Officer upon a 
preponderance of evidence. 

The hearing must be transcribed. Within twenty days after 
the transcript is available, the parties may submit proposed 
findings of fact and conclusions of law with supporting briefs. 
Reply briefs are also authorized. 

The Presiding Officer issues the initial decision, which 
consists of findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended 
civil penalty. In reaching an initial decision, the Presiding 
Officer is required to consider the statutory penalty assessment 
criteria listed in section 113(e), section 205(c) or section 
211(d) of the Act, as appropriate. For section 113(e), these 
criteria include: The size of the business; the economic impact 
of the penalty on the business; the Respondent's full compliance 
history; the Respondent's good faith efforts to comply; the 
duration of the violation as established by any credible 
evidence; payment by the Respondent of penalties previously 
assessed for the same violation; the economic benefit of 
noncompliance; the seriousness of the violation; and such other 
factors as justice may require. 

If the Presiding Officer recommends a penalty different from 
the one proposed by the citation, the initial decision must set 
forth the specific reasons for the increase or decrease. Either 
party may file a motion to reopen the hearing within twenty (20) 
days of service of the initial decision. 

Unless a party appeals to the Environmental Appeals Board 
(the Board) within twenty (20) days of service, or unless the 
Board elects to review it 

sua sponte

, the Presiding Officer's 
initial decision becomes a final order of the Board within forty-five (45) days after service. A final order of the
Board shall 
adopt, modify or set aside the findings and conclusions of the 
initial decision. The Board is authorized to increase or 
decrease the assessed penalty, except in the case of a default 
order. A motion for reconsideration of the final order may be 
filed with the Board within ten (10) days after service of the 
final order. 



Procedural Due Process 



EPA analyzed the issue of procedural due process with its 
consolidated APA rules of practice when they were promulgated. 
See 52 FR 2922 (August 6, 1987) (NPRM) and 57 FR 4316 
(February 4, 1992) (FRM). In that analysis EPA evaluated and 
balanced the three factors specified by the Supreme Court in 


Mathews 

v. 

Eldridge

, 424 U.S. 319 (1976) for determining whether 
the administrative procedure provided to an individual prior to 
the deprivation of a property interest meets the due process 
requirements of the Fifth Amendment: the magnitude and nature of 
the individual interest at stake, the risk of an erroneous 
deprivation of that interest and the benefit of additional 
procedures in reducing that risk, and the governmental interest 
in not providing such additional procedures. 

EPA's APA style hearing procedures would certainly satisfy 
procedural due process considerations as well as statutory 
requirements if employed for hearings on field citations. By 
statute APA adjudication procedures are not required. The 
violations are by definition minor in nature and should involve 
simple and straightforward factual and legal situations. In 
fact, EPA believes these procedures provide significantly more 
process than required by the Fifth Amendment for hearings on 
field citations, and are proposed as an option not because of due 
process considerations but because of the expected benefits of 
having a single set of procedures governing all administrative 
penalty proceedings under the Clean Air Act. 

EPA is also considering certain revisions to the Part 22 
procedures to account for the minor nature of the violations at 
issue under the field citation program. First, EPA is 
considering using presiding officers that are not administrative 
law judges. As with other non-APA situations, the agency's 
presiding officers would conduct the hearings and take other 
actions. This would help to conserve the agency's administrative 
law judge resources for APA hearings, with no expected reduction 
in the accuracy of the hearing process. The Agency is also 
considering such revisions as making the prehearing conference 
optional and changing the deadline for default from twenty to 
thirty days following service.

</DOC>

<DOCNO> FR940503-1-00036 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940503-1-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, EPA is considering limiting appeals from the 
presiding officer to the EAB. Appeals from the initial decision 
on a field citation would not be of right, but would be at the 
discretion of the EAB. For example, a party seeking an appeal 
from the initial decision would file a motion with the EAB 
seeking leave to appeal. There would only be an appeal to the 
EAB if they granted such motion, or reviewed the initial decision 


sua sponte

. Absent such review by the EAB, the initial decision 
of the presiding officer would become the final order of the 
Agency. EPA expects that in the typical situation the EAB would 
not hear an appeal from either party given the expected nature of 
the minor violations. Appeals typically would be limited to 
cases with unique factual or legal circumstances. This would 
conserve the Agency's resources for hearing and deciding 
administrative appeals, and allow their use for APA cases and 
more complex cases. At the same time, where appropriate the EAB 
could hear an appeal. This would minimize the chance of an 
erroneous deprivation of an individual interest, and at the same 
time maximize the efficient use of scarce Agency resources. 



2. Modified 40 CFR Part 28_Consolidated Rules of Practice Governing the Administrative Assessment of Civil Penalties

Under Various Statutes 



Under the second option considered and proposed by the 
Agency, the hearings on field citations would be conducted 
pursuant to the procedures in EPA
s proposed non-APA, 
consolidated rules of practice for the administrative assessment 
of penalties, with appropriate revisions to conform with the 
Clean Air Act. (See proposed 40 CFR part 28, 56 FR 29996 (July 
1, 1991)). In a separate rulemaking, the Agency would propose to 
amend Part 28, where appropriate, to make that regulation 
applicable to field citations. 



Basis for Hearing Procedures 



The rules of procedure proposed as 40 CFR Part 28 are 
intended to consolidate under uniform rules of practice the 
following non-APA administrative penalty programs that are 
currently administered by the Agency: Class I administrative 
penalties under sections 309(g) and 311(b)(6) of the Clean 
Water Act, section 109(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental 
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), and 
section 325(b) of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-toKnow Act (EPCRA); and administrative penalties
under section 
1423(c) of the Safe Drinking Water Act and sections 325 (c) and 
(d) of EPCRA. 

Part 28 was proposed to consolidate and harmonize certain 
EPA procedural rules and guidance for the administrative 
assessment of civil penalties under various statutes, where 
Congress gave EPA authority to conduct non-APA hearings. In line 
with this Congressional intent, proposed part 28 is designed to 
provide streamlined administrative penalty procedures that are 
designed to assure the protection of basic constitutional rights. 
Section 113(d)(3) of the Act explicitly states that hearings on 
field citations are not subject to the APA provisions for 
hearings (5 U.S.C. 554), and that recipients of a field 
citation must be provided a reasonable opportunity to be heard 
and to present evidence.
 

The basic hearing requirements of the field citation program 
are therefore similar in structure to those programs proposed for 
inclusion under 40 CFR part 28.
 

Inclusion of hearings on CAA field citations in part 28 
would be consistent with the goals stated by EPA when it proposed 
these consolidated rules for non-APA hearing procedures under 
various statutes_reduction of confusion by Agency decision 
makers and enforcement staffs, provision for the regulated 
community of an essentially uniform set of procedural rules, and 
conformity with Congress' and EPA's desire to employ expedited 
penalty assessment procedures. At the same time, the proposed 
part 28 procedures are designed to provide non-APA hearing 
procedures under a wide range of statutory provisions, involving 
civil penalties ranging from $5,000 for each day of violation to 
$25,000 per violation. This contrasts with the field citation 
program, involving no more than $5,000 per day of violation for 
minor violations of the Act or its implementing regulations. In 
addition, adoption of part 28 procedures for the field citation 
program would also involve two separate procedures for 
administrative assessment of civil penalties under the CAA, parts 
28 and 22. Adding the field citation program to part 28, 
however, would promote a greater potential for non-APA multimedia 
enforcement actions by providing a common administrative forum. 
As with the part 22 option, the currently proposed part 28 
procedures would be modified in certain ways to account for 
certain aspects of the field citation program. These are 
discussed later. 



Proposed Hearing Procedures 



Under the modified part 28, the field citation would be 
issued as an administrative complaint. Unlike proposed part 28, 
however, the field citation complaints would not require 
certification by an Agency attorney. Within thirty days after 
service of the citation, the Respondent must file a response 
requesting a hearing. A 90-day extension of time to respond may 
be granted by the complainant. 


As in part 22 practice, the Respondent may simultaneously 
pursue informal settlement and a hearing. During settlement 
negotiations, the parties may informally exchange information, if 
appropriate. For example, the Agency may supply copies of the 
documentation used to support its case and the Respondent might 
provide any evidence that would tend to disprove the allegations 
or to mitigate the requested penalty.

EPA's experience has been that the great majority of its 
administrative penalty actions conclude by a settlement. Part 28 
explicitly provides settlement procedures and, unlike part 22, 
would allow field citation cases to settle by the simple 
agreement of the parties in a consent order or, if the Respondent 
chooses, by the Respondent's payment of the amount requested by 
the Agency in the field citation itself (or in any superseding 
pleading). Under part 28, a settlement may be reached at any 
time, even before the deadline for a response has passed. In 
cases of settlement, there is no further administrative review, 
and the Respondent waives its rights to appeal the administrative 
penalty to the appropriate federal court. Pursuant to the 
language of the CAA, consent orders under the Part 28 field 
citation program would allow for the compromise, modification, or 
remission by the Agency, with or without conditions, of any 
penalty requested in the administrative complaint. 


Part 28 would be revised such that failure of the Respondent 
to affirmatively request a hearing in the response would lead to 
assessment of the penalty proposed in the field citation. Under 
section 113(d)(3) of the Act, the penalty assessed by the field 
citation becomes final if the Respondent fails to request a 
hearing within the time required by the implementing regulation. 
Part 28 would also be revised to require Agency counsel to file a 
written explanation for the penalty imposed by the field citation 
no later than five days following a Respondent's default by 
failure to request a hearing. This would ensure an adequate 
administrative record for the penalty imposed. 

Upon the request of a party, or on his own initiative, the 
Presiding Officer may make a summary adjudication of the 
allegations, without further proceedings, whenever he finds that 
there are no material facts in dispute and that a party is 
entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In the same manner, the 
Presiding Officer may accelerate the transmittal of his 
recommended decision to the Regional Administrator if there is no 
compelling need for additional fact-finding on remedy issues. 

Either party may request a summary determination or an 
accelerated recommended decision at any time after service of the 
response, up until thirty days before the time set for a hearing. 
Alternatively, the Presiding Officer may summarily determine any 
of the allegations after the time for the exchange of information 
has run, and after he has examined the entire administrative 
record. The Presiding Officer may accelerate the transmittal of 
the recommended decision, upon finding liability in a summary 
determination or upon stipulation as to liability by the parties, 
if there is no need for further fact-finding as to remedy. 

In reaching a recommended decision, the Presiding Officer is 
required to consider the statutory penalty assessment criteria 
listed in section 113(e) of the Act. These criteria include the 
size of the business; the economic impact of the penalty on the 
business; the Respondent's full compliance history; the 
Respondent's good faith efforts to comply; the duration of the 
violation as established by any credible evidence; payment by the 
Respondent of penalties previously assessed for the same 
violation; the economic benefit of noncompliance; the seriousness 
of the violation; and such other factors as justice may require. 
The Respondent is afforded the opportunity to provide evidence of 
the relevant statutory criteria, including evidence concerning 
the duration of the violation. Part 28 would be revised to 
incorporate these statutory penalty assessment criteria. 

Other than by a motion for summary determination or by a 
motion for an accelerated recommended decision, a field citation 
may be settled preliminarily by a consent order. The consent 
order includes a penalty settlement which has the force and 
effect of a final order issued by the Regional Administrator, 
except that the consent order is not appealable. Part 28 would 
be revised to provide that, consistent with the authority under 
section 113(d)(2)(B), the consent order may be issued with or 
without conditions. 

Part 28 establishes deadlines to ensure that administrative 
cases do not languish. 

Not later than thirty days following the Respondent's 
response, the Presiding Officer is required to hold a prehearing 
conference at which the parties meet to consider matters which 
may expedite the disposition of the proceedings. The Presiding 
Officer also sets the time and place for further proceedings and 
schedules an information exchange during the prehearing 
conference, if one is requested. 

The authority to require discovery is limited to exchange of 
certain information. The required information that may be 
exchanged is limited to: (1) Documents intended to be introduced 
at the proceedings under Part 28 that have not already been filed 
with the Hearing Clerk; (2) witness lists, qualifications of 
expert witnesses and the subject matter of intended witness 
testimony; and (3) information known to the Respondent relating 
to the Respondent's inability to pay a civil penalty or relating 
to any economic advantage accruing to the Respondent as a result 
of his alleged violations of law. Part 28 would be revised to 
expand this last category, by allowing the Agency to include the 
Respondent's good faith efforts to comply with the applicable 
Clean Air Act requirements. Other forms of discovery, including 
interrogatories and the taking of depositions, are not permitted 
unless stipulated to by the parties. 

Except for supplemental materials, the information exchange 
must conclude no later than sixty days following the prehearing 
conference. Since new information concerning witnesses or 
documents may develop after an information response deadline 
passes, the parties may supplement the original information, but 
not later than seven days prior to the hearing.

In order to provide the parties with incentives to cooperate 
during the discovery phase, there are both mandatory and 
discretionary sanctions for failure to comply with the 
information exchange requirements. For example, if a party fails 
to timely provide the name and all supporting information 
regarding any witness it intends to present at a hearing, such 
witness may not be presented. Similarly, if a party fails to 
timely produce a document it intends to introduce at such a 
hearing, that document may not be introduced to prove the truth 
of what it asserts. Part 28 would be revised to provide that if 
the Respondent fails to timely provide information regarding its 
good faith efforts to comply with the Act, then that information 
may not be used by the Respondent at the hearing. The Presiding 
Officer may also impose additional appropriate sanctions on a 
party that fails to fully comply with these requirements. 

In conducting the hearing, the Presiding Officer may limit 
the number of witnesses and the scope and extent of both the 
direct examination and cross-examination. Cross-examination is 
limited to the scope of the direct examination. The Presiding 
Officer may take testimony in the form that is the most efficient 
under the circumstances. No matter what form of testimony is 
permitted, however, the Presiding Officer will make adequate 
provision to ensure that each party retains its right of cross-examination if the witness is available to testify
or is subject 
to a subpoena. 

The hearing is generally limited to resolving disputed 
allegations as to liability. Remedy issues are generally 
addressed in the parties' closing arguments, unless there is a 
compelling need for remedy testimony. Such need could arise 
where the underlying facts which are material to the statutory 
penalty assessment factors are disputed. 

As is typical in administrative proceedings, strict 
adherence to the Federal Rules of Evidence is not required under 
part 28. Testimony or documentation that is ``relevant, material 
or of significant probative value'', including hearsay, is 
admissible, as long as the witness presenting the information is 
subject to cross-examination by any opposing party. The 
Presiding Officer has the discretion to take official notice of 
certain facts, exclusive either of facts relating to settlement 
or relating to a person's challenge to a final State or Agency 
action. 

The proposed part 28 rules contemplate that each party will 
have an opportunity to make an opening statement (with the Agency 
making its opening statement first); that the Agency will put on 
its prima facie case; and that the Respondent thereafter will 
have an opportunity to present its defense. 

Participants may present oral closing arguments at the 
discretion of the Presiding Officer, and such arguments may 
address both liability and remedy issues. The participants may 
submit supporting documentation regarding remedy. If the 
Presiding Officer does not allow oral closing arguments, the 
Agency anticipates that he would solicit the submission of 
written proposed recommended findings of fact and conclusions of 
law as to liability and remedy. 

Under part 28, the Presiding Officer would be required 
to: (1) Certify the administrative record as complete and as 
being in compliance with the requirements of part 28; (2) make 
the administrative record available to the Regional 
Administrator; and (3) prepare and transmit a recommended 
decision to the Regional Administrator. The Presiding Officer's 
authority to prescribe a remedy would be limited to recommending 
the withdrawal of the field citation or recommending the issuance 
of an order.

The decision of the Regional Administrator must be based on 
applicable law and on the administrative record, which includes 
the recommended decision of the Presiding Officer. Upon receipt 
of the Presiding Officer's recommended decision, the Regional 
Administrator may either withdraw the field citation, if he 
concludes that the Agency has not sustained its burden of proof, 
or issue an order granting the requested relief, in whole or in 
part. Any decision by the Regional Administrator must be in 
writing, supported by clear reasons based on the administrative 
record and applicable law, and include a statement of the right 
to judicial review and of the procedures and deadlines for 
obtaining judicial review. If the Regional Administrator rejects 
the recommendation of the Presiding Officer, the explanation for 
that rejection must be in writing and made part of the 
administrative record. 
The Regional Administrator's order must include a discussion 
of the applicable penalty factors which were considered in the 
assessment of a penalty under the Act, and set forth the penalty 
assessed. Part 28 would be revised to limit the Regional 
Administrator's authority to issue a default order by excluding 
those based on a default for failure to respond or to request a 
hearing (which would become final, pursuant to section 113(d)(3) 
of the CAA, by operation of law). 
Any order issued by the Regional Administrator becomes 
effective thirty days after issuance, unless either the 
Environmental Appeals Board (the Board) suspends the 
implementation of the order pursuant to its 

sua sponte

 review 
authority, or a judicial appeal is taken pursuant to section 113(d)(4) of the Act. No person may stay the effective
date of 
an administrative order by attempting to appeal it 
administratively. 
The decision of the Regional Administrator to issue a final 
decision constitutes final Agency action (subject to 

sua sponte

 
review by the Board) on its effective date, for purposes of any 
judicial appeal. Withdrawal of the field citation, however, 
would not constitute final Agency action, unless it occurs 
without prejudice. 
The Board, on behalf of the Administrator, is authorized to 
review part 28 rulings by Regional Administrators, 

sua sponte,

 on 
issues of law. The Board may not become involved in factfinding; second guess the penalty amount issued by the Regional
Administrator; or review orders issued on consent. The Agency anticipates that this review authority will be exercised
infrequently, but believes that the authority is necessary to 
ensure consistent Agency positions on the applicable law. 
The Board may withdraw a Regional Administrator's order if 
it determines that the Agency lacks jurisdiction to assess a 
penalty, or if it determines that the Respondent is not liable 
under applicable law. The Board shall remand an administrative 
order if it determines that elements of the Respondent's 
liability are different from those found by the Regional 
Administrator. Under such a remand, the remedy should be 
conformed to the amended conclusions of law. The order shall 
also be remanded if the Board finds that the order fails to 
provide clear reasons for the decision. The Board shall allow 
the Regional Administrator's order to issue unchanged if it finds 
that the order is legally sufficient and it agrees with all 
material conclusions of law. 
Parties are not permitted under part 28 to administratively 
appeal adverse rulings, either to the Regional Administrator or 
to the Environmental Appeals Board. 


Procedural Due Process 


EPA recognizes that the administrative imposition of 
penalties for minor violations of the Act may affect 
constitutionally protected interests of those against whom 
actions have been taken. Part 28 includes precautions to ensure 
that individuals subject to a finding of liability for a civil 
penalty will have all of the protections that due process of law 
requires. These precautions include an impartial Presiding 
Officer; the right to a hearing on liability, with a right of 
cross-examination; and a final Agency action based solely on the 
administrative record and applicable law. For a detailed due 
process discussion concerning part 28, see the July 1, 1991 
proposal at 56 FR 29997 

et seq

. 
The part 28 procedures provide all of the procedure 
necessary to meet constitutional due process requirements under 
the leading Supreme Court case, 

Mathews

 v. 

Eldridge

, 424 U.S. 319 
(1976). In that case, the Supreme Court set out a three-part 
test for determining whether the administrative procedure 
provided to an individual prior to the deprivation of a property 
interest by the government meets the due process requirements of 
the Fifth Amendment. The 

Mathews 

test involves balancing the 
magnitude and nature of the individual interest at stake; the 
benefit of additional procedures in reducing the risk of 
erroneous deprivation of that interest; and the governmental 
interest in not providing such additional procedures. Although 
the part 28 procedures streamline the adjudicatory process 
provided for analogous administrative hearings under the APA, 
those procedures do not eliminate any of the constitutional 
elements of such hearings. The part 28 procedures grant the 
person receiving the field citation a full opportunity to review 
the evidence of minor violations, as well as address the 
propriety of the assessed penalty. Since these procedures allow 
for complete adjudication of liability issues, there would be 
little benefit to the Respondent in more extensive or attenuated 
procedures, and disproportionate cost to the Agency and to the 
public. 
The field citation program will typically address violation 
and penalty issues that are simple and straightforward matters. 
Since these cases should not be complex, their resolution is 
well-suited to the expedited administrative penalty proceedings 
mandated by Congress and included in part 28. For these reasons 
as well as those noted in the July 1, 1991 proposal, EPA believes 
the proposed part 28 procedures would adequately provide for due 
process in the assessment of penalties under the field citation 
authority. 


3. 40 CFR Part 59_Rules Governing Administrative Hearings on 
Field Citations 


The third Agency proposal involves using new procedures for 
conducting administrative hearings requested by persons to whom 
field citations have been issued under section 113(d) of the Act. 


Background 


Section 113(d) of the Act provides that any person to whom a 
field citation is issued may either elect to pay the penalty 
assessment or to request a hearing, in accordance with procedures 
specified in the regulation which implements the field citation 
program. Section 113(d) further provides that the penalty 
assessed in the field citation becomes final unless the person to 
whom it is issued requests a hearing within the time specified in 
the implementing regulation. Section 113(d)(3) explicitly 
provides that the hearing is not subject to the requirements of a 
formal adjudicatory hearing under the Administrative Procedure 
Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 554 or 556. Instead, the hearing 
must provide a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present 
evidence. 



Basis for Hearing Procedures

The Congressional intent to afford the Respondent a less 
formal, non-APA hearing is explicit in the legislation. Although 
such hearing must provide the Respondent with a reasonable 
opportunity to be heard and to present evidence, such hearing 
shall not be subject to the procedures under sections 554 or 556 
of the APA. 
On July 1, 1991, the Agency proposed non-APA consolidated 
rules of practice for the administrative assessment of civil 
penalties at 40 CFR part 28 (56 FR 29,996). Although the part 28 
rules are intended to consolidate all other non-APA 
administrative penalty programs currently administered by the 
Agency under uniform rules of practice, the field citation 
program was excluded from those proposed rules. Programs covered 
by part 28 include Class I administrative penalties under section 
309(g) of the Clean Water Act, section 109(a) of CERCLA, and 
section 325(b) of EPCRA; and administrative penalties under 
section 1423(c) of the Safe Drinking Water Act and sections 
325(c) and (d) of EPCRA. 
There are several compelling reasons for developing hearing 
procedures that are better suited to the field citation program 
than those provided either by proposed part 28 or the 
consolidated APA rules of practice promulgated at 40 CFR part 22, 
45 FR 24363 (April 9, 1980). The part 28 rules provide many of 
the same procedural rights in part 22 that are designed to 
comport with APA requirements. These rights include prehearing 
conferences; subpoena authority; discovery rights; and cross-examination. The major differences between the
two rules are 
that part 28 provides for a Presiding Officer instead of an 
Administrative Law Judge; imposes page limits on written 
submissions; and eliminates the right to appeal the decision of 
the Presiding Officer or Regional Administrator to the 
Administrator. 
Under the part 28 procedures, resolution of an 
administrative penalty proceeding could take seven or eight 
months. This lengthy time period would diminish the utility of 
the field citation program in addressing minor violations quickly 
and efficiently. 
Most of the penalty programs covered by the part 28 
procedures provide for maximum per day per violation penalties 
well in excess of the $5,000 limit authorized for field 
citations. Using the part 28 hearing procedures could result in 
spending more money to adjudicate field citation appeals than 
would be justified by the expected monetary recovery. 
Based on the foregoing reasons, the Agency is considering 
using a more streamlined set of hearing procedures drafted 
specifically to apply to the field citation program. 
Today's proposal relies on some of the part 28 provisions 
which ensure expedited proceedings. This proposed option also 
relies on the rules at 33 CFR subpart 1.07, 43 FR 54186 (November 
20, 1978), which govern hearings on statutory penalties imposed 
by the Coast Guard. 
Under section 311(b)(6) of the Clean Water Act, the Coast 
Guard is authorized to assess a civil penalty of up to $5,000 
against any owner, operator or person in charge of a facility or 
vessel that discharges either oil or a hazardous substance. The 
violator may challenge the penalty assessment at a hearing 
governed by the subpart 1.07 procedures. The similarities 
between this program and the field citation program make the 
subpart 1.07 regulations an appropriate model for hearing 
procedures. These Coast Guard procedures were found to satisfy 
due process under the Constitution in 

U.S.

 v. 

Independent Bulk 
Transport

, 480 F. Supp. 474 (1979). 
The part 28 regulations were used as a model for the 
following major provisions of the proposed part 59 hearing 
procedures: the Presiding Officer's duties and responsibilities; 
consent orders; prehearing conference; information exchange; 
post-hearing submissions; and review of the Regional 
Administrator's decision by the Environmental Appeals Board. 
The subpart 1.07 regulations were used as a model for the 
following provisions: certain preliminary matters; confidential 
business information; hearing procedures; and the scope of the 
Regional Administrator's authority for issuing a decision. 
The relevant part 28 provisions were selected to ensure 
fundamental fairness while streamlining the procedures available 
to Respondents. The Presiding Officer under part 28 is 
authorized to exercise a great deal of discretion to expedite the 
presentation of evidence in administrative cases. In that 
regard, the most pertinent authority adopted from the part 28 
regulations allows the Presiding Officer to limit the number of 
witnesses and the extent of direct examination and cross-examination. 
The provisions adopted from subpart 1.07 further streamline 
the administrative process for penalty assessment, while 
guaranteeing fundamental rights. The Respondent is allowed under 
subpart 1.07 to submit written arguments and evidence in lieu of 
requesting a hearing. Such response allows the Presiding Officer 
to make a determination on the administrative record without the 
delays inherent in conducting the prehearing conference, 
information exchange, and hearing. 
Additionally, the subpart 1.07 provisions allow the 
Presiding Officer to determine the appropriate form of testimony: 
oral; written; or recorded. Subpart 1.07 also simplifies the 
hearing process by allowing the Respondent to present facts, 
statements, documents and other relevant evidence. The 
relatively informal nature of the proceeding provides the 
opportunity for expedited penalty assessment. 


Proposed Hearing Procedures 


Under proposed part 59, the field citation would be issued 
during or shortly after an inspection by an EPA officer or 
employee. The citation is subsequently served upon the 
Respondent by first class mail or equivalent. Within thirty days 
after service of the citation, the Respondent must either request 
a hearing; provide written evidence and arguments in lieu of a 
hearing; or pay the penalty.

<TEXT>
 

If the Respondent fails either to request a hearing or to 
submit evidence in lieu of a hearing, he would be in default 
under section 113(d)(3) of the Act. That section states that the 
penalty assessed by the field citation becomes final where the 
Respondent fails to request a hearing within the time required by 
the implementing regulation. In the case of a Respondent's 
default by failure to request a hearing, Agency counsel is 
required under this proposal to file, within ten days, a written 
justification for the penalty imposed by the field citation. 
At any time prior to final Agency action, a disputed field 
citation may be settled by a consent order. The consent order 
may conclude the citation in whole or in part, and may contain 
conditions. Upon service, the consent order constitutes a final 
order that is not appealable. Additionally, the field citation 
may be revoked by the Agency, in whole or in part and without 
prejudice, prior to payment of the penalty. 
Under the proposed part 59 procedures, the prehearing 
conference is optional. The purposes of the conference, which 
must be held no later than thirty days after the Respondent's 
response, are to simplify issues and to attempt to reach 
stipulations of fact. The Presiding Officer may also set the 
time and place for the hearing and schedule an information 
exchange during the prehearing conference. Within twenty days 
following the prehearing conference, the Presiding Officer may 
issue a written prehearing order to memorialize the rulings made 
at the conference. 
Each party has the authority to require that the other 
provide it with certain information. The information that may be 
exchanged is limited to: (1) Documents intended to be introduced 
at the hearing that have not already been filed with the Hearing 
Clerk; (2) witness lists, qualifications of expert witnesses and 
the subject matter of intended witness testimony; and (3) 
information known to the Respondent relating to the Respondent's 
inability to pay a civil penalty, economic benefit of 
noncompliance; and good faith efforts to comply with the 
applicable Clean Air Act requirements. 
The hearings on field citations will be conducted by an 
impartial Presiding Officer who, in most cases, will be the 
Judicial Officer or the Regional Judicial Officer. Such Judicial 
Officer will be an Agency employee who may perform other 
functions within the Agency, but who has no prior connection with 
the case being presided over. 
The Presiding Officer and other officials involved in 
deciding the case are prohibited under today's rule from engaging 
in ex parte contacts with interested parties both inside and 
outside of the Agency. The prohibition applies to the Regional 
Administrator as well as to his advisors. 
The Presiding Officer is required to schedule a hearing 
expeditiously. An extension of time for scheduling the hearing 
is only authorized for good cause and if no prejudice results. 
The hearing procedures provide that the Respondent may be 
represented by counsel. The Agency representative initiates the 
hearing by introducing into evidence the field citation and the 
relevant material supporting its issuance. The Respondent or his 
counsel may then provide facts, statements, arguments, documents, 
testimony and other exculpatory evidence responding to the 
evidence presented. Although the Presiding Officer may limit the 
number of witnesses and determine the appropriate form of 
testimony, either party has the right to cross-examine a witness 
who has provided direct testimony. The opportunity for rebuttal, 
and response to rebuttal, falls within the Presiding Officer's 
discretion. 
Consistent with the informal nature of the proceedings, the 
Presiding Officer is not bound by the Federal Rules of Evidence. 
The Presiding Officer is, however, authorized to take 
administrative notice of pertinent matters. 
Section 113(e) of the Act contains criteria that must be 
used in assessing whether the field citation penalty is 
appropriate. Under today's proposal, the Presiding Officer is 
required to consider these criteria when reviewing the assessed 
penalty. Those criteria include: The size of the business; the 
economic impact of the penalty on the business; the Respondent's 
full compliance history; the Respondent's good faith efforts to 
comply; the duration of the violation as established by any 
credible evidence; payment by the Respondent of penalties 
previously assessed for the same violation; the economic benefit 
of noncompliance; the seriousness of the violation; and such 
other factors as justice may require. Some or all of these 
criteria may be relevant to the issues presented in the case 
before the Presiding Officer. The burden of proof with respect 
to these criteria is assigned to the party with access to 
information concerning the particular factor. Consequently, the 
Agency must provide evidence regarding the duration and 
seriousness of the violation, and the Respondent must provide 
evidence regarding the other criteria. 
EPA is considering adopting a similar approach where the 
penalty assessment becomes final under section 113(d)(3) of the 
Act because a respondent fails either to request a hearing or 
submit evidence in lieu of a hearing within the time required by 
the regulations. When such a default occurs, the penalty 
assessed by the field citation becomes final by operation of 
section 113(d)(3). As previously discussed, under the proposed 
procedures, Agency counsel would then submit a written 
justification for the record concerning the amount of the 
assessed penalty. EPA is considering adopting a regulatory 
presumption that in cases of such default the penalty assessed in 
the field citation would be presumed to be appropriate with 
respect to those penalty assessment criteria where the 
regulations would place the burden of going forward on the 
respondent if a hearing had been requested. The purpose of this 
presumption would be to clarify the requirements of section 
113(e) in such a default situation, and at the same time, reflect 
the authority of the agency to establish reasonable presumptions 
based on the circumstances of a case. 
The hearing will normally be tape recorded, unless the 
parties decide otherwise in the interests of preventing a serious 
delay in the proceedings. Tape recording the proceedings is 
desirable to develop a clear administrative record for later 
review. Transcription of the proceedings is not required, but 
may be made by a party, at its own expense, or may be ordered by 
the Presiding Officer. Any party causing a transcript to be made 
must provide copies to the other party and to the Presiding 
Officer. The transcript then becomes a part of the 
administrative record. 
The parties are permitted to submit a written statement for 
the Presiding Officer's consideration within a reasonable time 
after the hearing. The written statements, which may only 
address matters raised at the hearing, may be in the form of 
proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. 
As soon as practicable after the hearing, the Presiding 
Officer is required to prepare a recommended decision in the case 
based on substantial evidence in the administrative record as a 
whole. The recommended decision will recommend either that the 
field citation be affirmed, modified or withdrawn. The 
recommended decision must be filed with the Regional 
Administrator. Within a reasonable time after receipt of the 
recommended decision, the Regional Administrator may either 
affirm, reverse, modify or remand the case to the Presiding 
Officer for further proceedings. The Regional Administrator may 
compromise, modify, or remit the penalty assessed by the field 
citation, with or without conditions.

The Regional Administrator must provide the legal and 
factual basis for any modification of the recommended decision. 
Withdrawal of the penalty assessment, which does not constitute 
final Agency action, occurs without prejudice to the Agency. 
Any order issued by the Regional Administrator becomes 
effective thirty days after issuance, unless either the 
Environmental Appeals Board (the Board) suspends the 
implementation of the order pursuant to its 

sua sponte

 review 
authority, or a judicial appeal is taken pursuant to 
section 113(d)(4) of the Act. 
The Board, on behalf of the Administrator, is authorized to 
review the decisions of Regional Administrators, 

sua sponte,

 on 
issues of law. The Board may not review fact-finding; second 
guess the penalty amount issued by the Regional Administrator; or 
overturn orders issued on consent. 
The Board may withdraw a Regional Administrator's order if 
it determines that the Agency lacks jurisdiction to assess a 
penalty, or if it determines that the Respondent is not liable 
under applicable law. The Board shall remand an administrative 
order if it determines that elements of the Respondent's 
liability are different from those found by the Regional 
Administrator. Under such a remand, the remedy should be 
conformed to the amended conclusions of law. The order shall 
also be remanded if the Board finds that the order fails to 
provide clear reasons for the decision. The Board shall allow 
the Regional Administrator's order to issue unchanged if it finds 
that the order is legally sufficient and it agrees with all 
material conclusions of law. 
Within thirty days after the penalty assessment becomes 
final, the Respondent may appeal to the appropriate United States 
District Court. 


Procedural Due Process 


As noted previously, 

Mathews

 v. 

Eldridge

 requires 
consideration of three factors in evaluating whether the proposed 
administrative procedures satisfy the Fifth Amendment's due 
process requirements. The relevant factors are: (1) The private 
interest that will be affected; (2) the risk of an erroneous 
deprivation of this interest and the probable value, if any, of 
additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and (3) the 
Government's interest including the function involved and the 
fiscal or administrative burdens that the additional procedural 
requirements would entail. 
The private interest at stake is payment of a civil penalty. 
The maximum amount that may be assessed, $5,000 per day of 
violation, is significantly less than the penalty that may be 
assessed under the other civil penalty authorities in the Act. 
In addition, EPA's proposed rules would establish a maximum 
amount that might be assessed in any one citation. It is also 
expected that the actual penalties assessed per violation will 
generally be less than the statutory maximum. The circumstances 
expected in the great majority of cases is a proper focus for 
assessing due process concerns. 

Chemical Waste Management, Inc.

 
v. 

U.S.E.P.A.,

 873 F.2d 1477, 1484 (D.C. Cir. 1989). In 
addition, the straightforward and simple hearing procedures 
proposed would minimize the cost for private parties to contest 
assessment of a field citation. 
The procedures proposed in this third option should minimize 
the risk of an erroneous deprivation of property. Under the 
proposed rules, a respondent would be served with a citation that 
clearly identified the alleged violation and provided a 
reasonable opportunity to request a hearing. If a hearing was 
requested, it would be presided over by a neutral agency official 
that had no prior connection with the action, including 
investigative or prosecutorial functions. The Presiding Officer 
also would have no interest in the outcome of the action. This 
offers the respondent a hearing before a neutral and unbiased 
tribunal, and clearly minimizes any risk of error from 
institutional or other bias. 
The parties have the right to discover, before the hearing, 
all the information necessary to provide for a fair and adequate 
hearing. Parties may obtain the names of all witnesses that will 
be presented, along with a brief description of the witnesses 
qualifications and the subject matter of the testimony, and they 
may obtain each document that will be introduced by the other 
party. Since the violations involved will be minor in nature and 
are expected to typically involve simple and straightforward 
factual and legal circumstances, this should provide a respondent 
with all the information needed to adequately contest a citation. 
In addition, the citation would typically have been issued 
immediately upon or shortly after the violation is detected, 
providing respondents with ample opportunity to investigate the 
circumstances of an alleged violation. In these circumstances, 
additional discovery would not be expected to significantly 
advance the accuracy of the final decision.

The hearing allowed under the proposed rules would provide 
respondents with several options in presenting relevant evidence, 
limited by the authority of the Presiding Officer to determine 
the manner of testimony that is most efficient in resolving an 
issue. Written and oral testimony are both acceptable, as well 
as testimony provided by other means. Respondents may offer any 
facts, statements, explanations, documents, testimony or other 
exculpatory evidence that is relevant to issues at the hearing. 
A right of cross-examination is provided, although EPA is 
considering limiting cross-examination to situations determined 
appropriate by the Presiding Officer. This form of hearing 
clearly meets the requirements of section 113(d)(3), and provides 
respondents with a fair opportunity to present evidence and 
argument on relevant issues. Given the simple and 
straightforward nature of the minor violations expected in the 
program, additional procedures would not significantly reduce the 
risk of an erroneous imposition of a civil penalty. A right to 
cross-examine witnesses, as compared to limiting cross 
examination to situations where deemed appropriate by the 
Presiding Officer, would allow for additional cross-examination 
only where the Presiding Officer, a neutral official, had already 
determined it was inappropriate. A right to cross-examination 
would increase the accuracy of the hearing only in those limited 
cases where a Presiding Officer had mistakenly denied crossexamination. EPA expects this kind of mistake would occur

infrequently, and a right to cross-examine, therefore, would not 
significantly increase the accuracy of the proceedings in the 
great bulk of cases. 

The Presiding Officer is afforded substantial discretion to 
tailor the hearing procedures to the individual facts and 
circumstances of each case. The Presiding Officer, may, for 
example, hold prehearing conferences, regulate the course of the 
hearing, including the form and extent of testimony and crossexamination, take official notice of matters, and request
a 
written statement from the parties post-hearing. This 
flexibility should increase the accuracy of the proceedings, and 
reduce the value of mandating additional procedures. See 
Chemical Waste Management, 873 F.2d at 1483. 


After the hearing, parties may submit written statements to 
the Presiding Officer, such as recommended findings of fact and 
conclusions of law, at the discretion of the Presiding Officer. 
The Presiding Officer then prepares and transmits a recommended 
decision that is forwarded to the Regional Administrator for 
issuance of a final decision. There is no administrative appeal 
to the Administrator, except the Board may review a decision sua 
sponte. This provides for at least one level of review above the 
Presiding Officer, and in some cases a second level of review by 
the Board, establishing a clear mechanism to correct potential 
errors in the recommended decision. It should also promote 
consistency within a region, as well as national consistency if 
and when issues of national importance arise.






Additional procedures, such as a right to comment on the recommended decision, would not significantly add to the
accuracy of these procedures. Respondents would already have had a full 
opportunity to present their position on the issues at the 
hearing, and could submit proposed findings and conclusions at 
the request of the Presiding Officer. All of this would be in 
the administrative record, and available to the Regional 
Administrator. Additional right to comment would not be expected 
to be of significant benefit, given the minor nature of the 
factual and legal issues involved. 

The government's primary interest, as previously described, 
is to implement an effective citation program without an 
unnecessary drain on limited enforcement resources. An effective 
program calls for issuance of a citation immediately or shortly 
after detection of a violation, with a final resolution 
accomplished shortly after issuance of the citation. This will 
maximize the deterrent effect of the field citation program, and 
minimize the amount of resources necessary to achieve this goal. 
The proposed hearing procedures meet these objectives by using 
simplified and streamlined procedures, with a relatively limited 
time needed to complete all procedures necessary to a final 
decision on assessment of a penalty. 

Since the field citation program fills a gap in EPA's 
enforcement program, it is reasonable to expect that a large 
number of citations will be issued in each region, addressing 
simple, easy to prove violations and assessing small monetary 
penalties. While the nature of the violations and the penalty 
should act to limit the number of hearings requested by 
respondents, it is reasonable to expect that a significant number 
of hearings may be requested if EPA issues a large number of 
citations. In that context, any additional procedures run the 
risk of significantly increasing the administrative burden and 
length of field citation proceedings. This could quickly make 
the program inefficient and a drain on government resources, 
given the small potential penalties and the limited environmental 
concerns involved for most minor violations.

EPA believes the proposed part 59 procedures faithfully 
implement Congressional intent for the field citation program, 
and satisfy procedural due process concerns. This belief is 
bolstered by judicial acceptance of similar procedures in a 
variety of related situations. See Chemical Waste Management, 
Inc. (court upheld EPA's non-APA hearing procedures for issuance 
of administrative orders concerning corrective action orders 
under 
section 3008(h) of RCRA); 

United States

 v. 

Independent Bulk 
Transport, Inc.

, 480 F. Supp. 474 (S.D. NY 1979) (court upheld 
non-APA hearing held by Coast Guard in assessing less than the 
maximum $5,000 civil penalty per unlawful discharge under the 
Federal Water Pollution Control Act). 


H. Design of Field Citations 


Field citations will be of a standardized format nationwide, 
and will be issued in triplicate. The following information 
shall be included on the field citation: 
(1) Date and time of violation(s); 
(2) Inspector's name, title, and office; 
(3) Name and address of source; 
(4) Name and telephone number of owner/operator or his/her 
representative; 
(5) Specific violation(s); 
(6) Location/source/description of violation(s); 
(7) Proposed penalty; 
(8) Notification of the 30-day deadline to either pay the 
penalty or request a hearing; 
(9) Address to which payment must be sent; 
(10) Address to which a request for a hearing must be sent; 
(11) Inspector's signature; 
(12) Space for signature indicating receipt; and 
(13) Citation number. 
The actual format of the citation will be published in the 
Agency's guidance document. 


V. Section-by-Section Analysis 


A. Section 59.1 Purpose and Scope 


This section of the proposed rule states EPA's authority to 
develop a field citation program and explains that procedures 
developed in this part will be used in administering the field 
citation program. The section acknowledges the twin goals of the 
field citation program: ensuring compliance with the Act and 
providing for expedited enforcement. 


B. Section 59.2 Use of Number and Gender 


This section clarifies that words in the singular also 
include the plural, and those in the masculine gender also 
include the feminine, and vice versa. 


C. Section 59.3 Computation of Time 


This section provides that any time period specified in 
these rules shall begin the day following the event from which 
the period begins, and shall include Saturdays, Sundays, and 
Federal legal holidays. 


D. Section 59.4 Definitions 


This section provides definitions of terms used in part 59. 


E. Section 59.5 Determination of Minor Violation and 
Maximum Proposed Penalty 


This section describes the process that will be used to 
determine whether a violation is minor. Each violation will be 
evaluated according to the proposed list of factors provided. A 
violation will be determined as minor through evaluation of the 
factors, considered as a whole. 
Criminal violations will not be addressed under the field 
citations program. Criminal enforcement action may be pursued 
for the violations described in section 113(c). These violations 
include ``knowing'' violations such as knowing endangerment, in 
which a person knowingly releases a hazardous air pollutant, with 
the knowledge that the release is placing another person in 
imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury. 
This section also provides the proposed maximum civil 
penalty for a minor violation as $5,000 per day of violation, and 
defines a field citation's total proposed penalty as the sum of 
each individual minor violation's proposed penalty. 


Subpart B_Rules Governing Hearings on Field Citations 


F. Section 59.6 Scope of These Rules 


This section outlines the purpose of Subpart B, which is to 
establish streamlined administrative procedures for conducting 
hearings under section  113(d)(3) of the Act. 


G. Section 59.7 Issuance and Service of Field Citations 


This section describes who may issue field citations and 
what should be contained therein. The section also details 
requirements for service of a field citation. The statute limits 
the authority to issue field citations to EPA officers or 
employees.

to a civil penalty, with or without conditions. Thereafter, the Presiding Officer shall enter a consent order in accordance
with the terms of the consent agreement. The consent order may be filed at any time prior to final Agency action, and
constitutes a final order that may not be appealed.



O. Section 59.15 Prehearing Conference



This section provides the Presiding Officer with the discretion to conduct a prehearing conference, and sets forth
matters appropriate for discussion during such conference.



P. Section 59.16 Information Exchange



This section outlines the responsibilities of each party, both in serving information requests and in providing
information requested by the other party. The exchange of information shall proceed according to the schedule established
by the Presiding Officer.



Q. Section 59.17 Subpoenas



This section establishes the Presiding Officer's right to subpoena the testimony of witnesses or the production
of documents, or both, and establishes the manner by which subpoenas shall be served.



R. Section 59.18 Hearing Procedures



This section outlines the basic requirements for the conduct of the proceeding. It also establishes the rights and
responsibilities of the Presiding Officer and of each party in presenting or receiving evidence, testimony, responses
and rebuttals. Either party has the right to cross-examine any witness who has provided direct testimony, however,
such crossexamination is limited to the issues presented in direct testimony. The overall format for the proceeding
is informal, and the Presiding Officer has the discretion to offer opportunities for rebuttal and response to rebuttal.




S. Section 59.19 Penalty Assessment Criteria



This section establishes the criteria which shall be considered by the Presiding Officer in reviewing the penalty
amount requested by the field citation, and assigns the burden of proof for each criterion either to the Respondent
or to the Agency.



T. Section 59.20 Transcript or Recording of Hearing



This section provides that all hearings will be tape recorded unless both parties agree and the Presiding Officer
directs otherwise. A verbatim transcript will not normally be prepared, however, this section outlines the requirements
and procedure to be followed if either party or the Presiding Officer should specially request that such a transcript
be prepared.

W. Section 59.23 Decision of the Regional Administrator 



The Regional Administrator must issue a final decision that either affirms, reverses, or modifies the recommended
decision, or remands the case to the Presiding Officer for further proceedings. This section describes the procedures
the Regional Administrator shall follow in concluding actions taken under this part. The Regional Administrator's
decision must be based on applicable law and the administrative record, which includes the recommended decision
of the Presiding Officer. The final decision becomes effective thirty days following the date of issuance. 



X. Section 59.24 Sua Sponte Review 



This section describes the role of the Environmental Appeals Board in reviewing the Regional Administrator's decision.
The thirty-day period for this review coincides with the thirty-day period before a final decision becomes effective.




Y. Section 59.25 Payment of Assessed Penalty 



This section outlines the deadline and method of payment for civil penalties assessed pursuant to this part. 



VI. Administrative Requirements 



A. Executive Order 12866 



Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 

(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;


(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 

(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 

(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 

Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory
action.'' As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations
will be documented in the public record. 



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.,

 whenever an agency is required to publish a general notice of rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare
and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis that describes the impact of the rule on small
entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions). The Administrator
may certify, however, that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. In
such circumstances, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. The expected impact of this proposed rule
is negligible. The rule creates no new requirements, small or large, and is procedural in nature. Accordingly, I hereby
certify that these proposed regulations will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
These regulations, therefore, do not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. 



C. Paperwork Reduction Act 



These proposed rules do not contain any information collection requirements subject to OMB review under the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

).

 59.17 

Subpoenas. 



(a) The Presiding Officer may, on his own initiative or at 
the request of either party, subpoena the testimony of witnesses 
or the production of documents, or both, for a hearing conducted 
pursuant to  59.16.

recipient in the manner prescribed for the service of a field 
citation pursuant to  59.7(d). 

(c) The Presiding Officer shall file a copy of the subpoena 
with the Hearing Clerk. 



 59.18 

Hearing procedures. 



(a) The Presiding Officer shall conduct a fair and 
impartial proceeding in which each party has a reasonable 
opportunity to be heard and to present evidence. Each witness 
shall testify in the form determined by the Presiding Officer to 
be most efficient in resolving an issue. Forms of testimony 
include oral testimony provided in person or by other means, and 
written or otherwise recorded testimony. The Presiding Officer 
may limit the number of witnesses and the scope and extent of any 
direct examination or cross-examination as necessary to protect 
the interests of justice and conduct a reasonably expeditious 
hearing. 

(b) The Agency representative shall present the field 
citation and the evidence supporting its issuance, and any other 
material that is pertinent to the issues to be determined by the 
Presiding Officer. The respondent has the right to examine, and 
to respond to or rebut, the field citation and any proffered 
evidence and material. The respondent may offer any facts, 
documents, testimony or other exculpatory evidence which bears on 
appropriate issues, or which may be relevant to the size of an 
appropriate penalty. Any opposing party has a right of crossexamination after the introduction of a witness' direct

testimony. A party shall not cross-examine regarding a matter 
that is outside of the scope of the direct examination. The 
Presiding Officer may require the authentication of any written 
exhibit or statement. 

(c) At the close of the respondent's presentation of 
evidence, the Presiding Officer may allow the introduction of 
rebuttal evidence by the Agency representative. The Presiding 
Officer may allow the respondent to respond to any such evidence 
submitted by the Agency. 

(d) In receiving evidence, the Presiding Officer is not 
bound by the Federal Rules of Evidence. In evaluating the 
evidence presented, the Presiding Officer shall give due 
consideration to the reliability and relevance of each item of 
evidence. 

(e) The Presiding Officer may take notice of matters which 
are not subject to reasonable dispute and are commonly known in 
the community, or are capable of accurate and ready determination 
by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be 
questioned. Prior to taking notice of a matter, the Presiding 
Officer shall give each party an opportunity to show why notice 
should not be taken. In any case in which notice is taken, the 
Presiding Officer shall place in the record a written statement 
of the matter as to which notice was taken with the basis for 
such notice, including either a statement that the parties 
consented to notice being taken or a summary of any party's 
objections. 



 59.19 

Penalty assessment criteria. 



(a) The Presiding Officer shall consider the following 
criteria in reviewing the penalty proposed in the field citation: 

(1) The size of the business; 

(2) The economic impact of the penalty on the business; 

(3) The respondent's full compliance history, and good faith 
efforts by the respondent to comply; 

(4) The duration of the violation as established by any 
credible evidence (including evidence other than the applicable 
test method); 

(5) Payment by the respondent of penalties previously 
assessed for the same violation; 

(6) The economic benefit of noncompliance; 

(7) The seriousness of the violation; and 

(8) Such other factors as justice may require. 

(b) The burden of going forward with respect to criteria in 
paragraphs (a)(1), (2), (3), (5), and (6) of this section, is on 
the respondent. The burden of going forward with respect to 
criteria in paragraphs (a)(4) and (7) of this section is on the 
Agency. The burden of going forward with respect to criterion in 
paragraph (a)(8) of this section is on the party proffering such 
factors. Failure of the respondent to meet its burden with 
respect to any applicable criterion shall mean that a penalty 
amount that is appropriate in light of other criteria shall also 
be appropriate in light of such criterion for which the 
respondent failed to meet its burden. 



 59.20 

Transcript or recording of hearing. 



(a) The hearing shall be tape recorded unless the parties 
agree and the Presiding Officer directs otherwise. A verbatim 
transcript will not normally be prepared, but may be ordered by 
the Presiding Officer if deemed necessary to permit a full and 
fair review and resolution of the case. If not so ordered by the 
Presiding Officer, a party may, at its own expense, cause a 
verbatim transcript to be made. The party causing the verbatim 
transcript to be made shall submit one (1) copy to the Presiding 
Officer and one (1) copy to the other party. 

(b) The transcript or recording of the hearing, together 
with all written submissions made by the parties, shall become 
part of the administrative record for the proceeding. 



 59.21 

Post-hearing submissions. 



The Presiding Officer may request, within a reasonable time 
following the conclusion of the hearing, that the parties submit 
a written statement for his consideration including, but not 
limited to, proposed recommended findings of fact and conclusions 
of law. Such written statement shall be limited to the matters 
raised at the hearing. 



 59.22 

Recommended decision. 



(a) Within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the 
hearing, the Presiding Officer shall: 

(1) Certify the administrative record as complete; 

(2) Make the administrative record available to the 
Regional Administrator; and 

(3) Prepare and transmit a recommended decision to the 
Regional Administrator. The recommended decision shall address 
all material issues of fact or law properly raised by the 
respondent, and shall recommend that the field citation be 
affirmed, modified or withdrawn. The recommended decision shall 
be based on substantial evidence in the administrative record, 
taken as a whole, and shall provide citations to relevant 
material contained in that record. 

(b) The Presiding Officer shall file a copy of the 
recommended decision with the Hearing Clerk at the time of its 
transmittal to the Regional Administrator. The Hearing Clerk 
shall immediately serve each party with a copy of the recommended 
decision.

 59.23 

Decision of the regional administrator. 



(a) Following receipt of the recommended decision, the Regional Administrator shall issue a final decision that
either affirms, reverses, or modifies the recommended decision or remands the case to the Presiding Officer for further
proceedings. The Regional Administrator's decision may compromise, modify, or remit the penalty requested by the
recommended decision, with or without conditions. 

(b) If the Regional Administrator rejects the recommendation of the Presiding Officer, in whole or in part, the decision
shall include a written explanation for that rejection that states each point of disagreement with the recommendation
of the Presiding Officer. If the Regional Administrator determines that the proposed penalty assessment must be
withdrawn, such action may be done without prejudice. 

(c) The Regional Administrator's decision shall be supported by clear reasons and by the administrative record and
shall include a statement of the right to judicial review and of the procedures and deadlines for obtaining judicial
review. The decision shall be comprised of the Regional Administrator's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and
assessment of an appropriate penalty after taking into account all applicable statutory and penalty factors. 

(d) For purposes of appeal, the final decision of the Regional Administrator pursuant to this part shall be deemed
issued five (5) days following the date of mailing of the decision to the respondent. The final decision becomes effective
thirty (30) days following its date of issuance unless an appeal is taken pursuant to section 113(d)(4) of the Clean
Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7413(d)(4) before that date. The issuance of the final decision by the Regional Administrator pursuant
to this section constitutes final Agency action on its effective date. 



 59.24 

Sua Sponte review. 



The Environmental Appeals Board may, on its own initiative, within thirty (30) days of the date of issuance by the Regional
Administrator of a final decision pursuant to  59.23, suspend implementation of such decision for the purpose
of reviewing its conclusions of law or its sufficiency under  59.23(c). The Environmental Appeals Board, after
such review, may amend its conclusions of law, withdraw the field citation, remand the case for appropriate action
to the Regional Administrator, or may allow the decision to issue unchanged. In any action in which the Environmental
Appeals Board acts pursuant to this section, the provisions of  59.23 shall apply, except that: 

(a) The Regional Administrator who issued the final decision shall be deemed the recommending Presiding Officer
for purposes of  59.22; 

(b) Upon suspension of the final decision, the Environmental Appeals Board shall be deemed the Regional Administrator
for purposes of  59.23; 

(c) The Regional Administrator's decision, except for its findings of fact, shall be deemed a recommended decision;
the Regional Administrator's findings of fact are findings for purposes of this part and are not subject to review
by the Environmental Appeals Board; 

(d) If the Environmental Appeals Board does not amend the Regional Administrator's conclusions of law nor determine
that the order is insufficient under  59.23(c), the Regional Administrator's penalty determination is not
subject to review. If the Environmental Appeals Board amends the Regional Administrator's conclusions of law or
determines insufficiency, the Regional Administrator's penalty determination shall be remanded by the Environmental
Appeals Board to the Regional Administrator for appropriate action, except that if the Environmental Appeals Board
determines that the respondent is not liable for the violations alleged under applicable law, then the Environmental
Appeals Board shall withdraw the field citation and the final decision of the Regional Administrator without remand;


(e) If the Environmental Appeals Board allows the final decision to issue unchanged, the requirements of  59.23(c)
shall not apply; 

(f) If the Environmental Appeals Board amends or remands the decision, the requirements of  59.23(c) to make
findings of fact and to assess the appropriate penalty shall not apply; and 

(g) The Environmental Appeals Board's decision to suspend implementation of a final decision shall not be deemed
final Agency action for the purposes of  59.23(d). 



 59.25 

Payment of assessed penalty. 



Except as may otherwise be provided by applicable law and the provisions of any applicable consent order, the respondent
shall pay, within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the final decision, any civil penalty assessed pursuant
to this part by forwarding to the address provided by the field citation a cashier's or certified check, payable to
``Treasurer, The United States of America.''

Regulations Governing Awards Under Section 113(f) of the Clean Air Act 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule sets forth criteria and procedures for the granting of awards as authorized by an amendment to the
Clean Air Act (the Act). The amendments added section 113(f) to the Act, which authorizes the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency discretion to pay an award, not to exceed $10,000, to any person who furnishes information
or services which lead to a criminal conviction or a judicial or administrative civil penalty enforced under section
113 of the Act for a violation of titles I, III, IV, V, or VI of the Act, as amended. Section 113(f) also authorizes the
Administrator to prescribe, by regulation, additional criteria for eligibility for such an award. This proposed
rule sets forth such additional criteria for eligibility. In addition, this proposal establishes procedures to
petition the Agency for consideration for an award, including what information must be submitted in such petitions,
and describes award criteria. This proposed rule also provides an assurance of confidentiality as to the identity
of persons who provide information or services on a confidential basis. Furthermore, to implement the goal of the
program, this rule provides direction for providing information or services regarding potential violations. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Statutory Requirements 



Section 113(f) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, (the Act), 42 U.S.C. 7413(f), authorizes the Administrator discretion
to pay awards to persons who provide information or services regarding potential violations of the Act. Pursuant
to section 113(f), the information or services must result in a criminal conviction or a judicial or administrative
civil penalty for a violation of titles I, III, IV, V, or VI of the Act, enforced under section 113 of the Act, before an
award may be issued. 

The statute specifically authorizes awards only for enforcement actions brought under section 113 of the Act. Thus,
information or services which assist actions brought under State law (e.g, enforcement of SIPs under State law or
citizen suits brought under State law), under other sections of the Act (i.e., citizen suits under section 304), or
under other statutes, do not qualify for an award under this provision. However, in cases where the Agency intervenes,
overfiles, or otherwise takes over the enforcement action under the authority of section 113, the awards authority
may become applicable.

Under section 113(f) of the Act, any officer or employee of the United States or any State or local government who furnishes
information or renders services to the Agency in the performance of an official duty is ineligible for an award. Also,
section 113(f) authorizes the Administrator to prescribe, by regulation, additional criteria for eligibility
for an award. In response, the regulation proposed today prescribes additional criteria for eligibility. The regulation
proposed today also prescribes general criteria for the Agency to consider in determining whether and how much of
an award is appropriate and procedures to be followed by persons who want to be considered for an award. Additional
authority for these provisions is provided by section 301(a) of the Act. 



II. The Proposal 



Today's proposed rule prescribes regulations for EPA's awards authority under section 113(f) of the Clean Air Act,
as amended, 42 U.S.C. 7413(f). The proposed rule sets forth general eligibility criteria, criteria to be used in considering
petitions for awards, the procedures for petitioning consideration for an award, and other matters designed to assist
the Administrator in exercising her discretion in this area. The goal of this proposal is to assist in the implementation
of an awards program that would encourage citizens to cooperate with and voluntarily assist the EPA's Clean Air Act
enforcement efforts and thereby deter violations. Inherent in a program for awards are concerns regarding the confidentiality
of the identity of those who provide information or services and the need to evaluate the quality of such information
or services. This proposal is intended to address those concerns. 



A. Application of Proposal 



The EPA intends that this proposed regulation will apply only after promulgation. Petitions for an award based on
information or services provided to the EPA after the passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Amendments)
but before the regulation is promulgated may be processed using the proposed criteria as nonbinding guidance. The
EPA will not consider a petition for an award based on information or services provided entirely prior to enactment
of the Amendments. 



B. Eligibility Criteria 



As discussed above, section 113(f) renders certain persons ineligible for an award, and also authorizes the Administrator
to prescribe additional eligibility criteria. In response, this proposed rule categorically excludes EPA employees
from eligibility to receive an award. The proposed regulation further delineates eligibility limits for employees
of, and others who have a contractual relationship with, federal, State, or local governments. Thus under the proposal,
officers, employees, contractors, and grantees will be ineligible to receive an award if at the time they come into
possession of the information or render services which constitute, in whole or in part, the basis of the award, they
were performing an official duty. Furthermore, any members of the immediate family of those ``performing their official
duty'' are likewise ineligible. 

The EPA believes these provisions will help ensure that employees and others contractually obligated to the EPA or
other governmental entities will fulfill their obligation and will not withhold information that they would otherwise
provide to the government. The proposed provisions also address the concern that such persons could indirectly benefit
by passing information obtained while performing their official duty to family members, who could then use that information
to petition for an award. The concern addressed here is protection of the integrity of compliance and enforcement
activities. By declaring such persons ineligible for an award, the proposed regulation seeks to ensure that the awards
program will not create an incentive for employees to abuse access to information and authority otherwise unavailable
to the public. The term ``immediate family member'' is purposely not defined in the proposed regulation, as the EPA
prefers to maintain its discretion in referencing other sources of law and otherwise evaluating the circumstances
of the particular case in making its award determination. 

So that persons who may receive awards are aware that certain persons are ineligible to be paid an award, the proposal
requires that a certificate of eligibility be signed by the person before the Administrator may pay the award. This
requirement assists the EPA in assuring that an award is not paid to ineligible persons. 



C. Addresses for Tips 



Tips from citizens to the US EPA and State and local air pollution control agencies provide useful information on the
possible existence or extent of a violation. Since the goal of the awards program is to encourage citizens to cooperate
with and voluntarily assist EPA enforcement efforts, the proposal provides the addresses to which information may
be sent. The information or services provided may or may not lead to eligibility for an award. Providing such information
does not create an obligation on the Agency to issue an award, or vest in any person a right to such award. Nevertheless,
the Administrator encourages all persons to provide any information they have regarding violations of the Act to
the appropriate persons listed in Appendix A. Such information improves the Agency's ability to enforce the Act.
The EPA encourages persons to provide the information or services to State and local agencies as well. Although completion
of an enforcement action by a State or local agency under authority other than section 113 of the Clean Air Act cannot
lead to an award paid by the U.S. EPA under section 113(f), it is important that information be provided to State and
local agencies. In most situations, the U.S. EPA will defer to State enforcement authorities to address violations
in a timely and appropriate manner. However, persons who provide information or services to a State or local agency
may become eligible for an award if the EPA overfiles or otherwise takes over the enforcement action.

D. Confidentiality 



Because today's proposal contemplates the EPA receiving and using information and services from private sources
for enforcement activities, the EPA is also proposing to maintain as confidential, upon request, the identity of
persons providing information or services. The EPA believes this assurance of confidentiality will encourage persons
to assist the EPA in its efforts to enforce compliance with the Act. In this regard, the proposed rule provides, upon
request, confidential treatment by the EPA consistent with this proposal, existing law and other EPA regulations.
Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(6) & (7), the confidentiality of the identity
of those providing information and services will be protected from FOIA requests consistent with existing law. The
assurance of confidentiality extends to petitions for awards submitted to the EPA. To ensure confidential treatment
of such petitions, it is important that persons submitting petitions to the EPA specifically request confidentiality
at or prior to the time of providing information or services, and to renew such request at the time of submitting a petition.




E. Petitions for Awards 



Because the information or services provided would be instrumental to the successful prosecution of the EPA's enforcement
action, in many cases EPA personnel will be aware of persons potentially eligible for an award, even without a petition
being submitted. The EPA expects that in many such situations, award determinations may be made without submission
of a petition. 

Today's proposal recognizes, however, that a person may wish to petition the Agency for consideration for an award
and authorizes such petitions. To ensure that such petitions contain sufficient information for the purpose of evaluation,
and to ensure that petitions are directed to the appropriate EPA office, the proposal sets forth award petition procedures
and requirements. 



Timing of Petitions 



The proposed rule requires petitions for consideration to be submitted in writing no later than one year after the
judgment of conviction or assessment of a civil penalty. Petitions may be submitted at any time prior to the judgment
or assessment, but no award determination will be made before the judgment of conviction is entered or a judicial or
administrative civil penalty is finally assessed, agreed, or ordered. Again, payment and the amount of any award
granted is within the Administrator's unfettered discretion. The granting of an award is a gratuity, and not an entitlement.




Certification of Eligibility 



The proposed regulation also requires that the petition contain a certification of compliance with the eligibility
criteria set forth in the regulation. A statement signed by the person to be considered for an award attesting to having
read the eligibility requirements and attesting that the person to be considered for an award is not ineligible to
receive an award would meet this requirement. This certification is important to the award determination process
because the EPA recognizes that it may be difficult for the Administrator to determine with certainty whether a person
meets all eligibility criteria. However, the Act prohibits payment of an award to certain persons. Therefore, the
proposal requires a certification of eligibility be signed before the Administrator may pay an award.

F. Criteria for Awards 



Under the Act, the Administrator has discretionary 
authority whether to pay an award and to determine the amount of 
an award. The proposed regulation does not constrain this 
discretion. Although the proposed rule permits petitions for 
consideration for an award, whether an award is ultimately 
granted will turn on the exercise of the Administrator
s 
unfettered discretion, including the application of factors 
described in this proposed regulation. These factors include 
whether the information or services constituted the initial, 
unsolicited notice of the violation to the government, whether 
the government would have obtained knowledge of the violation in 
a timely manner absent the information or services, the 
importance of the case, the severity of the violation, the 
potential for or existence of actual or threatened harm to 
persons or the environment, the willingness to assist in the 
government
s enforcement action(s) regarding the violation(s), 
the value of the assistance in comparison to that given by any 
other persons or sources of information or services and, in part, 
the amount of money available to the EPA through appropriations. 

Furthermore, the rule is not intended to discourage self-auditing within facilities nor is it intended to encourage

concealment of information about violations or problems within a 
facility by an employee from an employer. Thus, the regulation 
sets forth the additional criterion of whether payment of the 
award would improperly create incentives against the timely and 
appropriate identification of such a violation to either the 
employer or the government. 



G. Timing of Award Consideration 



As mandated by section 113(f), persons may not be 
considered for an award unless and until such time as the 
information or services provided leads to a judicial or 
administrative civil penalty or a criminal conviction under 
section 113 of the Act. 



H. Prepayment Offers 



The proposed regulation makes clear the distinction 
between the Awards program and paid informant programs or 
contractual relationships that may be created by the Agency. The 
EPA's employees do not have the authority under this proposal or 
this statutory provision to promise that an award will be paid 
nor to promise consideration or recommendation for an award. 



I. Request for Public Comment 



The EPA is interested in public comment on all aspects of 
this proposed rule. The EPA is particularly interested in 
comments on: (1) The provision for confidentiality of identity 
for persons who provide information or services; (2) the 
eligibility exclusions and eligibility criteria for an award; (3) 
petitions for consideration; and (4) the criteria for awards 
determinations. 



III. Administrative Requirements 



A. Executive Order 12866



Under Executive Order 12866, (58 
FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must 
determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and 
therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the 
Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory 
action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 

(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or 
more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, 
productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health 
or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; 

(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere 
with an action taken or planned by another agency; 

(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, 
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations 
of recipients thereof; or 

(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal 
mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth 
in the Executive Order. 

Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been 
determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory action''. 
As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes 
made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be 
documented in public record. 



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Compliance 



Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify 
that this attached rule, if promulgated, will not have an 
economic impact on small entities because no additional costs 
will be incurred. 



C. Paperwork Reduction Act 



Since this proposed rule does not create any new information 
requirements or contain any new information collection 
activities, no clearance is necessary from OMB under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

 65.571 


Purpose and scope. 


(a) This regulation implements section 113(f), 42 U.S.C. 
7413(f), the ``citizen award'' provision of the Clean Air Act, as 
amended (the Act). As authorized in section 113(f), of the Act the 
Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the 
Agency) is authorized to pay up to $10,000, as may be available 
from appropriations, to any person who provides information or 
services leading to a criminal conviction or a judicial or 
administrative civil penalty, enforced under section 113, for any 
violation of Titles I, III, IV, V, or VI of the Act. The goal of 
the program is to encourage citizens to cooperate with and 
voluntarily assist the Agency's enforcement efforts and thereby 
deter noncompliance. 
(b) Providing information or services to the Agency by any 
person does not create any obligation on the Administrator to 
issue an award or to pay compensation for such assistance. 
Neither the Act nor these regulations create an entitlement to 
the payment of an award. The determinations whether to pay an 
award, and in what amount, are matters which remain by statute in 
the exclusive and unfettered discretion of the Administrator. 


 65.572 


Definitions. 


The terms used in this part are defined in the Act or in 
this section as follows: 
(a) 

Administrative penalty. 

Any amount finally assessed, 
agreed or ordered to be paid into the U.S. Treasury pursuant to 
an administrative enforcement action under section 113 of the 
Act. 
(b) 

Certification of Eligibility. 

A statement signed by the 
person to be considered for an award attesting to having read the 
eligibility requirements and attesting that the person is not 
ineligible to receive an award. 
(c) 

Criminal conviction. 

A judgment of conviction entered 
in U.S. District Court on a verdict or finding of guilty, or by a 
plea of guilty, including a plea of nolo contendere, in an action 
brought under section 113 of the Act (as defined at 28 U.S.C. 2901(f)). 
(d) 

Judicial penalty. 

Any amount finally assessed, agreed 
or ordered to be paid into the U.S. Treasury by a court of the 
United States pursuant to a judicial enforcement action under 
section 113 of the Act.

Regulation of Fuels and Fuel Additives: Individual Foreign Refinery Baseline Requirements for Reformulated Gasoline



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA is proposing to amend the reformulated gasoline regulations to define criteria and procedures by which foreign
refiners establish individual refinery baselines that reflect the properties and volume of the gasoline that was
produced at a foreign refinery in 1990 and imported for use within the United States. EPA is seeking comments on a wide
range of matters in this proposal, including the air quality effects of the proposed approach. Where the requisite
showing is made through a petition process, importers of reformulated gasoline produced at the foreign refinery
would be allowed to use the individual foreign refinery baseline values to demonstrate compliance with the reformulated
gasoline standards with regard to gasoline produced at that foreign refinery and imported into the United States
only during the period 1995 through 1997 and only up to a volume of gasoline each year that equals the foreign refinery's
1990 import volume, and subject to certain limitations and conditions that are proposed as well. This amendment would
allow imported reformulated gasoline to be evaluated relative to individual refinery baselines in a manner that
is similar to that applicable to reformulated gasoline produced at domestic refineries. Individual foreign refinery
baselines could be used only with reformulated gasoline under this proposal, and such baselines could not be used
with conventional gasoline. 



EPA specifically states that it seeks comments on the proposed approach for foreign refinery baselines and on any
underlying assumptions, as well as any other options for regulating imported reformulated gasoline that would be
fair to all regulated parties and would achieve the environmental benefits intended for reformulated gasoline by
the Clean Air Act.

Background 



On December 15, 1993 the EPA Administrator issued the final regulations implementing the reformulated gasoline
and anti-dumping programs (the Final Rule), as prescribed by section 211(k) of the Clean Air Act (the Act). See 59 FR
7716 (February 16, 1994). 

Under the final rule, compliance by refiners and importers with certain reformulated gasoline and anti-dumping
standards is measured against baselines that are intended to reflect 1990 gasoline quality. Domestic refiners are
required to establish individual refinery baselines of the quality and quantity of the gasoline that was produced
by the refiner in 1990. Domestic refinery baselines must be calculated using, in hierarchical order based on the availability
of data, 1990 gasoline test data (Method 1), 1990 blendstock test data (Method 2), or post-1990 blendstock and/or
gasoline test data (Method 3). 

Under the rule, domestic importers of foreign-refined gasoline are treated differently. They are required to establish
baselines of the quality and quantity of 1990 gasoline that they import using 1990 gasoline test data (Method 1) if
available. If Method 1 data are not available, importers are assigned a baseline approximating average gasoline
quality in the United States in 1990_the statutory baseline.

1

 EPA anticipates that most importers, like most domestic refiners, lack the actual 1990 testing data necessary to
establish a baseline using Method 1. As a result, EPA expects most importers will be assigned the statutory baseline,
with the consequence that most gasoline produced at foreign refineries will be evaluated using the statutory baseline.
The baseline-setting scheme is specified in 40 CFR 80.91 through 80.93 and is discussed in the Preamble to the final
rule at 59 FR 7791 (February 16, 1994). 





Before January 1, 1998, refiners and importers have the option of certifying reformulated gasoline using either
the ``simple'' model or ``early use of the complex model.'' Under either of these reformulated gasoline certification
approaches, compliance with certain standards is determined in relation to the baseline established for each refinery
or importer. Under the simple model, the annual average levels for sulfur, T-90, and olefins are limited to each
refinery's or importer's baseline levels for these parameters.

2

 Under early use of the complex model (in contrast to mandatory use of the complex model beginning in 1998) refinery-
or importer-specific standards for VOC, toxics, and NO

X

 emissions performance are set in part using refiner or importer baseline levels for sulfur, T-90, and olefins.

3

 






Beginning on January 1, 1998, only the complex model may be used to certify reformulated gasoline, and the basis for
all compliance with the reformulated gasoline complex model standards is determined in relation to 1990 statutory
baseline gasoline. See   80.41(i)(2)-(i)(3). As a result, beginning in 1998 refiner or importer
baselines are no longer relevant to determining compliance with reformulated gasoline standards. 

Compliance with the standards for conventional gasoline (the ``anti-dumping'' standards) is measured against
refinery or importer baselines beginning in January 1995 and thereafter. See  80.101. As a result of the baseline-setting
requirements of the final rule discussed above, domestic refiners would determine compliance with the anti-dumping
standards in relation to refinery-specific baselines, while most or all importers of gasoline produced at foreign
refineries would determine compliance in relation to the statutory baseline.

In developing the final rule, EPA evaluated comments regarding the proposed approach for establishing baselines
for imported gasoline, including comments submitted on behalf of Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), the Venezuelan
national oil company, in response to the April 16, 1992 reformulated gasoline proposal, at 57 FR 13416. In their comments,
PDVSA said that the proposal for imported gasoline baselines is unfair in that it treats domestic and foreign refiners
differently. PDVSA also stated in its comments that this difference in treatment of domestic and foreign refiners
conflicted with the requirements of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). EPA officials held a series
of meetings on the foreign refiner baseline issue during the Fall of 1992 and during 1993. These included meetings
with PDVSA officials, regarding whether PDVSA has the data necessary to establish a baseline of the quality of its
gasoline that was used in the United States in 1990, and whether EPA could formulate an adequate enforcement scheme
for a program that included individual foreign refinery baselines. EPA also met with domestic refiners on this issue,
to hear their concerns, and with representatives of other agencies, primarily officials from the Office of the U.S.
Trade Representative and the State Department, to better understand the GATT requirements. EPA's February 26, 1993
reformulated gasoline proposal also invited comment on these issues. See 58 FR 11758. 

As a result of these comments and meetings, EPA considered provisions allowing foreign refiners to establish individual
refinery baselines in a manner similar to that required for domestic refiners. See discussion in the Preamble to the
final rule at 59 FR 7785-7788 (February 16, 1994). EPA was not prepared to adopt such provisions by the court ordered
deadline for the final rule of December 15, 1993, but it stated at that time that it would continue to consider this issue
and continue discussions with PDVSA. Since issuance of the final rule, EPA has continued to consider this question,
including the relationship of the GATT and the reformulated gasoline rule, and is seeking comments on its proposal
in this notice to allow foreign refiners to establish individual refinery baselines under limited circumstances.
While EPA does not necessarily agree with PDVSA position on GATT requirements, EPA desires to remove the uncertainty
in this regard and we believe the proposal does that in a manner fully protective of human health and the environment.




II. The Proposed Limited Use of Individual Foreign Refinery Baselines 



Under today's proposal, importers would be allowed limited use of a baseline established for an individual foreign
refinery to demonstrate compliance with the reformulated gasoline standards for gasoline produced at that foreign
refinery and imported for use in the United States. The use of individual foreign refinery baselines would be conditioned
and limited in the following ways: 

 EPA would have to specifically approve the baseline for the foreign refinery. In order to obtain a baseline,
the foreign refiner would have to submit a petition to EPA, which would include the same types of gasoline and blendstock
testing data and refinery modelling analyses that domestic refiners must submit. In addition, a foreign refiner
would have to support its baseline petition with a report prepared by an independent baseline auditor, and like for
domestic refiners EPA would have to approve the auditor. One key aspect of a foreign refiner's baseline petition is
that it would have to conclusively establish the quality and volume of gasoline that was used in the United States in
1990, and not just the refinery's overall gasoline quality in 1990. 

 Individual foreign refinery baselines could be used by importers only to demonstrate compliance with reformulated
gasoline standards and only prior to January 1, 1998. They could not be used to demonstrate compliance with anti-dumping
standards. 

 The total volume of imported reformulated gasoline that could be subject to the individual baseline for any
foreign refinery would be limited each year to the volume of that refinery's gasoline used in the United States in 1990.


 The importer would be required to establish that any imported gasoline that would be subject to an individual
foreign refinery baseline actually came from that refinery, through gasoline inspections and attest engagements
conducted by independent inspectors and auditors at the foreign refinery. 

 EPA inspectors would have to receive full access to the foreign refinery to conduct announced and unannounced
inspections and audits related to the individual foreign refinery's baseline or any gasoline produced at the foreign
refinery.

<TEXT>
 

These conditions and limits are discussed more fully below. 

Under the final rule, individual baselines are used to certify reformulated gasoline and demonstrate compliance
with the reformulated gasoline standards only during 1995 through 1997. Beginning January 1, 1998 all reformulated
gasoline compliance must be certified using the statutory baseline. See   80.41(h)-(j). This
constraint also would apply to importers of reformulated gasoline who under today's proposal had previously used
individual foreign refinery baselines. 

Importers would be able to use an individual foreign refinery baseline for reformulated gasoline for 1995 through
1997 only if all of these conditions and limits are fully met. If any condition is not met with regard to a specific foreign
refinery, then importers would not be allowed to use the foreign refinery's individual baseline. If any such conditions
are not met subsequent to the time the importer uses the individual foreign refinery baseline, then the importer would
be required to recalculate its compliance using the statutory baseline, even if the failure to meet the conditions
occurs during a subsequent averaging period. This potentially could expose the importer to substantial penalties
if subsequent use of the statutory baseline causes the importer to be in non-compliance with the reformulated gasoline
requirements.

4

 





EPA is proposing that importers who use a foreign refinery's individual baseline would use that baseline, and the
volume of the foreign refinery's reformulated gasoline involved, to calculate a new importer baseline for use during
that year. The total of the reformulated gasoline imported by the importer during the relevant averaging period would
then be evaluated against this new importer baseline to determine compliance by the importer with the reformulated
gasoline standards. This proposed method for using foreign refinery baselines is illustrated by the following example.


A hypothetical importer has been assigned the statutory baseline. During 1996 he imports reformulated gasoline
totalling 900,000 barrels of gasoline produced at hypothetical foreign refinery A, and 800,000 barrels of gasoline
produced at hypothetical foreign refinery B. Foreign refiner A has an individual refinery baseline, and the sulfur
baseline level is 400 ppm, and a baseline volume of 1,000,000 barrels.

5

 Foreign refiner B does not have an individual refinery baseline, and the importer would use the statutory baseline,
which for sulfur is 338 ppm, for the refinery B volume. The average sulfur content of the imported gasoline that was
produced at foreign refinery A was 375 ppm, and the average sulfur content of the imported gasoline that was produced
at foreign refinery B was 360 ppm. 





The hypothetical importer would calculate a new sulfur baseline of 370.80 ppm as follows: 








The hypothetical importer then would compute the average sulfur content of all gasoline imported during the year,
of 365.00 ppm, as follows: 








Because the 365.00 ppm overall average sulfur content of the gasoline imported is less than the 370.80 ppm calculated
baseline for the importer, the importer meets the sulfur standard applicable to the importer. Note that the imported
gasoline produced at foreign refinery A would not be required to separately meet the 400 ppm sulfur baseline applicable
to refinery A, and the imported gasoline produced at foreign refinery B would not be required to separately meet the
338 ppm sulfur baseline applicable to refinery B.

A. Establishing Individual Foreign Refinery Baselines 



In order to establish an individual baseline for a foreign refinery under this proposal, a petition would have to be
submitted to EPA in a manner analogous to the baseline submissions required for domestic refiners. The petition would
have to contain the Method 1, Method 2, and/or Method 3 data, collected and evaluated in the same manner as is required
of domestic refiners under  80.91. The baseline data would have to be submitted in the same manner as is required
of domestic refiners under  80.93, except that EPA is proposing to modify the requirements in  80.93 related
to the dates by which baseline submissions are due. 

Under  80.93 domestic refiners are required to submit data collected before December 15, 1993 by June 1, 1994,
or by September 1, 1994 if data is collected subsequent to December 15, 1993. As a result of the timing of this proposal,
these dates are not reasonable for baseline petitions for foreign refiners. EPA is therefore proposing that any petition
for an individual foreign refinery baseline would be required to be submitted to the Administrator within six months
following the date the individual foreign refinery baseline final regulation is signed. This approach is analogous
to the lead time afforded domestic refiners in the final rule for baseline submissions. 

Another departure from the baseline submission requirements of  80.93 is that baseline data for foreign refineries
would have to be submitted in such a manner that EPA could determine the quality and quantity of the gasoline produced
at the foreign refinery during 1990 that was used in the United States. Baseline submissions by domestic refiners
are not required to focus on the 1990 U.S. market share of refinery production, because it is assumed that all gasoline
produced at a domestic refinery is used in the United States, unless the refiner shows certain gasoline was exported.
This proposal that foreign refinery baseline petitions would be required to establish U.S. market gasoline quality
and quantity is critical, because the quality of a foreign refinery's U.S. market gasoline in many cases would be different
from the quality of the refinery's overall gasoline quality. Under the proposal, if EPA is unable to determine both
the quality and quantity of the gasoline that was produced by any foreign refinery in 1990 and used in the United States,
the individual foreign refinery baseline petition would be denied. 

The accuracy and completeness of the data and conclusions contained in the individual foreign refinery baseline
petition would have to be verified by an independent EPA-approved auditor, in the same manner as is required of domestic
refiners under  80.92. Thus, the auditor would have to be approved by EPA according to the criteria, specified
in  80.92, which include approval of the auditor's independence and technical ability. 

EPA is proposing that a petition for an individual foreign refinery baseline must be submitted by the foreign refiner.
EPA believes the foreign refiner is the most appropriate person to submit such a petition, because it is the foreign
refiner who will possess most or all of the information that would support such a petition. 

EPA also is proposing that the petition must contain a declaration by the owner or president of the foreign refiner
business that the information submitted in the petition is accurate and complete. EPA is further proposing that the
foreign refiner owner or president would be required to affirmatively declare that EPA auditors and inspectors will
be given full and immediate access to all refinery premises, for purposes of compliance with the EPA inspection requirements
EPA has proposed in  80.84(f). The declarations by the foreign refiner owner or president would be mandatory
conditions for EPA approval of any foreign refinery baseline petition. EPA is proposing this declaration requirement
in order to ensure that in each case of a foreign refiner seeking an individual baseline, refiner officials at the highest
levels of the business are aware of the refiner commitments that are necessary for use of a foreign refinery's baseline.




B. Establishing the Refinery-of-Origin 



EPA is proposing regulatory requirements that would, for any batch of imported gasoline claimed to be subject to an
individual foreign refinery baseline, establish the identity of the foreign refinery at which the gasoline was produced.
The proposed requirements would include the testing of samples of the gasoline in question collected subsequent
to loading into the ship at the port serving the foreign refinery, but before the ship leaves that port. These test results
from the foreign refinery loading point would then be compared with test results of samples of the gasoline in question
collected when the ship arrives at the United States port of entry. Sampling and testing of gasoline at the U.S. port
of entry is required by the final rule, at   80.65(e)-(f).

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940503-1-00065 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940503-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The proposed regulations include criteria for evaluating whether the test results of the gasoline samples from the
foreign refinery loading port match the test results of the gasoline samples from the U.S. port of entry. The test results
would have to agree, for each parameter included in the evaluation of reformulated gasoline, within the limits used
for comparing domestic refiner and independent laboratory test results, which are specified in  80.65(f).

The volume of gasoline contained in each shipment of imported gasoline claimed to be subject to an individual foreign
refinery baseline also would have to be confirmed. The inspection at the foreign refinery loading port would have
to establish the volume loaded onto the ship, which would be compared to the volume determination at the U.S. port of
entry. EPA is proposing that these two volume determinations, corrected for temperature and density, would have
to agree within one percent. EPA believes this level of correlation is appropriate, because it is well within the level
of correlation normally expected in commercial transactions. EPA understands that protests normally are initiated
if ship volume determinations in commercial dealings differ by 0.5%. Nevertheless, EPA requests comment as to the
appropriate level of correlation which should be required, and as to any other approach to confirming volumes that
would be preferable to that proposed. 
In the event any single parameter, or the volumes involved, would not agree in the manner proposed, the individual
foreign refinery baseline could not be used by the importer for the specific batch of imported gasoline for which there
is parameter value or volume disagreement. 
EPA believes that in most cases the gasoline contained in each compartment of a ship would constitute a separate batch,
because the gasoline would not be homogeneous across more than one compartment, and would therefore not meet the batch
definition of  80.2(gg). In consequence, EPA believes that in most cases the sampling, testing, and volume
determinations would have to be performed separately for each of a ship's compartments. In addition, it is EPA's understanding
that the current practice for inspecting the gasoline transported by ship is to separately sample each compartment,
even when the same grade of gasoline is being transported in more than one compartment of a ship. 
EPA also is proposing that the independent laboratory would be required to determine the refinery of origin, and thereby
establish whether the gasoline loaded onto the ship was in fact produced at that refinery. The laboratory also would
determine whether the foreign refinery's gasoline has been combined with gasoline produced at any other refinery.
Only gasoline that is produced at the foreign refinery or origin would be eligible for use with the foreign refinery's
baseline, yet it is possible that gasoline loaded onto a ship at a port serving a foreign refinery could have been produced
at a different refinery. For example, two refineries could be linked to a port by a common pipeline, or gasoline could
be produced at a foreign refinery and then transferred by ship to storage tanks located at a second foreign refinery.

The proposed requirements related to determining the refinery of origin would confirm that gasoline loaded into
a ship at the port serving a foreign refinery was in fact produced at the foreign refinery and therefore that the foreign
refinery's individual baseline would be applicable. This confirmation of the source refinery by the independent
inspector normally would require the review of documents that reflect all transfers and storage of the gasoline in
question from the point of production at the source refinery to the point of ship loading. The inspector thus would
be required to establish the refinery of origin and that there was no fungible mixing of the gasoline in question with
any gasoline produced at any other refinery prior to loading onto the ship. 
An additional proposed requirement that relates to establishing the refinery-of-origin for imported gasoline
is the proposal for attest engagements at the foreign refinery. This attest requirement would supplement the requirements
regarding an independent laboratory determination of the source refinery of gasoline. The focus of the attest engagement,
however, would be on the refinery operations while the independent laboratory's primary focus would be on the transportation
and storage of gasoline from the refinery to the point of ship loading. 

Under the proposed procedures, the attester would be required to confirm the overall production for the refinery
in question, and to confirm that the portion claimed to have been transferred to ships for shipment to the United States
was a part of that overall production. The attester also would be required to confirm the transfer of gasoline from
the refinery to the ships, and to identify the ships into which the gasoline was transferred. EPA requests comment
on whether these proposed attest procedures are appropriate and adequate.

EPA is proposing that the sampling, testing, and volume determinations at the foreign refinery loading port would
have to be performed by an independent laboratory that is U.S.-based. The proposed criteria for independence are
the same criteria that apply for the independent sampling and testing requirement for domestic refiners and importers,
and that are specified at  80.65(f)(2)(ii). Similarly, EPA is proposing that the attest requirements would
have to be fulfilled by certified public accountants (CPA's) that are United States citizens, or members of a firm
that is a U.S. corporation. 
The proposed requirements that the independent laboratories and CPA's be U.S.-based is intended to result in laboratories
and CPA's over which EPA may easily exercise jurisdiction. EPA's ability to inspect, obtain judicial enforcement,
or submit information requests under section 114 of the Clean Air Act is significantly more effective in the case of
a person that is a United States citizen or a United States corporation. These enforcement approaches may not be easily
available against non-U.S. corporations or citizens. EPA seeks comment on the proposed requirement that independent
laboratories and CPA's be U.S. corporations or citizens. 



C. The Volume Limitation on Use of Individual Foreign Refinery Baselines 



EPA is proposing that the total volume of imported reformulated gasoline that could be subject to the individual baseline
for any foreign refinery would be limited each year to the volume of that refinery's gasoline that was used in the United
States in 1990. It has been argued that this proposed volume constraint would limit any potential adverse environmental
effects of gasoline imported under individual foreign refinery baselines in comparison to the final rule, as is discussed
more fully below. 
The proposed volume constraint would apply separately to each foreign refinery having an individual baseline, and
would apply across all of the importers who import gasoline produced at each foreign refinery. Thus, for example,
if the gasoline produced at a particular foreign refinery having an individual baseline is imported by ten importers
during a specific year, the volume constraint applicable to that foreign refinery would apply to the ten importers
collectively. Any of the hypothetical refinery's gasoline that is imported that year beyond the proposed volume
constraint would be subject to the baseline otherwise applicable to the importer (normally the statutory baseline),
and the individual foreign refinery's baseline would not apply to this excess volume. 
EPA is proposing that the date gasoline is imported would be the criterion for determining which gasoline would qualify
for use of an individual foreign refinery baseline. In the event importers claim use of an individual foreign refinery's
baseline for a volume in excess of the proposed volume constraint, the gasoline that is first imported that equals
the volume constraint would receive use of the individual baseline. Thus, the proposed volume constraint would apply
based on the date the gasoline is imported into the United States, and not based on the date the gasoline is produced.
Beginning on January 1 of each year the volume constraint accounting would begin anew. 
EPA is not proposing any regulatory mechanisms that would provide importers a running accounting of the volume of
a particular foreign refinery's gasoline that has been imported subject to an individual refinery baseline. Moreover,
EPA would not know the total volume of imported gasoline claimed to be subject to any particular foreign refinery's
baseline until quarterly or annual reports are submitted to EPA. EPA expects that importers would make private arrangements
with their foreign refiner business partners to track the volume of each foreign refinery's gasoline that is imported
under each individual foreign refinery's baseline. In this way EPA believes that importers would be able to know whether
any particular batch of imported gasoline would be within the volume constraint that would apply to the foreign refinery
that produced the gasoline. 
The proposed consequences for the importer that would result from claiming use of an individual foreign refinery's
baseline beyond the proposed volume constraint are discussed below. 
EPA is proposing that any reformulated gasoline that is imported during 1994 and for which an individual foreign refinery
baseline is used would be combined with such gasoline imported during 1995 for purposes of the proposed volume constraint.
This proposal for combining compliance calculations for gasoline imported during 1994 and 1995 is analogous to the
requirement in the final rule that reformulated gasoline produced or imported in 1994 must be combined with reformulated
gasoline produced or imported in 1995 for determining compliance with average standards. See  80.67(i).

<TEXT>
 

EPA is further proposing to expand the 1990 baseline volume to allow for imports during 1994, but this expanded baseline
volume would apply only for gasoline imported during 1994-1995. The mechanism proposed for this volume expansion
is to multiply the foreign refinery's 1990 baseline volume times 1.17, which would result in an additional volume
equal to two months of the 1990 baseline volume. EPA believes this approach for expanding the 1990 baseline volume
to cover imports during 1994 is appropriate, because it would allow imports subject to an individual baseline to begin
in November 1994 and to continue at the same rate as would be allowed for 1995. 
EPA requests comment on this proposal for combining gasoline imports in 1994 and 1995 for purposes of applying the
proposed volume constraint on use of an individual foreign refinery's baseline, and on the proposed mechanism for
calculating an expanded 1990 individual foreign refinery baseline volume for use during 1994 and 1995. 


D. The Requirement To Allow EPA Inspections and Audits 


EPA is proposing that, as a condition of use by an importer of an individual foreign refinery's baseline, EPA inspectors
and auditors would have to be given full access to conduct inspections and audits related to the foreign refinery's
baseline and to the gasoline produced at the foreign refinery. The proposed access for inspections and audits would
be at the foreign refinery, at any place gasoline produced at the foreign refinery for the U.S. market is located, and
at any location where documents are kept that relate to the foreign refinery's baseline or to gasoline produced at
the foreign refinery for the U.S. market. EPA is proposing that the access would have to be granted in response to inspections
or audits that either are announced or unannounced. 
EPA is proposing the inspection and audit access requirement in order to allow EPA inspectors and auditors to confirm
the baseline submissions that would relate to any foreign refinery. In addition, EPA inspections and audits would
confirm the information related to refinery-of-origin that is reported to EPA. The proposed access requirements
related to foreign refineries would provide EPA with access analogous to that exercised over domestic refiners to
conduct inspections and audits. EPA historically has conducted inspections and audits of domestic refineries in
order to ensure compliance with gasoline quality rules, including the lead phasedown requirements at  80.20,
and the gasoline volatility requirements at   80.27-28. EPA intends to follow this enforcement
approach with the reformulated gasoline program. EPA believes it is important that it have comparable access to foreign
refinery operations under the proposed approach for foreign refinery baseline in order to meet its enforcement responsibilities.

The scope of the proposed access requirement is intended to allow EPA to inspect or audit wherever documents are located
that would relate to an individual foreign refinery's baseline, or to the production or shipping of gasoline that
would be subject to such a baseline. In addition, the access proposal would ensure EPA access to collect samples of
any gasoline that would be subject to an individual foreign refinery baseline. 
EPA is proposing that the access requirement would terminate on January 1, 2003. This proposed termination date is
five years following January 1, 1998, the last date individual foreign refinery baselines could be used. Five years
is the statutory limitation that applies to potential liability for violations of the reformulated gasoline requirements.
EPA also is proposing that its inspection and audit access would be limited to gasoline produced before 1998 and to
documents that relate to such gasoline. This proposed limitation on the access requirement also corresponds to the
January 1, 1998 date individual foreign refinery baselines would become unavailable.

EPA would conduct these inspections or audits at facilities controlled by the foreign refiner. As a result, EPA inspectors
and auditors would have to be given access to conduct inspections or audits by the foreign refiner and by the country
in which the foreign refiner's facilities are located. Any failure to grant access, therefore, would be the result
of an action or decision by the foreign refiner or the foreign country. Nevertheless, the consequences of any failure
to give EPA full and immediate access would fall on the U.S. importers of that foreign refiner's gasoline. In consequence,
EPA believes any importer who would claim use of an individual foreign refinery's baseline would be expected to protect
itself against this possibility through whatever means it would feel prudent, such as assurances from the foreign
refiner that the access requirement would be met, or contractual indemnification provisions that would apply in
the event the access requirement is not met. 

The proposed consequences for the importer that would result from any failure to meet the access requirements are
discussed below. 



E. Failure To Meet Requirements 



EPA is proposing that a foreign refinery's individual baseline could not be used by any importer if EPA were to determine
that information submitted to EPA to establish the foreign refinery's individual baseline is inaccurate, or if EPA
were denied access to the foreign refinery to conduct an inspection or audit. EPA also is proposing that a foreign refinery's
individual baseline could not be used by the importer of a specific batch of gasoline in the event any of the foreign
refinery baseline requirements would not be met with respect to that batch of gasoline. 

Thus, for example, if EPA would determine that a foreign refinery's individual baseline submittal is in error, an
individual baseline for that refinery could not be used by any importer during any year, unless the Administrator
determines a shorter period is appropriate. Similarly, if EPA were to attempt to conduct an inspection or audit of
a foreign refinery and were to be denied full and immediate access, the individual baseline for that refinery could
not be used by any importer during any year, unless the Administrator determines a shorter period is appropriate.
In this situation, any importer who had previously submitted reports to EPA for any averaging period that included
use of the foreign refinery's individual baseline would be required to recompute its compliance calculations, 

ab initio

, using the baseline that would apply to the importer in the absence of the foreign refinery's individual baseline_normally
the statutory baseline. This recalculation by the importer would be required even if the recalculation would result
in violations by the importer of the reformulated gasoline standards. It would be no defense for the importer to argue
it used the foreign refinery's individual baseline in a good faith belief the baseline information was accurate,
or that the foreign refiner would allow EPA to conduct inspections and audits. 

A similar result would occur if EPA were to discover that a particular batch of imported gasoline, claimed by the importer
to be subject to a foreign refinery's individual baseline, in fact is not entitled to use of that baseline. This could
occur, for example, if through the CPA attest engagement or through an EPA audit it were discovered that the gasoline
comprising the batch was not produced at the foreign refinery claimed by the importer. Another example of gasoline
that would not be entitled to use of a foreign refinery's baseline would be a batch of gasoline that is imported subsequent
to the date when the total volume of imported gasoline for which use of the foreign refinery's baseline is claimed equals
the baseline volume for that foreign refinery. In these cases the importer who improperly claimed use of the foreign
refinery's individual baseline, but not other importers of gasoline produced by that foreign refinery, would be
required to recompute its compliance calculations, 

ab initio

, as described above. 


EPA is proposing that these consequences would be imposed on the importers, because there are clear barriers to effective
enforcement directly against foreign refiners. This would occur even in a case where EPA could prove that gasoline
was improperly imported using a foreign refinery's individual baseline, and where the improper use was the fault
of the foreign refiner, for example by submitting false baseline information or by refusing to allow EPA inspections
or audits. In such a case EPA could not bring effective enforcement against the foreign refiner. As a result, in order
to preserve the integrity of the reformulated gasoline program, EPA proposes that importers would be ultimately
responsible for the proper establishment and use of individual foreign refinery baselines.

<TEXT>
 

EPA believes that importers would be able to decide whether and when to claim use of a foreign refinery's individual
baseline. This approach is predicated on the assumption that importers would be expected to use great care in making
this decision, and would do so only if the importer has complete confidence the foreign refinery baseline information
was properly submitted to EPA and the foreign refiner intends to fully and properly comply with all requirements related
to use of individual foreign refinery baselines, including requirements that apply years into the future. EPA also
would expect importers to require the foreign refiner to carry out a gasoline volume tracking scheme that would enable
importers to know with certainty that any batch of imported gasoline for which use of the foreign refinery's individual
baseline would be claimed is within the foreign refinery's baseline volume. 



III. Justification for Proposed Amendment to Final Rule 



When EPA issued the final rule on December 15, 1993 the Agency was not fully satisfied that the baseline-setting scheme
applicable to importers, and thereby applicable to foreign refiners, was the optimum solution. In preparing the
final rule, EPA focused on three major issues regarding the use of individual baselines for foreign refiners in the
reformulated and conventional gasoline programs. EPA's overriding consideration, and the basis for EPA's focus
on these issues, was the ultimate environmental consequences of the baseline-setting scheme. The three issues are:
(1) The technical problems with using baseline-setting Methods 2 and 3 to accurately predict the qualities of gasoline
imported in 1990 from a foreign refiner; (2) the ability of the agency to adequately verify and enforce the use of foreign
refiner individual baselines, including problems identifying the refinery of origin of imported gasoline and enforcing
performance standards against a foreign refiner; and (3) any risk that would result from providing refiners or importers
with options in establishing baselines. 

The final regulations for reformulated and conventional gasoline, promulgated on December 15, 1993 pursuant to
a court ordered deadline, attempt to resolve these issues. These issues, however, are complex and have potentially
broad consequences. EPA therefore announced that it would continue to consider individual baselines for foreign
refiners after promulgation of the Final Rules in mid-December 1993. This consideration has resulted in today's
proposal, with EPA inviting comments on the proposed resolution described above. 

The first issue involved whether and when it would be appropriate to allow refiners or importers an option in establishing
individual baselines. In general, EPA's Final Rule takes the approach that options should not be allowed. Given a
choice, a refiner or importer would tend to choose the option requiring the least expense overall, which would also
presumably be the least protective of the environment. Avoiding options should therefore tend to avoid skewing the
program in a way that would reduce air quality benefits. EPA described this gaming concern in the preamble to the Final
Rule, at 59 FR 7785 (February 16, 1994). 


Under EPA's Final Rule, domestic refiners are basically provided no choice regarding individual baselines_they
must develop an individual baseline, using one or more of three different methods or modelling approaches. Since
gasoline produced by domestic refiners made up an overwhelming majority of the gasoline sold in the U.S. in 1990, the
average of all domestic refiner baselines should closely approximate the average 1990 quality of gasoline sold in
1990. Importers are treated like domestic refiners in that they are not provided an option on how to develop an individual
baseline. A major difference, however, is that importers may use only the first of the three modeling methods. If the
data are not available for this method, the importer defaults to the statutory baseline. In general, EPA expects all
or almost all importers to default to the statutory baseline.

For foreign refiners, EPA considered whether it should also require that all foreign refiners establish individual
baselines before they could import either conventional or simple model reformulated gasoline into the U.S. However,
as discussed later, EPA had considerable doubt about the ability of baseline-setting Methods 2 and 3 to accurately
predict the quality of that portion of a foreign refiner's production sent to the U.S. in 1990. EPA believed many foreign
refiners would therefore not be able to use these models, and mandating use of an individual baseline might therefore
lead to a ban on importation of gasoline from those foreign refiners not able to develop such baselines.

6

 In addition, EPA had serious questions whether it could adequately verify the accuracy of individual baselines for
foreign refiners under such a scenario. The current Final Rule resolves these concerns by not allowing foreign refiners
to establish individual baselines, and regulating the introduction of gasoline into the U.S. through the importer.
Importers must establish an individual baseline in the manner described above. 





The air quality impact of allowing foreign refiners a choice in what baseline to use, such as would result from the petition
process proposed today, depends in large part on which foreign refiners ultimately would have the ability, and would
choose, to produce reformulated gasoline for importation into the U.S., and on the individual baselines of those
foreign refiners who would make this choice. If a significant number of foreign refiners sent gasoline to the U.S.
in 1990 that was cleaner than the statutory baseline, those refiners would not be expected to choose to establish an
individual baseline but would instead default to the statutory baseline. Refiners who sent gasoline to the U.S. in
1990 that was dirtier than the statutory baseline might well decide to petition for an individual baseline, assuming
they could satisfy all of the conditions for establishing an individual baseline. In such a case, this might result
in certain foreign refiners being allowed to degrade the emissions performance of their gasoline down from its actual
1990 quality to the statutory baseline. Under this approach other foreign refiners might be allowed to establish
accurate and verifiable individual baselines that are dirtier than the statutory baseline, and thereby continue
to produce at this quality. 

In comparison, the current regulatory provisions provide foreign refiners with no choice. As described above, foreign
refiners whose 1990 gasoline was cleaner than the statutory baseline may degrade the quality of their gasoline down
to the statutory baseline, while foreign refiners whose 1990 gasoline was dirtier than the statutory baseline are
required to reformulate to meet the stricter statutory baseline. 

It is important to note that EPA does not have any clear evidence as to the actual average quality of gasoline imported
into the U.S. in 1990. EPA does not know, for example, whether a significant amount of such gasoline was cleaner than
the statutory baseline. While it would be reasonable to assume that at least some imported gasoline was cleaner and
some was dirtier than the statutory baseline, EPA is not in a position to quantify this in any reliable manner. As such,
it is not clear whether or how much providing foreign refiners with an option in establishing an individual baseline
would actually skew the air quality impacts of these programs in a negative direction. 
As mentioned above, a second major issue EPA has considered involves the technical limits of Methods 1, 2 or 3 in predicting
the qualities of that portion of a foreign refiner's 1990 gasoline production that was sent to the U.S.

7

 Foreign refiners likely did not send the majority of their gasoline to the United States in 1990. Foreign refiners
may not have exported the majority of their gasoline to the United States in 1990. Domestic refiners, on the other hand,
are assumed to have distributed (and to continue to distribute) the majority of their gasoline within the U.S. In the
absence of actual 1990 data, domestic refiners may calculate individual baselines using models developed by EPA
that depend, in part, on the fact that the majority of the modelled gasoline is distributed in the U.S. However, foreign
refiners typically did not distribute the majority of their 1990 gasoline within the U.S., rendering the models inappropriate
for those refiners.

The third major issue of concern involves whether EPA can accurately verify individual baselines of foreign refiners
and effectively enforce standards for foreign produced gasoline based on such individual baselines. EPA was concerned
that it would not be able to effectively exercise authority to inspect foreign facilities and require the production
of records or samples, or to require accurate auditing of the compliance of foreign operations. This includes, for
example, EPA's ability to ensure the accuracy of an individual foreign refiner baseline, EPA's ability to clearly
identify the refinery of origin for gasoline imported into the U.S. (the ``tracking'' issue), and EPA's ability to
easily access foreign records, samples, and facilities for inspections and other compliance measures. 
With respect to tracking refinery of origin, EPA believes it must be able to establish with certainty which baseline
attaches to each specific batch of gasoline imported into the U.S. The distribution of foreign produced gasoline
is significantly distinct from domestic distribution patterns. As described in the preamble to the final rule, see
59 FR 7785 (February 16, 1994), the association of a refinery-specific baseline with the gasoline produced at a domestic
refinery is relatively uncomplicated, because compliance is determined at the refinery level before fungible mixing
in the gasoline distribution system. The source refinery for gasoline is clear before the gasoline leaves the refinery.
In the case of all imported gasoline, on the other hand, the gasoline will be transported from the refinery to the U.S.
port of entry prior to the point at which the imported gasoline would have to be associated with a foreign refinery-specific
baseline. This stage of transportation from the foreign refinery to the U.S. port of entry could be by fungible means
for any imported gasoline, with the consequence that fungible mixing could obscure the identity of the source refinery
for any batch of imported gasoline. For a discussion of these and other enforcement and compliance related issues,
see the preamble to the final rule at 59 FR 7787 (February 16, 1994). 
Finally, it is important to place the role of individual baselines in their proper context for the reformulated and
conventional gasoline programs. For conventional gasoline, the individual baseline of a refiner or importer establishes
the applicable emissions standard for the conventional gasoline they produce or import. On average, a refiner's
or importer's conventional gasoline has to meet an emissions performance standard measured by the performance of
their individual baseline. If the refiner or importer is assigned the statutory baseline instead of an individual
baseline, then performance is measured against the statutory baseline. This performance standard applies on an
annual basis starting with 1995. The statutory basis for these requirements are found in section 211(k)(8) of the
Act. 
The individual baseline plays a much more limited rule in the reformulated gasoline program. For the first three years
of that program, three specific fuel qualities are capped at the level of a refiner's or importer's individual baseline.
 Starting January 1, 1998, a refiner or importer's individual baseline has no relevance in the reformulated gasoline
program. This short term requirement is part of the standards adopted by EPA and commonly called the simple model.
The refiner and importer specific caps on the three parameters were based on EPA's understanding of the directional
impacts of these parameters on emissions, the lack of adequate data to fully model the emissions impacts of these three
gasoline parameters when EPA proposed the simple model, and the lead time needed before requiring use of a subsequent,
more complex emissions performance model adopted by EPA in the final rule. Further discussion of this may be found
in the preamble to the final rule at 59 FR 7720 (February 16, 1994). 




The final rule's requirements for individual baselines resolves these various concerns in a straightforward manner.
EPA is seeking comment on whether this proposal addresses all of the above concern, in a manner that achieves the environmental
goals intended for reformulated gasoline while at the same time addressing the equity concerns that previously have
been raised, by placing clear limits and conditions on the use of individual baselines for foreign refiners. These
limits and conditions would be designed to address the issues described above_concerns about skewing of air quality
benefits in a negative direction by providing options in establishing individual baselines, concerns about the
technical limits of the refinery modeling used to establish baselines, and finally concerns over the Agency's ability
to adequately verify individual baselines for foreign refiners and adequately ensure compliance by imported gasoline
with standards based on individual baselines.

A. Accuracy of Individual Foreign Refiner Baselines 


As described in detail above, this proposed amendment provides that parties that desire to establish an individual
baseline for a foreign refinery would submit a petition to EPA's Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation to
establish a reliable and verifiable individual baseline. The petitioner would also submit data adequate to establish
the volume of gasoline exported to the United States during 1990. 
The Assistant Administrator would only approve petitions when the individual baseline had been established with
sufficient certainty, to the satisfaction of the Assistant Administrator. The Assistant Administrator's decision
whether to approve a petition would depend, in part, on the certainty with which the foreign refiner's 1990 fuel properties
and volume data could be verified by a U.S.-based independent baseline auditor and by EPA, as discussed above. In requiring
that a petitioner bear the burden of demonstrating to the Assistant Administrator that the individual baseline and
the data submitted in support of an individual baseline is accurate and verifiable, and in requiring that a U.S.-based
attestor corroborate that demonstration, the amendment provides for appropriate certainty in establishing accurate
individual baselines. 
EPA requests comment as to whether the proposal would result in appropriate certainty as to any foreign refinery baseline
that would be established. 


B. Certainty as to Refinery-of-Origin 


In the preamble to the final rule, EPA expressed concern about effectively determining the refinery-of-origin for
specific batches of imported gasoline so as to determine the appropriate baseline to be applied to the product. However,
EPA is proposing and seeking comment on procedures that are designed to ensure that importers effectively track gasoline
from the point of gasoline production to the port-of-entry into the U.S. 
Strict tracking and segregation of reformulated gasoline that is produced by foreign refiners and that would be subject
to an individual baseline is necessary to assure compliance with this program. Only by matching a discrete volume
of gasoline with an individual baseline would an importer be able to accurately calculate its compliance with this
proposed amendment to the reformulated gasoline program. Further, such tracking and segregation is necessary for
EPA to ensure that use of an individual baseline remains within the foreign refiner's volume cap. 
Today's proposed amendment of the final rule seeks to provide for certainty with respect to establishing the refinery-of-origin
of imported gasoline through the use of independent sampling and testing that would be required upon loading on-board
ship at the refinery-of-origin and upon receipt by an importer at a U.S. port-of-entry. The sampling and testing at
both ends of the shipment would help to assure that the volume and parameters of the product subject to the individual
baseline are identical. Additionally, the independent laboratory would verify the foreign refinery-of-origin
before the shipment leaves the foreign port. 
The amendment proposes that batch specific information pertaining to the parameters and volume of the batch would
be collected by an independent laboratory upon loading of the product and a report filed with EPA. This information
would be available for comparison with batch specific information required to be collected by importers upon receipt
of product. 
Further, the tracking system would help to ensure that EPA could determine that the imported reformulated gasoline
produced subject to an individual baseline was not commingled with gasoline produced under another baseline en route
from its source to the U.S. port-of-entry. 
Today's proposal also would require that an importer exercising the option to use a foreign refinery's individual
baseline must demonstrate that an annual attestation engagement is conducted of the foreign refinery for each year
of individual baseline use. The engagement would be undertaken by a U.S.-based CPA or firm. This requirement would
be equivalent with attest engagement requirements applicable to domestic refiners and importers under the Final
Rule. The engagement would verify that the gasoline loaded on-board ship was produced by the refinery for which individual
baseline use is claimed. 
The practical effect of today's proposal would be to condition the use of individual foreign refinery baselines upon
strict tracking of reformulated gasoline. An importer's use of a foreign refinery's individual baseline would depend
upon the importer's ability to establish with certainty that the reformulated gasoline for which the individual
baseline is claimed was, in fact, produced at the foreign refinery for which the individual baseline is applicable.

EPA requests comment regarding whether there would be appropriate certainty as to the refinery of origin of any imported
gasoline that would use an individual foreign refinery's baseline under this proposal. 


C. The Limited Potential for Adverse Air Quality Effects From Gaming 


It has been argued that the proposed constraints on the use of individual baselines by importers would limit the potential
for gaming associated with establishing baselines for imported gasoline, and in consequence the potential for adverse
air quality effects from such gaming.

If all foreign refiners sending gasoline to the U.S. established accurate and verifiable baselines, and concerns
about tracking refinery of origin and other compliance concerns were resolved, then it has been agreed, those baselines
and the gasoline produced under them clearly and easily would lead to the air quality benefits expected from conventional
and reformulated gasoline. This might be considered the ``ideal'', or best possible result. As described earlier,
however, there is considerable doubt about whether accurate, verifiable, and enforceable baselines can be expected
for 

all

 foreign refiners. 

The Final Rule addresses these problems in effect by requiring all foreign refiners to produce gasoline using the
statutory baseline_those cleaner than the statutory baseline are allowed to degrade down to that baseline, while
those dirtier than the statutory baselines are required to clean up to that baseline. While the Final Rule would not
allow the average quality of foreign produced gasoline to degrade below the statutory baseline, it might in fact require
that foreign gasoline be cleaner on average than would be required if all refiners did establish individual baselines.

10

 





One concern regarding the approach used in the Final Rule is that it treats all foreign refiners as a class (by assigning
the statutory baseline to all imported gasoline), yet the factors that led to grouping foreign refiners as a class
may not apply equally to all foreign refiners. The result of the class approach to resolving the foreign refiner baseline
issue could be considered unfair to any particular foreign refiner who would be able to accurately establish refinery
baselines, and who would be able to establish with certainty the refinery of origin for gasoline imported into the
United States. On the other hand, and as has been discussed above, allowing each foreign refiner to choose whether
to establish individual refinery baselines creates the potential for gaming with consequent adverse environmental
effects. The challenge for EPA, then, is to create a regulatory mechanism for imported gasoline baselines that is
as fair as possible to each foreign refiner, but that also achieves the environmental goals intended for reformulated
gasoline. 

The proposed revisions would allow certain foreign refiners the option to petition for the right to establish individual
baselines under carefully controlled circumstances. As discussed above, this proposed scheme has a potential for
adverse air quality effects, in comparison to the current Final Rule, because some importers would have an option
as to which baseline would apply to imported reformulated gasoline. Presumably, foreign refiners and their U.S.
importer business partners would elect to seek to establish individual foreign refinery baselines only if the foreign
refinery produced gasoline in 1990 that was ``dirtier'' than the statutory baseline alternative to an individual
foreign refinery baseline. In the case of foreign refineries that produced gasoline in 1990 that was ``cleaner''
than the statutory baseline, on the other hand, the foreign refiners and their U.S. importer business partners presumably
would use the less stringent and less costly statutory baseline option. EPA's ``gaming'' concern would result from
these likely decisions by ``dirtier'' and ``cleaner'' foreign refiners. The potential adverse air quality consequence
would result from the volume of imported gasoline during 1995 through 1997 that would use a ``dirtier''-than-statutory
baseline, and the loss to the U.S. gasoline pool during 1995 through 1997 of gasoline produced to meet a ``cleaner''-than-statutory
baselines. There may or may not be an adverse air quality impact in relation to the ``ideal'' scenario described above,
depending on whether the average quality of gasoline imported from foreign refiners in 1990 was different from the
statutory baseline and how much reformulated gasoline is imported in 1995 through 1997.

EPA has been unable to identify any foreign refiners other than PDVSA who intend to produce any reformulated gasoline,

11

 though there nevertheless could be some because there is no requirement that refiners must announce their intentions
at this time. The absence of identified foreign reformulated gasoline refiners (other than PDVSA) does present the
possibility that there will be few, if any, foreign reformulated gasoline refiners who would have a ``cleaner''-than
statutory baseline (but who would opt for the statutory baseline). If true, this would resolve EPA's gaming concern.






Moreover, even to the extent there are foreign refiners who would qualify for ``cleaner''-than-statutory baselines
EPA believes there is a possibility that their gasoline would nevertheless be cleaner than the statutory baseline,
which would limit the likelihood for adverse air quality effects. This possibility was presented to EPA by a foreign
refiner who argued that such ``clean'' refiners may in fact be technologically incapable of relaxing production
parameters so as to realize a benefit from the statutory baseline. To the extent this may be true, such ``clean'' refiners
might reduce any adverse air quality impact associated with providing an option to establish individual baselines.


The principal reason limiting the potential for adverse air quality effects from gaming under today's proposal is,
however, that use of ``dirtier''-than-statutory individual baselines would be restricted. It has been argued that
this would in turn limit any adverse air quality effects, in relation to the current final rule.

12

 At the same time, any reformulated gasoline imported under an individual baseline would be required to meet the same
standards that apply to any other refiner, foreign or domestic, with the same baseline. For the three parameters of
interest under the simple model for reformulated gasoline, sulfur, olefins, and T-90, reformulated gasoline
produced by a foreign or domestic refiner with an individual baseline would have to meet an annual average limit set
at 100% of the individual baseline level for those parameters. This effectively requires that the gasoline stay as
clean as it was in 1990, for those three specific parameters. 





EPA has considered the level of emissions that would result from gasoline imported under the approach contained in
the final rule, versus gasoline imported under the approach described in today's proposal. While no baselines have
been established yet for any refiner or importer, PDVSA has submitted to the reformulated gasoline docket a record
that describes the baseline it would be able to establish if given the opportunity. The baseline it describes is dirtier
than the statutory baseline for some parameters, and cleaner for other parameters. In the case of sulfur and olefins,
PDVSA's stated baseline levels would be significantly higher than the statutory baseline: PDVSA's claimed sulfur
level is 644 parts per million (ppm), and the statutory baseline level is 339 ppm; PDVSA's claimed olefin level is 22
vol% and the statutory baseline level is 9.2 vol%. The environmental implication is that NO

X

 emissions are higher with larger sulfur and olefin levels. 

Taking into account the volume of PDVSA's gasoline that is used in the Northeast U.S._its primary market, EPA's preliminary
analysis shows that PDVSA's 1995 gasoline would increase overall NO

X

 emissions there by only 0.08% during the high ozone season,

13

 in comparison to the case where PDVSA would produce gasoline to meet the statutory baseline for sulfur and olefins.






Also, PDVSA's 1995 gasoline quality will be approximately equal to the quality of statutory gasoline in terms of VOC
emissions, and will be much cleaner in terms of toxics emissions.

14

 





The proposed program elements that would help to limit the impact of ``dirtier''-than-statutory baselines are the
limited volume of a foreign refinery's reformulated gasoline that could use the individual baseline, the limited
time period during which the individual baseline could be used, the fact that the individual baseline could be used
only for reformulated gasoline, and EPA's belief that the individual baseline option would not be attractive to most
foreign refiners.

1. The Volume Limitation on Use of Individual Refinery Baselines 



An importer's use of a foreign refinery's individual baseline is proposed to be limited to volumes of reformulated
gasoline equivalent to the foreign refinery's 1990 volume of gasoline imports to the U.S. This volume constraint
is described above. 

The volume cap limiting use of an individual baseline for reformulated gasoline production (until January 1, 1998)
to a foreign refiner's 1990 import volumes ensures that the use of an individual baseline is constrained by historical
import volumes. Volumes imported above the 1990 constraint would be subject to the importer's statutory baseline.
Foreign-produced reformulated gasoline subject to an individual baseline, within the 1990 volume cap limitation,
would be measured for compliance against gasoline produced in 1990, and therefore would be at least as clean as the
foreign refiner's 1990 gasoline. However, any reformulated gasoline produced by a foreign refiner above the 1990
volume would be evaluated relative to the statutory baseline and therefore would be at least as clean as reformulated
gasoline produced using the statutory baseline. 



2. The Time Limitation on the Use of Individual Foreign Refinery Baselines 



A further constraint on potential adverse air quality effects is the time limit on an importer's use of a foreign refiner's
individual baseline. It would be limited to the period commencing when reformulated gasoline is first imported into
the U.S. and continues through December 31, 1997. After 1997, individual baselines have no further relevance to the
requirements for reformulated gasoline, and all importers and domestic refiners are required by the Final Rule to
measure compliance with the reformulated gasoline standards against the statutory baseline. Therefore, the effect
of this regulation would be limited to this three year period only. 



3. The Number of Foreign Refiners Who Would Seek to Use Individual Foreign Refinery Baselines Would be Limited



This proposal is predicated on the assumption that the costs inherent in producing reformulated gasoline and meeting
the requirements of the reformulated gasoline program, including those costs necessary to establish an individual
baseline, will deter most foreign refiners from selecting the individual baseline option, thereby further limiting
any potential adverse air quality impact. These costs include extensive refinery modifications; costs associated
with petitioning EPA for an individual baseline and providing adequate information to establish with certainty
that the baseline determination is accurate; a baseline audit; and the record keeping and product tracking associated
with complying with the proposed annual compliance audits. 

EPA believes that few refiners have made the requisite capital investments necessary to produce reformulated gasoline.
Therefore, it currently appears that the number of foreign refiners who would take advantage of this proposed amendment
would be limited. 

In addition, the limited time period during which individual foreign refinery baselines could be used may limit the
number of foreign refiners that would take advantage of this option, because the costs associated with exercising
this option described above, could only be recouped within the 1995 through 1997 time frame. 



4. Conventional Gasoline Not Affected by This Proposed Amendment 



EPA's concern for gaming in the case of conventional gasoline is substantially greater than its concern with respect
to reformulated gasoline. First, there is likely to be significantly more conventional gasoline imported into the
U.S. than reformulated gasoline. Second, the Final Rule provides that individual baseline will be the basis for conventional
gasoline compliance into the foreseeable future while an individual baseline for reformulated gasoline is applicable
only until December 31, 1997. Accordingly, due to these volumetric and long term distinctions between reformulated
gasolines and conventional gasolines, the potential for adverse air quality impact is significantly larger if individual
foreign refinery baselines could be used with conventional gasoline, as compared with the potential if individual
foreign refinery baselines could be used with reformulated gasoline. 

The Final Rule requires that domestic refiners apply their individual baselines to conventional gasoline production.
EPA anticipates that nationwide use of individual baselines will result in gasoline quality that approximately
equals the statutory baseline. However, EPA believes that an option to use individual baselines by foreign refiners
in the production of conventional gasoline would result in significant skewing, in a negative direction, of the average
quality of imported gasoline based on the gaming scenario described above.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940503-1-00076 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940503-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A skewing in a negative direction of the average of baselines with respect to foreign conventional gasoline, is of
significant concern because EPA anticipates that most foreign sources of gasoline will provide conventional gasoline
to the U.S. This assumption is based on EPA's belief that few foreign producers of gasoline have invested in the capital
equipment necessary for complying with the reformulated gasoline program. Further, the increased costs of capitalization
realized by a refiner entering the reformulated gasoline market would be exacerbated by the continuing costs of overseas
shipping under the segregated fuels requirement proposed in this amendment. Accordingly, there appears to be few
economic incentives for foreign refiners to reallocate production from conventional to reformulated gasolines.

Thus, EPA is not proposing to change the approach contained in the Final Rule pertaining to baselines for imported
conventional gasoline, and EPA expects all or almost all importers to default to the statutory baseline.

EPA requests comment as to the magnitude of any potential adverse air quality consequences that would result from
gaming under today's proposal. 



D. EPA's Compliance Oversight Authority



The preamble to the Final Rule expresses EPA's concern that it would lack adequate compliance monitoring and enforcement
techniques to ensure that foreign refineries comply fully with the reformulated gasoline program. This concern
arose out of the perceived need to bring any enforcement actions against importers that would rely on baseline audits
and inspections of foreign refiners, and that these foreign refiners may not be subject to the full panoply of enforcement
mechanisms available with domestic corporations.

Today's proposed amendment, however, provides for compliance monitoring and enforcement pertaining to foreign-produced
reformulated gasoline to focus on domestic importers. Such foreign-produced reformulated gasoline would be subject
to the full array of monitoring and enforcement devices available to EPA. It has been argued that importers' potential
liability, including but not limited to exposure to potential relegation to compliance with the statutory baseline,
will be adequate to ensure that importers would import gasoline using an individual foreign refinery's baseline
only where the importer has sufficient confidence the requirements of this program would be met, including the compliance
monitoring provisions that require the cooperation of the foreign refiner and the government of the country in which
the foreign refiner is located. These compliance monitoring and enforcement provisions appears to be equivalent
to EPA's compliance monitoring and enforcement authority over domestic refiners.

The proposal provides that, as a condition for the use of a foreign refinery's individual baseline, EPA would be guaranteed
full and immediate access to conduct compliance oversight inspections, collect gasoline samples and perform compliance
audits at the foreign refinery. EPA's compliance audits supplement the baseline certification and annual audits
specified elsewhere in this proposal. EPA's compliance oversight authority is proposed to last until January 1,
2003, consistent with the statute of limitations governing violations of the reformulated gasoline program and
associated statutes governing the submission of information to the U.S. government.

In addition, foreign refiners electing to petition to use an individual baseline would be required to engage a domestic
CPA to conduct a baseline certification audit and annual attest engagements. EPA anticipates that and is seeking
comment on whether the professional standards governing the conduct of such audits, as well as the amenability of
a U.S. CPA to EPA compliance monitoring and enforcement, is adequate assurance that EPA can effectively monitor foreign
refiners for program compliance.

E. EPA Seeks Comment on Today's Proposal, or Any Alternative Approaches 


Today's proposal is an attempt to resolve the issue of baselines for foreign refiners in a more appropriate manner,
with the intent of achieving several important, but different, goals. One goal is that the environmental benefits
intended for reformulated gasoline by the Clean Air Act be realized. The other goal is that all regulated parties who
are similarly situated be treated alike, with the differences in treatment between domestic and foreign refiners
limited to those measures necessary to appropriately accommodate differences in their situations and protect human
health and environmental values. EPA recognizes that there may be other methods for regulating imported reformulated
gasoline that resolve these two goals in ways that are preferable to the approaches contained both in the Final Rule
and in today's proposal. EPA requests comment as to any alternative approaches to regulating imported reformulated
gasoline that achieves the environmental benefits required by the Clean Air Act for reformulated gasoline, and that
treats domestic and foreign refiners in a manner consistent with the provisions of the GATT. 



IV. Public Participation 


EPA invites comment on all aspects of today's notice. EPA has specifically requested comments on a number of areas
throughout the previous discussion. A list of these and other areas for comment are the following:

 Any alternative approaches to regulating imported reformulated gasoline that achieve the environmental
benefits required by the Clean Air Act for reformulated gasoline, and that treat domestic and foreign refiners in
a manner consistent with the provisions of the GATT.

 The accuracy of any foreign refinery baseline that would be established under the proposal.

 The identification of the refinery of origin of any imported gasoline that would use an individual foreign
refinery's baseline under today's proposal.

 Whether today's proposal would result in the environmental benefits that are intended by the reformulated
gasoline provisions of the Clean Air Act.

 The issue of when foreign refinery baseline petitions would be due.

 The appropriate approach for correlating the volume determination at the foreign refinery and at the U.S.
port of entry.

 The adequacy of the proposed attest procedures.

 The proposed requirement that independent laboratories and CPA's be U.S. corporations or citizens. 

 The proposal for combining gasoline imports in 1994 and 1995 for purposes of applying the proposed volume constraint
on use of an individual foreign refinery's baseline.

 The proposed mechanism for calculating an expanded 1990 individual foreign refinery baseline volume for
use during 1994 and 1995.



V. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis 



A. Executive Order 12866



Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:

(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940503-1-00078 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940503-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 

(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 

(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 

Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory
action'' because of the potential impacts on portions of the domestic refining and gasoline importing industry.
As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations
will be documented in the public record. 



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator certifies
that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

The issue of baselines for imported reformulated gasoline is discussed generally in section VII-C of the Regulatory
Impact Analysis that was prepared to support the Final Rule for reformulated gasoline. A copy of this document may
be found in the reformulated gasoline docket, number A-92-12, at the location identified in the 

ADDRESSES 

section of this document. 

The RFA of 1980 requires federal agencies to examine the effects of proposed regulations and to identify significant
adverse impacts on a substantial number of small entities. Because the RFA does not provide concrete definitions
of ``small entity,'' ``significant impact,'' or ``substantial number,'' EPA has established guidelines setting
the standards to be used in evaluating impacts on small businesses.

15

 For purposes of the proposed individual foreign refinery requirements for reformulated gasoline, a small entity
is any business which is independently owned and operated and not dominant in its field as defined by SBA regulations
under section 3 of the Small Business Act.

The Agency believes that the individual foreign refinery baseline requirements being proposed today are unlikely
to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The businesses affected will be either
a relatively small number of major domestic oil companies who would compete with imported gasoline that is produced
at foreign refineries for which individual baselines are established, or importers who would import gasoline that
is produced by foreign refineries for which individual baselines are established. EPA expects the number of foreign
refineries for which individual baselines will be established will be small, with the result that the number of affected
domestic refiners and importers also will be small. 

However, EPA invites comment on the question of significant impacts on small entities. EPA also requests all relevant
data which justify any conclusions submitted. 



C. The Paperwork Reduction Act 



The information collection requirements in this proposal have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq. 

An Information Collection Request document has been prepared by EPA (ICR No. 1591.04) and a copy may be obtained from
Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch, EPA, 401 M St., SW. (Mail Code 2136), Washington, DC 20460 or by calling (202)
260-2740. 

This collection of information has an estimated recordkeeping and reporting burden averaging 4.1 hours per respondent.
This estimate includes time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining
the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. 

Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch, EPA, 401 M St., SW. (Mail Code 2136), Washington, DC
20460, and to the Office of Information Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503,
marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or public comments on the information
collection requirements contained in this proposal. 



VI. Statutory Authority 



The statutory authority for the rules proposed today is granted to EPA by sections 114, 211 (c) and (k), and 301 of the
Clean Air Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 7414, 7545 (c) and (k), and 7601.

Islands. 
(b) 

Conditions for use of individual foreign refinery baselines.

 For purposes of compliance with the reformulated gasoline standards of  80.41, any importer may use a baseline
established for a foreign refinery as the importer's individual baseline, but only for gasoline produced at that
foreign refinery and provided that: 
(1) The Administrator has approved separate 1990 baseline properties and volume for the foreign refinery, as specified
under paragraph (c) of this section; 
(2) The importer is able to establish that the imported gasoline was produced at the foreign refinery, as specified
under paragraph (d) of this section; 
(3) An attest engagement is conducted of the foreign refinery operation for the calendar year during which the separate
foreign refinery baseline is claimed by the importer, as specified under paragraph (e) of this section; and 

(4) Authorized representatives of the Administrator are given full and immediate access and are allowed to conduct
inspections, review records and other documents, collect gasoline samples, and perform audits relating to the foreign
refinery, as specified under paragraph (f) of this section. 

(c) 

Establishing individual foreign refinery baselines.

(f) 

EPA inspections.

 The inspections, reviews, collections, and audits under paragraph (b)(4) of this section may be conducted: 
(1)(i) At the foreign refinery; 
(ii) At any other location where gasoline produced at the foreign refinery for use in the United States is stored or
transported; and 
(iii) At any other location where documents are kept which relate to the quality and/or quantity of the gasoline produced

(3) At any time prior to January 1, 2003; and 
(4) With relation to any gasoline produced: 
(i) During 1990 and any other year for which data are submitted to EPA in support of an individual baseline; and 
(ii) For use in the United States during the period December 1994 through December 1997. 
(g) 

Failure to meet requirements.

 If any requirement specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section is not fully met for any calendar year, or
if the Administrator determines that the information submitted to EPA under paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section
is inaccurate in whole or in part, then compliance with the requirements of   80.41 (h) and (i) by an importer
shall be measured, 

ab initio

 and for each and every calendar year or for such other period of time as the Administrator may determine, from the baseline
that otherwise would apply to the importer in the absence of the operation of this section. 
(h) 

Volume constraints.

 (1) During any calendar year the total volume of gasoline imported by one or more importers to which a foreign refinery's
baseline applies shall not be greater than the refinery's 1990 baseline volume. 
(2) Where the volume of gasoline for which the foreign refinery's baseline is claimed by one or more importers during
any calendar year exceeds the refinery's 1990 baseline volume, the refinery's baseline applies only to the first
volume of that refinery's gasoline that is imported into the United States that equals the 1990 baseline volume. 
(3) In the event any importer uses a foreign refinery baseline in violation of the volume constraint specified in paragraphs
(h) (1) through (2) of this section the importer shall, 

ab initio

, calculate compliance using the baseline values that properly apply under paragraphs (h) (1) through (2) of this
section. 
(4) In the event any gasoline is imported before January 1, 1995 for which a separate foreign refinery baseline is claimed:

(i) Such gasoline shall be combined with gasoline imported during 1995 for which the separate foreign refinery baseline
is claimed for purposes of the volume constraint specified in paragraphs (h) (1) through (2) of this section; and 
(ii) An adjusted 1990 baseline volume for the foreign refinery shall be calculated, for use during the combined 1994
and 1995 period only, by multiplying the 1990 baseline volume for the foreign refinery times 1.17.

ACTION: 

Policy Statement; notice of hearing and extension of comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission will hold a public hearing on the issues raised concerning the implementation of the Children's Television
Act of 1990. The Commission will also accept additional comments and reply comments. It has been nearly one year since
the last comments were filed in this proceeding. Submission of this more current information will facilitate the
Commission's ability to make an informed policy decision.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




April 20, 1994.


Commission To Hold En Banc Hearing on Children's Television (MM Docket No. 93-48)



The Federal Communications Commission will hold an 

en banc

 hearing on children's television on Tuesday, June 28, 1994. The hearing will convene at 9 a.m. in Room 856, at 1919 M
Street, NW., Washington, DC, and will be open to the public. The Commission has determined that it would be useful to
hear oral presentations and a direct exchange of viewpoints on the issues raised in the pending children's television
proceeding. The issues in this proceeding focus on the Commission's current definition of informational and educational
programming and the amount of informational and educational programming a broadcaster must air to meet its obligation
to children under the Children's Television Act. The Commission had earlier issued a Notice of Inquiry, 8 FCC Rcd 1841
(1993) (58 FR 14367, March 17, 1993), in this proceeding, comments were filed on May 7, 1993, and reply comment were
filed on June 7, 1993.

Parties wishing to make oral presentations and appear on panels to debate issues at this hearing should submit written
requests by close-of-business, Wednesday, May 11, 1994, to: Larry A. Miller, Video Services Division, Mass Media
Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street, NW._room 702, Washington, DC 20554.

Such requests should clearly identify the speaker, the organization represented (if any), relevant experience
and training, and the specific topic(s) to be discussed. Appropriate topics include any issues related to the 

NOI

, and specifically comments on changes in the availability, quantity, quality and effectiveness of programming
directed to the educational and informational needs of children, including standard-length programming, that
have occurred between the enactment of the Children's Television Act of 1990 and the present. The Commission is also
interested in comments on the economics of providing educational and informational programming for children either
to the home or to the classroom.

Depending on the number of requests, it may be necessary to limit the number of presenters. If so, we will select speakers
for the hearing in order to achieve broad representation of different viewpoints. With this in mind, interested parties
wishing to present similar material are encouraged to propose a single representative or consolidated presentation.
The precise format and schedule for the 

en banc

 hearing, as well as a list of the selected presenters, will be specified in a future public notice; however, we anticipate
that presentations will be limited to no more than five minutes.

Persons selected to appear will be required to submit to the Secretary by close-of-business, Wednesday, June 8, 1994,
an original and 9 copies of the proposed remarks, a summary of those remarks of no more than two pages, a brief speaker
biography, and a description of the organization represented. In addition, 21 copies of the material submitted to
the Secretary must be submitted to the Video Services Division by close-of-business on June 8, 1994. Interested persons
not desiring to participate or not selected to participate in the 

en banc 

hearing may file written comments on June 8, 1994. Persons filing written comments only should comply with Sections
1.415 and 1.419 of the Commission's Rules. Persons wishing to respond to testimony presented at the hearing are invited
to do so by July 15, 1994.




For more information contact Larry Miller, Video Services Division, (202) 632-6993. Members of the media should
contact Maureen Peratino, Office of Public Affairs, (202) 632-5050.

52. AMENDMENTS TO CCC DEBT SETTLEMENT REGULATIONS REGARDING WAIVER OF 
RESTRICTION ON PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY AND COLLECTION OF JUDGMENTS BY 
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFSET 


Significance: 


Subject to OMB review: Yes 


Legal Authority:  
28 USC 3201; 
15 USC 714b; 
15 USC 714c 
CFR Citation:  
None 
Legal Deadline: None 


Abstract: This action is needed to allow for the waiver of restrictions on 
program eligibility, as authorized by the Federal Debt Collection 
Procedures Act of 1990 (the Act), and to facilitate the 
collection of judgements by administrative offset. The Act 
provides that debtors who have judgement liens against their 
property for a debt owed to the United States are not eligible to 
receive grants or loans made by the United States until the debt 
is paid in full or otherwise satisfied. However, the Act also 
permits agencies to waive this restriction. In addition, the 
Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized to collect debts for 
other Federal agencies by administrative offset upon receipt of 
(1) a qualified offset request, (2) a Notice of Levy, or (3) a 
request or approval by the Department of Justice. This action 
would authorize ASCS to collect judgements in favor of the United 
States by administrative offset. This action will result in 
increased collection of debts owed to the Government.

53. AMENDMENT TO THE U.S. WAREHOUSE ACT REGULATIONS_LICENSE AND 
INSPECTION FEES 


Legal Authority:  
7 USC 268 
CFR Citation:  
07 CFR 736 
Legal Deadline: None 


Abstract: The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 required that U.S. 
Warehouse Act licensing and examination programs be operated on a 
fee basis. New regulations are required when an increase and/or 
decrease is warranted. Fixed fees were implemented in 1981 and 
were last increased in 1985. The interest accumulating in the 
Warehouse User Fee Account has been the major reason for not 
having to adjust the fee schedule before now. In more recent 
years, low interest rates and increased expenses (primarily 
salaries, travel, and administrative costs), coupled with 
collections which have not changed significantly over the past 10 
years, will result in a deficit in the ``fee collection account'' 
by FY 1994 if the fee schedule is not revised, and would thus 
require a reduction in service. The cost of Government of this 
action has not yet been determined.

supporting the prices of wool and mohair by means of loans, 
purchases, payments, or other operations. The support level for 
wool is set by statutory formula. Payments are to be 75 percent 
of the amount otherwise determined. The other determinations are 
to: (1) support mohair at a level not more than 15 percent above 
or below the comparable percentage of parity at which shorn wool 
is supported, and (2) support pulled wool through payments based 
on the liveweight of unshorn lambs marketed for slaughter. The 
expected cost is $130-150 million.

62. AMENDMENTS TO REGULATIONS REGARDING PAYMENTS TO PERSONS CONVICTED 
OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE VIOLATIONS 


Legal Authority:  
21 USC 881a 
CFR Citation:  
07 CFR 796 
Legal Deadline: None 


Abstract: This action is necessary to amend the regulations regarding 
payments to persons convicted of controlled substance violations 
to reflect recent legislation. Current regulations implement the 
Food Security Act of 1985 provisions but not the FY 1993 
Appropriations Act provisions. This action will thus amend the 
regulations to implement the statutory provisions regarding 
controlled substance violations. The primary effect of this 
action will be to make most conservation programs subject to the 
controlled substance violation provisions and result in some 
people being declared ineligible for benefits. No Government 
outlays are expected.

provide price assurance equivalent to deficiency payments and 
price support benefits. (3) Provide terms and conditions for 
producers who elect to participate; (4) Provide provisions for 
administering the program, and (5) Provide measures to prevent 
circumvention of the program, including refunds and penalties. 
Only minor administrative and program costs are expected.

 NONEMERGENCY HAYING AND GRAZING ON CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM 
GRASSLANDS 


Significance: 


Subject to OMB review: Yes 


Legal Authority:  
16 USC 3801 et seq 
CFR Citation:  
07 CFR 1410 
Legal Deadline: None 


Abstract: This action is needed to revise the regulations governing the 
Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to allow the non-emergency 
haying and grazing of CRP grasslands, under specified conditions. 
Such haying and grazing can have beneficial impacts on wildlife 
habitat and cover quality while still achieving the goals of the 
CRP. Issues to be considered include conditions for allowing 
haying and grazing, acreage to be allowed, monitoring and 
enforcement, compensation offset, effects on wildlife habitat and 
ground cover, and impacts on local markets. A savings to 
Government would likely result from the compensation offset, 
while monitoring and enforcement costs would likely increase 
slightly.

 1995-CROP MARKETING QUOTA AND PRICE SUPPORT LEVEL FOR FLUE-CURED 
TOBACCO 


Legal Authority:  
7 USC 1314; 
7 USC 1445 
CFR Citation:  
07 CFR 723; 
07 CFR 1464 
Legal Deadline:  
Final, Statutory, December 15, 1994. 


Marketing Quotas 


Abstract: The flue-cured tobacco marketing quota and price support are 
required by statute. The purpose of quotas and price support is 
to balance supply with demand at levels assuring stable supplies 
for domestic and export use at prices that are considered 
sufficient for producers. The national quota is based on 
cigarette manufacturers' intentions, 3-year average exports, a 
loan stocks adjustment, and discretionary adjustment of plus or 
minus 3 percent. The quota may not be less than 90 percent of the 
previous year's quota except this limit may be waived if producer 
association inventories likely will exceed 150 percent of the 
reserve stock level. The price support level is based on a 
formula that averages market prices (2/3 weight) and a cost index 
(1/3 weight), with discretion to limit any increase to 65 percent 
of the formula increase. Marketing quotas are implemented if 
approved by producer in a referendum scheduled for January 1995. 
Gross loan outlays of $30 million are expected in FY's 1995 and 
1996. They will be offset by redemptions and no-net-cost 
assessments in FY 1996 and later years, for a net cost of 0.

 1995-CROP MARKET QUOTA AND PRICE SUPPORT LEVELS FOR SIX KINDS OF 
TOBACCO 


Legal Authority:

7 USC 1445 
CFR Citation:  
07 CFR 723; 
07 CFR 1464 
Legal Deadline:  
Final, Statutory, March 1, 1995. 


Marketing Quotas. 


Abstract: Marketing quotas and acreage allotments are required by statute 
for these kinds of tobacco: Fire-cured (type 21), Fire-cured 
(types 22-23), Dark Air-cured (types 35-36), Virginia sun-cured 
(type 37), Cigar Filler (type 46) and Cigar Filler and Binder 
(types 42-44 and 53-55). Quotas and allotments are determined by 
statutory formula to balance supply with demand to assure stable 
supplies for domestic and export use. Marketing quotas are 
implemented if approved by producers in referenda. Producers 
approved quotas for the 1995 crops of cigar filler (type 46) and 
cigar filler and binder (types 42-44 and 53-55) in March, 1993. 
Referenda for the other kinds are scheduled for March, 1994 and 
1995. Producers of these types have historically voted in favor 
of quotas. Price support levels are set by statutory formula. The 
Secretary may reduce the level at the request of producer 
associations, and may limit increases to 65 percent of the 
formula increase. Gross loan outlays of $2 million are expected 
in FY 1996. They will be offset by loan redemptions and 
no-net-cost assessments in FY 1996 and subsequent years, for a 
net cost of 0.

 1995-CROP MARKETING QUOTAS FOR THREE KINDS OF TOBACCO 


Legal Authority:  
7 USC 1312; 
7 USC 1445 
CFR Citation:  
07 CFR 723 
Legal Deadline:  
Final, Statutory, March 1, 1995. 


Abstract: Marketing quotas and acreage allotments are required by statute 
to be announced for these three kinds of tobacco: Maryland (type 
32), cigar filler (type 41) and cigar binder (type 51-52). 
Marketing quotas are implemented, if approved by producers in 
referenda, to achieve a supply equal to the ``reserve supply 
level'' as defined by legislation. No quotas are in effect because 
producers disapproved quotas for 1992-94 crops,
