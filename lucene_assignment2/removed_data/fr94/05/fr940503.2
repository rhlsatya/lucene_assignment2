Availability of Environmental Assessments and Findings of No Significant Impact 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are advising the public that six environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared
by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service relative to the issuance of permits to allow the field testing of
genetically engineered organisms. The environmental assessments provide a basis for our conclusion that the field
testing of these genetically engineered organisms will not present a risk of introducing or disseminating a plant
pest and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Based on its findings of no significant
impact, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that environmental impact statements need
not be prepared. 

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The regulations in 7 CFR part 340 (referred to below as the regulations) regulate the introduction (importation,
interstate movement, and release into the environment) of genetically engineered organisms and products that are
plant pests or that there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulated articles). A permit must be obtained before
a regulated article may be introduced into the United States. The regulations set forth the procedures for obtaining
a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the
release into the environment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has stated
that it would prepare an environmental assessment and, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before
issuing a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906). 



In the course of reviewing each permit application, APHIS assessed the impact on the environment that releasing the
organisms under the conditions described in the permit application would have. APHIS has issued permits for the field
testing of the organisms listed below after concluding that the organisms will not present a risk of plant pest introduction
or dissemination and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. The environmental
assessments and findings of no significant impact, which are based on data submitted by the applicants and on a review
of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentation of APHIS' 
review and analysis of the environmental impacts associated with conducting the field tests. 

Environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared by APHIS relative to the issuance
of permits to allow the field testing of the following genetically engineered organisms: 







The environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared in accordance with: (1) The
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq

.), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA 
(40 CFR parts 1500-1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing
NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274, August 31, 1979).

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

FGIS announces the designation of Memphis Grain Inspection Service (Memphis) to provide official inspection services
under the United States Grain Standards Act, as amended (Act). FGIS also announces that there were no applicants for
the Alaska area, and that there will be no designated agency to serve Alaska.






</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



This action has been reviewed and determined not to be a rule or regulation as defined in Executive Order 12866 and Departmental
Regulation 1512-1; therefore, the Executive Order and Departmental Regulation do not apply to this action.

In the December 1, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 63332), FGIS announced that the designations of Memphis and Alaska end on May 31, 1994, and asked persons interested
in providing official services within the specified geographic areas to submit an application for designation.
Applications were due by December 31, 1993. Memphis applied for designation in the entire area currently assigned
to it. There were no applicants for the Alaska geographic area. FGIS requested comments on the applicant for the Memphis
area, and comments on the need for official services in Alaska in the February 1, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 4679). Comments were due by March 2, 1994. FGIS received no comments. FGIS evaluated all available information
regarding the designation criteria in Section 7(f)(1)(A) of the Act; and according to Section 7(f)(1)(B), determined
that Memphis was able to provide official services in the geographic area for which they applied.

Effective June 1, 1994, and ending May 31, 1997, Memphis is designated to provide official inspection services in
the geographic area specified in the December 

Federal Register

.

FGIS also determined that, pursuant to the provisions of the Act, there is insufficient need for official services
in Alaska to designate an agency. Alaska's designation ends May 31, 1994. Any person desiring official services in
Alaska after this date should contact the FGIS office in Olympia, Washington at 206-753-9072 (Fax: 206-586-5257).

<DOCTITLE>Management Plan Being Developed for Allegheny National Wild and Scenic River; Warren, Forest, and Venango Counties,
PA</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service will prepare a draft and final environmental impact statement for a Management Plan and Final Corridor
Boundaries for the Allegheny National Wild and Scenic River located in northwestern Pennsylvania.



The agency invites written comments and suggestions on the issues to be addressed and management recommendations
needed to protect the outstandingly remarkable values of the Allegheny National Wild and Scenic River. In addition,
the agency gives notice of the environmental analysis and decisionmaking process that will occur on the proposal
so that interested and affected people are aware of how they may participate and contribute to the decision. This EIS
will result in an amendment to the Allegheny National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On April 20, 1992, legislation was signed (Pub. L. 102-271) amending the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968 to
include 85 miles of the Allegheny River as a component of the National Wild and Scenic River System. This act gave a ``recreational''
classification to all three designated sections of the Allegheny River between Kinzua Dam and Emlenton, PA. The Act
directed the Secretary of Agriculture to establish two advisory councils to advise him on the final corridor boundaries
and the management of the designated river segments. Approximately 20 percent of the designated river segments are
bordered by public lands and 80 percent by private lands.



The decision to be made, based on this environmental impact statement is: What management guidelines and final corridor
boundaries will best preserve and protect for present and future generations the outstanding scenic, natural recreational,
scientific, historic and ecological values of the Allegheny River while adequately recognizing private land rights?

The following preliminary issues derived from public involvement during the initial river study and the more recent
advisory council process, as well as significant issues identified during additional scoping, will be considered
in the environmental analysis: (1) Public vs. Private Interests: There is a concern that with the increasing use of
the river by the public, the possibility of conflicts between private landowners and river users will increase. Landowners
are also concerned about the loss of property rights and increased regulation to protect identified river values.
There is also concern that private land use could change the character of the river corridor. (2) River Development:
There is concern about what will be proposed, how proposed river development will be managed and how river development
will affect municipalities and landowners. There is also concern about how to maintain the river's character and
minimize impacts on riparian landowners while developing the economic potential of the river. (3) Land Acquisition:
There is a concern that acquisition of land by the Forest Service within the river corridor will result in a loss of tax
base for local municipalities.

A range of alternatives will be considered. They will include, as a minimum, the no action alternative that does not
recommend any action to implement the Wild and Scenic River designation beyond that which is needed to meet minimum
requirements and existing laws; and an alternative that recommends maximum protection of designated sections,
including public land purchase and the inforporation of advisory council recommendations. Additional alternatives
may be developed from public comments received during the scoping process. The environmental impact statement will
disclose the direct, indirect and cumulative effects of implementing each alternative.

The Forest Service is seeking information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State and local agencies, and
other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposal. Comments previously submitted
during the river study and relevant to the management of the corridor as well as new information submitted will be utilized
in the preparation of the draft environmental impact statement. During April 1994, news releases will be mailed to
local and regional newspapers, radio stations, etc., and letters will be sent to key contacts and interested and affected
publics. Advisory Council meetings will continue to be used as a means to inform the public of the analysis process
and to provide for public participation and involvement. Additional meetings may be held in other locations.

The responsible official is Floyd J. Marita, Regional Forester.

The draft environmental impact statement is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
and to be available for public review by September 1994. At that time, EPA will publish a notice of availability of the
draft environmental impact statement in the 

Federal Register

.

The comment period on the draft environmental impact statement will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection
Agency publishes the notice of available in the 

Federal Register

.

The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. Upon release of the draft environmental impact
statement, projected for September 1994, reviewers must structure their participation in the environmental review
of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.

 v. 

NRDC,

 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact statement
stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed
by the courts. 

City of Angoon

 v. 

Hodel,

 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc.

 v. 

Harris,

 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposal participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
environmental impact statement.

To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. (Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.)

After the comment period ends on the draft environmental impact statement, the comments will be analyzed, and considered
by the Forest Service in preparing the final environmental impact statement. The final environmental impact statement

Administration (NOAA), Commerce. 




<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact 
statement and request for comment. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The ARPA, in cooperation with the NMFS, intends to 
prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS), according to the 
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), on an application for a 
scientific research permit to allow harassment of marine mammals 
and sea turtles by a low frequency sound source, and to monitor 
the effects thereof. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 An application for a scientific 
research permit has been submitted by Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography, Institute for Geophysics and Planetary Physics, 
Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC) Program, 9500 Gilman 
Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093-0225. The applicant is requesting 
authorization to take (by harassment) several species of 
cetaceans, pinnipeds, and sea turtles in California coastal 
waters, during a study designed to assess the effects of low 
frequency sound associated with the ATOC program on marine 
mammals and sea turtles. The proposed research is a pilot 
project which is intended to provide information which can be 
used in assessing the potential environmental effects of 
continuing the ATOC program in a broader context. If a decision 
is made to continue funding for the broader ATOC program, any 
potential environmental effects will be assessed in a separate 
environmental analysis. 



The subject research was proposed to be conducted in 
California waters from April 1994 through March 1996. As 
currently proposed, the sound source will be located due west of 
Pt. Sur, California at 850-950 m depth. The maximum duty cycle 
will be 8%, with a transmission bandwidth of 20 Hz at a level of 
195 dB (re 1  u Pa at 1m), and with a spectrum level for the center 
frequency (70 Hz) at 182 dB. The effects of these transmissions 
on marine mammals and sea turtles will be monitored through the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA)
of 1972, as 
amended (16 U.S.C. 1361 

et seq.

), the Regulations Governing the 
Taking and Importing of Marine Mammals (50 CFR part 216), the 
Endangered Species Act (EIS) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 


et seq

.), the regulations governing the taking, importing, and exporting of endangered fish and wildlife (50 CFR part 222),

the Fur Seal Act of 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1151 

et seq.

), 
and fur seal regulations at 50 CFR part 215. ARPA and NMFS invite 
interested parties to participate in determining the scope of 
significant issues to be addressed in the EIS. Significant 
issues currently under consideration by ARPA and NMFS are: the 
potential effects of the proposed low frequency sound source on 
marine mammals, sea turtles, and other marine resources, 
including fish; alternatives with respect to site selection; and, 
as a related issue, the purpose of the ATOC program, and an 
evaluation thereof as compared to other possible alternatives for 
assessing global warming. ARPA and NMFS will also consider as 
part of the scoping process, comments received at a public 
hearing to be held in California on May 16, 1994, from 5 p.m. to 
10 p.m. at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, 307 Church Street, 
Santa Cruz, California co-sponsored with the Monterey Bay 
National Marine Sanctuary. The period from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. will be allotted for the applicant to provide a brief description
of an udpated research program. Upon completion of a draft EIS on the proposed application, ARPA and NMFS will solicit
public comments on it, as well.

<DOCTITLE>Chicago Mercantile Exchange: Proposed Amendments Establishing a Report-Based Contract Month Cycle for the Live
Hog and Frozen Pork Bellies Futures Option Contracts</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Proposed Contract Market Rule Change. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has submitted proposed amendments to its live hogs and frozen pork bellies
futures option contracts. The proposed amendments will establish a ``report-based'' contract month trading cycle.
Trading in each contract month of the cycle will occur only during a two-week period immediately preceding the release
of the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) quarterly ``Hogs and Pigs'' report. 


In accordance with section 5a(a)(12) of the Commodity Exchange Act and acting pursuant to the authority delegated
by Commission Regulation 140.96, the Acting Director of the Division of Economic Analysis (Division) of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (Commission) has determined, on behalf of the Commission, that publication of the proposed
amendments is in the public interest. On behalf of the Commission, the Division is requesting comment on this proposal.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under the existing terms of the live hogs and pork bellies futures option contracts, the CME lists ``regular cycle''
option contract months which are exercisable into each of the contract months listed by the CME for the underlying
live hogs and pork bellies futures contracts.

1

 Currently, all live hogs option contract months expire on the first Friday of the underlying futures contract month.
All but one of the contract months listed for the pork bellies option contract expire on the last Friday that precedes
by at least three days the first business day of the underlying futures contract month.

2

 The CME presently lists for trading at all times the nearest five live hogs option contract months and the nearest four
pork bellies option contract months.

3

 






The pork bellies option contract's existing terms provide for the listing of 11 strike prices in intervals of two cents
per pound at the commencement of trading in a contract month, including the strike price nearest to the previous day's
settlement price and the next five strike prices above and the next five strike prices below that strike price. The
pork bellies option contract currently provides for the listing of additional strike prices as necessary to maintain
the listing of at least the next five strike prices above and the next five strike prices below the prevailing prices
for the underlying futures contract month. 
The live hogs option contract currently provides for the listing at the commencement of trading in a contract month
of all strike prices in intervals of two cents per pound that fall within the range of ten cents above and ten cents below
the previous day's settlement price for the underlying futures contract month. In addition, the live hogs option
contract currently provides that, when a contract month becomes the next-to-expire contract month, all strike prices
that fall within a range of six cents per pound above or six cents per pound below the previous day's settlement price
will be listed in intervals of one cent per pound. The live hogs option contract's existing terms also provide for the
listing of additional strike prices as necessary to ensure that all strike prices at the specified price intervals
are listed within the above-noted ranges of ten and, as appropriate, six cents above and below the prevailing prices
for the underlying futures contract month. 
The proposed amendments would provide for the listing of a ``report-based'' cycle of contract months for the live
hog and frozen pork bellies option contracts, in addition to the listing of the ``regular cycle'' of option contract
months currently provided for in the contracts' rules.

4

 Each report-based option will have a trading life of two weeks. Specifically, a report-based option contract month
will be listed on the first business day of the calendar week preceding the week in which the USDA releases the quarterly
``Hogs and Pigs'' report

5

 and will expire on the last business day of the week in which the report is released.

6

For report-based options in live hogs, the underlying futures contract will be the second-nearest futures contract
to delivery. For example, the underlying futures contract for a report-based option that is listed in March in connection
with the release of the March Hogs and Pigs report would be the June futures contract month. Similarly, the underlying
futures contracts for the other report-based options to be listed during the calendar year are: the August futures
contract month for the option listed during June; the December futures contract month for the option listed in September;
and the April futures contract month for the option listed in December. The CME shall list initially, and thereafter
maintain, put and call live hogs report-based options with strike prices at one-cent intervals in a range of six-cents
above and below the previous day's settlement price of the underlying futures contract, and at two-cent intervals
in a range 10 cents above and below the previous day's settlement price of the underlying futures contract. 


The underlying futures contract months for pork bellies report-based options are: the May futures contract month
for the option listed in March; the August futures contract month for the option listed in June; the February futures
contract month for the option listed in September; and the March futures contract month for the option listed in December.
The CME shall list initially and maintain pork bellies report-based put and call options at eleven strike prices listed
in two-cent intervals, including the strike price that is nearest the previous day's settlement price of the underlying
futures contract, and the next five higher, and the next five lower strike prices. 

The proposed amendments will continue to specify the listing of the ``regular cycle'' of option contract months and
the listing of strike prices for such months in the same manner as provided for in the contracts' existing terms. 

In support of the proposed amendments, the CME states the following:

 


Options on futures allow hedgers to shield themselves from the adverse impact of a [``Hogs and Pigs''] report while
retaining much of the ability to benefit from a favorable market response. However, for hedgers using options on the
more distant contract months, the high cost of buying an option_due to the large time value component of the option
premium_can outweigh the benefits of protection from an unfavorable market reaction. As a result, many potential
hedgers are effectively priced out of the option market. 

Short-dated options would address this problem. Since these options would be traded for such a short time, the time
value component of the option premium would be negligible, and therefore the total premium would be substantially
less than for a traditional long-dated option, all other things being the same. This would make short-dated options
an attractive risk-management tool for hedgers who require protection around the release of these critical reports,
and particularly those whose usage of options is currently limited due to the cost of the premium.

 


Copies of the proposed amendments will be available for inspection at the Office of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, at the above address. Copies of the amended terms and conditions can be obtained through the Office

Clearance Request for Certification of Commercial Pricing


AGENCIES: 

Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA).



<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of request for an extension to an existing OMB clearance (9000-0105).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501), the Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR) Secretariat has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request to review and approve an extension
of a currently approved information collection requirement concerning Certification of Commercial Pricing.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Purpose


This clearance covers the extension of reporting requirements as required by 41 U.S.C. 253e on Certification of Commercial
Pricing. The clauses at FAR 52.215-32 and 52.215-35 require that offerors/contractors certify to the
best of their knowledge and belief that prices offered for certain spare or repair parts that the contractor offers
for sale to the public are no higher than the lowest commercial sales price at which such parts were sold during the most
recent regular monthly, quarterly, or other period for which sales data are reasonably available, provided that
in no event shall this period be less than 30 days in duration. All items for which prices offered are higher than the
lowest commercial sales price discussed above must be identified and a written justification for the differences
supplied.
The commercial pricing information is used by contracting officers to ensure that the Government does not pay prices
for commercial spare and repair parts that exceed the lowest commercial sales prices at which such items are sold by
the contractor to the general public unless the price differences are justified. Without the information, the Government
may pay prices for such supplies that are higher than prices paid by other customers.


B. Annual Reporting Burden


Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 

120

 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering
and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding

burden, to General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat, 18th & F Streets, NW., room 4037, Washington,
DC 20405, and to the FAR Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget,
Washington, DC 20503.
The annual reporting burden is estimated as follows: Respondents, 

303

; responses per respondent, 

1

; total annual responses, 

303

; preparation hours per response, 

120

; and total response burden hours,

<DOCTITLE>Finding of No Significant Impact for the Urgent-Relief Acceptance of Foreign Research Reactor Spent Nuclear Fuel
</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 United States Department of Energy (DOE).

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Finding of no significant impact.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., the Council on Environmental Quality's
implementing regulations, 40 CFR parts 1500-1508, DOE's implementing procedures, 10 CFR part 1021, and Executive
Order 12114, Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Federal Actions, the DOE has prepared an Environmental Assessment
(DOE/EA-0912, April 1994) to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the proposed urgent-relief
acceptance of foreign research reactor spent nuclear fuel. 


The Environmental Assessment analyzed the potential environmental impacts under the proposed action of accepting
up to 409 spent nuclear fuel elements from eight reactors in Europe for storage in an existing DOE wet storage facility
to meet the urgent needs of certain foreign research reactor operators and to avoid failure of a key United States nuclear
weapons nonproliferation objective of minimizing and eventually eliminating the use of highly enriched uranium
in civil programs worldwide. Specifically, the Environmental Assessment analyzed the potential impacts of transporting
the spent nuclear fuel elements by commercial or chartered vessel from eight reactors in Europe to any one of five ports
of entry in the United States (Wilmington, North Carolina; the Army Military Ocean Terminal at Sunny Point, North
Carolina; Charleston, South Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; and Jacksonville, Florida), off-loading the spent fuel
at the port of entry and transporting it by truck or rail to the Savannah River Site, near Aiken, South Carolina; and
storing the spent fuel there until decisions are made regarding interim storage and ultimate disposition. The Nuclear
Waste Policy Act authorizes ultimate disposal of the spent fuel in a geologic repository. 
In October 1993, DOE provided a draft Environmental Assessment for comment to the States of Georgia and South Carolina,
and the Commonwealth of Virginia, and interested individuals and organizations. In February 1994, DOE provided
a revised draft Environmental Assessment to the States of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina,
the Commonwealth of Virginia, and to individuals and groups known to have an interest in the proposed action, and requested
that comments on the draft Environmental Assessment be submitted by March 7, 1994. On February 10, 1994, Federal,
State and local government representatives, citizen groups, individuals and members of the international community
attended a meeting in Washington, DC, to present their views concerning the proposed action. DOE also held public
meetings in communities potentially affected by the proposed acceptance of foreign research reactor spent fuel.
On March 18, 1994, the comment period on the draft Environmental Assessment was extended until April 8, 1994, to provide
an additional opportunity for stakeholders to provide comments. The Environmental Assessment has been revised,
where appropriate, to reflect comments received during the comment period.

Based on an evaluation of the use of either commercial or chartered vessels, the proposed ports of entry and alternative
modes of transporting the spent nuclear fuel (truck or train) from the port of entry to the Savannah River Site, DOE
has concluded that no significant impact would result from receipt of the spent fuel at any of the five proposed ports
and overland transport by rail or truck from the port of entry to the Savannah River Site. Therefore, based on the analysis
in the Environmental Assessment and after careful consideration of all comments from Federal, State and local officials,
members of the public and from the international community, DOE has determined that the acceptance of up to 409 spent
nuclear fuel elements from eight foreign research reactors in Europe for storage at the Savannah River Site does not
constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, within the meaning
of the National Environmental Policy Act. Accordingly, an Environmental Impact Statement is not required and the
DOE is issuing this Finding of No Significant Impact. 

However, upon further consideration, and in an effort to balance the domestic and international interests at stake,
DOE has decided to implement the proposed action as follows. The spent fuel will be shipped either by commercial or
chartered vessel from Europe to the Army's Military Ocean Terminal at Sunny Point, North Carolina to the maximum extent
practicable (rather than allowing the shipper to select from among any one of the five proposed ports as described
in the Environmental Assessment), and transported overland by rail (rather than truck). Should DOE determine that
another port or mode of transport (from among those considered as the proposed action) is necessary, DOE will provide
direct notice of the change to State and local government officials of the affected States and will notify the public
through local media and other means, as appropriate.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 1950's, as part of the ``Atoms for Peace'' program, the United States began providing assistance in the peaceful
application of nuclear technologies to countries that agreed to forego the development of nuclear weapons. This
assistance included the provision of highly enriched uranium for use in research reactors around the world. After
irradiation in the reactor, the used (spent) fuel was transported to the United States, where it was reprocessed to
extract the uranium still remaining in the spent fuel. In this way, the United States maintained control of the highly
enriched uranium, which otherwise could be used to make nuclear weapons. 



To reduce the danger of nuclear weapons proliferation, the United States began a program in 1978 aimed at minimizing
and eventually eliminating the use of highly enriched uranium in civilian reactor programs worldwide. This effort
(the Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors Program) was directed at replacing the highly enriched uranium
used in research reactors with low enriched uranium, a material that is not directly usable in nuclear weapons. Research
reactors are of particular interest because the major civilian use of highly enriched uranium is as fuel in research
reactors. If research reactors worldwide were to convert to low enriched uranium fuels, highly enriched uranium
essentially would be eliminated from use in civil commerce. 

For research reactors converting to low enriched uranium fuel, acceptance of spent fuel by the United States was viewed
as essential to offset the substantial expenses and reduction in reactor efficiency and capability resulting from
conversion. The United States accepted highly enriched uranium spent fuel for several decades, until the program
was allowed to expire in 1988. 

DOE decided in mid-1993 to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement on a new proposed policy to accept, over a 10-15
year period, up to 15,000 spent fuel elements containing uranium enriched in the United States. The goal of the proposed
long-term policy would be to recover highly enriched uranium exported from the United States, while giving foreign
research reactor operators sufficient time to develop their own long-term solutions for storage and disposal of
spent fuel. Although the Environmental Impact Statement is under preparation, DOE does not expect to complete the
analysis and make a decision on whether to implement the policy until mid to late 1995.

Because DOE has not accepted any spent fuel containing uranium enriched in the United States for more than five years,
several foreign research reactor operators are running out of storage capacity and facing safety and regulatory
issues associated with the presence of spent fuel at their sites. If the United States is unable to commit now to the
near-term acceptance of a small amount of foreign research reactor spent fuel, several reactor operators soon will
either shut down their reactors or ship their spent fuel offsite for reprocessing. Neither option would serve the
nonproliferation interests of the United States. Thus, at the urging of the Department of State, DOE is proposing
to accept a small number of highly enriched uranium spent fuel elements in the near term for storage in an existing federal
facility in South Carolina. 
DOE believes that preparation of the Environmental Assessment, which analyzes the potential environmental impacts
of the proposed urgent-relief acceptance of a small number of spent fuel elements before the Environmental Impact
Statement is completed, fully complies with the National Environmental Policy Act and its implementing regulations.
The proposed near-term acceptance is justified independently of the decision on whether to establish a new policy
on the proposed long-term acceptance of foreign research reactor spent fuel. Until the Environmental Impact Statement
is completed and a decision made whether to implement the proposed long-term acceptance policy, the proposed acceptance
of a small number of spent fuel elements is necessary to maintain the United States program of encouraging the conversion
by research reactors to low enriched uranium fuel. Further, while there is an obvious relationship between the two
proposals, a decision to accept such a small number of fuel elements does not foreclose or prejudice future decisions
regarding establishment of a new spent fuel acceptance policy, or the decisions regarding interim storage or ultimate
disposition of spent nuclear fuel. (In the Programmatic Spent Nuclear Fuel Management Environmental Impact Statement,
due to be completed by June 1995, DOE is considering where to manage all spent fuel within the DOE complex nationwide
for the interim period prior to ultimate disposition.) 
In October 1993, to ensure that countries currently possessing spent fuel continue to support the nonproliferation
initiatives of the United States embodied in the Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactor Program until the
ongoing Environmental Impact Statement can be completed, DOE issued for comment a draft Environmental Assessment
which evaluated the proposed urgent-relief acceptance of up to 700 elements of foreign research reactor spent nuclear
fuel containing uranium enriched in the United States. It was apparent from the comments that DOE received in response
to the October 1993 draft that many people did not agree that there is a need for the United States to accept this spent
fuel. Others expressed concerns regarding DOE's plans for implementing the proposed action. Subsequent to the release
of the October 1993 draft Environmental Assessment and after consideration of comments received, teams of experts
from the United States visited foreign research reactors in Europe and Australia to assess the near-term need for
acceptance of foreign research reactor spent fuel elements before the Environmental Impact Statement on the proposed
long-term acceptance policy is completed. 

In February 1994, a revised draft Environmental Assessment, which included revisions made in response to comments
received on the October 1993 draft Environmental Assessment, was prepared and issued for public review and comment.
The proposed action evaluated in the February draft Environmental Assessment was to accept 448 highly enriched uranium
spent fuel elements shipped by sea to any one of seven ports (Newport News, Norfolk, or Portsmouth, Virginia; Charleston,
South Carolina; Wilmington, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; and Jacksonville, Florida) and then by truck to
DOE's Savannah River Site near Aiken, South Carolina, for storage. The comment period on the revised draft Environmental
Assessment was scheduled to close on March 7, 1994. On February 10, 1994, DOE and the Department of State co-hosted
a meeting of stakeholders from State and local governments, Congress, environmental and non-proliferation public
interest groups, other private sector interest groups, foreign research reactor operators and key affected communities.
The purpose of that meeting was to involve stakeholders in a meaningful and constructive dialogue on the proposed
urgent-relief acceptance of a small number of spent fuel elements from foreign research reactors. Subsequent to
that meeting and based on concerns raised by local communities potentially affected by the proposed action, DOE extended
the comment period on the February draft Environmental Assessment until April 8, 1994. 



Proposed Action



The DOE proposes to accept up to 409 spent nuclear fuel elements containing highly enriched uranium of United States
origin from eight research reactors in seven European countries (Austria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Netherlands,
Sweden and Switzerland). The spent fuel would be shipped across the ocean in up to 15 spent fuel transportation casks
from the country of origin to one or more United States eastern seaboard ports. The casks are expected to be transported
in the next several months either by commercial container ships or chartered ships. Several casks could be transported
together on a single ship to any one of the five proposed ports of entry: Wilmington and the United States Army's Military
Ocean Terminal at Sunny Point, North Carolina; Charleston, South Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; and Jacksonville,
Florida.

After arriving in the United States, the casks would be transported to DOE's Savannah River Site near Aiken, South
Carolina, where the fuel elements would be stored underwater in an existing storage facility (the Receiving Basin
for Offsite Fuels). 




Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action





Routine Operation:

 During routine (non-accident condition) ocean transport, there would be no impact to the marine environment. Radiation
exposure from the very small radiation fields being emitted from the casks_about 1 millirem per hour at 1 meter from
the cask surface_would be limited primarily to crew members who inspect the cargo on a daily basis to ensure secure
stowage and structural safety of the vessel. Incident-free dose estimates to these crew members would be essentially
the same regardless of the port of entry, largely because the exposure is proportional to the numbers of inspections
over time. Distances and time of transit are similar from the European ports to the proposed United States ports of
entry. Assuming that the ship makes three intermediate port stops and then unloads at the fourth stop, the incident-free
dose to a ship cargo inspector is estimated to be 4.3 millirem for shipments into Sunny Point and Wilmington, North
Carolina; 4.5 millirem for shipments into Charleston, South Carolina; and 4.6 millirem for shipments into Jacksonville,
Florida and Savannah, Georgia. The likelihood of a single fatal cancer among the entire crew of all the ships used in
the proposed action is approximately one in 450,000. If no intermediate port stops are assumed, the collective dose
would be reduced by approximately 30 percent. 

Because container cargo handling is relatively uniform throughout the world, exposure to port workers (handlers/inspectors)
also would be essentially the same regardless of the port of entry. Using a conservative assumption, i.e., the same
handler/inspector inspects all shipments, the maximally exposed port worker would receive a dose of approximately
5.2 millirem. The collective exposure (assuming the same crew of handlers/inspectors for all shipments) to the handlers/inspectors
is estimated as 0.078 person-rem (0.0052 rem  x  15 workers). The likelihood of a single individual port worker
dying from cancer as a result of the proposed action is about 1 in 380,000. Dose to members of the general public during
port operations would be extremely low because residences are separated from dock facilities by buffer spaces such
as parking lots, warehouses and other port facilities. 

During truck transport of the spent fuel from the port of entry to the Savannah River Site, the maximally exposed individual
truck crew member (assuming the same person is involved in all truck shipments) would receive 2.4 millirem for shipments
from Charleston, South Carolina; 2.7 millirem for shipments from Savannah, Georgia; 4.1 millirem for shipments
from Wilmington, North Carolina; 4.5 millirem for shipments from Sunny Point, North Carolina; and 3.9 millirem for
shipments from Jacksonville, Florida. The likelihood of a single crew member dying from cancer as a result of transporting
spent fuel from Sunny Point to the Savannah River Site is about 1 in 440,000. 

The maximum exposure to an individual not actively involved in shipping the spent fuel during routine transport was
estimated for two cases: (1) a member of the public who lives beside the highway route (this individual was assumed
to be exposed to each of the 15 truck shipments at a distance of 30 meters); and (2) an individual located near a stopped
truck, e.g., in a traffic jam. The maximum in-transit dose under the first instance was calculated to be 0.002 millirem
for routine operations. A dose of 0.002 millirem would increase the risk of a latent cancer fatality by 1 in one billion.
For the second case, an individual could receive doses higher than 0.002 millirem depending on the duration of the
stop and the distance of the individual from the truck. For example, in the unlikely event that a person was standing
outside a stopped truck for a period of 1/2 hour at a distance of two meters, the person could receive a dose of one millirem.


Since port workers, inspectors, and truck drivers are not considered radiation workers, as defined by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC), the maximum annual allowable exposure for these personnel would be 100 millirem, the
same radiation dose limit established by the NRC to protect the individual members of the general public. As discussed
above, during normal transport of the spent nuclear fuel, the maximum annual exposure to the public, port workers,
inspectors, and truck drivers would be well below the 100 millirem dose limit, and no doses large enough to result in
acute health effects are predicted among either the workers or general public for the proposed action. The cumulative
annual incident-free dose from the proposed activity to all persons potentially exposed would range between 0.12
person-rem (Charleston and Savannah) and 0.16 person-rem (Sunny Point). 

Currently, the average annual individual worker dose at the Receiving Basin for Off-Site Fuels (RBOF) for all operations
(unloading, handling and storage of the spent nuclear fuel elements) is approximately 150 millirem. Based on very
conservative assumptions, i.e., all 409 spent fuel elements are received in a one-year period and the same individuals
unload all 15 casks, the maximum annual increase in the average individual dose to a worker at RBOF is estimated to be
60 millirem. This dose would be well below both the DOE limit of 5,000 millirem per year for radiation workers and the
DOE Administrative control level of 2,000 millirem per year per person, for all DOE activities. Once the spent fuel
elements were stored under water in the RBOF, the increase in radiation exposure to facility personnel from the storage
of the foreign spent fuel elements would not be detectable. 

Only minor environmental impacts would be expected from the proposed action because the receipt and storage of up
to 409 spent fuel elements represents only a small increase to existing site activity and involves no new construction.
Approximately 15 cubic feet of laundry type waste and 5.5 cubic feet of solid waste would be generated per cask. The
proposed action would add less than 4 percent to the average annual solid waste normally generated at RBOF. Receipt
and storage of foreign research reactor spent nuclear fuel would have no effect on the types, quantities or utilization
of hazardous compounds stored at RBOF, and no incremental risk to workers would be expected. 



Accident Conditions:

 The Environmental Assessment evaluates the potential for accidents during ocean transport (port departure, ocean
crossing, and port arrival), overland transport, and storage at RBOF.

In the extremely unlikely event of an accidental fire at sea in which a cask was sufficiently damaged by the fire to release
its contents, members of the ship crew near the fire would be exposed to the released radioactive material. However,
any crew member close enough to the fire to suffer a significant radiation dose likely would be more severely injured
from the fire than the radiation dose. If crew members were to survive the fire, radiological impacts would be similar
to those resulting from a severe accident in port, which would result in a maximum exposure to workers and the public
of approximately 0.21 person-rem. This exposure would result in an approximately one in 9,500 chance of one additional
cancer in the entire exposed population. If such an accident were to occur at sea, however, there would be essentially
no exposure to members of the public, and all released activity would be deposited in the ocean. Assuming that the spent
fuel cask lay on the ocean floor where it slowly released its radioactive inventory, the peak doses to biota residing
on the ocean floor in or near the uppermost sediment layer are estimated to be 0.11 rad (radiation adsorbed dose) per
year for fish, 0.17 rad per year for crustaceans and 7.3 rad per year for mollusks. The radioactive material would be
expected to disperse and to be diluted due to the influence of ocean currents. Since deleterious effects of chronic
irradiation have not been observed in natural populations at dose rates of less than 365 rad, no significant impacts
would be expected. Further, uranium, the major constituent of the spent fuel, has not been found to bioaccumulate
in fish and bioaccumulates only slightly in crustaceans and mollusks. No significant chemical hazard would be expected
from the release of the contents of the spent fuel elements into the open ocean. 

Spent fuel casks are designed to withstand at least a 15-meter immersion, and it has been demonstrated that the cask
seals will remain intact at much greater depths. Further, damaged and undamaged casks can be recovered readily from
water up to 200 meters deep. Recovery from depths of up to 2,000 meters may be possible, but would be costly. 

In an extreme situation, where the accident occurs in coastal wasters, the spent fuel is not recovered, and both the
spent fuel and cask are damaged, the peak dose to an individual is estimated to be 11 millirem per year. This individual
is assumed to reside near the shore and to eat seafood (fish, mollusk, seaweed) harvested from the area in the immediate
vicinity of the spent fuel cask. 

In the event of the most severe port accident (major mechanical damage, fire, oxidation of 100 percent of the fuel,
and release of radioactive material from a cask containing 33 spent fuel elements), the dose to a maximally exposed
individual, i.e., an individual assumed to be standing outside approximately 100 feet away from the event and remaining
there for 24 hours, would be 25 rem. At such close distance, it is highly probable that the individuals, if not evacuated,
would be harmed more by the explosion and fire engulfing the cask than by the radiation dose. If the individual were
inside a building approximately 100 feet away and remained there for 24 hours after the accident, the dose would be
reduced to 0.22 rem. At a more likely distance, where an individual may be located outside for a period of 24 hours after
the accident, the dose at 0.6 miles would be 0.21 rem. If the person were inside at the same distance, the dose would be
0.002 rem. When considered in conjunction with the unlikely probability of occurrence (approximately 1 chance in
7.7 million), the accident has an extremely small risk. For example, the risk of developing a single fatal cancer for
the most severe case, i.e., individual outside, 100 feet away for 24 hours receiving 25 rem, is about 1 chance in 600
million. 

In the event of an overland accident, assuming the surrounding population remains there for a 24-hour period, the
estimated population dose risk is 0.0000015 person-rem for transport from Savannah, 0.0000018 person-rem from
Charleston, 0.0000028 person-rem from Wilmington, 0.0000024 person-rem from Jacksonville, and 0.0000035 person-rem
from Sunny Point. While there would be slightly different risks among the different ports, no significant impacts
would result. 

Four hypothetical accidents at RBOF were evaluated that could potentially release radionuclides to the atmosphere.
These accidents include: (1) A nuclear criticality incident; (2) a fire and explosion at RBOF; (3) accidental cutting
of fuel element cores; and (4) rupture or failure of fuel elements during underwater storage. The maximum dose was
attributed to the unlikely accident of 1000 foreign fuel elements rupturing during storage at RBOF. This event would
result in an 8.3 millirem maximum dose to the individual at the site boundary and a 70 person-rem dose for the offsite
population. The probability of such an accident occurring, however, would be less than one in 2000 years. When the
probability is taken into account, there would be an additional 1 in 500 million chance that the individual at the site
boundary would develop a fatal cancer, and a 1 in 55,000 chance that a single fatal cancer would occur in the exposed
populations.

Environmental Impacts of Alternatives


Alternatives considered in the Environmental Assessment include no action, receipt of a greater or lesser number
of spent fuel elements, alternate ports of entry, alternative modes of transport from the receiving port to the Savannah
River Site, and reprocessing abroad and transport of low or highly enriched uranium to the United States. 


No Action:

 Under the No Action Alternative, there would be no environmental impact in the United States. However, United States
nonproliferation policy would be adversely affected. Foreign reactor operators will try to avoid shutting down
their reactors. The operators of two reactors can elect to reprocess their spent fuel at an existing facility in Scotland,
although one of the two would need United States authorization to do so. Reprocessing would allow the uranium to be
extracted for reuse, and thus would increase the threat of nuclear proliferation. Reactor operators in Belgium and
Germany resorted to reprocessing on four occasions in 1993 and 1994. 
Six of the eight research reactors from which DOE proposes to accept spent fuel either do not have the option to reprocess
their spent fuel or could not obtain regulatory authority to reprocess in time to avoid shutdown. Shutdown of these
reactors would severely undermine the United States' credibility as a reliable partner in matters of nuclear cooperation.
This, in turn, could influence other reactor operators to cease their conversion to low enriched fuel or to revert
to the use of highly enriched fuel if they have already converted. In fact, several reactor operators have stated that,
if the United States is unable to accept spent fuel, they will cancel or delay their reactor conversions to low enriched
uranium fuel. Such actions would encourage development of a world market for highly enriched uranium, thereby undermining
a key aspect of the United States nonproliferation program. 
Selection of the No Action Alternative would also adversely affect the upcoming 1995 international conference on
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The conference will consider the indefinite extension of
the Treaty, which the United States strongly supports. Other Treaty parties will want assurance that the United States
has fulfilled its obligations under the Treaty to share the benefits of peaceful nuclear cooperation. If several
countries that are parties to the Treaty are compelled to shut down their research reactors, thereby foregoing the
benefits from these reactors, the United States may be accused, fairly or unfairly, of not sharing the benefits of
peaceful nuclear cooperation. Such an accusation, however ill-founded, could create or increase opposition to
the indefinite extension of the Treaty, which is the foundation for the international nuclear weapons nonproliferation
regime. 


Greater or Lesser Number of Spent Fuel Elements Accepted:

 In addition to the proposed action (shipment of up to 409 spent nuclear fuel elements), the environmental impacts
of shipping alternative numbers of spent fuel elements (i.e., 953, 359, 291, and 248 spent fuel elements) were also
considered in the Environmental Assessment. The risks for the 953-element alternative are slightly more than double
the risks for shipping 409 elements through the proposed ports. Conversely, the risks of shipping 359, 291 and 248
elements are less than the risks for shipping 409 elements. While there are differences in the risks depending upon
the number of elements shipped, the impacts associated with the shipment of any alternative number of elements are
extremely small.

Acceptance of up to 409 spent fuel elements would allow the foreign research reactors to ship full casks, and would
not force the two reactors that can ship spent fuel to Scotland for reprocessing to do so. (Acceptance of 359 spent fuel
elements, i.e., shipment in partially full casks, also would not force these two reactors to reprocess.) In proposing
to accept full casks, DOE took note of the fact that there is no significant difference in the environmental impacts
between shipping full and partially full casks. Further, shipping full casks is the customary shipping procedure,
and more cost-effective. Accordingly, proposing to accept full casks appeared to be a prudent course to encourage
the continued participation of foreign research reactors in the Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors
Program. 


Other Ports of Entry:

 The Environmental Assessment also evaluated the impacts of shipping 409 spent fuel elements through alternate commercial
and military ports using two assumptions: (1) No intermediate port stops and eight casks per vessel; and (2) three
intermediate port stops and one cask per vessel. Dose to handlers and port workers would be essentially the same from
port to port. During ocean transport, dose to the ship's crew would be generally the same regardless of the port of entry.
However, dose to the truck's crew showed some slight variation consistent with the distance of travel, i.e., slightly
higher doses are associated with greater distances traveled. The dose to the ship's crew and the dose to the truck crew
would be well below the 100 millirem limit for nonradiation workers. 
None of the alternate ports appeared as advantageous for the proposed receipt of spent fuel as the five proposed ports
based on the application of screening criteria drawn from the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
1994, and additional criteria recommended by a panel of maritime experts at a DOE-sponsored workshop on port selection
criteria for shipments of spent fuel. While there are comparative advantages and disadvantages among the five proposed
ports, all five of the proposed ports appear comparatively more advantageous than other United States seaports for
the proposed action. 


Other Modes of Overland Transport:

 The spent nuclear fuel could be transported by rail from the port of entry to the Savannah River Site. The incident-free
dose to spent fuel cask handlers would depend on how the casks were handled in port. If two casks are shipped per rail
car, the handler would continue to receive a small dose from the first loaded cask as the second cask is loaded. Dose
would also be influenced by the number of cargo transfers required. For example, if the spent fuel cask cannot be off-loaded
directly from the ship to a rail car, spent fuel cask handlers would receive an additional small dose during the transport
by truck to the rail car and from the transfer of the cask from the truck to the rail car. In addition, rail cargo is inspected
after loading and prior to off-loading. As a result, transport by rail would result in a slightly higher dose to port
handlers/inspectors and rail crew than transport by truck. Dose to the public, however, would be generally lower,
partly because rail stops would normally occur in rail yards (removed from the general population). For example,
rail transport from Sunny Point to the Savannah River Site would result in an annual dose of 0.16 person-rem total to
port handlers/inspectors, other port workers and rail crew, and in a dose of 0.0017 person-rem to members of the public.
Truck transport of the spent fuel from Sunny Point to the Savannah River Site would result in an annual dose of 0.08 person-rem
to port handlers/inspectors, other port workers and truck crew and a dose of 0.067 person-rem to members of the public.
Neither mode of transport would result in a significant health effect. 


Reprocessing Abroad and Transport of Low or Highly Enriched Uranium to the United States:

 The potential environmental impact of transporting low enriched uranium by ship to the United States after reprocessing
the spent fuel abroad was analyzed in detail in two recently issued Environmental Assessments prepared by the United
States Enrichment Corporation. Low enriched uranium was found to be a common commercial product that has been shipped
safely around the world in large quantities by air, water, and land transport modes for over 30 years without significant
impact. Consequently, if the spent nuclear fuel elements were reprocessed in Europe (i.e., at Dounreay, Scotland),
blended down to low enriched uranium, and the low enriched uranium was returned to the United States, no significant
impacts would be expected. 
If the spent fuel were reprocessed in Scotland, but not blended down, then highly enriched uranium could be transported
from Scotland to the United States for blending. The shipment of highly enriched uranium would require extensive
security activities and would involve the use of military assets for protection and safety. The military has had considerable
experience in shipment of highly enriched uranium and has safely transported such materials throughout the world
without significant impact. 
These options, however, would not serve the nonproliferation interests of the United States. As discussed above
and in greater detail in the Environmental Assessment, reprocessing would likely result in reactor operators postponing
conversion from highly enriched uranium fuel, or reverting back to its use if conversion has already been completed.
This is because the only current reprocessor of highly enriched uranium does not reprocess low enriched uranium fuel,
and reactor operators have only limited capacity to store spent fuel generated as a result of operating. Thus, to continue
operating, research reactors would have to continue to use highly enriched uranium fuels. In addition, for those
reactors for which United States consent is not required for reprocessing to occur, there is no mechanism to implement
or to enforce a blending requirement by the reactor operators or reprocessors. Consequently, reactor operators
could elect to have their fuel reprocessed, but not blended. This would result in the continued use of highly enriched
uranium fuel by research reactors, contrary to United States nonproliferation policy.

Enhanced Storage in Europe:

 DOE considered but rejected as unreasonable the alternative of assisting foreign research reactors to expand spent
fuel storage capacity at the reactor sites or at other sites in Europe. By the time new facilities could be constructed
and licensed, or existing facilities modified, the reactors from which DOE proposes to accept spent fuel would have
been forced to send their spent fuel to Scotland for reprocessing, where that is an option, or to shut down. For the reasons
discussed above and in greater detail in the Environmental Assessment, forcing research reactors to shut down or
reprocess would undermine the gains already realized in converting to low enriched uranium fuels under the Reduced
Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors Program. The governments in the countries where these reactors are located
have stated that acceptance of spent fuel has become a measure of the United States' reliability in worldwide nuclear
cooperation. A perceived lack of reliability could complicate upcoming negotiations for renewal of important nonproliferation
agreements. 



Cumulative Impact



In addition to the environmental impacts from the proposed action, the Environmental Assessment also considered
the cumulative dose of transporting other shipments of spent fuel to the Savannah River Site and shipments of low-level
radioactive materials to the Barnwell facility, east of the Savannah River Site. No significant cumulative effects
were identified. 



Determination



Based on the analyses in the Environmental Assessment, and after careful consideration of comments received, DOE
has determined that the acceptance of up to 409 spent nuclear fuel elements from eight foreign research reactors in
Europe for storage at the Savannah River Site does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting
the quality of the human environment, within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act. Therefore, an
Environmental Impact Statement is not required and DOE issues this Finding of No Significant Impact. 

Based on an evaluation of the five proposed ports of entry (Jacksonville, Florida; Savannah, Georgia; the Army Military
Ocean Terminal at Sunny Point, and Wilmington, North Carolina; and Charleston, South Carolina) and alternative
modes of transporting the spent nuclear fuel from the port of entry to the Savannah River Site (truck or train), DOE
has concluded that no significant impact would result from any combination of proposed port and mode of transport
from the port of entry to the Savannah River Site. 

However, upon further consideration, and in an effort to balance the domestic and international interests at stake,
DOE has decided to implement the proposed action as follows. The spent nuclear fuel will be shipped by commercial or
chartered vessel from Europe to the Army's Military Ocean Terminal at Sunny Point, North Carolina to the maximum extent
practicable (rather than allowing the shipper to select from among any one of the five proposed ports as described
in the Environmental Assessment) and transported overland by rail (rather than truck). Should DOE determine that
another port or mode of transport (from among those considered as the proposed action) is necessary, DOE will provide
direct notice of the change to State and local government officials of the affected states and will notify the public
through local media and other means, as appropriate.

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Award of a Grant, Noncompetitive Financial Assistance</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Richland Operations Office.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to make a noncompetitive financial assistance award.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy (DOE), Richland Operations Office (RL) announces that pursuant to Public Law 95-224,
The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977, it intends to make a discretionary financial assistant award
based on the criterion set forth in 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(B) to the Institute for Science and Society, Inc., (ISS),
Ellensburg, Washington, under Grant Number DE-FG06-94RL12929. The primary purpose of the grant is to
help ``K through 12'' teachers improve math and science education classes for their students and to assist in strengthening
math and science education in the public sector. This two year effort will have an estimated cost of $300,000 for the
first budget year.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In support of DOE's Math/Science Education Action Conference Report of May 1990 which emphasized the critical need
for a technologically informed citizenry and the need for American elementary and secondary students to receive
increased preparation in math and science in every grade and that teachers must become empowered to prepare this generation
of children for lives in the 21st Century, various methods are being explored and pursued to accomplish these aims.
Surveys have found that many K-12 teachers have little or no background in science or need to enhance and update
their skills in this field. A science literacy course covering such fields as astronomy, geology, chemistry, math,
physics, origins of life, evolution, global warming, electromagnetic fields, population explosion, ionizing
radiation and the health effects of radiation, has been developed to increase and stimulate a teacher's interest
and understanding of the sciences and the concept of the scientific approach to societal issues involving science
and/or technology. Some simple, inexpensive experiments are offered which can be used by the teachers in the classroom
to demonstrate scientific principles. Experts in various science fields are utilized as lecturers to provide quality
instruction. Teachers who complete the course generally overcome their fears of science and transfer a sense of excitement
in science to their students.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy, Kansas City Support Office announces that, pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules
10 CFR 600.7(b)(2), DOE intends to make a noncompetitive financial assistance award to the Wisconsin Center for Demand-Side
Research, to continue activities initiated through a cooperative agreement between the Center and the DOE that seek

related issues of electric motor systems.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Wisconsin Center for Demand-Side Research is a non-profit organization which sponsors and conducts cooperative
research and technology transfer efforts aimed at cost effective and customer sensitive energy efficiency initiatives.
The Center has worked in partnership with Wisconsin utilities, DOE, national and state based energy research organizations,
and Canadian utilities on a wide range of energy efficient technology and market issues. Through the existing cooperative
agreement the Center and the DOE are working together to develop a Midwest Electric Motor Systems Collaborative Project
which encourages implementation of energy efficient motor-driven systems in a ten state region. This award will

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Rate Adjustment for Eklutna Project </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Alaska Power Administration, Department of Energy.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rate adjustment for Eklutna Project, notice of public forum and opportunity for review and comment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Alaska Power Administration (APA) is proposing to adjust the rates for the Eklutna Project. Rates of 17 mills per kilowatthour
for firm energy, 10 mills per kilowatthour for non-firm energy and .3 mills per kilowatthour for wheeling expire September
30, 1994. APA proposes to raise the rate for firm energy to 18.9 mills per kilowatthour beginning October 1, 1994 for
a period of up to five years. Rates for non-firm energy and wheeling would remain the same. APA will finalize the proposal
giving full consideration to comments received. The final proposal may differ from the present. The proposed rates
will be submitted to the Deputy Secretary of Energy for interim approval and to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
for review and final approval. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The proposed rates apply for power sold from the Eklutna Hydroelectric Project to three electric utilities serving
the Anchorage and Matanuska Valley areas of Alaska. 


Details of the proposed rates, including supporting studies, are available for inspection at Alaska Power Administration,
2770 Sherwood Lane, Suite 2B, Juneau, Alaska; and the Eklutna Project Office, Mile 4.0, Old Glenn Highway, Palmer,
Alaska. 
A public information and comment forum is scheduled to be held June 14, 1994, at 7 p.m., in the public conference room
of the Loussac Library, 3600 Denali, Anchorage, Alaska. APA is requesting that the parties interested in attending
the public information and comment forum notify APA of this intent in writing by June 7, 1994. If APA has not received
any written notices of intent to attend the forum the APA Administrator will cancel the forum, as allowed in 10 CFR 903.15(c)
and 10 CFR 903.16(c). 
Authorities for the proposed rate action are the Eklutna Project Act of July 31, 1950 (64 Stat. 382, as amended) and
the Department of Energy Organization Act (Pub. L. 95-91). Alaska Power Administration is developing these
rates in accordance with DOE financial reporting policies, procedures and methodology (DOE Policy RA 6120.2 [September
20, 1979]), and the procedures for public participation in rate adjustments found in 10 CFR Part 903 (1987) as amended.

The present rates went into effect in October 1990. APA has repaid over 75% of the project investment. Since the last
rate action Operation and Maintenance (O&M) costs have increased. The major contributors to this increase are
the addition of the Government's unfunded liability for the Civil Service Retirement System in the repayment studies,
and an increase in the number of staff dealing with environmental compliance issues. The proposed rate results in
an 11% rate increase. This is below the rate of inflation from 1990 to 1994. 
APA has notified its customers that a rate was being developed. One of the customers has asked that APA look at the increased
O&M costs and to verify the need for the increases. APA is in the process of doing this and will include the results
of this evaluation in the final rate proposal. 
Given the age of the Eklutna Project, APA expects sizeable replacement costs over the next several years. These costs
have been included in the repayment study supporting the proposed rates. 
The Administration continues to advocate divestiture of APA, and a legislative proposal to authorize the divestiture
is under Congressional consideration. This proposed rate action continues present rate policies under existing
law. 


Environmental Impact 


The proposed rate action will have no significant environmental impact within the meaning of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969. The proposed action meets the requirements of a categorical exclusion as defined in 40 CFR 1508.4
and is listed as a categorical exclusion for DOE in 10 CFR 1021, Appendix B4.3. An Environmental Assessment and an Environmental
Impact Statement is not required.

21. Arizona Public Service Company 




[Docket No. ER94-1171-000]





Take notice that on April 20, 1994, Arizona Public Service Company (APS) tendered for filing the Reciprocal Transmission
Service Agreement (Agreement) between APS and PacifiCorp. 



The enclosed Agreement essentially proposed two transmission service arrangements: (1) APS will provide 30 MW of
interim firm transmission service for PacifiCorp over the Cholla/Four Corners System until PacifiCorp's Four Corners/Borah-Brady
System is able to accommodate additional transmission for APS; and (2) at such time as PacifiCorp's Four Corners/Borah-Brady
System has sufficient capacity to accommodate additional transmission for APS, the Agreement then converts to a
classical ``reciprocal'' type arrangement whereby APS and PacifiCorp will each provide 30 MW of firm unidirectional
reciprocal transmission to the other. 





Comment date: 

May 6, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph E at the end of this notice.

<DOCTITLE>Polk Power Partners, L.P.; Application for Commission Recertification of Qualifying Status of a Cogeneration Facility</DOCTITLE>



April 26, 1994.



On April 14, 1994, Polk Power Partners, L.P. (Polk) of 1027 South Rainbow Boulevard, Las Vegas, Nevada 89128, submitted
for filing an application for recertification of a facility as a qualifying cogeneration facility pursuant to Section
292.207(b) of the Commission's Regulations. No determination has been made that the submittal constitutes a complete
filing.

The topping-cycle cogeneration facility will be located in Polk County, Florida. On December 23, 1991, in Docket
No. QF92-54-000, Mulberry Energy Company, Inc. filed a notice of self-certification for a natural gas-fueled
123 MW combined-cycle cogeneration facility. In Docket No. QF92-54-001, Polk was granted certification
with a power production capacity of 118.7 MW. Thermal energy from the facility was to be used by an affiliated host for
the production of liquified carbon dioxide [61 FERC  61,030 (1992), 

order denying rehearing,

 61 FERC  61,300 (1992), 

appeal pending sub nom. Liquid Carbonic Corp.

 v. 

FERC

 (D.C. Cir. Nos. 93-1095 

et al

)]. In Docket No. QF92-54-003, Commission granted certification to reflect change in ownership and use
of thermal output for the product of fuel grade ethanol [65 FERC  62,136 (1993)]. On September 3, 1993, in Docket
No. QF92-54-004, Polk filed a notice of self-certification. In Docket No. QF92-54-005, the
Commission granted a limited waiver of Commission's operating and efficiency standards [66 FERC  61,116 (1994)].
Instant recertification is submitted to reflect change in the maximum net electric power production capacity to
134 MW, change in facility's ownership and possible operational changes in the facility's thermal host.

Any person desiring to be heard or objecting to the granting of qualifying status should file a motion to intervene
or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in
accordance with rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such motions or protests
must be filed within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register and must be served on
the applicant. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken but
will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a petition
to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

<DOCTITLE>Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products: Granting of the Application for Interim Waiver and Publishing
of the Petition for Waiver of DOE Furnace Test Procedures From Armstrong Air Conditioning Inc. (Case No. F-070)</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Department of Energy.




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Today's notice publishes a letter granting an Interim Waiver to Armstrong Air Conditioning Inc. (Armstrong) from
the existing Department of Energy (DOE) test procedure regarding blower time delay for the company's GUK and GCK condensing
gas furnaces, and GUJ, GCJ, and GHJ non-condensing gas furnaces.



Today's notice also publishes a ``Petition for Waiver'' from Armstrong. Armstrong's Petition for Waiver requests
DOE to grant relief from the DOE furnace test procedure relating to the blower time delay specification. Armstrong
seeks to test using a blower delay time of 30 seconds for its GUK and GCK condensing gas furnaces and GUJ, GCJ, and GHJ
non-condensing gas furnaces instead of the specified 1.5-minute delay between burner on-time and blower on-time.
The Department is soliciting comments, data, and information respecting the Petition for Waiver.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Public Law 94-163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy
Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Public Law 95-619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation
Act of 1987 (NAECA), Public Law 100-12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA
1988), Public Law 100-357, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), Public Law 102-486, 106 Stat. 2776,
which requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer
products, including furnaces. The intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption
that will assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR part 430, subpart
B.



The Department amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 on September 26, 1980, creating the
waiver process. 45 FR 64108. Thereafter, DOE further amended the appliance test procedure waiver process to allow
the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver
from test procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures.
51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986.

The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to waive temporarily, test procedures for a particular basic model
when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing according
to the prescribed test procedures, or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner
so unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers
generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective, resolving the problem that is
the subject of the waiver.

The Interim Waiver provisions added by the 1986 amendment allow the Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver when it is
determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver is denied,
if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines that
it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition
for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the
Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary.
On March 11, 1994, and the addendum of April 6, 1994, Armstrong filed an Application for Interim Waiver regarding blower
time delay. Armstrong's Application seeks an Interim Waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute
time delay between the ignition of the burner and starting of the circulating air blower. Instead, Armstrong requests
the allowance to test using a 30-second blower time delay when testing its GUK and GCK condensing gas furnaces and GUJ,
GCJ, and GHJ non-condensing gas furnaces. Armstrong states that the 30-second delay is indicative of how these furnaces
actually operate. Such a delay results in an increase in AFUE of 1.2 percentage points for GUK and GCK condensing gas
furnaces, and 0.8 percentage point for GUJ, GCJ, and GHJ non-condensing gas furnaces. Since current DOE test procedures
do not address this variable blower time delay, Armstrong asks that the Interim Waiver be granted.
The Department has published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on August 23, 1993, (58 FR 44583) to amend the furnace
test procedure, which addresses the above issue.
Previous waivers for this type of time blower delay control have been granted by DOE to Coleman Company, 50 FR 2710,
January 18, 1985; Magic Chef Company, 50 FR 41553, October 11, 1985; Rheem Manufacturing Company, 
53 FR 48574, December 1, 1988, 56 FR 2920, January 25, 1991, 57 FR 10166, March 24, 1992, and 57 FR 34560, August 5, 1992;
Trane Company, 54 FR 19226, May 4, 1989, 56 FR 6021, February 14, 1991, 57 FR 10167, March 24, 1992, 57 FR 22222, May 27,

56 FR 27958, June 18, 1991, 56 FR 63940, December 6, 1991, 57 FR 23392, June 3, 1992, and 58 FR 68130, December 23, 1993;
Snyder General Corporation, 56 FR 54960, September 9, 1991; Goodman Manufacturing Corporation, 56 FR 51713, October
15, 1991, 57 FR 27970, June 23, 1992 and 59 FR 12586, March 17, 1994; The Ducane Company Inc., 56 FR 63943, December 6,
1991, 57 FR 10163, March 24, 1992, and 58 FR 68134, December 23, 1993; Armstrong Air Conditioning, Inc., 57 FR 899, January
9, 1992, 57 FR 10160, March 24, 1992, 57 FR 10161, March 24, 1992, 57 FR 39193, August 28, 1992, and 57 FR 54230, November
17, 1992; Thermo Products, Inc., 57 FR 903, January 9, 1992; Consolidated Industries Corporation, 57 FR 22220, May
27, 1992; Evcon Industries, Inc., 57 FR 47847, October 20, 1992; and Bard Manufacturing Company, 57 FR 53733, November
12, 1992. Thus, it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted for blower time delay.
In those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated based upon DOE having
granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested and rated
for energy consumption on a comparable basis.
Therefore, based on the above, DOE is granting Armstrong an Interim Waiver for its GUK and GCK condensing gas furnaces
and GUJ, GCJ, and GHJ non-condensing gas furnaces. Pursuant to paragraph (e) of  430.27 of the Code of Federal
Regulations part 430, the following letter granting the Application for Interim Waiver to Armstrong was issued.
Pursuant to paragraph (b) of 10 CFR 430.27, DOE is hereby publishing the ``Petition for Waiver'' in its entirety. The
petition contains no confidential information. The Department solicits comments, data, and information respecting
the petition.

March 24, 1992, 57 FR 10161, March 24, 1992, 57 FR 39193, August 28, 1992, and 57 FR 54230, November 17, 1992; Thermo Products,
Inc., 57 FR 903, January 9, 1992; Consolidated Industries Corporation, 57 FR 22220, May 27, 1992; Evcon Industries,
Inc., 57 FR 47847, October 20, 1992; and Bard Manufacturing Company, 57 FR 53733, November 12, 1992. Thus, it appears
likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted for blower time delay.
Armstrong's Application for Interim Waiver does not provide sufficient information to evaluate what, if any, economic
impact or competitive disadvantage Armstrong will likely experience absent a favorable determination on its application.
However, in those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated, based upon
DOE having granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested
and rated for energy consumption on a comparable basis.
Therefore, Armstrong's Application for an Interim Waiver from the DOE test procedure for its GUK and GCK condensing
gas furnaces, and GUJ, GCJ, and GHJ non-condensing gas furnaces regarding blower time delay is granted.
Armstrong shall be permitted to test its GUK and GCK condensing gas furnaces, and GUJ, GCJ, and GHJ non-condensing
gas furnaces on the basis of the test procedures specified in 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B, Appendix N, with the modification
set forth below:
(i) Section 3.0 in Appendix N is deleted and replaced with the following paragraph:
3.0 Test Procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified in Section 9 in ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82
with the exception of Sections 9.2.2, 9.3.1, and 9.3.2, and the inclusion of the following additional procedures:
(ii) Add a new paragraph 3.10 in Appendix N as follows:
3.10 Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the cool-down
test and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature, using the
thermocouple grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner start-up,
delay the blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t^) unless: (1) The furnace employs a single motor to drive the power burner
and the indoor air circulation blower, in which case the burner and blower shall be started together; or (2) the furnace
is designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case the fan control shall
be permitted to start the blower; or (3) the delay time results in the activation of a temperature safety device which
shuts off the burner, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the latter case, if the
fan control is adjustable, set it to start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control is permitted to
start the blower, measure time delay (t^) using a stop watch. Record the measured temperatures. During the heat-up
test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain the draft in the flue pipe within 

#

0.01 inch of water column of the manufacturer's recommended on-period draft.
This Interim Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements and all allegations submitted by the company.
This Interim Waiver may be removed or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying the
application is incorrect.
The Interim Waiver shall remain in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE acts on the Petition for Waiver, whichever
is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180-day period, if necessary.

Subject: Petition for Wavier and Application of Interim Waiver.




Gentlemen: This is a Petition for Waiver and application of Interim Waiver submitted pursuant to Title 10 CFR 430.28.
Waiver is requested from the test procedure for measuring Furnace Energy Consumption as found in appendix H to subpart
B of part 430.

The current test requires a 1.5 minute delay between burner ignition and the start of the circulating air blower. Armstrong
Air Conditioning Inc. is requesting waiver and authorization to use a timed on delay instead of the specified 1.5 minutes
for blower start-up after main burner ignition. Armstrong intends to use a fixed timing control on our GUK and GCK condensing
gas furnaces and on our GUJ, GCJ, and GHJ non-condensing gas furnaces to gain additional energy savings that are achieved
with the use of shorter blower on times.

Test data for these furnaces with a timed on delay indicates an increase in AFUE. The use of a timed on delay reduces flue
losses thus increasing furnace efficiency. Copies of confidential test data confirming these energy savings will
be forwarded to you upon request.

The current test procedure does not give Armstrong credit for the energy savings that can be obtained using fixed timing.
ASHRAE 103-1993 test procedure that is under consideration by D.O.E. addresses the use of timed blower operation.
Section 9.6.1 of ASHRAE 103-1993 requires testing of a furnace with this type of control to be set to its maximum
setting. Armstrong's intent would be to request testing at this maximum setting. Granting of this Waiver permits
testing of similar competitive products to be rated on a comparable basis to that of Armstrong.

Armstrong is confident that this Waiver will be granted, and therefore requests an Interim Waiver be granted until
a final ruling is made. Armstrong, as well as other manufacturers of domestic furnaces, have been granted similar
waivers. 

Manufacturers that domestically market similar products have been sent a copy of this Petition for Waiver and Application
for Interim Waiver.




   Sincerely,




Armstrong Air Conditioning Inc.

Attention: Mr. Cyrus Nasseri.




Subject: March 11, 1994 Petition for Waiver Addendum.




Sir: Inadvertently in our Petition for Waiver and application for Interim Waiver, the delay on timing and the additional
increase in AFUE was left out. Our intent is to use a 30 second delay between burner ignition and the start of the circulating
air blower. An increase of 1.2 percentage points in AFUE can be achieved on the GUK and GCK condensing furnaces and an
increase of .8 percentage points on the GUJ, GCJ, and GHJ furnaces.

Please consider this information upon reviewing the Petition for Waiver and application for Interim Waiver. Should
you require any additional information, please feel free to contact me.

<DOCTITLE>Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products: Granting of the Application for Interim Waiver and Publishing
of the Petition for Waiver of DOE Furnace Test Procedures From DMO Industries </DOCTITLE>

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, DOE. 

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Today's notice publishes a letter granting an Interim Waiver to DMO Industries (DMO) from the existing Department
of Energy (DOE) test procedure regarding blower time delay for the company's HDS series gas furnaces. 



Today's notice also publishes a ``Petition for Waiver'' from DMO. DMO's Petition for Waiver requests DOE to grant
relief from the DOE furnace test procedure relating to the blower time delay specification. DMO seeks to test using
a blower delay time of 30 seconds for its HDS series gas furnaces instead of the specified 1.5-minute delay between
burner on-time and blower on-time. The Department is soliciting comments, data, and information respecting the
Petition for Waiver. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Public Law 94-163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy
Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Public Law 95-619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation
Act of 1987 (NAECA), Public Law 100-12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA
1988), Public Law 100-357, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), Public Law 102-486, 106 Stat. 2776,
which requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer
products, including furnaces. The intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption
that will assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR part 430, subpart
B. 



The Department amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 on September 26, 1980, creating the
waiver process. 45 FR 64108. Thereafter, DOE further amended the appliance test procedure waiver process to allow
the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver
from test procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures.
51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986. 

The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to waive temporarily, test procedures for a particular basic model
when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing according
to the prescribed test procedures, or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner
so unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers
generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective, resolving the problem that is
the subject of the waiver. 

The Interim Waiver provisions added by the 1986 amendment allow the Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver when it is
determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver is denied,
if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines that
it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition
for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the
Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary. 

On March 4, 1994, DMO filed an Application for Interim Waiver regarding blower time delay. DMO's Application seeks
an Interim Waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute time delay between the ignition of the burner
and starting of the circulating air blower. Instead, DMO requests the allowance to test using a 30-second blower time
delay when testing its HDS series gas furnaces. DMO states that the 30-second delay is indicative of how these furnaces
actually operate. Such a delay results in an increase in AFUE of 2.0 percentage points. Since current DOE test procedures
do not address this variable blower time delay, DMO asks that the Interim Waiver be granted. 

The Department has published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on 
August 23, 1993, (58 FR 44583) to amend the furnace test procedure, which addresses the above issue. 

Previous waivers for this type of time blower delay control have been granted by DOE to Coleman Company, 50 FR 2710,
January 18, 1985; Magic Chef Company, 50 FR 41553, October 11, 1985; Rheem Manufacturing Company, 
53 FR 48574, December 1, 1988, 56 FR 2920, January 25, 1991, 57 FR 10166, 
March 24, 1992, and 57 FR 34560, August 5, 1992; Trane Company, 54 FR 19226, May 4, 1989, 56 FR 6021, February 14, 1991,

Manufacturing Company, 57 FR 53733, 
November 12, 1992. Thus, it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted for blower time delay.

In those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated based upon DOE having
granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested and rated
for energy consumption on a comparable basis. 

Therefore, based on the above, DOE is granting DMO an Interim Waiver for its HDS series gas furnaces. Pursuant to paragraph
(e) of  430.27 of the Code of Federal Regulations part 430, the following letter granting the Application for
Interim Waiver to DMO was issued. 

Pursuant to paragraph (b) of 10 CFR Part 430.27, DOE is hereby publishing the ``Petition for Waiver'' in its entirety.
The petition contains no confidential information. The Department solicits comments, data, and information respecting
the petition.

Dear Mr. Hwang: This is in response to your March 4, 1994, Application for Interim Waiver and Petition for Waiver from
the Department of Energy (DOE) test procedure regarding blower time delay for DMO Industries (DMO) HDS series gas
furnaces. 

Previous waivers for this type of timed blower delay control have been granted by DOE to Coleman Company, 50 FR 2710,

Manufacturing Company, 57 FR 53733, 
November 12, 1992. Thus, it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted for blower time delay. 

DMO's Application for Interim Waiver does not provide sufficient information to evaluate what, if any, economic
impact or competitive disadvantage DMO will likely experience absent a favorable determination on its application.

However, in those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated, based upon
DOE having granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested
and rated for energy consumption on a comparable basis. 

Therefore, DMO's Application for an Interim Waiver from the DOE test procedure for its HDS series gas furnaces regarding
blower time delay is granted. 

DMO shall be permitted to test its HDS series gas furnaces on the basis of the test procedures specified in 10 CFR Part
430, Subpart B, Appendix N, with the modification set forth below: 

(i) Section 3.0 in Appendix N is deleted and replaced with the following paragraph: 

3.0 Test Procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified in Section 9 in ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82
with the exception of Sections 9.2.2, 9.3.1, and 9.3.2, and the inclusion of the following additional procedures:


(ii) Add a new paragraph 3.10 in Appendix N as follows: 

3.10 Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the cool-down
test and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature, using the
thermocouple grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner start-up,
delay the blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t-) unless: 

(1) The furnace employs a single motor to drive the power burner and the indoor air circulation blower, in which case
the burner and blower shall be started together; or 

(2) The furnace is designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case the
fan control shall be permitted to start the blower; or 

(3) The delay time results in the activation of a temperature safety device which shuts off the burner, in which case
the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the latter case, if the fan control is adjustable, set it to
start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control is permitted to start the blower, measure time delay
(t-) using a stop watch. Record the measured temperatures. During the heat-up test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain
the draft in the flue pipe within 0.01 inch of water column of the manufacturer's recommended on-period draft. 

This Interim Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements and all allegations submitted by the company.
This Interim Waiver may be removed or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying the
application is incorrect. 

The Interim Waiver shall remain in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE acts on the Petition for Waiver, whichever
is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180-day period, if necessary.

Subject: Petitions for Waiver and Interim Waiver.



Dear Secretary: Please consider this letter as a Petition for Waiver and Application for Interim Waiver, submitted
pursuant to Title 10 CFR 430.27. DMO Industries is requesting a waiver from the furnace test procedure which requires
a 90 second delay between burner ignition and blower start-up.
DMO requests authorization to reduce the 90 second delay to 30 seconds when testing our HDS series, high efficiency,
residential gas furnaces. The HDS series includes the following models as listed in the GAMA (Gas Appliance Manufacturers
Association) certification program:



HDS 40MS 
HDS 50MS (60/50MS)
HDS 60MS 
HDS 60M (70/60M)
HDS 70M 
HDS 80M (90/80M)
HDS 90M 
HDS 90MF (100/90M)
HDS 100M 
HDS 110M (120/110M)
HDS 120M 




DMO is currently switching all controls on this series to a 30 second blower-on delay by a timed controller, which cannot
be adjusted by the installer, or service person.

Our tests indicate that by using the 30 second delay, AFUE values increase by up to 2.0 points, depending on the model.
We feel that this is a substantial benefit to our customers and would like to reflect this through the higher AFUE values.
Confidential Test data is available upon request which confirms the above claim.

We are confident that both an Interim Waiver and final Waiver will be granted us on the basis that many similar petitions
have already been granted on our competitors.

A copy of this petition for Waiver and Application for Interim Waiver is being sent to manufacturers who market similar
equipment.

SUMMARY:

 Today's notice publishes a letter granting an Interim Waiver to Rheem Manufacturing Company (Rheem) from the existing
Department of Energy (DOE) test procedure regarding blower time delay for the company's GDG upflow, GLH downflow,
GVH horizontal, and GPH upflow/horizontal gas furnaces.


Today's notice also publishes a ``Petition for Waiver'' from Rheem. Rheem's Petition for Waiver requests DOE to grant
relief from the DOE furnace test procedure relating to the blower time delay specification. Rheem seeks to test using
a blower delay time of 20 seconds for its GDG upflow, GLH downflow, GVH horizontal, and GPH upflow/horizontal gas furnaces

The Interim Waiver provisions added by the 1986 amendment allow the Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver when it is
determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver is denied,
if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines that
it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition
for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the
Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary.
On March 23, 1994, Rheem filed an Application for Interim Waiver regarding blower time delay. Rheem's Application
seeks an Interim Waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute time delay between the ignition of the
burner and starting of the circulating air blower. Instead, Rheem requests the allowance to test using a 20-second
blower time delay when testing its GDG upflow, GLH downflow, GVH horizontal, and GPH upflow/horizontal gas furnaces.
Rheem states that the 20-second delay is indicative of how these furnaces actually operate. Such a delay results in
an average increase in AFUE of 2.0 percentage points. Since current DOE test procedures do not address this variable
blower time delay, Rheem asks that the Interim Waiver be granted.
The Department has published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on

likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted for blower time delay.
In those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated based upon DOE having
granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested and rated
for energy consumption on a comparable basis.
Therefore, based on the above, DOE is granting Rheem an Interim Waiver for its GDG upflow, GLH downflow, GVH horizontal,
and GPH upflow/horizontal gas furnaces. Pursuant to paragraph (e) of  430.27 of the Code of Federal Regulations
part 430, the following letter granting the Application for Interim Waiver to Rheem was issued.
Pursuant to paragraph (b) of 10 CFR 430.27, DOE is hereby publishing the ``Petition for Waiver'' in its entirety. The
petition contains no confidential information. The Department solicits comments, data, and information respecting
the petition.

Mr. Daniel J. Canclini, 


Vice-President, 
Product Development and, 
Research Engineering, 
Rheem Manufacturing Company, 
P.O. Box 17010, 
Fort Smith, AR 72917-7010.

 

Dear Mr. Canclini: This is in response to your March 23, 1994, Application for Interim Waiver and Petition for Waiver
from the Department of Energy (DOE) test procedure regarding blower time delay for Rheem Manufacturing Company (Rheem)
GDG upflow, GLH downflow, GVH horizontal, and GPH upflow/horizontal gas furnaces. 
Previous waivers for this type of timed blower delay control have been granted by DOE to Coleman Company, 50 FR 2710,
January 18, 1985; Magic Chef Company, 50 FR 41553, October 11, 1985; Rheem Manufacturing Company, 53 FR 48574, December

19226, May 4, 1989, 56 FR 6021, February 14, 1991, 57 FR 10167, March 24, 1992, 
57 FR 22222, May 27, 1992, and 58 FR 68138, December 23, 1993; Lennox Industries, 55 FR 50224, December 5, 1990, 57 FR

December 23, 1993, 58 FR 68133, December 23, 1993 and 59 FR 14394, 
March 28, 1994; Amana Refrigeration Inc., 56 FR 27958, June 18, 1991, 
56 FR 63940, December 6, 1991, 57 FR 23392, June 3, 1992, and 58 FR 68130, December 23, 1993; Snyder General Corporation,

23, 1992 and 59 FR 12586, March 17, 1994; The Ducane Company Inc., 
56 FR 63943, December 6, 1991, 57 FR 10163, March 24, 1992, and 58 FR 68134, December 23, 1993; Armstrong Air Conditioning,
Inc., 57 FR 899, 
January 9, 1992, 57 FR 10160, March 24, 1992, 57 FR 10161, March 24, 1992, 
57 FR 39193, August 28, 1992, and 57 FR 54230, November 17, 1992; Thermo Products, Inc., 57 FR 903, January 9, 1992; Consolidated
Industries Corporation, 57 FR 22220, May 27, 1992; Evcon Industries, Inc., 57 FR 47847, October 20, 1992; and Bard
Manufacturing Company, 57 FR 53733, 
November 12, 1992. Thus, it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted for blower time delay. 
Rheem's Application for Interim Waiver does not provide sufficient information to evaluate what, if any, economic
impact or competitive disadvantage Rheem will likely experience absent a favorable determination on its application.

However, in those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated, based upon
DOE having granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested
and rated for energy consumption on a comparable basis. 
Therefore, Rheem's Application for an Interim Waiver from the DOE test procedure for its GDG upflow, GLH downflow,
GVH horizontal, and GPH upflow/horizontal gas furnaces regarding blower time delay is granted. 
Rheem shall be permitted to test its GDG upflow, GLH downflow, GVH horizontal, and GPH upflow/horizontal gas furnaces
on the basis of the test procedures specified in 10 CFR part 430, subpart B, Appendix N, with the modification set forth
below: 
(i) Section 3.0 in Appendix N is deleted and replaced with the following paragraph: 
3.0 Test Procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified in Section 9 in ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82
with the exception of Sections 9.2.2, 9.3.1, and 9.3.2, and the inclusion of the following additional procedures:

(ii) Add a new paragraph 3.10 in Appendix N as follows: 
3.10 Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the cool-down
test and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature, using the
thermocouple grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner start-up,
delay the blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t-) unless: 
(1) The furnace employs a single motor to drive the power burner and the indoor air circulation blower, in which case
the burner and blower shall be started together; or 
(2) The furnace is designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case the
fan control shall be permitted to start the blower; or 
(3) The delay time results in the activation of a temperature safety device which shuts off the burner, in which case
the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the latter case, if the fan control is adjustable, set it to
start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control is permitted to start the blower, measure time delay
(t-) using a stop watch. Record the measured temperatures. During the heat-up test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain
the draft in the flue pipe within 

#

0.01 inch of water column of the manufacturer's recommended on-period draft. 

This Interim Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements and all allegations submitted by the company.
This Interim Waiver may be removed or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying the
application is incorrect. 
The Interim Waiver shall remain in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE acts on the Petition for Waiver, whichever
is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180-day period, if necessary.

Mr. Cyrus Nasseri,


Assistant Secretary, Conservation, and Renewable Energy, United States Department of Energy, 1000 Independence
Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585.



Dear Mr. Nasseri: This is a petition for waiver and application for interim waiver submitted pursuant to title 10 CFR
430.27. Waiver is requested from the furnace test procedure as prescribed in appendix N to Subpart B of Part 430. The
test procedure requires a 1.5 minute delay between burner and blower start-up. Rheem is requesting authorization
to use a 20 second delay instead of 1.5 minutes for our series (^)GDG upflow, (^)GLH downflow, (^)GVH horizontal, and
(^)GPH upflow/horizontal residential gas-fired furnaces.
Rheem will be manufacturing these appliances with an electronic device that controls the blower operation on a timing
sequence as opposed to temperature.
Improved energy efficiency is achieved by reducing on cycle losses. Under the Appendix N procedures, the stack temperature
is allowed to climb at a faster rate than it would with a 20 second blower on time, allowing energy to be lost out of the
vent system. This waste of energy would not occur in actual operation. If this petition is granted, the true blower
on time delay would be used in the calculations.
The current test procedures do not give Rheem credit for the energy savings which averages approximately 2%. This
improvement is an average reduction of 20% of the normal on cycle energy losses. Rheem is of the opinion that a 20% reduction
is a worthwhile energy savings.
Rheem has been granted previous waivers regarding blower on time to be used in the efficiency calculations for our
(^)GEB and (^)GKA series condensing furnaces and/or (^)GDE, (^)GLE, (^)GDG, (^)GLG and (^)GVG series furnaces.
Several other manufacturers of gas furnaces have also been granted a waiver to permit calculations based on timed
blower operation. Also, ASHRAE Standard 103-1993, paragraph 9.5.1.2.2 specifically addresses the use of
timed blower operation.
Confidential and comparative test data is available to you upon your request, confirming the above energy savings.
Manufacturers that domestically market similar products are being sent a copy of this petition for waiver and petition
for interim waiver.



   Sincerely,


<SIGNER>

Disability Process Reengineering Proposal: Notice of Public Meeting 



Agency: 

Social Security Administration, HHS.

 


Action: 

Notice of public meeting. 


 


Summary: 

Notice is hereby given that the Disability Process Reengineering Team of the Social Security Administration (SSA)
will hold a public meeting to discuss the proposal to redesign the disability claims process that was issued on March
31, 1994 and published as a notice in the 

Federal Register

 on April 15, 1994. This proposal was developed by the Disability Process Reengineering Team_comprised of SSA and
State Disability Determination Services (DDS) employees_and is intended to achieve dramatic improvements in customer
service to the public. This public meeting is being held in conjunction with a national dialogue period to obtain the
views, concerns, and ideas of all interested parties before the Team makes a final recommendation to the Commissioner
of Social Security on what changes should be made to the disability claims process. The national dialogue period will
end on May 27, 1994. 




Dates: 

May 16, 1994, 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. 




Addresses: 

VOA Auditorium, Department of Health and Human Services, Cohen Building, 330 Independence Avenue, Washington,
D.C. 20201. 




For Further Information Contact: 

Disability Process Reengineering Team, Room 4-N-3, Operations Building, 6401 Security Boulevard,
Baltimore, MD 21235, (410)966-8255. 




Supplementary Information: 

The aim of the proposal to redesign the disability claims process is to achieve dramatically improved levels of service
to the public. For purposes of this initiative, the process considered begins with the initial contact of the claimant
when an intent to file an application for disability benefits is expressed, and continues through the payment of benefits
or the final administrative appeal. 



The proposed redesigned process is characterized by opportunities for claimants to participate fully throughout
the process, enabled by information about the process and personal contact with a single employee during the initial
claims process. The appeals process is streamlined, with more efficient management of pre-hearing development
and an opportunity for claimants to receive favorable decisions without a hearing if the evidence so warrants, or
faster decisions if a hearing is held. The decision methodology used at all levels would be simplified and streamlined
to be more understandable by lay persons and medical persons alike, and there is an emphasis on individualized functional
assessment. Employees work in an atmosphere characterized by teamwork, contributions by claimants and interested
third parties, adequate training and quality feedback, and technological supports. 

The Team's proposal intends to make the process more efficient and customer friendly for all claimants for Social
Security or Supplemental Security Income disability benefits; to give claimants the right decision at the earliest
point possible in the process. It is the Team's intention that claims for benefits which are correctly paid today will
continue to be paid, but in a more expedited manner. The Team's proposal is not intended to affect the benefits of current
disability beneficiaries, to reduce the percentage of cases that are allowed under the current process, or to make
it more difficult for an individual to be found disabled. 

The Disability Process Reengineering Team is interested in receiving public comments on the concepts in the proposal,
particularly the public's response to the following questions about the proposal's goals: 

 Does the proposal have the potential to provide a process that is easy for claimants and those who assist claimants
to access and understand? 

 Will it enable SSA and the State DDS to make the right decision the first time a case is adjudicated? 

 Will it result in dramatically improved processing times? 

 Will it result in a more efficient use of SSA and State DDS personnel? 

 Will it create jobs for employees in the process that are satisfying? 

In considering these questions, interested parties are encouraged to identify factors that would assure that the
proposed concepts will achieve these goals. To the extent that the proposal is not seen as achieving these goals, alternative
suggestions about how to do so are of particular interest to the Team. 

The Commissioner of Social Security or her designee will preside over the public meeting and chair a panel including
members of the Disability Process Reengineering Team. The meeting will be open to the public to the extent that space
is available. Individuals who would like to present comments to the panel should contact the Project Team at 410-966-8255
by COB 
May 11, 1994 to sign up for a specific time for their presentations. Times for presentations will be scheduled on a first-come,
first-served basis. Time allowing, each presenter will be given 5 minutes to make a presentation to the panel. Participants
in this meeting are asked to submit 1 written copy of their full presentation on the day of the public meeting and be prepared
to give an abbreviated statement at the public meeting. 

While we will try to provide all interested parties with an opportunity to present comments to the panel, individuals
who do not pre-register to make a presentation may not be able to be accommodated within the three hours reserved for
the meeting. In such cases, written statements may be submitted on the day of the public meeting. A sign language interpreter
will be available; the room is accessible for wheelchairs. 

Written comments on the proposed disability claims process published in the April 15, 1994 

Federal Register

 should be directed to: SSA_Disability Process Reengineering Project, P.O. Box 17052, Baltimore, MD 21235. Written
comments can also be telefaxed to 410-966-9884. Comments should be sent by May 27, 1994 to ensure that they
will be considered. 

The transcript of the meeting will be available at cost. Transcripts may be ordered from the Project Team. The transcript
will become part of the record of this meeting.

 The Department of Health and Human Services notifies Federal agencies of the laboratories currently certified to

If any laboratory has withdrawn from the National Laboratory Certification Program during the past month, it will
be identified as such at the end of the current list of certified laboratories, and will be omitted from the monthly
listing thereafter.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing were developed in accordance with Executive Order 12564
and section 503 of Public Law 100-71. Subpart C of the Guidelines, ``Certification of Laboratories Engaged
in Urine Drug Testing for Federal Agencies,'' sets strict standards which laboratories must meet in order to conduct
urine drug testing for Federal agencies. To become certified an applicant laboratory must undergo three rounds of
performance testing plus an on-site inspection. To maintain that certification a laboratory must participate in
an every-other-month performance testing program plus periodic, on-site inspections. 


Laboratories which claim to be in the applicant stage of certification are 

not 

to be considered as meeting the minimum requirements expressed in the HHS Guidelines. A laboratory must have its letter
of certification from SAMHSA, HHS (formerly: HHS/NIDA) which attests that it has met minimum standards. 
In accordance with Subpart C of the Guidelines, the following laboratories meet the minimum standards set forth in
the Guidelines:

Notice of Proposed Reinstatement of Terminated Oil and Gas Lease



Pursuant to the provisions of 30 U.S.C. 188(d) and (e), and 43 CFR 3108.2-3(a) and (b)(1), a petition for reinstatement
of oil and gas lease WYW106365 for lands in Sweetwater County, Wyoming, was timely filed and was accompanied by all
the required rentals accruing from the date of termination. The lessee has agreed to the amended lease terms for rentals
and royalties at rates of $10.00 per acre, or fraction thereof, per year and 16 2/3 percent, respectively.

The lessee has paid the required $500 administrative fee and $125 to reimburse the Department for the cost of this 

Federal Register

 notice. The lessee has met all the requirements for reinstatement of the lease as set out in Section 31 (d) and (e) of
the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 (30 U.S.C. 188), and the Bureau of Land Management is proposing to reinstate lease
WYW106365 effective November 1, 1993, subject to the original terms and conditions of the lease and the increased
rental and royalty rates cited above.

Bureau of Land Management, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Realty Action_IDI-29516; Exchange of public and private lands in Ada and Owyhee Counties, Idaho.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The following described public lands have been determined to be suitable for disposal by exchange under sec. 206 of
the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of October 21, 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1716):



Boise Meridian, Idaho



T. 1 N., R. 2 E.


Sec. 5: SE1/4NW1/4


T. 2 N., R. 2 E.


Sec. 7: Lot 4, SE1/4SW1/4
Sec. 8: SE1/4SW1/4
Sec. 14: NW1/4NW1/4
Sec. 17: SW1/4NW1/4, NE1/4SW1/4
Sec. 18: S1/2NE1/4, SE1/4NW1/4.




Aggregating 403.40 acres, more or less, in Ada County.



In exchange for the above described public lands, BLM will acquire the following described private lands from Thomas
Nicholson and Ronald Yanke:


Boise Meridian, Idaho


T. 4 N., R. 2 E.


Portions of Sections 34 and 35.



Containing 13.02 acres, more or less, in Ada County.



T. 8 S., R. 6 E.


Sec. 36: All.



Containing 640 acres, more or less, in Owyhee County.



The purpose of this exchange is to dispose of public lands that have no legal access, limited resource values, are difficult
and uneconomic to manage, and would better be managed in private ownership, in exchange for private lands that contain
important wildlife, riparian, and recreation values in Hulls Gulch and along the Bruneau River Canyon. The public
interest will be well served by the completion of this exchange, as the consummation thereof will fulfill the Secretary's
Fish and Wildlife 2000, Recreation 2000, and riparian management initiatives.
The values of the lands to be exchanged are approximately equal. Full equalization of values will be accomplished
prior to closing through either acreage adjustment or cash payment in an amount not to exceed 25 percent of the value
of the lands to be transferred out of Federal ownership.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register 

segregates the public lands from operation of the public land laws and mining laws, but not the mineral leasing laws.
The segregative effect will end upon issuance of patent or two (2) years from the date of publication, whichever occurs
first.



Lands to be transferred from the United States will be subject to valid existing rights and the following reservations,
terms, and conditions:



Excepting and Reserving to the United States




1. A right-of-way thereon for ditches or canals constructed by the authority of the United States, Act of August 30,
1890 (43 U.S.C. 945).



Subject To:



2. Those rights for power transmission purposes granted to Idaho Power Company, its successors or assigns, by Rights-of-Way
No. IDI-017143 and IDI-9195, pursuant to the Act of March 4, 1911 (43 U.S.C. 961).

3. Those rights for buried telephone line purposes granted to AT&T, its successors or assigns, by Right-of-Way
No. IDI-26291, pursuant to the Act of October 21, 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1761).

4. Those rights for railroad purposes granted to Union Pacific Railroad, its successors or assigns, by Right-of-Way
No. IDB-026801, pursuant to the Act of March 3, 1875 (43 U.S.C. 934-939).

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is planning to enter a cooperative research and development agreement
with several major oil companies. The purpose of the CRADA is to conduct geological field studies on Devonian and Carboniferous
carbonate reefs and carbonate platforms in Kazakhstan that will lead to the development of predictive petroleum-focused
models that can serve as useful analogs for interpreting the subsurface nature of facies belts, stratigraphic cyclicity,
and distribution of potential reservoir, seal, and source-rock facies in the North Caspian basin and in other carbonate
basins of the former Soviet Union.



Any other oil companies or organizations interested in pursuing the possibility of a CRADA for similar kinds of activities
should contact the USGS.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice is to meet the USGS requirement stipulated in the Survey Manual.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Call for information and nominations, and notice of intent (Call/NOI) to prepare an environmental impact statement
(EIS) 





1. 

Authority.

 This Call is published pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act as amended (43 U.S.C. 1331-1356,
(1988))(OCSLA), and the regulations issued thereunder (30 CFR part 256). 
The NOI is published pursuant to the regulations (40 CFR 1501.7) implementing the provisions of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

 (1988))(NEPA). 
2. 

Purpose of Call.

 The purpose of the Call is to gather information for OCS Lease Sale 157 in the Central Gulf of Mexico Planning Area, tentatively
scheduled for March 1995, and OCS Lease Sale 161 in the Western Gulf of Mexico Planning Area, tentatively scheduled
for August 1995. 
Information and nominations on gas and oil leasing, exploration, and development and production within the Central
and Western Gulf of Mexico Planning Areas are sought from all interested parties. This early planning and consultation
step is important for ensuring that all interests and concerns are communicated to the Department of the Interior
for future decisions in the leasing process pursuant to the OCSLA, and regulations at 30 CFR part 256. This Call does
not indicate a preliminary decision to lease in the area described below. Final delineation of the area for possible
leasing will be made at a later date and in compliance with applicable laws including all requirements of the NEPA,
and the OCSLA. Established departmental procedures will be employed. 
3. 

Description of Area.

 The general area of this Call covers the entire central and western portions of the Gulf of Mexico between approximately
88 degrees W. longitude on the east and approximately 97 degrees W. longitude on the west and extends from the Federal-State
boundaries seaward to the provisional maritime boundary between the United States and Mexico. The entire Call area
is offshore the States of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. This area is divided into two planning areas.

The Central Gulf Planning Area is bounded on the east by approximately 88 degrees W. longitude. Its western boundary
begins at the offshore boundary between Texas and Louisiana and proceeds southeasterly to approximately 28 degrees
N. latitude, thence east to approximately 92 degrees W. longitude, thence south to the provisional maritime boundary
with Mexico which constitutes the southern boundary of the area. The northern part of the area is bounded by the Federal-State
boundary offshore Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. The area available for nominations and comments consists
of about 47.8 million acres. 
The Western Gulf Planning Area is bounded on the west and north by the Federal-State boundary and on the east by the Central
Gulf Planning Area. It extends south to the provisional maritime boundary with Mexico. It is offshore Texas and, in
deeper water, offshore Louisiana. The area available for nominations and comments consists of about 35.9 million
acres. 
A standard Call for Information Map depicting each planning area on a block-by-block basis is available without charge
from: Minerals Management Service, Public Information Unit (MS 5034), 1201 Elmwood Park Boulevard, New Orleans,
Louisiana 70123-2394, Telephone: (504) 736-2519. 
4. 

Areas Deferred from this Call (Western Gulf).

 High Island Area, East Addition, South Extension, (Flower Gardens), Block A-375 and Block A-398. 
5. 

Area Under Ongoing Discussions with the Navy (Western Gulf).

 The Navy has requested that two, three block groups in the Mustang Island Area be deferred from leasing in the Western
Gulf so that they can conduct mine warfare operations in those areas. These six blocks are not being deferred from this
Call. The MMS will continue its review to take into account possible changes in nearby oil and gas discovery and development
patterns and will continue discussions with the Navy and industry representatives regarding future activities.

6. 

Instructions on Call.

 Indications of interest and comments must be received no later than 45 days following publication of this document
in the 

Federal Register

 in envelopes labeled ``Nominations for Proposed 1996 Lease Sales in the Gulf of Mexico'' or ``Comments on the Call
for Information and Nominations for Proposed 1996 Lease Sales in the Gulf of Mexico.'' The standard Call for Information
Map and indications of interest and/or comments must be submitted to the Regional Supervisor, Leasing and Environment,
Gulf of Mexico OCS Region, at the address stated above.

The standard Call for Information Map delineates the Call area, all of which has been identified by the MMS as having
potential for the discovery of accumulations of gas and oil. Respondents are requested to indicate interest in and
comment on any or all of the Federal acreage within the boundaries of the Call area that they wish to have considered
for inclusion in proposed Sale 157 in the Central Gulf and proposed Sale 161 in the Western Gulf. 
Although individual indications of interest are considered to be privileged and proprietary information, the names
of persons or entities indicating interest or submitting comments will be of public record. Those indicating such
interest are requested to do so on the standard Call for Information Map by outlining the areas of interest along block
lines. 
Respondents should rank areas in which they have expressed interest according to priority of their interest (e.g.,
priority 1 (high), 2 (medium), or 3 (low)). 


Respondents are encouraged to be specific in indicating blocks by priority, as blanket 
nominations on large areas are not useful in the analysis of industry interest. Areas where interest has been indicated
but on which respondents have not indicated priorities will be considered priority 3 (low). 

Respondents may also submit a detailed list of blocks nominated (by Official Protraction Diagram and Leasing Map
designations) to ensure correct interpretation of their nominations. Specific questions may be directed to the
Chief, Leasing Activities Section at (504) 736-2761. Official Protraction Diagrams and Leasing Maps can be
purchased from the Public Information Unit referred to above. 
Comments are sought from all interested parties about particular geological, environmental, biological, archaeological,
and socioeconomic conditions or conflicts, or other information that might bear upon the potential leasing and development
of particular areas. Comments are also sought on possible conflicts between future OCS gas and oil activities that
may result from the proposed sales and State Coastal Management Programs (CMP's). If possible, these comments should
identify specific CMP policies of concern, the nature of the conflict foreseen, and steps that the MMS could take to
avoid or mitigate the potential conflict. Comments may either be in terms of broad areas or restricted to particular
blocks of concern. Those submitting comments are 
requested to list block numbers or outline the subject area on the standard Call for Information Map. 
7. 

Use of Information from Call.

 Information submitted in response to this Call will be used for several purposes. First, responses will be used to
help identify the areas of potential for gas and oil development. Second, comments on possible environmental effects
and potential use conflicts will be used in the analysis of environmental conditions in and near the Call area. This
information will be used to make a preliminary determination of the potential advantages and disadvantages of gas
and oil exploration and development to the region and the Nation. A third purpose of this Call is to use the comments
collected to initiate the scoping process for the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and to develop a proposed
action and alternatives. Fourth, comments may be used in developing lease terms and conditions to ensure safe offshore
operations. Fifth, comments may be used to assess potential conflicts between offshore gas and oil activities and
a State CMP. 
8. 

Existing Information.

 Preceding this Call in the sale planning process was an Information Base Review (IBR). The purpose of an IBR is to evaluate
the status of pertinent information and the information acquisition efforts. This IBR constituted an assessment
of the quality and adequacy of the information available which has been found sufficient for the decision to proceed
with the Call.

An extensive environmental studies program has been underway 
in this area since 1973. The emphasis, including continuing studies, has been on environmental characterization
of 
biologically sensitive habitats, physical oceanography, ocean-circulation modeling, and ecological effects
of gas and oil activities. A complete listing of available study reports, and information for ordering copies, can
be obtained from the Public Information Unit referenced above. The reports may also be ordered, for a fee, from the
U.S. Department of Commerce, National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia
22161, or telephone (703) 487-4650. In addition, a program status report for continuing studies 
in this area can be obtained from the Chief, Environmental Studies Section, Gulf of Mexico OCS Region (see address
under ``Description of Area''), or telephone (504) 736-2896. 
Summary Reports and Indices and technical and geological reports are available for review at the MMS, Gulf of Mexico
OCS Region. Copies of the Gulf of Mexico OCS Regional Summary Reports may be obtained from the OCS Information Program,
Office of Offshore Information and Publications, Minerals Management Service, at 
381 Elden Street, Herndon, Virginia 22070. 
9. 

Tentative Schedule.

 The following is a list of tentative milestone dates preceding Sale 157 and Sale 161: 







10. 

Purpose of Notice of Intent (NOI). 

Pursuant to the regulations implementing the provisions of the NEPA, the MMS is announcing its intent to prepare an
EIS on the gas and oil leasing proposals known as Sale 157 in the Central Gulf, and Sale 161 in the Western Gulf, off the
States of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. The NOI also serves to announce the scoping process that will
be followed for this EIS. Throughout the scoping process, Federal Agencies and State and local governments and other
interested parties have the opportunity to aid the MMS in determining the significant issues and alternatives to
be analyzed in the EIS. 
The EIS analysis will focus on the potential environmental effects of leasing, exploration, and development of the
blocks included in the areas defined in the Area Identification procedure as the proposed areas of the Federal actions.
Alternatives to the proposal which may be considered for each sale are to delay the sale, cancel the sale, or modify
the sale. 
11. 

Instructions on NOI to Prepare an EIS. 

Federal Agencies and State and local governments and other interested parties are requested to send their written
comments on the scope of the EIS, significant issues which should be addressed, and alternatives that should be considered
to the Regional Supervisor, Leasing and Environment, Gulf of Mexico OCS Region, at the address stated under ``Description
of Area.'' Comments should be enclosed in an envelope labeled ``Comments on the NOI to Prepare an EIS on the proposed
1995 Lease Sales in the Gulf of Mexico.'' Comments on the NOI should be submitted no later than 45 days from publication
of this Notice. Scoping meetings will be held in appropriate locations to obtain additional comments and information
regarding the scope of the EIS.

(a) 

Fixed Interest Rate: 

If rates are to be quoted based on a spread over an index, the lender should use as its index a long bond, specifically
the 61/4% U.S. Treasury Bond due August 15, 2023. Such rate is to be set at the time of acceptance.
(b) 

Variable Interest Rate: 

To be based on the six-month British Bankers Association LIBOR, preferably with terms relating to Borrower's right
to convert to fixed. The rate should be adjusted weekly.
(5) 

Prepayment: 

Offers should include options for prepayment and mention prepayment premiums, if any.
(6) 

Fees: 

Offers should specify the placement fees and other expenses, including USAID fees, the Paying and Transfer Agent
fees. Lenders are requested to include all legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses in their placement fee. Such fees
and expenses shall be payable at closing from the proceeds of the loan.
(7) 

Closing Date: 

As early as practicable, but not to exceed 60 days from date of selection of lender.
Selection of investment bankers and/or lenders and the terms of the loan are initially subject to the individual discretion
of the Borrower and thereafter subject to approval by USAID. The Republic of Chile reserves the right to not accept
any bid which, in its estimation, is non-competitive. Disbursements under the loan will be subject to certain conditions
required of the Borrower by USAID as set forth in agreements between USAID and the Borrower.
The full repayment of the loans will be guaranteed by USAID. The USAID guaranty will be backed by the full faith and credit
of the United States of America and will be issued pursuant to authority in Section 222 of the Foreign Assistance Act
of 1961, as amended (the ``Act'').
Lenders eligible to receive the USAID guaranty are those specified in section 238(c) of the Act. They are: (1) U.S.
citizens; (2) domestic U.S. corporations, partnerships, or associations substantially beneficially owned by
U.S. citizens; (3) foreign corporations whose share capital is at least 95 percent owned by U.S. citizens; and, (4)
foreign partnerships or associations wholly owned by U.S. citizens.
To be eligible for the USAID guaranty, the loans must be repayable in full no later than the thirtieth anniversary of
the disbursement of the principal amount thereof and the interest rates may be no higher than the maximum rate established
from time to time by USAID.
Information as to the eligibility of investors and other aspects of the USAID housing guaranty program can be obtained
from: Mr. Peter Kimm, Director, Office of Housing and Urban Programs, U.S. Agency for International Development,
Room 401, SA-2, Washington, DC 20523-0214, Telephone: 202/663-2530.

Virginia & Southwestern Railway Company (V&S) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR Part 1152 Subpart
F_Exempt Abandonments to abandon 0.18 mile of track between milepost 68.24-T and milepost 68.42-T at
Bristol, VA, and 0.8 mile of track between milepost 70.6-T and milepost 71.4-T at Bristol, TN, a total distance
of 0.98 mile. 
V&S has certified that: (1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) there is no overhead
traffic on the line; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government
entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission
or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the
requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (service of environmental report on agencies), 49 CFR 1105.8 (service of historic report

and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to government agencies) have been met. 
As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee affected by the abandonment shall be protected under 

Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 

360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial
revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. 
Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption
will be effective on June 2, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental
issues,
 formal expressions of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2),

and historic resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental assessment (EA)
by 
May 6, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA by writing to SEA (room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission,
Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief of SEA at (202) 927-6248. Comments on environmental
and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA becomes available to the public. 



 
Environmental, historic preservation, public use, or trail use/rail banking conditions will be imposed, where
appropriate, in a subsequent decision.

of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on March 24, 1994, applicable to all workers of the subject

Federal Register

 on December 28, 1993 (58 FR 68669).
At the request of the State Agency, the Department is amending the certification to include leased employees at Bravo
Fashions who were separated as a result of the adverse impact of imported ladies' jackets.
The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers at Bravo Fashions, Mineral Wells, Texas who
were affected by increased imports of ladies' jackets.
Further, as a result of the plant shutdown in November, 1993, the Department is including a termination date of April
23, 1994.
The amended notice applicable to TA-W-29,567 is hereby issued as follows:



All workers of Bravo Fashions, Inc., Mineral Wells, Texas who became totally or partially separated from employment
on or after February 23, 1993 and before April 23, 1994, including leased employees of Employee Services who were employed
exclusively at Bravo Fashions, Mineral Wells, Texas who were separated as a result of the impact of imported ladies'
jackets on or after February 23, 1993 and before April 23, 1994, are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under
Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.

<DOCTITLE>Investigations Regarding Certifications of Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance</DOCTITLE>




Petitions have been filed with the Secretary of Labor under section 221 (a) of the Trade Act of 1974 (``the Act'') and
are identified in the Appendix to this notice. Upon receipt of these petitions, the Director of the Office of Trade
Adjustment Assistance, Employment and Training Administration, has instituted investigations pursuant to section
221 (a) of the Act.

The purpose of each of the investigations is to determine whether the workers are eligible to apply for adjustment
assistance under title II, chapter 2, of the Act. The investigations will further relate, as appropriate, to the determination
of the date on which total or partial separations began or threatened to begin and the subdivision of the firm involved.

The petitioners or any other persons showing a substantial interest in the subject matter of the investigations may
request a public hearing, provided such request is filed in writing with the Director, Office of Trade Adjustment
Assistance, at the address shown below, not later than May 13, 1994.

Interested persons are invited to submit written comments regarding the subject matter of the investigations to
the Director, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance, at the address shown below, not later than May 13, 1994.

The petitions filed in this case are available for inspection at the Office of the Director, Office of Trade Adjustment
Assistance, Employment and Training Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington,
DC 20210.

<DOCTITLE>Johnson Controls, Inc., Bennington, VT; Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>




On April 5, 1994, the workers with the support of their Congressman, requested administrative reconsideration of
the Department's denial notice for workers at the subject firm. The notice was issued on March 15, 1994 and was published
in the Federal Register

 on March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14876).

It's claimed that an appropriate subdivision at Johnson Controls in Bennington, Vermont was adversely affected
by increased imports because Johnson Controls moved a part of the production process (the filling, charging, decorating
and installing) at Bennington to a plant in Mexico. The charged batteries will then reenter the U.S. as imports.



Conclusion



After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration
of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted.

separated from employment after December 8, 1993 (date of enactment of Public Law 103-182) are eligible to apply
for NAFTA-TAA under Subchapter D of the Trade Act because of increased imports from or the shift in production
to Mexico or Canada.

<DOCTITLE>Wagner-Peyser Act Final Planning Allotments for Program Year (PY) 1994</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Employment and Training Administration, Labor.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces the final planning allotments for Program Year (PY) 1994 (July 1, 1994, through June 30, 1995)
for basic labor exchange activities provided under the Wagner-Peyser Act.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with Section 6(b)(5) of the Wagner-Peyser Act, the Employment and Training Administration is publishing
final planning allotments for each State for Program Year (PY) 1994 (July 1, 1994, through June 30, 1995). Preliminary
planning estimates were provided to each State on February 25, 1994. Funds are distributed in accordance with formula
criteria established in Section 6 (a) and (b) of the Wagner-Peyser Act. Civilian labor force (CLF) and unemployment
data for Calendar Year 1993 are used in making the formula calculations.



The total amount of funds currently available for distribution is $832,856,000. The Secretary of Labor set aside
3 percent of the total available funds to assure that each State will have sufficient resources to maintain statewide
employment services, as required by Section 6(b)(4) of the Act. In accordance with this provision, $24,396,018 is
set aside for administrative formula allocation. These funds are included in the total planning allotment. The funds
that are set aside are distributed in two steps to States which have lost in relative share of resources from the prior
year. In Step 1, States which have a CLF below one million and are below the median CLF density are maintained at 100 percent
of their relative share of prior year resources. The remainder is distributed in Step 2 to all other States losing in
relative share from the prior year but which do not meet the size and density criteria for Step 1. 

Postage costs incurred by States during the conduct of employment service (ES) activities are billed directly to
the Department of Labor by the U.S. Postal Service. The total final planning allotment reflects $19,655,400, or 2.36
percent of the total amount available, withheld from distribution to finance postage costs associated with the conduct
of ES business. 

The Department had planned to require State Employment Security Agencies (SESAs) to convert from penalty mail systems
to commercial mail systems effective October 1, 1994, at which time the Employment and Training Administration (ETA)
had planned to allocate national postage reserves to the SESAs. Based on a legal opinion, the Department cannot require
this conversion. SESAs are entitled to the penalty mail privilege pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 3202(a)(1)(E). This does
not impact on the change to direct accountability that SESAs implemented on October 1, 1993. States will continue
to use penalty mail systems (penalty meters, penalty stamps and envelopes, permit G-12, and Business Reply
Mail permit 12634) and ETA will continue to pay the SESA penalty mail costs to the U.S. Postal Service. ETA will explore
with the U.S. Postal Service the possibility of having individual State penalty mail agreements with the U.S. Postal
Service. This would permit ETA to allocate postage resources to the States who could then have the option of using commercial
or penalty mail systems. It continues to the Departmental policy that States utilize commercial mail methods for
mail which pertains to both employment security and non-employment security business. In such instances, ETA will
reimburse the SESA for the employment security share of the cost. 

Differences between preliminary planning estimates and final planning allotments are caused by the use of a Calendar
Year data base as opposed to the earlier data used for preliminary planning estimates. Ten percent of the total sums
allotted to each State shall be reserved for use by the Governor to provide performance incentives for public ES offices;
services for groups with special needs; and for the extra costs of exemplary models for delivering job services.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Indiana Michigan Power Co., D.C. Cook, Unit No. 2, Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact







The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements
of 10 CFR part 50, appendix J, III.D.2.(a) and III.D.3., related to Type B and C local leak rate testing of containment
isolation valves, to the Indiana Michigan Power Company (the licensee), for operation of the D.C. Cook Nuclear Plant,
Unit 2, located in Berrien County, Michigan. 



Environmental Assessment 



Identification of Proposed Action 



The proposed action would grant a one-time schedular exemption from the requirements of Appendix J, paragraphs III.D.2.(a)
and III.D.3 of 10 CFR part 50 and approve an extension of the 2-year period between the performance of Type B and C leak
rate test by 150 days. Appendix J to 10 CFR part 50, paragraph III.D.2.(a), states, in part, ``Type B tests, except tests
for air locks, shall be performed during reactor shutdown for refueling, or other convenient intervals, but in no
case at intervals greater than 2 years.'' Paragraph III.D.3., states, ``Type C tests shall be performed during each
reactor shutdown for refueling but in no case at intervals greater than 2 years.'' Taken together, these sections
require Type B and C containment leakage tests to be performed at an interval not to exceed 2 years. 

In a letter dated March 9, 1994, as supplemental April 13, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption to 10 CFR part 50,
Appendix J, to allow the time between the performance of the required Type B and C tests to exceed the 2-year maximum
by up to 150 days. 



The Need for the Proposed Action 



The proposed exemption is needed because compliance with paragraphs III.D.2(a) and III.D.3 of 10 CFR part 50, appendix
J, would result in a unit shutdown and additional personnel radiation exposure in order to comply with the required
Type B and C test frequency. The licensee last conducted the required Type B and C leak rate tests during a refueling
outage in the spring of 1992. These previous leak rate tests will reach the 2-year maximum test interval imposed by
Appendix J starting on May 29, 1994. The licensee's next refueling outage is scheduled to begin in August 1994. The
extended interval between refueling outages is a result of an equipment problem and scheduling to avoid coincident
refueling outages on both units. The exemption is requested to support the current outage schedule and to avoid the
potential for an earlier reactor shutdown. If a forced outage is imposed to perform testing it would present undue
hardship and cost in the form of increased radiological exposure. Furthermore, if a forced outage is imposed to perform
the required testing, an additional plant shutdown and startup will be required. This action is similar to that approved
for several other facilities. 



Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action 



The proposed action includes exemptions from performing Type B and C tests for a maximum period of 150 days beyond the
required Appendix J test intervals. As stated in 10 CFR part 50, appendix J, the purpose of the primary containment
leak rate testing requirements is to ensure that leakage rates are maintained within the Technical Specification
requirements and to assure that proper maintenance and repair is performed throughout the service life of the containment
boundary components. The requested exemption is consistent with the intent of 10 CFR 50.12(a), in that it represents
a one-time only schedular extension of short duration. The required leak tests will still be performed to assess compliance
with Technical Specification requirements, albeit later, and to asure that any required maintenance or repair is
performed. As noted in paragraphs III.D.2.(a) and III.D.3 of Appendix J, it was intended that the testing be performed
during refueling outages or other convenient intervals. Extending the Appendix J intervals by a small amount to reach
the next refueling outage will not significantly impact the integrity of the containment boundary and, therefore,
will not significantly impact the consequences of an accident or transient in the unlikely event of such an occurance
during the 150-day extended period. 

Past Unit 2 local leak rate test data have demonstrated improving leak rate test results. Although the As Found results
for the 1989 and 1990 outages were 3.0 L

a

 and 0.74 L

a

, respectively, which exceeded the maximum limit of 0.6 L

a

, the 1992 As Found was 0.18 L

a

. The improved 1992 As Found result, which was a minor increase from the 1990 As Left of 0.17 L

a

, followed several corrective actions by the licensee. The improving trend for the Type B and C testing, well below
the allowable limit, provides reasonable assurance that the probability of exceeding the offsite dose rates established
in 10 part 100 will not be increased by extending the current Type B and C testing for a maximum of 150 days.

Thus, radiological releases will not differ from those determined previously and the proposed exemption does not
otherwise affect facility radiological effluent or occupational exposures. The proposed exemption will not increase
the probability or consequences of any reactor accidents. The proposed exemption does not affect plant nonradiological
effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no measurable
radiological or nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption.


Alternatives to the Proposed Action


Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental effects that would result from the proposed
action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.
The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption and amendment and to require rigid compliance
with the requirements of paragraphs III.D.2.(a) and III.D.3 of appendix J to 10 CFR part 50. Such action would not enhance
the protection of the environment and would result in unjustified burdens and costs for the licensee and greater occupational
exposure to plant personnel.


Alternative Use of Resources


This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in connection with the Commission's Final
Environmental Statement for D.C. Cook, Units 1 and 2, dated August 1973.


Agencies and Persons Consulted


The staff consulted with the State of Michigan regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. The State
had no comments.


Finding of No Significant Impact


The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption.
Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the staff concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment.
For further details with respect to this proposed action, see the licensee's application and request for exemption
dated March 9 and April 13, 1994. This document is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document
Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the Maud Preston Palenske
Memorial Library, 500 Market Street, St. Joseph, Michigan 49085.

<DOCTITLE>Public Service Electric and Gas Co.; Issuance of Environmental Assessment Finding of No Significant Impact</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating
Licenses No. DPR-70 and DPR-75, issued to Public Service Electric and Gas Company (the licensee), for
the operation of Salem Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1 and 2.


Identification of Proposed Action


The amendments would consist of changes to the Technical Specifications (TS) that would authorize an increase to
the storage capacity of the spent fuel pools (SFP) from 1170 fuel assemblies to 1632 fuel assemblies at each Salem unit.
The amendments to the TS are responsive to the licensee's application dated April 28, 1993, as supplemented by letters
of August 12, 1993, November 7, 1993, February 2, 1994, and April 7, 1994. The NRC staff has prepared an Environmental
Assessment of the proposed action, ``Environmental Assessment by the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation Relating
to the Expansion of the Spent Fuel Pools, Public Service Electric and Gas Company, Facility Operating License No.
DPR-70 and DPR-75, Salem Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1 and 2, Docket Nos. 50-272 and 50-311,''
dated April 25, 1994.


Summary of Environmental Assessment


The ``Final Generic Environmental Impact Statement (FGEIS) on Handling and Storage of Spent Light Water Power Reactor
Fuel'' (NUREG-0575), concluded that the environmental impact of interim storage of spent fuel was negligible
and the cost of the various alternatives reflects the advantage of continued generation of nuclear with the accompanying
spent fuel storage. Because of the differences in SFP designs, the FGEIS recommended licensing SFP expansion on a
case-by-case basis.
For Salem Units 1 and 2, the SFP modification will not create any significant additional radiological effects or measurable
nonradiological environmental impacts.
In the event of a fuel handling accident, the whole body dose and thyroid dose that might be received by an individual
at the site boundary is well within regulatory requirements. It is not expected that an increase in the occupational
radiation dose will result from the operation of the expanded spent fuel pools. For the modification of the pools,
the occupational exposure is estimated to be less than 4% of the total annual occupational exposure at the facility.
To assure as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) goals are met, during the SFP expansion activities, work, personnel
traffic and movement of equipment will be monitored and controlled. Therefore, the staff concludes that the exposure
to workers is ALARA and is acceptable.
The only nonradiological impact affected by the expansion of the spent fuel pools is the waste heat rejected. The increase
in total plant waste heat is insignificant (less than 0.05% of the total plant heat loss to the environment). There
is no significant environmental impact attributed to the waste heat from the plant because of the expansion of the
spent fuel pools.


Finding of No Significant Impact


The staff has reviewed this proposed facility modification relative to the requirements set forth in 10 CFR part 51.
Based on this assessment, the staff concludes that there are no significant radiological or nonradiological impacts
associated with the proposed action and that the issuance of the proposed amendments to the licenses will have no significant
impact on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the Commission has determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.31,
not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed amendments.
For further details with respect to this action, see (1) the application for amendments to the Technical Specifications
dated April 28, 1993, as supplemented by letters of August 12, 1993, November 17, 1993, February 2, 1994, and April
7, 1994, (2) the FGEIS on Handling and Storage of Spent Light Water Power Reactor Fuel (NUREG-0575), (3) the Final

Assessment dated April 25, 1994. These documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public

<DOCTITLE>Southern California Edison Co. San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, Unit 1; Environmental Assessment and Finding
of No Significant Impact</DOCTITLE>





The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements
of 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) to Facility Operating License No. DPR-13, a possession-only license held by the Southern
California Edison Company (SCE or the licensee). The exemption would apply to the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station,
Unit 1 (SONGS 1), a permanently shutdown plant located at the SCE site in San Diego County, California.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of Proposed Action



The proposed action would grant an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) to the extent that SONGS
1 would be exempted from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan (secondary level financial protection).
The licensee requested the elimination of its required participation in a letter dated February 2, 1993.



The Need for the Proposed Action



SONGS 1 was permanently shut down in November 1992, and defueling of the reactor completed in March 1993. Upon licensee
certification of the defueling on March 9, 1993, Amendment No. 150 to Facility Operating License No. DPR-13
became effective, changing the license to a possession-only license. The exemption addresses withdrawal from participation
in the industry retrospective rating plan.

Since SONGS 1 no longer contributes as great a risk to the retrospective rating plan participants as does an operating
plant, this reduction in risk should be reflected in the indemnification requirements to which the licensee is subject.
Approval of this request would allow a more equitable allocation of financial risk.



Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action



The proposed action does not involve any environmental impacts. The proposed exemption is in a subject area, changes
in surety, insurance and/or indemnity requirements, for which the Commission in 10 CFR 51.22(c)(10) has determined
that a license amendment would meet the criteria for categorical exclusion from the need for either an environmental
assessment or an environmental impact statement.

Since the proposed action does not involve a change in plant operation or configuration, there is reasonable assurance
that the proposed action would not increase the probability or the consequences of an accident or reduce the margin
of safety, no changes would be made in the types or quantities of effluents that may be released offsite, and there would
be no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative radiation exposure.

Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental
impact.

With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed action does not affect non-radiological plant
effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
non-radiological impacts associated with the proposed action.



Alternatives to the Proposed Action


Since the Commission has concluded that there are no measurable environmental impacts associated with the proposed
action, any alternative with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.
The principal alternative would be to deny the action. This would not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation
and would not enhance the protection of the environment nor public health and safety.



Alternative Use of Resources


This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the Environmental Assessment related
to the conversion of the Provisional Operating License to a Full Term Operating License issued to Southern California
Edison Company for the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, Unit 1, on September 16, 1991.


Agencies and Persons Consulted


The NRC staff consulted with a representative of the State of California regarding the environmental impact of the
proposed action.


Finding of No Significant Impact


The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption.
Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.
For further details with respect to this action, see the licensee application to amend Indemnity Agreement No. B-31,
dated February 2, 1993, which is available for public inspection at the Commission Public Document Room, Gelman Building,
2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the Local Public Document Room at the Main Library, University of California,

<DOCTITLE>Detroit Edison Co. (Fermi 2); Exemption</DOCTITLE>



I




Detroit Edison Company (the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. NPF-43 which authorizes
operation of the Fermi 2 Nuclear Plant at steady-state reactor power levels not in excess of 3430 megawatts thermal.
The Fermi 2 facility is a boiling water reactor located at the licensee's site in Monroe County, Michigan. The license
provides, among other things, that it is subject to all rules, regulations, and Orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(the Commission) now or hereafter in effect.



II



Paragraph III.C of appendix J to 10 CFR part 50 requires, in part, that valves, unless pressurized with fluid (e.g.,
water, nitrogen) from a seal system, shall be tested by pressurizing with air or nitrogen at a test pressure of Pa (56.5
psig), the calculated peak containment internal pressure as a result of the design basis accident. Further, the combined
leakage rate of all penetrations and valves subject to Type B and C testing shall be less than 0.60 La (La is the maximum
allowable leakage rate at Pa). Leakage from containment isolation valves that are sealed with fluid from a seal system
may be excluded, provided the leakage rates for these valves do not exceed the Technical Specification leakage requirements
and the seal system fluid inventory is sufficient to ensure the sealing function for 30 days following an accident
at a pressure of 1.10 Pa.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), the NRC may grant exemptions from the requirements of the regulations (1) which are authorized
by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and are consistent with the common defense and
security; and (2) where special circumstances are present.



III



By letter dated May 24, 1993, the licensee requested an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR part 50, appendix
J, III.C for performing Type C integrated leak rate tests of the containment isolation valves in the Low pressure coolant
injection (LPCI) lines of the residual heat removal (RHR) system. The valves in question are the loop A and B LPCI isolation
valves, which are motor-operated gate valves, outboard of containment and which are operable from the control room
and are designated as E11-F015 A and B. The licensee proposed, as alternative testing, an external leakage test,
with water as the test medium, at a pressure of 1045 psig with an allowable leakage value of 5 milliliters per minute
(ml/min). The license also provided justification in its May 24, 1993, letter to reclassify the inboard containment
LPCI valve configuration (which consists of a reverse flow swing check valve with a 1-inch, locked closed, solenoid-operated
bypass valve) as other than containment isolation valves and thus no longer subject to Type C testing.

The staff evaluated the licensee's proposal for reclassification of the inboard containment valves and concluded
that the licensee's proposal met the guidance in the Standard Review Plan (SRP), NUREG-0800, Section 6.2.4
for differing from the explicit requirements of General Design Criterion 55 in 10 CFR part 50, appendix A for containment
isolation valves (CIVs). Subsection II.6.e allows only a single CIV outside containment, if the system is closed
outside containment and certain other criteria are met. Details concerning the staff's review are contained in the
staff's safety evaluation dated April 22, 1994.

Two aspects of the RHR system form the basis for the proposed exemption. It is a closed system outside of containment,
and the containment penetrations will be water sealed during a loss of coolant accident (LOCA). The licensee's analyses
showed that a water seal. pressurized to greater than 1.1 Pa (62.15 psig), would exist outboard of the LPCI CIV for at
least 30 days following the design basis LOCA despite the most limiting single active failure. However, if one or both
of the LPCI CIVs is shut, that water seal might not prevent external valve leakage (valve stem or bonnet leakage). The
licensee also showed that a water seal, would exist inboard of the LPCI CIVs following a design basis LOCA. The licensee's
analyses demonstrated that the volume of the water seal is sufficient to last for greater than 30 days assuming the
leakage limit proposed in their alternative testing acceptance criteria. The licensee's analyses also showed that
through seat leakage of the LPCI CIVs would be in toward containment and would not deplete the water seal.

Although the external leakage water seal would prevent atmosphere from leading out of containment, it does not satisfy
the requirements for a water seal contained in Appendix J. Appendix J allows water sealed valves to be excepted from
the normal Type C testing with air, but it requires that the water seal be pressurized to at least 1.1 Pa during an accident.
The water leg inboard of the LPCI CIVs does not meet this requirement. Nevertheless, the staff has determined that
the licensee's analyses of the water seals provide sufficient assurance that containment atmosphere leakage out
of containment will be prevented during an accident to justify granting the requested exemption from Type C testing
of the LPCI CIVs with air as the test medium. The licensee's alternative test will measure external valve leakage with
a limit of 5 ml/min using water as the test medium at a pressure of 1045 psig.



IV



Accordingly, the Commission concluded that the licensee's proposed alternative testing plan and analyses provide
sufficient assurance that the containment atmosphere would not leak out of containment through the LPCI CIVs during
a design basis accident and that containment integrity will be maintained by granting the proposed exemption.

The special circumstances for granting this exemption pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12 have also been identified. As stated
in part in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), special circumstances are present when application of the regulation in the particular
circumstances is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule. The purpose of Section III.C of Appendix
J is to measure containment isolation valve leakage rates. This leakage, when summed with the allowable Type A and
Type B leakage is limited to a value which ensures overall containment integrity in preventing the uncontrolled release
of radioactivity to the environment. The licensee has demonstrated through analyses and by proposing alternative
testing criteria, that containment integrity will be maintained. Consequently, the Commission concludes that
the special circumstances of 10 CFR 50.12 (a)(2)(ii) exist in that application of the regulation in these particular
circumstances is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule.



V



Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to CFR 50.12 this exemption as described in Section III
above is authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with the
common defense and security. The Commission further determines that special circumstances as provided in 10 CFR
50.12(a)(2)(ii) are present justifying the exemption.

Therefore, the Commission hereby grants an exemption as described in Section III above the requirements in 10 CFR
50.12, Appendix J, III.C. for performing Type C containment integrated leak rate tests of the CIVs in the LPCI lines
of the RHR system and approves the licensee's alternative testing plan.

Pursuant to CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will have no significant
impact on the environment (59 FR 19028).

This exemption is effective upon issuance.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to subsection (e)(11) of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, the Postal Service is publishing a notice
of a new routine use applicable to its system of records USPS 010.050, Collection and Delivery Records_Delivery of
Mail Through Agents. The new routine use will authorize disclosure of information for the purpose of identifying
addresses as belonging to Commercial Mail Receiving Agencies (CMRAs). CMRAs are private entities which receive
mail on behalf of other persons. Often, the address provided for a person by a CMRA appears to be a typical residential
or business address.




The Postal Service, primarily through its law enforcement branch, the Postal Inspection Service, has been working
with the credit card industry to prevent credit card fraud. One form of credit card fraud consists of submitting an
application for a credit card under a fictitious name. Perpetrators of this type of fraud may use an address provided
by a CMRA as a means of avoiding detection. Credit card companies have asked the Postal Service to help them detect such
fraud by identifying CMRA addresses, and the Postal Service has concluded that the identification of CMRA addresses
would be an effective tool in combatting credit card fraud and other types of consumer fraud.


The routine use will authorize disclosure of information only for the purpose of identifying an address as belonging
to a CMRA, and no other information concerning CMRAs or their customers will be disclosed pursuant to the routine use.
Because the routine use will not authorize the disclosure of the identities of CMRA customers, disclosures under
the routine use will not invade the legitimate privacy interests of persons who receive mail through CMRAs. The information
will be disclosed primarily by means of annotations to the Postal Service's Delivery Sequence File (DSF). DSF data,
the use of which is made available to the public through authorized licensees, contains delivery-point addresses,
and it does not include the identities of individuals.



New Routine Use




This notice adds routine use No. 1 to Postal Service system of records USPS 010.050, Collection and Delivery Records_Delivery
of Mail Through Agents, as follows:


``1. Information may be disclosed for the purpose of identifying an address as an address of an agent to whom mail is
delivered on behalf of other persons. This routine use does not authorize the disclosure of the identities of persons
on behalf of whom agents receive mail.''

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of
Amendment No. 1 to a Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc., Relating to the Listing of Options
and Long-Term Options on the CBOE Global Telecommunications Index and Long-Term Options on a Reduced-Value Global
Telecommunications Index


April 25, 1994.


I. Introduction


On December 14, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to provide for the listing and trading of index options on the CBOE Global Telecommunications
Index (``Global Telecommunications Index'' or ``Index''). Notice of the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on December 30, 1993.
 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. On March 16, 1994, the Exchange submitted Amendment
No. 1 to the proposed rule change.
 This order approves the Exchange's proposal.







II. Description of Proposal


A. General


The CBOE proposes to list and trade options on the CBOE Global Telecommunications Index, a new securities index developed
by the CBOE and based on stocks and ADRs
 of international telecommunications companies that are traded on the American Stock Exchange (``Amex''), the New
York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''), or are national market securities traded through the facilities of the National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system (``NASDAQ''). The CBOE also proposes to list either
long-term options on the full-value Index or long-term options on a reduced-value Index that will be computed at one-tenth
of the value of the Global Telecommunications Index (``Global Telecommunications LEAPS'' or ``Index LEAPS'').
 Global Telecommunications LEAPS will trade independent of and in addition to regular Global Telecommunications
Index options traded on the Exchange,
 however, as discussed below, position and exercise limits of Index LEAPS and regular Index options will be aggregated.







B. Composition of the Index


The Index is based on securities representing twenty U.S. and foreign companies that the Exchange believes are representative
of the global telecommunications industry, all of which trade domestically as either stocks or ADRs. Fourteen of
these securities currently trade on the NYSE, one trades on the Amex, and five trade through NASDQ. The Index is price-weighted
and will be calculated on a real-time basis using last sale prices.
As of the close of trading on February 11, 1994, the Index was valued at 149.63.
 As of November 30, 1993, the market capitalizations of the individual securities in the Index ranged from a high of
$73.61 billion (AT&T) to a low of $144.21 million (Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc.), with the mean and median being
$14.79 billion and $8.14 billion, respectively. The market capitalization of all the securities in the Index was
$295.74 billion. The total number of shares outstanding for the stocks and ADRs in the Index ranged from a high of 1.35
billion shares (AT&T) to a low of 12.27 million shares (Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc.). The average price per share
of the securities in the Index, for the six-month period between June 1 and November 30, 1993, ranged from a high of $78.19
(Compania De Telefonos De Chile) to a low of $12.79 (Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc.). In addition, the average daily
trading volume of the stocks and ADRs in the Index, for the same six-month period, ranged from a high of 1.89 million
shares per day (AT&T) to a low of 51,675 shares per day (Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc.), with the mean and median
being 425,652 and 252,187 shares, respectively. Lastly, no one stock or ADR accounted for more than 9.08% of the Index's
total value (Compania De Telefonos De Chile) and the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index accounted
for 37.07% of the Index's value. The percentage weighting of the lowest weighted component was 1.27% of the Index (Atlantic
Tele-Network, Inc.) and the percentage weighting of the five smallest issues in the Index accounted for 11.66% of
the Index's value.

C. Maintenance



The Index will be maintained by the CBOE. The CBOE may change the composition of the Index at any time, subject to compliance
with the maintenance criteria discussed herein, to reflect the conditions in the global telecommunications industry.
If it becomes necessary to replace a security in the Index, the Exchange represents that it will make every effort to
add new stocks and/or ADRs that are representative of the global telecommunications industry and will take into account
a security's capitalization, liquidity, volatility, and name recognition of the proposed replacement. Further,
securities may be replaced in the event of certain corporate events, such as takeovers or mergers, that change the
nature of the security. If, however, the Exchange determines to increase the number of Index component securities
to greater than twenty-six or reduce the number of Index component securities to fewer than fourteen, the proposal
provides that the CBOE will submit a rule filing with the Commission pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act. In addition,
in choosing replacement securities for the Index, the CBOE will be required to ensure that at least 90% of the weight
of the Index continues to be made up of stocks and ADRs that are eligible for standardized options trading.
 Finally, the CBOE will be required to ensure that each component of the Index is subject to last sale reporting requirements
in the U.S.







D. Applicability of CBOE Rules Regarding Index Options



Except as modified by this order, the rules in Chapter XXIV of the CBOE Rules will be applicable to Global Telecommunications
Index options and full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS. Those rules address, among other things, the applicable
position and exercise limits, policies regarding trading halts and suspensions, and margin treatment for narrow-based
index options. 



E. Calculation of the Index



The CBOE Global Telecommunications Index is a price-weighted index and reflects changes in the prices of the Index
component securities relative to the Index's base date of January 2, 1992. Specifically, the Index value is calculated
by adding the prices of the component stocks and ADRs and then dividing this summation by a divisor that is equal to the
number of the components of the Index to get the average price. To maintain the continuity of the Index, the divisor
will be adjusted to reflect non-market changes in the prices of the component securities as well as changes in the composition
of the Index. Changes that may result in divisor adjustments include, but are not limited to, stock splits and dividends,
spin-offs, certain rights issuances, and mergers and acquisitions. 

The Index will be calculated continuously and will be disseminated to the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'')
every fifteen seconds by the CBOE, based on the last-sale prices of the component stocks and ADRs.
 OPRA, in turn, will disseminate the Index value to other financial vendors such as Reuters, Telerate, and Quotron.






The Index value for purposes of settling outstanding regular Index options and Index LEAPS contracts upon expiration
will be calculated based upon the regular way opening sale prices for each of the Index's component securities in their
primary market on the last trading day prior to expiration. In the case of securities traded on and through NASDAQ,
the first reported sale price will be used. Once all of the component stocks and ADRs have opened, the value of the Index
will be determined and that value will be used as the final settlement value for expiring Index options contracts.
If any of the component stocks or ADRs do not open for trading on the last trading day before expiration, then the prior
trading day's (

i.e.

, normally Thursday's) last sale price will be used in the Index calculation. In this regard, before deciding to use
Thursday's closing value of a component security for purposes of determining the settlement value of the Index, the
CBOE will wait until the end of the trading day on expiration Friday.

<TEXT>
 

F. Contract Specifications


The proposed options on the Index will be cash-settled, European-style options.
 Standard options trading hours (8:30 a.m. to 3:10 p.m. Central Standard time) will apply to the contracts. The Index
multiplier will be 100. The strike price interval will be $5.00 for full-value Index options with a duration of one
year or less to expiration.
 In addition, pursuant to CBOE Rule 24.9, there may be up to six expiration months outstanding at any given time. Specifically,
there may be up to there expiration months from the March, June, September, and December cycle plus up to three additional
near-term months so that the two nearest term months will always be available. As described in more detail below, the
Exchange also intends to list several Index LEAPS series that expire from twelve to thirty-six months from the date
of issuance.





Lastly, the options on the Index will expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month (``Expiration
Friday''). Accordingly, since options on the Index will settle based upon opening prices of the component securities
on the last trading day before expiration (normally a Friday), the last trading day for an expiring Index option series
will normally be the second to the last business day before expiration (normally a Thursday).


G. Listing of Long-Term Options on the Full-Value or Reduced-Value Global Telecommunications Index


The proposal provides that the Exchange may list long-term Index options that expire from 12 to 36 months from listing
based on the full-value Global Telecommunications Index or a reduced value Global Telecommunications Index that
will be computed at one-tenth the value of the full-value Index. Existing Exchange requirements applicable to full-value
and reduced-value LEAPS will apply to full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS.
 The current and closing Index value for reduced-value Global Telecommunications LEAPS will be computed by dividing
the value of the full-value Index by 10 and rounding the resulting figure to the nearest one-hundredth. For example,
an Index value of 149.76 would be 14.98 for the Index LEAPS and 149.73 would become 14.97. The reduced-value Index LEAPS
will have a European-style exercise and will be subject to the same rules that govern the trading of all the Exchange's
index options, including sales practice rules, margin requirements and floor trading procedures. Pursuant to CBOE
Rule 24.9, the strike price interval for the reduced-value Index LEAPS will be no less than $2.50 instead of $5.00.




H. Position and Exercise Limits, Margin Requirements, and Trading Halts


Because the Index is classified as an ``industry index'' under CBOE rules,
 Exchange rules that are applicable to the trading of options on narrow-based indexes will apply to the trading of Global
Telecommunications Index options and Global Telecommunications Index LEAPS. Specifically, Exchange rules governing
margin requirements,
 position and exercise limits,
 and trading halt procedures
 that are applicable to the trading of narrow-based index options will apply to options traded on the Index. The proposal
further provides that, for purposes of determining whether a given position in reduced-value Index LEAPS complies
with applicable position and exercise limits, positions in reduced-value Index LEAPS will be aggregated with positions
in the full-value Index options. For these purposes, ten reduced-value contract will equal one full-value contract.







I. Surveillance


Surveillence procedures currently used to monitor trading in each of the Exchange's other index options will also
be used to monitor trading in regular Index options and in full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS. These procedures
include complete access to trading activity in the underlying securities. Further, the Intermarket Surviellance
Group Agreement, dated July 14, 1983, as amended on January 29, 1990, will be applicable to the trading of options on
the Index.

III. Findings and Conclusions


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5).
 Specifically, the Commission finds that the trading of Global telecommunications Index options, including full-value
and reduced-value Index LEAPS, will serve to promote the public interest and help to remove impediments to a free and
open securities market by providing investors with a means of hedging exposure to market risk associated with securities
in the global telecommunications industry.






The trading of options on the Global Telecommunications Index, including full-value and reduced-value LEAPS on
the Index, however, raises several concerns, namely issues related to index design, customer protection, surveillance,
and market impact. The Commission believes, for the reasons discussed below, that the CBOE adequately has addressed
these concerns.


A. Index Design and Structure


The Commission finds that the Global Telecommunications Index is a narrow-based index. The Global Telecommunications
Index is composed of only twenty securities, all of which are within one industry_the global telecommunications
industry.
 Accordingly, the Commission believes it is appropriate for the CBOE to apply its rules governing narrow-based index
options to trading in the Index options.






The Commission also finds that the large capitalizations, liquid markets, and relative weightings of the Index's
component securities significantly minimize the potential for manipulation of the Index. First, the overwhelming
majority of the components that compose the Index are actively traded, with a mean and median average daily trading
volume of 425,652 and 252,187 shares, respectively.
 Second, the market capitalizations of the securities in the Index are very large, ranging from a high of $73.61 billion
to a low of $144.21 million as of November 30, 1993, with the mean and median being $14.79 billion and $8.14 billion,
respectively. Third, although the Index is only comprised of twenty component securities, no one particular security
or group of securities dominates the Index. Specifically, no one stock or ADR comprises more than 9.08% of the Index's
total value and the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index account for 37.07% of the Index's value.
 Fourth, at least 90% of the twenty securities in the Index by weight must be eligible for standardized options trading.
 The proposed CBOE maintenance requirement that 90% of the weighting of the Index be comprised of securities that are
eligible for options trading will ensure that the Index is almost completely comprised of options eligible securities.
Fifth, if the CBOE increases the number of component securities to more than twenty-six or decreases that number to
less than fourteen, the CBOE will be required to seek Commission approval pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act before
listing new strike price or expiration month series of Global Telecommunications Index options and Index LEAPS.
This will help protect against material changes in the composition and design of the Index that might adversely affect
the CBOE's obligations to protect investors and to maintain fair and orderly markets in Global Telecommunications
Index options and Index LEAPS. Sixth, the CBOE will be required to ensure that each component of the Index is subject
to last sale reporting requirements in the U.S.
 This will further reduce the potential for manipulation of the value of the Index. Finally, the Commission believes
that the expense of attempting to manipulate the value of the Global Telecommunications Index in any significant
way through trading in component stocks, ADRs, or securities underlying ADRs (or options on those securities) coupled
with, as discussed below, existing mechanisms to monitor trading activity in those securities, will help deter such
illegal activity.

B. Customer Protection





The Commission believes that a regulatory system designed to protect public customers must be in place before the
trading of sophisticated financial instruments, such as Global Telecommunications Index Options (including full-value
and reduced-value Global Telecommunications (LEAPS), can commence on a national securities exchange. The Commission
notes that the trading of standardized exchange-traded options occurs in an environment that is designed to ensure,
among other things, that: (1) the special risks of options are disclosed to public customers; (2) only investors capable
of evaluating and bearing the risks of options trading are engaged in such trading; and (3) special compliance procedures
are applicable to options accounts. Accordingly, because the Index options and Index LEAPS will be subject to the
same regulatory regime as the other standardized options currently traded on the CBOE, the Commission believes that
adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the protection of investors in Global Telecommunications Index options
and full-value and reduced-value Global Telecommunications Index LEAPS.




C. Surveillance





The Commission believes that a surveillance sharing agreement between an exchange proposing to list a security index
derivative product and the exchange(s) trading the securities underlying the derivative product is an important
measure for surveillance of the derivative and underlying securities markets. Such agreements ensure the availability
of information necessary to detect and deter potential manipulations and other trading abuses, thereby making the
security index product less readily susceptible to manipulation.
 In this regard, the CBOE, NYSE, Amex, and NASD are all members of the ISG, which provides for the exchange of all necessary
surveillance information.
 Further, as to the foreign components of the Index, either the Exchange has comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements
with the primary foreign markets for the securities underlying the ADRs or the U.S. is the relevant market for surveillance
purposes.










D. Market Impact





The Commission believes that the listing and trading of Global Telecommunications Index options, including full-value
and reduced-value Index LEAPS, on the CBOE will not adversely impact the underlying securities markets.
 First, as described above, for the most part, no one security or group of securities dominates the Index. Second, because,
at least 90% of the numerical value of the Index must be accounted for by securities that meet the Exchange's options
listing standards,
 and because each of the component securities must be subject to last sale reporting requirements,
 the component securities generally will be actively-traded, highly-capitalized securities. Third, the 10,500
contract position and exercise limits applicable to Index options and Index LEAPS will serve to minimize potential
manipulation and market impact concerns. Forth, the risk to investors of contra-party non-performance will be minimized
because the Index options and Index LEAPS will be issued and guaranteed by the Options Clearing Corporation just like
any other standardized option traded in the United States.









Lastly, the Commission believes that settling expiring Global Telecommunications Index options (including full-value
and reduced-value Index LEAPS) based on the opening prices of component securities is consistent with the Act. As
noted in other contexts, valuing options for exercise settlement on expiration based on opening prices rather than
closing prices may help reduce adverse effects on markets for securities underlying options on the Index.

<TEXT>
 

The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication
of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. Specifically, Amendment No. 1 raises the maintenance standards originally proposed by the Exchange by requiring
the CBOE to ensure that at least 90% of the Index, by weight, is composed of securities that are eligible for equity options
trading pursuant to CBOE Rule 5.3. As stated above, the Commission believes that this requirement has the effect of
ensuring that the Index is composed of highly-capitalized, actively-traded securities which serve to minimize
the possibility that the Index can be easily manipulated. Additionally, the Commission notes that this is the same
standard that the Commission recently approved for the listing and trading of index options and index LEAPS on the
CBOE Telecommunications Index.
 As a result, the Commission believes that good cause exists for approving Amendment No. 1 on an accelerated basis.





IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection
and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions should
refer to the File Number SR-CBOE-93-97 and should be submitted by May 24, 1994.



It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-CBOE-93-57), as amended, is approved.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Depository Trust Company; Order Temporarily Approving a Proposed Rule Change
Expanding the Money Market Instrument Settlement Program on a Pilot Basis</DOCTITLE>



April 22, 1994.



On October 19, 1993, The Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'')
a proposed rule change (File No. SR-DTC-93-12) under section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 to implement a pilot program to include additional types of money market instruments (``MMIs'') in its MMI settlement
program. Notice of the proposal was published in the 

Federal Register 

on November 8, 1993.
 The Commission did not receive any comment letters on the proposed rule change.
 For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is granting temporary approval of the pilot program until April 30,
1995.








I. Description



A. Generally



The proposed rule change makes DTC's existing MMI settlement services available for transactions in additional
types of MMIs. New MMI programs include those for institutional certificates of deposit (``CD''), municipal commercial
paper, and bankers' acceptances. The existing DTC MMI programs to be expanded or enhanced include those for corporate
commercial paper, medium-term notes, preferred stock in a CP-like mode, short-term bank notes, and discount notes.

The new MMI programs, along with the existing MMI programs, are an extension of DTC's Same-Day Funds Settlement (``SDFS'')
system.
The automated operating procedures for MMIs are virtually the same as those followed by SDFS participants and by Institutional
Delivery (``ID'') system users for basic depository services in other eligible SDFS securities. The MMI issues being
made SDFS-eligible will be distributed in book-entry-only form by the issuer's issuing agent that, as in the commercial
paper (``CP'') and medium-term note MMI programs, will send MMI issuance instructions to DTC electronically. Settlement
of an issue will be on the same day as the issuance or on a specified future day. The issuer's paying agent, that will also
serve as DTC's custodian, will hold a master or balance MMI certificate for DTC unless the issuer and its issuing and
paying agent bank choose to distribute uncertificated MMIs through DTC.
Because SDFS-eligible MMIs will be book-entry-only, participant operating procedures for deposits and withdrawals
will not apply to MMIs.






B. New MMI Programs



The fundamental risk in the SDFS system is that a participant will default in its payment obligation. The new MMI programs
are offered as an extension of DTC's current SDFS system; therefore, DTC will employ the same risk management controls
(

e.g., 

net debit collateralization, net debit caps, and receiver-authorized deliveries) to transactions in these new
programs as are employed in the current SDFS system.






Net debit collateralization requires each participant to maintain in its account throughout the processing day
collateral at least equal in value to the participant's net settlement debit. If during the processing day a transaction
will cause a net debit greater than the amount of collateral in the participant's account at the time the transaction
is being processed, DTC will recycle the transaction until there is sufficient collateral in the participant's account.
Transactions in the new MMI programs also will be subject to the participant's net debit cap.
 The net debit cap helps to protect against abnormal intraday debit peaks that are out of line with a participant's prior
month's average daily activity level. The net debit cap also reduces the possibility that the failure to settle by
more than one participant will not cause DTC to exceed its liquidity resources. The new MMI programs also will utilize
the receiver-authorized delivery control which allows a participant to monitor deliveries and payment orders directed
to its account before the orders are posted to the account.

<DOCNO> FR940503-2-00127 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940503-2-00085 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, DTC's three failure to settle procedures applicable to the CP program will be applicable to the new MMI
programs. First, DTC will employ the same procedures with regard to the sequence in which DTC will use MMI collateral
and eliminate payment order debits in a failing participant's account. Second, if DTC is notified before 3 p.m. eastern
standard time (``E.S.T.'') that a paying agent will not pay on an MMI issuer's maturity presentments, reorganization
presentments, periodic principal presentments, or periodic income presentments or if DTC is informed of an MMI issuer's
bankruptcy and a participant fails to settle with DTC on that day, DTC has the authority to reduce the settlement credits
of participants who had transactions on the day of default with the defaulting issuer or the defaulting participant
on the day of the default. Third, if the paying agent has not settled with DTC by noon E.S.T. on the DTC business day following
the settlement day or if a paying agent is determined to be insolvent according to DTC's rules, DTC will notify the issuers
utilizing that paying agent and provide those issuers with information on any presentments related to their MMIs
on which the PA failed to pay DTC.


C. Expanded or Improved Existing MMI Programs


DTC will be expanding its CP program to include ``uncommon CP.'' Uncommon CP is CP paying income periodically, a variable
amount of income, or a variable amount of principal. It also includes CP denominated in a foreign currency, CP with
a maturity of 271 days to a year, or corporate variable-rate demand obligations in CP mode. These instruments were
not included in the original CP program.
DTC also will be enhancing their MMI programs for medium-term notes, short-term notes, discount notes, and preferred
stock in CP-like mode. The medium-term note program will be enhanced by DTC's collection and allocation of income,
principal, reorganization, and maturity payments within the SDFS system. Paying agents will no longer have to separately
wire such payments to DTC. Instead, as with maturity payments in the CP program, these payments will be included in
each paying agent's net settlement figure due to or from DTC at the end of each day. Similarly, the short-term note program
will be enhanced with the inclusion in the SDFS system maturity payments and periodic income payments in the SDFS system
and in the paying agents' net SDFS amounts due to or from DTC. The restriction that short-term notes must have a minimum
maturity period of thirty days to be included in this program will be removed. The short-term notes program, the discount
notes program, and the preferred stock in CP-like mode program will all provide for uncertificated issuer programs.
However, one master note or certificate may be held for DTC by the paying agent.


II. Discussion


Section 17A(b)(3)(F)
 of the Act requires that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and
settlement of securities transactions and to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds which are in the custody
or control of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible. As discussed below, the Commission believes the DTC's
proposed rule change is consistent with DTC's obligations under the Act.




As previously described, the new MMI programs and the expanded and enhanced programs are an extension of DTC's current
SDFS system and include many of the same risk management features that are employed in the SDFS system. The Commission
previously examined these features when DTC first proposed the SDFS system and again when the CP program was added.
 At those times, the Commission found, and continues to believe, that these risk management measures are consistent
with Section 17A of the Act and should minimize the impact of a default by a participant in the SDFS system.




The use of provisional credits and unwind procedures if an MMI issuer were to default, however, could increase the
risk of settlement gridlock in certain circumstances. For example, if DTC were to confirm the insolvency of an MMI
issuer before 3:00 p.m.,
 DTC would reverse all participants' credits attributable to the insolvent issuer without regard to any of the risk
management controls. Such reversals of credits could result in a participant having a net debit that exceeds the participant's
net debit cap and DTC's liquidity resources. If such a participant then failed to settle its net debit with DTC, DTC
would possibly have difficulty completing other settlements thus creating systemic risk.

As an interim solution, DTC proposed for comment the implementation of an additional $500 million line of credit dedicated
to the completion of settlement in the SDFS system in the event a participant fails to settle after application of the
unwind procedures. The additional line of credit would be supported by securities pledged to the SDFS fund and would
not be included as a part of DTC's liquidity resources when determining a participant's net debit cap. DTC also proposed
as a long term solution, a SDFS system enhancement that would conduct default scenarios to assure that unwind procedures
would not cause a liquidity problem.

DTC solicited comment from its participants regarding (1) the necessity of unwind procedures in the SDFS service
that override risk management controls and (2) if unwind procedures are necessary, whether participants would be
prepared to absorb the additional costs of mechanisms to assure that use of the unwind procedures on the same day that
any DTC participant failed to settle would not deplete DTC's liquidity resources. DTC received ten comment letters
from participants and two from industry organizations.
 Generally, the comments supported the use of unwind procedures as a way to replicate the risks taken by parties to transactions
in the physical MMI market (

i.e., 

to place the risk and burden of default on the appropriate party, which is on the issuer or the purchaser instead of on
the issuing and paying agent). The comments also generally supported the interim solution of obtaining an additional,
dedicated line of credit and allocating its cost to SDFS system participants.





Two of DTC's bank participants did not support DTC's proposals and offered alternative solutions. One of these two
commentators argued that issuing and paying agents should fund presentments earlier or that unwind procedures should
be employed earlier in the day.
 The other commentator suggested that DTC should create a system similar to the procedures employed by the Clearing
House Interbank Payment System.







DTC has agreed to implement the dedicated line of credit as an interim solution and proceed with the necessary modifications
to implement the system enhancements. DTC also has agreed to continue to employ its liquidity monitoring system which
simulates double default scenarios every fifteen minutes beginning at 2 p.m. E.S.T.

DTC will begin the expansion of its MMI programs with the institutional CDs programs. DTC will begin the pilot program
with four bank issuers and will expand the pilot program over the net two months. Until DTC secures the additional $500
million line of credit, the pilot program will be limited to: (1) 120 CD programs, (2) A value not to exceed $20 billion
on deposit with DTC, (3) A percentage of the total CD market on deposit at DTC not to exceed 5.7%, and (4) A daily average
face amount of CD issuances not to exceed $1 billion.
 DTC has agreed that if prior to securing the $500 million line of credit the addition of CDs according to the schedule
increases simulated breaches of its liquidity resources (currently $760 million), DTC will slow down or stop the
addition of CD programs after consultation with the regulators. DTC also has agreed that if subsequent to attaining
the additional line of credit, simulations show breaches of DTC's new overall liquidity resources, due to the expansion
of the MMI program to include different types of MMI instruments, DTC again will slow down or stop expansion of the program
after consultation with the regulators.







The Commission believes that the additional risk management controls to be implemented with the new and enhanced
MMI programs in conjunction with the current SDFS system risk management controls should help further reduce the
possibility that a double default scenario will exceed DTC's liquidity resources. In addition, the Commission believes
the controlled expansion of the SDFS program to include additional types of MMIs will reduce the costs, inefficiencies,
and risks associated with the clearance and settlement of physically transferred securities by providing the benefits
of centralized, automated, book-entry clearance and settlement.



III. Conclusion



On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements
of the Act and in particular with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder.



It is therefore ordered,

 pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-DTC-93-12) be, and hereby is, approved on a temporary
basis until April 30, 1995.






For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>IDS Life Insurance Company of New York, et al.</DOCTITLE>



April 25, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for an Order under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``1940 Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

IDS Life Insurance Company of New York (``IDS Life of New York''), IDS Life of New York Accounts 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11 (``Variable
Accounts''), and IDS Financial Services Inc.




RELVANT 1940 ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under section 6(c) of the 1940 Act granting exemptions from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) thereof.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order to permit the deduction of a mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Variable
Accounts under a group, fixed/variable annuity contract and related certificates to be issued in connection with
retirement plans.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations



1. IDS Life of New York is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of New York and is a wholly owned subsidiary
of IDS Life Insurance Company (``IDS Life'') of Minneapolis, Minnesota. IDS Life is a wholly owned subsidiary of IDS
Financial Corporation, which, in turn, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the American Express Company. IDS Financial
Services Inc. is the principal underwriter of the Variable Accounts and also is a subsidiary of IDS Financial Corporation.


2. Variable Accounts 4, 5, and 6 were established on November 12, 1981. Variable Account 9 was established on February
12, 1986. Variable Accounts 10 and 11 were established on October 8, 1991. All Variable Accounts were established
as separate accounts under New York law to fund variable annuity contracts issued by IDS Life of New York. The Variable
Accounts are registered together as a single unit investment trust under the 1940 Act.

3. IDS Life of New York proposes to issue and distribute a group deferred annuity contract (``Contract'') that is designed
primarily to fund retirement plans. The owners of the group Contracts are the employers or other organizations that
sponsor the plans. Participation in the Contract will be accounted for separately by the issuance of certificates
showing the participants' interests under the Contract. Purchase payments may be accumulated before retirement
on a variable and/or fixed basis, and annuity payments will be received after retirement on a variable and/or fixed
basis. A registration statement on Form N-4 has been filed with the Commission in connection with the Contracts.

4. The Contracts provide for allocation of purchase payments to the Variable Accounts or to a fixed account of IDS Life
of New York. The Variable Accounts, in turn, will invest solely in the shares of the IDS Life Retirement Annuity Mutual
Funds (``Funds''). The Funds are registered with the Commission as diversified open-end management investment
companies.

5. The Contracts and related certificates provide for certain charges. IDS Life of New York will make a charge against
the certificate value for any premium taxes to the extent the taxes are payable.

6. IDS Life of New York will deduct an annual administrative charge of $30 from the value of each certificate. This annual
administrative charge can not be increased and does not apply after retirement payments begin. The administrative
charge represents reimbursement for only the actual administrative costs expected to be incurred over the life of
the certificates.

7. No sales charge is collected or deducted at the time purchase payments are applied under the Contracts and related
certificates. A contingent deferred sales charge (``surrender charge'') will be assessed on certain full or partial
surrenders. A surrender charge applies if all or part of the certificate value is withdrawn within the first eleven
certificate years. The surrender charge is 8 percent of the amount surrendered in the first through fourth certificate
years, and then declines by 1 percent from 7 percent in the fifth certificate year to 1 percent in the eleventh certificate
year. In no event will the aggregate surrender charges exceed 8.5 percent of purchase payments made to a certificate.
The surrender charge can not be increased during the life of the Contracts and related certificates.

<DOCNO> FR940503-2-00132 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940503-2-00086 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

8. There is no surrender charge on amounts surrendered: After the eleventh certificate year, due to a participant's
retirement under the plan on or after age 55; due to the death of the participant; or upon settlement of the certificate
under an annuity payment plan.

9. IDS Life of New York will assess the Variable Accounts of a daily mortality and expense risk charge equal to 1 percent
of the average daily net assets of the Variable Accounts on an annual basis. IDS Life of New York estimates that two-thirds
of this charge is for assumption of the mortality risk and one-third is for the assumption of the expense risk. This
charge cannot be increased during the life of the Contracts and does not apply after retirement payments begin.

10. IDS Life of New York will assume certain mortality and expense risks under the contracts. IDS Life of New York assumes
certain mortality risks by its contractual obligation to continue to make retirement payments for the entire life
of the annuitant under annuity obligations involving life contingencies. This obligation assures each annuitant
that neither the annuitant's own longevity nor an improvement in life expectancy generally will have an adverse effect
on the retirement payments received under the Contracts and related certificates. This assurance relieves the annuitant
from the risk of outliving the amounts accumulated for retirement. The payment option tables contained in the Contracts
are based on the 1983 Individual Annuity Mortality Table. The use of these tables is guaranteed for the life of the Contracts
and related certificates.

11. IDS Life of New York assumes additional mortality and certain expense risks under the Contracts and certificates
by its contractual obligation to pay a death benefit in a lump sum (or in the form of an annuity payment plan) upon the
death of a participant prior to the retirement date.

12. IDS Life of New York assumes an expense risk because the administrative charge may be insufficient to cover administrative
expenses. These include the costs and expenses of processing purchase payments, retirement payments, surrenders,
and transfers; furnishing confirmation notices and periodic reports; calculating mortality and expense risk charges;
preparing voting materials and tax reports; updating registration statements; and actuarial and other expenses.

13. If the administrative charge and the mortality and expense risk charge are insufficient to cover the costs and
expenses assumed, the loss will be borne by IDS Life of New York. Conversely, if the amount deducted proves more than
sufficient, the excess will represent a profit to IDS Life of New York. As noted above, IDS Life of New York does not expect
to profit from the administrative charge. However, IDS Life of New York does expect to profit from the mortality and
expense risk charge. Any profit realized from this charge would be available to IDS Life of New York for, among other
things, payment of distribution expenses.



Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions



1. Section 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor
or underwriter thereof from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments (except
such amounts as are deducted for sales loads) are deposited with a trustee or custodian having the qualifications
prescribed by section 26(a)(1) of the 1940 Act and held under an agreement that provides that no payment to the depositor
or principal underwriter shall be allowed except as a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission
may prescribe, for bookkeeping and other administrative services.

2. Applicants request an exemption from sections 26(a)(2)(c) and 27(c)(2) to the extent necessary to permit the issuance
and sale of the Contracts and related certificates providing for the 1 percent mortality and expense risk charge.
Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, in pertinent part, provides that the Commission, by order upon application, may conditionally
or unconditionally exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities,
or transactions, from any provisions of the 1940 Act to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the Act. Applicants state that, for the following reasons, their exemptive requests meet the standards
set out in section 6(c) and, therefore, an order should be granted.

3. Applicants represent that the level of the mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice
for comparable variable annuity products. IDS Life of New York has reviewed publicly available information about
other annuity products, taking into consideration such factors as current charge levels, charge guarantees, sales
loads, surrender charges, availability of funds, investment options avaiable under annuity contracts, market
sector and the availability of retirement plans. IDS Life of New York represents that it will maintain at its principal
office, and make available upon request of the Commission or its staff, a memorandum setting forth its analysis, including
its methodology and results.

4. Applicants acknowledge that the surrender charge described above may be insufficient to cover all costs relating
to the distribution of the Contracts and certificates and that, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense
risk charge, all or a portion of such profit may be offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the contingent
deferred sales charge. In such circumstances, a portion of the mortality and expense risk charge might be viewed as
providing for a portion of the distribution costs of the Contracts and related certificates.

5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, IDS Life of New York has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the
proposed distribution financing arrangements made with respect to the Contracts will benefit the Variable Accounts
and investors in the Contracts and related certificates. The basis for such conclusion is set forth in a memorandum
that will be maintained by IDS Life of New York at its principal office and will be available to the Commission or its
staff on request.

6. IDS Life of New York represents that the Variable Accounts will invest only in an underlying mutual fund that, in
the event the fund should adopt any plan under Rule 12b-1 to finance distribution expenses, would have such a
plan formulated and approved by a board of directors, a majority of the members of which are not interested persons
of such fund within the meaning of section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act.



Conclusion



For the reasons set forth above, Applicants represent that the exemptions requested are necessary or appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the Act.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of establishment of FAR/JAR Harmonization Working Group for Helicopters.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is given of the establishment of a FAR/JAR Harmonization Working Group for Helicopters for the FAA Aviation
Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC). This notice informs the public of the activities of the ARAC on noise certification
issues.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) establishment an Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) (56
FR 2190, January 22, 1991; and 58 FR 9230, February 19, 1993). One area of the ARAC deals with noise certification issues.
These issues involve the harmonization of part 36 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 36) with Joint Aviation
Requirements (JAR) part 36, their associated guidance material including equivalent procedures, and the interpretation
of the regulations. The FAR/JAR Harmonization Working Group for Helicopters will forward recommendations to the
ARAC, which will determine whether to forward them to the FAA.


Specifically, the FAR/JAR Harmonization Working Group for Helicopters is charged with reviewing the applicable
provisions of subparts A and H, and appendices H and J of the 14 CFR part 36 and harmonizing them with the corresponding
applicable provisions of JAR 36.
ARAC should consider the current international standards and recommended practices, as issued under the International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Annex 16, Volume 1, and its associated Technical Manual, as the basis for development
of these harmonization proposals. ARAC should also consider recommending a process whereby subsequent ICAO Annex
16 changes are properly incorporated into JAR and FAR 36.
If the ARAC determines that a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), an Advisory Circular (AC), or both would be appropriated,
those documents are to be submitted, in the format prescribed, to the FAA. The Working Group should make recommendations
to the ARAC in the following manner.


Reports


(a) Recommend a work plan for completion of the task and subtasks, including the rationale supporting the plan, for
consideration at the meeting of the ARAC to consider noise certification issues held following publication of this
notice;
(b) Giver a detailed conceptual presentation on the proposed recommendation to the ARAC before proceeding with the
work stated in item (c) below;
(c) If considered appropriate, develop NPRM(s) proposing the revised rules for aircraft noise certification, a
supporting economic and other required analysis, advisory and guidance material, and any other collateral documents
the Working Group determines to be needed. Present these recommendations to the ARAC for further consideration and
disposition; and 
(d) Give a status report on the task at each meeting of the ARAC held to consider noise certification issues.
The FAR/JAR Harmonization Working Group for Helicopters will be comprised of experts from those organizations having
an interest in the tasks assigned. A working Group member need not necessarily be a respective of one of the organizations
of the ARAC. Individuals who have expertise in the subject matter and wish to become a member of the Working Group should
write the person listed under the caption, 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

, expressing that desire, describing their interest in the task, and the expertise they would bring to the working
group. The request will be reviewed by the ARAC Assistant Chair for Noise Certification and the Chair of the Working
Group, and the individual will be advised if the request can be granted. 
The Secretary of Transportation has determined that the formation and use of the ARAC are necessary and in the public
interest, in connection with the performance of duties of the FAA. Meetings of the ARAC to consider noise certification
issues will be open to the public, except as authorized by section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Meetings
of the FAR/JAR Harmonization Working Group for Helicopters will not be open to the public, except to the extent that
individuals with an interest and expertise are selected to participate. No public announcement of Working Group
meetings will be made.

Notice of alteration of Privacy Act System of Records.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Treasury Department gives notice of proposed alteration to the system of records entitled Public Transportation
Incentive Program Records_Treasury/DO .203, which is subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended by the Computer
Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988. The system notice was last published in its entirety on September 21,
1992, at 57 FR 43485.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The purpose of the alteration is to bring the existing Privacy Act notice into compliance with the requirements of
the Privacy Act, as amended. The alteration increases the number of locations at which records of the public transportation

ACTION: 

Notice_request for proposals.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Prospective grantee will provide approximately twelve research fellowships for scholars from Eastern Europe and
the Newly Independent States (NIS) to pursue research in American studies in U.S. universities and research institutions
in the academic year 1995-1996. Participants should be teaching at the university level in humanities and social
science fields of American studies, broadly defined, such as American history, law, demography, literature, sociology,
or political science. Grantee is responsible for publicizing the program abroad, selecting the participants, and
placing them in appropriate U.S. institutions. Grantee is also responsible for all administrative arrangements,
for program evaluation, and for establishing procedures for follow-up after participants return to their home institutions.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character, and should
be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life.



Overview



The program seeks to increase the quality and amount of teaching in Eastern European and NIS countries about the United
States through guided curricular research. The program will provide fellowships for approximately twelve qualified
Eastern European and NIS scholars to update and enhance their knowledge of their American studies fields. 



Guidelines



The program is designed for Eastern European and NIS scholars who are teaching at the university level in humanities
and social science fields of American studies, broadly defined, such as American history, law, demography, literature,
sociology, or political science. Participants should be chosen through a public, open competition which includes
U.S. professional peer review for the final selection of participants. Selections should be made and announced in
reasonable time for applicants to make plans for absence from their countries and to undertake departure formalities.
USIA (E/AAS) and all posts in countries from which scholars are selected should be informed of the final selection.
Proposals should demonstrate extensive contacts with and knowledge of Eastern European and NIS universities to
ensure that the best possible candidates are recruited and selected. 

Fellowships should be six to twelve months in duration. Family members may accompany recipients for part of the grant
period, but not for a period exceeding six months. The fellowships provide for all costs of the recipients and accompanying
dependents, with due account being taken of any continuing university salary transferable into U.S. dollars that
recipients might be receiving.

Grantee will arrange appropriate placement in U.S. universities and research institutions for participants. To
the extent possible, waivers of tuition fees should be procured.

Grantee will make all administrative arrangements, including travel, visa, disbursement of grant funds, insurance
and related matters. The grantee should maintain contact with the participants and liaison with university hosts
during the course of the grant to offer assistance with participant administrative concerns such as housing, travel
within the U.S., or emergency matters. Grantee will develop evaluation instruments and procedures to determine
the participants' scholarly activity during the course of the grant, the adequacy of the stipend, and the adequacy
of grantee and university administrative arrangements. Participants should also report on their general impressions
of the U.S. and how they intend to apply the materials or new information gained during the fellowship in their professional
work in their own countries. The grantee will establish procedures for follow-up communication with grantees to
ascertain the application of their fellowship activity to their professional responsibilities, such as new publications,
workshop leadership, new positions, or new course offerings stemming from their fellowship experience.

<DOCTITLE>Public and Private Nonprofit Organizations in Support of International Educational and Cultural Activities: Exchange
Programs To Promote the Strengthening of the Rule of Law in Africa Through Judicial and Public Defender Training</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

United States Information Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice_Request for proposals.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Citizen Exchange (E/P) of the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs announces a competitive grants
program for nonprofit organizations to develop initiative grant projects on the theme of rule of law for audiences
in selected African countries. Two separate projects are detailed below for judicial training and public defender
training. USIA is particularly seeking projects linking American legal institutions and specialists with partners
in Africa. Interested organizations are welcome to submit proposals for one or both projects; if submitting for both,
each project should have a separate proposal.




BACKGROUND:

 Many African countries are striving to create and institutionalize more democratic polities by establishing multi-party
systems, writing new constitutions, holding free elections, creating new legal systems and making a variety of political
and economic reforms. The highest priority of U.S. Missions in Africa is supporting democratization, of which one
crucial aspect is the growth of strong legal systems and legal institutions firmly committed to the rule of law.



The two projects described in this announcement are intended to engage American legal professionals, particularly
judges, public defenders and training institutions, in working with African counterparts to enhance the professionalism
and efficiency of the judiciary and to create or greatly expand public defender and legal aid services in the target
countries. The projects should also promote long-term linkages between American and African institutions.

Interested applicants are urged to read the complete 

Federal Register

 announcement before addressing inquiries to the Office or submitting their proposals. After the RFP deadline, the
Office of Citizen Exchanges may not discuss this competition in any way with applicants until the final decisions
are made.




ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER:

 This Announcement number is E/P-24-29. Please refer to the title given above and this number in all correspondence
or telephone calls to USIA.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



African Judicial Training Exchange



USIA will accept proposals designed to develop a two-way exchange program to support independent judiciaries and
enhance the performance of judges and the administrative capacity of court systems in Malawi, Zambia, Tanzania,
and Uganda. The project should encourage long-term relationships between African judicial systems and U.S. counterparts.
USIA will consider providing funding up to approximately $250,000 of which at least $30,000 must be devoted to developing
or purchasing specialized support materials for participating African institutions. For technical information,
interested organizations may contact E/P Program Specialist Charlotte Peterson at (202) 619-5319.

Project Themes and Objectives


1. Introduce African judges to the American legal system and the principles upon which it is based, particularly the
rule of law and the independence of the judiciary;
2. Provide a formal training component for the dual purpose of benefiting the individual visiting judges and enabling
them to develop improved in-service training programs for colleagues in their home countries;
3. Discuss constitutional issues including due process, rules of evidence, equal protection and criminal procedure;
4. Demonstrate various U.S. models for enhancing judicial efficiency, including caseload management and trial
conduct techniques and alternative dispute resolution;
5. Promote long-term linkages between African and U.S. court systems to foster dialogue on issues of common concern
and to enhance the institutional capabilities of the African judiciaries;
6. Develop and/or purchase specialized support materials for participating institutions in each of the target countries.
Such materials might include but are not limited to legal reference and research books, training videos, textbooks
or other instructional materials. Grant monies of $30,000 must be used for this purpose.


Participants


The African participants will be judges selected through coordination among U.S. Information Service personnel
in the target countries, USIA, and the African partner institutions. All participants must have strong English-language
skills.
The U.S. consultants who will travel to Africa will be selected by the grantee institution in consultation with USIA.
The grantee should provide the names of American participants and brief, relevant biographical data. American participants
should be selected on the basis of their experience and expertise in the thematic field. Experience in communicating
to foreign audiences and general knowledge of Africa and of the countries involved in the project are highly desirable.


Recommended Program Structure


The following suggestions should not serve as a blueprint, but as a stimulus for the development of an original program
design.


Phase One: 

The program could begin with a 3-4 week U.S. study tour for a group of approximately 10-12 judges representing
the target countries. The study tour should allow the African jurists to visit several locations in the U.S. and should
include cultural activities as well as the following professional components:



_A series of field visits to familiarize the visiting jurists with the operations of courts and other legal institutions
such as bar associations, law schools, and legal training organizations;
_An intensive visit of several days duration to a state court system which is of a scale similar to the national courts
of the target countries;
_Formal judicial training to address the program themes in both the constitutional and court administration areas;
_A concluding session to evaluate the study tour, make plans for the follow-up visit of American specialists to Africa,
and discuss needs for the specialized support materials to be provided with grant funds.





Phase Two: 

One or more American judges, judicial training specialists and/or experienced court administrators would visit
each of the target countries for consultations, workshops or other activities with local counterparts. Ideally,
the Americans would work closely with Africans who participated in Phase One to build on that earlier phase. For example,
they might collaborate to train and to plan professional development programs for many others. One approach might
be for the Americans and their Phase One African partners to conduct week-long workshops for 10-20 African judges
on selected constitutional or court management issues; another approach might be to convene 10-20 African
judges to begin designing a country-specific professional development program of coursework and practical experience
and technical progress. In planning these follow-up activities, the grantee should work closely with the African
participants in the U.S. study tour and with U.S. Information Service personnel in Africa to ensure that the activities
are tailored to meet the needs of the African countries.

Phase Three: 

With careful planning and cost sharing, there may be enough money to conduct a third phase, in either the U.S. or Africa,
which would extend the work of the first two phases.



African Public Defender and Legal Aid Training Exchange



USIA will accept proposals for a two-way exchange project to foster the development of public defender and legal aid
services in Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia, and to promote linkages between legal professionals in the U.S.
and these countries for this purpose. USIA will consider providing funding up to approximately $200,000, of which
$10,000 must be devoted to developing or purchasing specialized support materials for participating African institutions.
For technical information, interested organizations may contact E/P Program Specialist Charlotte Peterson at
(202) 619-5319.



Project Objectives



1. Introduce African participants to the U.S. legal system and the principles on which it is founded, particularly
the rule of law and the power of courts to overrule actions of the Executive and Legislative branches, and compare the
U.S. legal system with those of the target countries;

2. Examine the organizational structure and administrative operation of public defender and legal aid organizations
in the U.S., and explore how U.S. models might be adapted for use in the target countries;

3. Explore techniques of alternative dispute resolution and sentencing alternatives such as probation and community
service;

4. Provide a formal training component for the dual purpose of benefiting the individual visiting public defenders
and legal aid attorneys, and of enabling them to develop or enhance training programs for colleagues in their home
countries;

5. Discuss the primary constitutional issues affecting criminal cases, including due process, equal protection,
rules of evidence, and criminal procedure;

6. Explore strategies and modalities for challenging governmental actions, including test cases and class action
lawsuits;

7. Promote long-term linkages between African public defenders and legal aid organizations and their counterparts
in the U.S. in order to foster dialogue on issues of common concern and to enhance the institutional capabilities of
the African organizations;

8. Develop and/or purchase specialized support materials for participating institutions in each of the target countries.
Such materials might include but are not limited to legal reference and research books, training videos, textbooks
or other instructional materials. Grant monies of $10,000 must be used for this purpose.



Participants



The African participants will be attorneys active in public defense work and/or legal aid in their countries, or seeking
to establish such services. Participants will be nominated through coordination among U.S. Information Service
personnel in the target countries, USIA, and the African partner institutions. All participants must have strong
English-language skills.

The U.S. consultants who will travel to Africa will be selected by the grantee institution in consultation with USIA.
The grantee should provide the names of American participants and brief, relevant biographical data. American participants
should be selected on the basis of their experience and expertise in the thematic field. Experience in communicating
to foreign audiences and general knowledge of Africa and of the countries involved in the project are highly desirable.



Program Structure



The following suggestions should not serve as a blueprint, but as a stimulus for the development of an original program
design.



Phase One: 

The program could begin with a 3-4 week U.S. study tour for approximately 12 attorneys representing public defense
and legal aid services in the target countries. The study tour should allow the African lawyers to visit several regions
of the U.S. and should include cultural activities as well as the following professional components:




_An initial orientation to the U.S. legal system and the constitution on which it is founded;

_A series of field visits to familiarize the visiting lawyers with the operations of courts and other legal institutions
such as bar associations, law schools, and legal training facilities;

_Field visits and consultations with NGOs wholly or partly dedicated to legal aid, including organizations focused
on civil rights, consumer protection and public interest issues such as the environment;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940503-2-00147 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940503-2-00096 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

_Intensive visits of several days duration to public defender or legal aid organizations representing at least two
different organizational approaches to provision of legal services. Participants might be divided into two or more
small groups for this portion of the program. For example, those focused on criminal defense might spend a few days
with a large-city public defender's office and then travel to a smaller community which provides public defenders
through a system of appointing private-practice attorneys. Those participants interested primarily in legal aid
in civil cases might visit a single city to observe the various organizations providing legal aid such as legal aid
societies, NGOs devoted to civil rights or public interest practice, and law school clinical programs;
_Formal training in such areas as trial advocacy skills, for the benefit of the visiting attorneys and to demonstrate
training techniques they might establish for colleagues in their home countries;
_A concluding session to evaluate the study tour, make plans for the follow-up visit of American specialists to Africa,
develop a framework for institutional linkages between African public defender/legal aid organizations and American
counterpart institutions, and discuss needs for the specialized support materials to be provided with grant funds.





Phase Two: 

One or more American attorneys specializing in criminal defense or legal aid services would visit each of the target
countries for consultations, workshops or other activities with local counterparts. In planning these follow-up
activities, the grantee should work closely with the African participants in the U.S. study tour and with U.S. Information
Service personnel in Africa to ensure that the activities are tailored to meet the needs of the African countries.
Ideally, the Americans and their African partners would use this phase to involve many more African lawyers and to
design or launch projects which continue after this phase.


Additional Guidelines and Restrictions


USIA is interested in supporting programs which will lay the groundwork for new and continuing relationships between
American and African legal institutions. Proposals which are overly ambitious and those which are very general will
not be competitive. Therefore, institutions should provide strong evidence of their ability to accomplish a few
tasks exceptionally well.
Bureau grants are not given to support projects whose focus is limited to technical issues, or for research projects,
developing publications for dissemination in the United States, individual student exchanges, film festivals,
or exhibits. Neither does the Office of Citizen Exchanges provide scholarships or support for long-term (a semester
or more) academic studies. Competitions sponsored by other Bureau offices are also announced in the 

Federal Register

 and may have different application requirements as well as different objectives.


Programmatic Considerations


Pursuant to the legislation authorizing the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, programs must maintain
a nonpolitical character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social
and cultural life.
USIA will give priority to proposals from U.S. organizations with relevant institutional contacts in the countries
involved in the projects described above. Partner institutions are encouraged to provide cost-sharing or significant
in-kind contributions such as local housing and transportation, interpreting, translating and other local currency
costs. These institutions are also encouraged to assist with the organization of various program activities.
The grantee will be responsible for most arrangements associated with this program. These include selecting speakers,
themes, and topics for discussion; organizing a coherent progression of activities; making all arrangements associated
with the African follow-up portion of the program; providing international and domestic travel arrangements for
all participants; making lodging and local transportation arrangements for visitors; orienting and debriefing
participants; preparing any necessary support materials; and working with host institutions and individuals to
achieve maximum program effectiveness.
At the start of the U.S. portion of a program, the grantee should conduct an orientation session for the visiting delegation
which addresses substantive details of the program as well as geographic, historical, and cross-cultural factors
which they should consider to enhance program success.
At the conclusion of each phase, the grantee institution will conduct participant evaluations and submit to E/P a
progress report. Upon conclusion of the program the grantee will be required to submit a report to E/P summarizing
results of the entire program including project outcomes, anticipated follow-on activities, and any resulting
institutional linkages.
Program monitoring and oversight will be provided by appropriate USIA elements. Per Diem support from host institutions
during an internship component is strongly encouraged. However, for all programs which include internships, a nonprofit
grantee institution which receives funds from corporate or other cosponsors should then use those monies to provide
food, lodging, and pocket money for the participants. In no case could the intern receive a wage or be hired by the sponsoring
institution. Internships should also have an American studies/values orientation component at the beginning of
the exchange program in the U.S. Grantee institutions should try to maximize cost-sharing in all facets of their program
design, and to stimulate U.S. private sector (foundation and corporate) support.
USIS officers in participating countries will facilitate the issuance of visas and other program-related materials.

Funding 



Organizations with less than four years of successful experience in managing international exchange programs are
limited to $60,000. 

Competition for USIA funding support is keen. The final selection of a grantee institution will depend on assessment
of proposals according to the review criteria delineated below. 

While applicants must provide an all-inclusive budget with the proposal, they are also encouraged to include separate
sub-budgets for each program component, phase, location or activity. 

The recipient's proposal shall include the cost of an audit that: 
(1) Complies with the requirements of OMB Circular No. A-133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and
Other Nonprofit Institutions; 
(2) Complies with the requirements of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position
(SOP) No. 92-9; and 
(3) Includes review by the recipient's independent auditor of a recipient-prepared supplemental schedule of indirect
cost rate computation, if such a rate is being proposed. 

The audit costs shall be identified separately for: 

(1) Preparation of basic financial statements and other accounting services; and 
(2) Preparation of the supplemental reports and schedules required by OMB Circular No. A-133, AICPA SOP 92-9,
and the review of the supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation. 

USIA will consider funding the following project costs: 
1. International and domestic air fares; visas; transit costs (e.g., airport taxes); ground transportation costs.

2. 

Per diem: 

For the U.S. program, organizations have the option of using a flat $140/day for international participants or the
published Federal Travel Regulations per diem rates for individual American cities. NOTE: U.S. escorting staff
must use the published federal per diem rates, not the flat rate. For activities overseas, the Standard Government
Travel Regulations per diem rates must be used. 
3. 

Book and cultural allowance: 

Participants are entitled to a one-time cultural allowance of $150 per person, plus a book allowance of $50. Escorts
are reimbursed for actual cultural expenses up to $150. U.S. staff do not get these benefits. 
4.

 
Consultants: 

May be used to provide specialized expertise or to make presentations. Honoraria generally do not exceed $250 per
day. Subcontracting organizations may also be used, in which case the written contract(s) must be included in the
proposal. 
5. 

Room rental: 

generally should not exceed $250 per day. 
6. 

Materials development: 

Proposals may contain costs to purchase, develop and translate materials for participants, in addition to the specialized
support materials to be provided to African institutions. USIA reserves the rights to these materials for future
use. 

7. 

One working meal per project: 

Per capita cost may not exceed $5-8 per lunch and $14-20 per dinner, excluding room rental. The number of
invited guests may not exceed the number of participants by more than a factor of two to one. 
8.

 Return travel allowance: 

$70 for each participant which is to be used for incidental expenditures incurred during international travel. 
9. Other costs necessary for the effective administration of the program, including salaries for grant organization
employees, benefits, and other direct and indirect costs per detailed instructions in the application package.

E/P encourages cost-sharing, which may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. E/P would be especially
interested in proposals which demonstrate a program vision which goes well beyond that which can be supported by the
requested USIA grant and which would try to use a USIA grant to leverage additional funding from other sources to support
elements of the broader program plan. 

The Recipient must maintain written records to support all allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution
to cost participation, as well as costs to be paid by the Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. The
basis for determining the value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular A-110,
Attachment E., ``Cost-sharing and Matching,'' and should be described in the proposal. In the event the Recipient
does not meet the minimum amount of cost-sharing as stipulated in the Recipient's budget, the Agency's contribution
will be reduced in proportion to the Recipient's contribution. 


Please note: 

All delegates will be covered under the terms of a USIA-sponsored health insurance policy. The premium is paid by USIA
directly to the insurance company.

Application Requirements




Proposals must be structured in accordance with the instructions contained in the Application Package. Confirmation
letters from U.S. and foreign co-sponsors noting their intention to participate in the program will enhance a proposal.



Review Process



USIA will acknowledge receipt of all proposals and will review them for technical eligibility. Proposals will be
deemed ineligible if they do not fully adhere to the guidelines established herein and in the Application Package.


Eligible proposals will be forwarded to panels of USIA officers for advisory review. All eligible proposals will
be reviewed by the appropriate geographic area offices and the budget and contract offices. Proposals may also be
reviewed by the Office of General Counsel or other Agency offices. Funding decisions are at the discretion of the Associate
Director for Educational and Cultural Affairs.


Final technical authority for grant awards resides with USIA's contracting officer. The award of any grant is subject
to availability of funds.

The U.S. Government reserves the right to reject any or all applications received. USIA will not pay for design and
development costs associated with submitting a proposal. Applications are submitted at the risk of the applicant;
should circumstances prevent award of a grant, all preparation and submission costs are at the applicant's expense.
USIA will not award funds for activities conducted prior to the actual grant award.



Review Criteria



USIA will consider proposals based on the following criteria:

1. 

Quality of program idea:

 Proposals should exhibit originality, substance, rigor, and relevance to the Agency mission. They should demonstrate
the matching of U.S. resources to a clearly defined need.

2. 

Institutional reputation and ability:

 Applicant institutions should demonstrate their potential for excellence in program design and implementation
and/or provide documentation of successful programs. If an applicant is a previous USIA grant recipient, responsible
fiscal management and full compliance with all reporting requirements for past Agency grants as determined by USIA's
Office of Contracts (M/KG) will be considered. Relevant substantive evaluations of previous projects may also be
considered in this assessment.


3. 

Project personnel:

 The thematic and logistical expertise of project personnel should be relevant to the proposed program. Resumes or
C.V.s should be relevant to the specific proposal and no longer than two pages each.

4. 

Program planning:

 A detailed agenda and relevant work plan should demonstrate substantive rigor and logistical capacity.

5. 

Thematic expertise:

 Proposal should demonstrate the organization's expertise in the subject area which promises an effective sharing
of information.

6. 

Cross-cultural sensitivity and area expertise:

 Evidence should be provided of sensitivity to historical, linguistic, religious, and other cross-cultural factors,
as well as relevant knowledge of the target geographic area/country.

7. 

Ability to achieve program objectives:

 Objectives should be realistic and feasible. The proposal should clearly demonstrate how the grantee institution
will meet program objectives.


8. 

Multiplier effect:

 Proposed programs should strengthen long-term mutual understanding and contribute to maximum sharing of information
and establishment of long-term institutional and individual ties.

9. 

Cost-effectiveness:

 Costs to USIA per exchange participant (American and foreign) should be kept to a minimum, and all items proposed for
USIA funding should be necessary and appropriate to achieve the program's objectives.

10. 

Cost-sharing:

 Proposals should maximize cost-sharing through other private sector support as well as direct funding contributions
and/or in-kind support from the prospective grantee institution and its partners.

11. 

Follow-on activities:

 Proposals should provide a plan for continued exchange activity (without USIA support) which ensures that USIA-supported
programs are not isolated events.

12. 

Project evaluation:

 Proposals should include a plan to evaluate the activity's success. USIA recommends that the proposal include a draft
survey questionnaire or other technique plus description of a methodology to use to link outcomes to original project
objectives. Grantees will be expected to submit intermediate reports after each project component is concluded
or quarterly, whichever is less frequent.



Notice




The terms and conditions published in this RFP are binding and may not be modified by any USIA representative. Explanatory
information provided by the Agency which contradicts published language will not be binding. Issuance of the RFP
does not constitute an award commitment on the part of the U.S. Government. Awards cannot be made until funds have been
fully appropriated by Congress and allocated and committed through internal USIA procedures.



Notification



All applicants will be notified of the results of the review process on or about September 5, 1994. Awarded grants will
be subject to periodic reporting and evaluation requirements.

Direct Grant Programs and Fellowship Programs; Notice

  Vol. 59, No. 84  Tuesday, May 3, 1994  Notices







<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION </USDEPT>



Direct Grant Programs and Fellowship Programs 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of direct grant programs and fellowship programs under which the Secretary is making new awards for fiscal
year 1994.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary updates the list of the Department's direct grant programs and fellowship programs under which the
Secretary is making new awards for fiscal year (FY) 1994 and estimates the deadline dates for the transmittal of applications
for those programs for which application notices have not yet been published. The Secretary also revises the list
of State Single Points of Contact (SPOCs) for programs subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 (Intergovernmental
Review of Federal Programs). The notice is intended to help potential applicants in planning for the remainder of
this fiscal year.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On September 24, 1993, the Secretary published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 50138) the Department's 
annual combined application notice (CAN). That notice listed almost all of the direct grant and fellowship programs
under which the Secretary planned to make new awards in FY 1994 and included the application notices for many of those
programs. The list included some programs for which application notices had not yet been published. 


Since publication of the CAN, additional application notices have been published. In addition, on February 11, 1994,
the Secretary published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 6826) a notice extending application deadline dates for certain programs. The Secretary took this action to
assist potential applicants who may have been adversely affected by severe weather conditions in various parts of
the Nation or by the earthquake in California. Also, since publication of the CAN, some new programs have been added,
and some other programs have been withdrawn or replaced. The Secretary therefore determined that publication of
an update would be useful to the educational community. 

This notice, therefore, lists all FY 1994 programs previously announced in the 

Federal Register

, including those for which the deadline dates have already passed, as well as FY 1994 programs to be announced at a later
date. As is the case with the CAN, this notice is designed to assist potential applicants in planning projects and activities.
However, to expedite publication of this update, the Secretary has decided not to include any individual application
notices. Application notices are published separately in the 

Federal Register

. If additional competitions are carried out in FY 1994 because of events not known at this time, the Secretary will
announce those competitions in future issues of the 

Federal Register

.

As an appendix to the CAN of September 24, 1993, the Secretary published a list of State Single Points of Contact (SPOCs)
for programs subject to Executive Order 12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR part 79. Since publication of that list,
the names or addresses of SPOCs in a few States have changed. Therefore, as an appendix to this update, the Secretary
is publishing a revised listing of SPOCs. 


Organization of Notice 


The chart lists all direct grant programs and certain fellowship programs under which the Secretary is making new
awards in FY 1994. The listings are organized under the following principal program offices of the Department: 
Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Languages Affairs. 
Office of Educational Research and Improvement. 
Office of Elementary and Secondary Education. 
Office of Postsecondary Education. 
Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services. 
Office of Vocational and Adult Education. 
The listing for each principal office includes application notices already published and those to be published at
a later date. The latter are referenced with estimated dates (est.) in columns three and four of the chart. The programs
are listed in order of their Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number irrespective of category. An asterisk
(*) preceding a CFDA number indicates a program announced or listed since publication of the CAN and not included or
referenced in that earlier combined notice. 
The listing for each office contains the following information: 
The CFDA number of each program. 
The name of that program. 
A reference to the application notice; that is, either (1) the publication date of the application notice, with a reference
to the volume and page number of the 

Federal Register

 in which the announcement appeared, or (2) an estimated date for publication of the application notice. 
The deadline date or estimated deadline date for the transmission of applications. 


Programs To Be Announced at a Future Date 


For FY 1994 a number of programs will be governed by new regulations or funding priorities. This notice references
these types of programs with an asterisk following the respective estimated date (est.*) in column three of the chart.
For further information regarding six of these programs, readers are referred to the following notices of proposed
rulemaking and notices of proposed priority that have been published in the 

Federal Register

National Education Goals 


On March 31, 1994, the President signed into law the Goals 2000: Educate America Act (Pub. L. 103-227). The Act
enunciates eight National Education Goals for the year 2000: 


Goal 1:

 All children in America will start school ready to learn. 


Goal 2:

 The high school graduation rate will increase to at least 90 percent. 


Goal 3:

 All students will leave grades 4, 8, and 12 having demonstrated competency in challenging subject matter, including
English, mathematics, science, foreign languages, civics and government, economics, arts, history, and geography;
and every school in America will ensure that all students learn to use their minds well, so they may be prepared for responsible
citizenship, further learning, and productive employment in our Nation's modern economy.

<PARENT> FR940503-2-00100 </PARENT>

Goal 4:

 The Nation's teaching force will have access to programs for the continued improvement of their professional skills
and the opportunity to acquire the knowledge and skills needed to instruct and prepare all American students for the
next century. 


Goal 5:

 United States students will be first in the world in mathematics and science achievement. 


Goal 6:

 Every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy
and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. 


Goal 7:

 Every school in the United States will be free of drugs, violence, and the unauthorized presence of firearms and alcohol
and will offer a disciplined environment conducive to learning. 


Goal 8:

 Every school will promote partnerships 
that will increase parental involvement and participation in promoting the social, emotional, and academic growth
of children. 
For competitions that are still open for FY 1994, the Secretary encourages applicants under these programs to consider
the eight National Education Goals in developing their applications. 


Applicability of Section 5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 


A number of programs listed in the chart provide that a grant, fellowship, traineeship, or other monetary benefit
may be awarded to an individual. This award may be made to the individual either directly by the Department or by a grantee
that receives Federal funds for the purpose of providing, for example, fellowships, traineeships, or other awards
to individuals. 
Section 5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-690; 21 U.S.C. 862) provides that a sentencing court
may deny eligibility for certain Federal benefits to an individual convicted of drug trafficking or possession.
Thus, an individual who applies for a grant, fellowship, or other monetary benefit under a program covered by this
notice should understand that, if convicted of drug trafficking or possession, he or she is subject to denial of eligibility
for that benefit if the sentencing court imposes such a sanction. This denial applies whether the Federal benefit
is provided to the individual directly by the Department or is provided through a grant, fellowship, traineeship,
or other award made available with Federal funds by a grantee. 
Any persons determined to be ineligible for Federal benefits under the provisions of section 5301 are listed in the
General Services Administration's ``Lists of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement or Nonprocurement Programs.''



Applicability of the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act of 1990 


The programs listed in the chart make discretionary awards subject to the eligibility requirements of the Federal
Debt Collection Procedures Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-647; 28 U.S.C. 3201). The Act provides that if there is a judgment
lien against a debtor's property for a debt to the United States, the debtor is not eligible to receive a Federal grant
or loan, except direct payments to which the debtor is entitled as beneficiary, until the judgment is paid in full or
otherwise satisfied.

Appendix 


Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs 


This appendix applies to each program that is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 (Intergovernmental
Review of Federal Programs) and the regulations in 34 CFR part 79. 
The objective of the Executive order is to foster an intergovernmental partnership and to strengthen federalism
by relying on State and local processes for State and local government coordination and review of proposed Federal
financial assistance. 
Applicants must contact the appropriate State Single Point of Contact to find out about, and to comply with, the State's
process under Executive Order 12372. Applicants proposing to perform activities in more than one State should immediately
contact the Single Point of Contact for each of those States and follow the procedure established in each of those States
under the Executive order. A listing containing the Single Point of Contact for each State is included in this appendix.

In States that have not established a process or chosen a program for review, State, areawide, regional, and local
entities may submit comments directly to the Department. 
Any State Process Recommendation and other comments submitted by a State Single Point of Contact and any comments
from State, areawide, regional, and local entities must be mailed or hand-delivered by the date indicated in this
notice to the following address: The Secretary, EO 12372_CFDA

Dwight D. Eisenhower National Program for Mathematics and Science Education_Model Professional Development in
the Use of Technology for Mathematics and Science Instruction; Model Projects in Encouraging Female and Minority
Students in Mathematics and Science; and Model Science-Based Professional Development Projects in Environmental
Education 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of final priorities for fiscal year 1994.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary announces three priorities for fiscal year 1994 under the Dwight D. Eisenhower National Program for
Mathematics and Science Education: model professional development projects in the use of technology for mathematics
and science education, model projects in encouraging female and minority students in mathematics and science, and
model science-based professional development projects in environmental education. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The goal of the Eisenhower National Program is to support projects of national significance in elementary and secondary
schools in mathematics and science education designed to improve the skills of teachers and the quality of instruction
in these areas and to increase the access of all students to that instruction. The program is authorized under Title
II, Part A, Subpart 1, section 2012 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended. 




The Secretary may subsequently conduct an external study or studies of the effectiveness and lessons learned from
projects funded under this program. If he does so, projects will be required to cooperate with the conduct of the study,
by sharing their experiences, project evaluations, and data. 


Regarding priority 1, the Secretary believes that technology can be used to improve instruction and assessment in
mathematics and science and provide all students with greater opportunity to learn in accordance with state content
and student performance standards. The Secretary believes that developments in technology have great promise for
helping to attain National Education Goal Five, that by the Year 2000, United States students will be first in the world
in mathematics and science achievement; however, he sees ample evidence that many teachers are not confident about
using these resources in the classroom. The scope of these projects may include professional development in the use
of technology for assessment of student learning. For purposes of substantiating that two or more schools assisted
under this priority serve underachieving students, the applicant may cite test scores, drop-out rates, Chapter
I eligibility, or similar indices. 


Regarding priority 2, the Secretary is concerned that the Nation's schools encourage too few minority and female
students to study and pursue careers in the fields of mathematics and science. The Secretary believes that the well-documented
underrepresentation of minorities and women in these disciplines represents a waste of human talent that the Nation
can ill afford. This priority will therefore support, and learn from, projects that seek to stimulate and sustain
the interest and attainments of female and minority children in mathematics and science. 


Regarding priority 3, the Secretary believes that environmental education can stimulate students' interest in
scientific fields and enhance their understanding of these disciplines. The Secretary also believes that environmental
issues are important in their own right and are, therefore, eminently worthy of study. The Secretary finds, however,
that environmental education programs of high quality are available in too few of the Nation's schools, in part because
American teachers have very limited opportunities to increase their knowledge of environmental issues and to learn
the most successful means of providing environmental education. The Secretary proposes, therefore, to support
and learn from projects in professional development for teachers in environmental education. 


The Secretary draws to the attention of potential applicants responding to priority 3 the National Consortium for
Environmental Education and Training (NCEET) at the University of Michigan, an undertaking funded by the Environmental
Protection Agency under Section 5 of the National Environmental Education Act of 1990. NCEET's primary emphasis
is professional development for teachers in environmental education. Potential applicants should consult with
NCEET to ensure that their projects are not duplicative of the National Consortium's efforts. 


On November 12, 1993, the Secretary announced in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 60007) a proposed priority for the Eisenhower National Program in model professional development in the use
of technology for mathematics and science instruction. After considering the intent of the Senate Report that accompanied
the Fiscal Year 1994 Department of Education Appropriations Act, the Secretary proposed two additional priorities.
These proposed priorities were announced on February 28, 1994 in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 9610).

Federal Register

. 




Analysis of the Comments and Changes 




In response to the Secretary's invitation in the notices of proposed priorities several parties submitted comments.
An analysis of the comments and of the changes in the priorities since publication of the notices of proposed priorities
follows. 




Notice of Proposed Priority Published on November 12, 1993 






Comment:

 One commenter pointed out that technology projects are hardware intensive. The commenter therefore suggested that
the portion of grant funding available for purchase or lease of appropriate hardware, software, and communications
services or tariffs for use in these projects be greater than is traditionally available in many grants. Another commenter
urged that the Department allow up to 50% of the total Federal portion of the project budget, rather than the 20% stipulated
in the priority, to be used for purchase of items such as hardware. This commenter believed that this change would result
in greater numbers of applications from districts that have relatively few resources for the purchase of technology.





Discussion:

 In this priority the Secretary wishes to emphasize professional development, rather than equipment purchase, and
thus does not wish to reduce the proportion of Federal funds available for inservice education. The Secretary notes
that, in their efforts to obtain additional funds to be used for purchase of hardware, software, and other such items,
applicants should have available the joint resources of the partnerships that are to be formed under this priority.
The Secretary acknowledges, however, that the type of projects to be supported under this priority may require a significant
initial investment in technology-related resources. 



Changes: 

The priority has been revised to state that up to one-third of the total Federal funds approved for year one and up to
15 percent of the Federal funds approved in years two and three may be expended to purchase or lease hardware, software,
and communications services or tariffs. 



Comment: 

One commenter urged that a portion of funds made available through this priority be used for preservice programs,
such as those that would help faculty in schools of education to provide exemplary models of the use of technology in
teaching. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees that preservice programs can play a critical role in preparing teachers to use technology effectively
in the classroom. The current priority, however, was designed for inservice professional development, where ample
need for improvement exists. Given the relatively limited amount of funding available for these priorities, the
Secretary does not wish to dilute the purpose or effectiveness of the priority by broadening it to encompass preservice
programs. The Secretary will, however, examine possible opportunities to support preservice programs in future
technology-related grant priorities. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comment: 

One commenter suggested that partnerships formed to develop and implement project activities include representatives
of the Statewide Systemic Initiative (SSI) program funded by the National Science Foundation. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that, insofar as the SSI program involves professional development, this comment is already
addressed in the priority's requirement that projects coordinate their work with other professional development
efforts in mathematics and science education. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comment: 

One commenter urged that principals be allowed to designate persons knowledgeable in technology to serve in the principal's
stead on the advisory committees that will guide the projects. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary points out that the priority does not preclude participation on the advisory committees by persons
who have been chosen by principals and who are particularly knowledgeable in technology. The Secretary believes
that the presence of a principal himself or herself on an advisory committee represents a personal commitment that
could be vital to the undertaking's success. In addition, in light of the many-faceted professional development
activities envisioned in the priority, the Secretary believes that the advisory committee 

needs the breadth of knowledge and management perspectives that principals can bring. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comment: 

One commenter suggested that the priority require the participation of teachers of English as a second language (ESL)
to enhance the effectiveness of the program in schools serving underachieving students whose native language is
not English. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary notes that the priority allows for inclusion of ESL teachers in project activities. The priority requires
the involvement of two or more schools serving underachieving students and the inclusion of the majority of, if not
all, the mathematics and science teachers in participating schools. ESL teachers who provide instruction in mathematics
and science at project site schools are thus likely to participate in the professional development activities that
are part of the project. In the interest of allowing the greatest amount of flexibility and variety in the projects
that are funded, the Secretary does not wish to add further requirements concerning inclusion of teachers. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comment: 

One commenter suggested that, in addition to requiring integration of academic content and pedagogical components,
the priority should provide a focus on the interdisciplinary nature of mathematics and science education.

<PARENT> FR940503-2-00101 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Discussion: 

The Secretary observes that the priority would not preclude such a focus. The Secretary wishes to allow potential
applicants flexibility to design projects that respond to local and State needs, and thus does not desire to restrict
applicants' choice of emphases. 


Changes: 

None. 


Comment: 

One commenter pointed out that technology provides the teacher with an opportunity to assess each student's learning
on a near-continuous basis, thus enabling the teacher to adjust instruction to fit the needs of both individual learners
and groups of students throughout the course of a learning sequence. Technology can thus maximize the usefulness
of assessment by making it an integral part of learning, the commenter argued. The commenter urged that the priority
be expanded to include attention to the use of technology for student assessment aimed at continuous monitoring and
improvement of learning. 




Discussion: 

The Secretary recognizes that technology can provide improved methods of assessing student progress and thus can
contribute to student learning. The Secretary does not exclude teacher professional development in the use of technology
for student assessment. 


Changes: 

None. 




Notice of Proposed Priorities Published on February 28, 1994






Comment: 

One commenter strongly supported the emphasis on women and minorities, as well as the emphasis on environmental education.
The commenter also suggested adding a priority, or mentioning the possibility of, the development and incorporation
of service learning in projects. 




Discussion: 

The Secretary observes that the priorities would not necessarily preclude such a focus. The Secretary wishes to allow
potential applicants flexibility to design projects that respond to local and State needs, and thus does not desire
to restrict applicants' choice of emphases. 


Changes: 

None. 


Comment: 

Two commenters strongly argued against limiting one priority to environmental education. They felt that it is unnecessary
and unwise to focus limited funding for professional development on a particular field of science. One commenter
stated that most teachers teach more than one science and therefore need reinforcement in more than one field. 




Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that environmental education is one way to stimulate students' interest in scientific fields.
The Secretary also believes that environmental education involves several different scientific fields and will
therefore enhance teachers' ability to teach science generally. 


Changes: 

None. 


Comment: 

One commenter supported the encouragement of women and minorities in mathematics and science. However, the commenter
urged that the priority provide opportunities and funds for selected projects to do controlled studies, with longer
term follow up of their impact. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary requires these projects to evaluate lessons learned about promoting the interest and attainment of
women and minorities in mathematics and science and expects the findings to be widely disseminated. This requirement
does not preclude the use of controlled evaluation studies for these purposes. However, projects funded under this
priority must be ``model'' projects designed themselves to stimulate and sustain the interest and attainments of
females and minority children in mathematics and science. The Secretary will not support projects under this priority
which are solely for the purpose of conducting research and evaluation in this area. 


Changes: 

None. 


Comment: 

One commenter strongly supported programs attracting females and minorities to careers in mathematics and science.
However, referencing the Senate report language cited in the February 28, 1994, Notice of Proposed Priority issued
by the Eisenhower National Program, the commenter questioned the Secretary's intent to fund the priority on environmental
education because it would dilute Congressional intent to respond to the needs of women and minorities in mathematics
and science, and in any event mathematics and science high schools would be teaching environmental education. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary believes the commenter overlooked a provision of the Senate report directing the Department of Education
to support work in environmental education. 


Changes: 

None.

Absolute Priorities




Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) the Secretary proposes to give an absolute preference to applications that meet one of the
following priorities. Each application shall respond to 

only one

 of the three priorities, although an applicant could submit more than one application to respond to more than one priority.
The Secretary funds under this competition only applications that meet one of these absolute priorities: 




Absolute Priority 1_Teacher Professional Development in the Use of Technology for Mathematics and Science Education




The Secretary will support model projects that demonstrate effective ways of strengthening teachers' abilities
to use technology in the classroom for the improvement of teaching and learning in mathematics and science at the elementary
or secondary school levels, or both. 




Required Activities: 

Each project must: 


(a) Form a partnership to develop and implement project activities. Partnerships must include one or more of each
of the following parties: local educational agency or private school(s), State educational agency, institution
of higher education, and private sector party with expertise in technology. Partners must contribute resources
to the operation of the project. Programming must be designed in consultation with professionals who are experts
in the applicable subject matter, educational levels, and technologies to be used in the project. Projects must be
coordinated with other professional development efforts in mathematics and science education, particularly with
the Eisenhower State Grant Program. 


(b) Establish an advisory committee to guide the project. The advisory committee must include representation from
each of the partners to the application, plus principals of project site schools and classroom teachers participating
in the project. 


(c) Involve two or more schools serving underachieving students in the project. 


(d) Involve the majority of, if not all, teachers of mathematics and science in the participating schools in project
activities. Participating teachers must implement the use of technology in their teaching of mathematics and science.



(e) Provide participating teachers with sustained, intensive, high-quality professional development activities
that focus on the use of technology to improve classroom instruction in mathematics and science. Project activities
must reflect relevant research on teaching and learning, as well as the experiences of the partners and participating
teachers. Activities must integrate academic content and pedagogical components, and be delivered largely on-site
(i.e., in schools or districts) for groups of teachers working cooperatively. 


(f) Provide participating teachers with forums for interaction and with access to sources of technical assistance
outside their schools. Projects must require that participating teachers collaborate with each other and that they
participate in electronic networking with other teachers, including teachers participating in other projects
funded under this program, to share experiences and knowledge about how to improve student learning through the use
of technology in instruction. 


Projects may use up to one-third of the total Federal portion of the project budget for year one and no more than 15 percent
in years two and three to purchase or lease appropriate hardware, software, and communications services or tariffs
for use in these projects. In addition, projects must provide, using non-Federal funds, some of the hardware, software,
and other requirements of the technology to be used in these projects. 


(g) Evaluate lessons learned about effective teacher professional development in the use of technology to improve
mathematics and science teaching and learning, and use the information to improve the project on a continuing basis.
Evaluations must address the characteristics of participating teachers and students, the technologies used and
their relative effectiveness, and the effects on teaching and learning of the use of technology in instruction in
mathematics and science. Evaluations must include a mid-course, on-site review by an outside panel, including experts
in the use of technology in instruction and classroom teachers with successful experience in using technology to
improve instruction.

(h) Disseminate lessons learned to other schools participating in the program, and to others such as schools with
similar needs in the project site State, institutions and organizations providing pre-service and in-service teacher
development programs in the project site State, and other interested parties that could benefit from this information.
Dissemination must begin while the project is in progress and use electronic as well as other forms of communication.
Applicants may request Federal funding to support dissemination activities, including travel for dissemination,
in amounts not to exceed 20% of the total Federal portion of the project budget. Projects must participate in meetings
of the Eisenhower Program held annually in Washington, DC. 



Absolute Priority 2_Encouraging Female and Minority Students in Mathematics and Science 



The Secretary will support model projects designed to stimulate and sustain the interest and attainments of female
and minority children in mathematics and science. 

Each project must: (a) Make use of research and the experience of projects that have achieved success in the area of
the priority. 

(b) Collaborate in the planning and operation of the project with the State science teachers' association and/or
the State mathematics teachers' association and with at least one other party such as a school, another educational
institution, a local or state educational agency, a national education organization, a science-technology center,
or private sector parties; and with these other parties, develop plans for continuing project activities after Federal
support has ended. 

(c) Evaluate lessons learned from the project and use them to improve activities on a continuing basis. 

(d) Disseminate lessons learned to interested parties. Dissemination must begin while the project is in progress
and use electronic as well as other forms of communication. 

(e) In the case of projects serving elementary and middle schools, increase teachers' own mastery of mathematics
and science in order to increase their confidence and skill in teaching these subjects (including skills in providing
hands-on learning). 

(f) Involve parents and community members as role models and/or mentors for female and minority children. 



Absolute Priority 3_Science-Based Teacher Professional Development in Environmental Education 



The Secretary will support model science-based professional development projects designed to improve student
achievement in environmental education. 

Each project must: 
(a) Make use of research and the experience of projects that have achieved success in the area of the priority. 

(b) Collaborate in the planning and operation of the project with at least two other parties such as schools, other
educational institutions, local or state educational agencies, national education organizations, science-technology
centers, or private sector parties; with these other parties, develop plans for continuing project activities after
Federal support has ended. 

(c) Use environmental education as a means to enhance students' interest, literacy, and achievement in science.


(d) Increase teachers' own mastery of environmental issues, including related scientific issues. 

(e) Train teachers to develop varied learning experiences for students in environmental education that include
field components and the study of individual themes, such as ecosystems (e.g., wetlands), the water cycle, and global
climate change; and enable teachers to pilot-test these varied learning experiences with students. 

(f) Evaluate lessons learned from the project and use them to improve activities on a continuing basis. 

(g) Disseminate lessons learned to interested parties. Dissemination must begin while the project is in progress
and use electronic as well as other forms of communication.

 Notice of final priority for fiscal years 1994 and 1995.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary announces an absolute priority for fiscal years 1994 and 1995 under the Fund for Innovation in Education
(FIE): Innovation in Education Program to support innovative projects that provide K-12 teachers and other
educators with sustained, high quality professional development opportunities that are aligned with challenging
content and professional standards developed at the national, State or local levels. 
The intent of this priority is to enable school educators, working with appropriate university, community, and business
partners, to create and maintain model learning environments that will help all students in elementary and secondary
schools achieve challenging academic standards in subjects such as English, mathematics, science, history, geography,
civics, foreign languages, economics, and the arts.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 An essential step in achieving our National Education Goals is ensuring that we have high academic expectations for


all

 students and that each student has the opportunity to fulfill those expectations. Current national, State, and local
efforts to define high standards for what students should know and be able to do in the various subject areas provide
a starting point for creating the type of learning opportunities that an education system of excellence must provide
for all members of an increasingly diverse student population. 



In order to provide learning opportunities where more rigorous and complex learning is expected of 

all

 students, teachers will need high-quality, career-long professional development programs. Other educators who
help to create teaching and learning environments that better serve the academic and other needs of students will
need similar high-quality professional development opportunities. Such educators might include school and district
administrators, school and university-based teacher educators, curriculum and supervisory personnel, paraprofessionals/instructional
aides, and members of school boards. To provide effective professional development programs for teachers and other
educators, applicants must ensure that their proposed projects are aligned with high standards for student learning.
Applicants should also consider related standards for teacher effectiveness and for the preparation, credentialling
and continuing development of educators. More specifically, in designing policies and practices for professional
development, applicants are urged to draw on relevant work, as appropriate, from groups such as the National Board
for Professional Teaching Standards, the Interstate New Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium, the National
Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education, and the National Staff Development Council. 

The Secretary recognizes that successful well-articulated programs that provide for continuous improvement of
professional educators from recruitment to retirement will require educators to work together across traditionally
separated roles and organizations. Therefore, projects must be carried out by partnerships. Finally, the design
of professional development efforts must incorporate what is known about developing and managing high-performance
school systems that support educational excellence and equity. 

The Secretary proposes to direct financial assistance to projects that develop new or further develop existing innovative
partnerships of school, university, community, and other entities to establish and maintain high-quality, standards-based
professional development programs for teachers and other educators. The purpose of these partnerships may be to
improve the entire continuum of professional development or to focus on one or more points along that continuum (e.g.,
preservice, induction, inservice). 

In accordance with recommendations in the Senate Report that accompanied the Fiscal Year 1994 Department of Education
Appropriation Act, the Secretary supports development of programs based on existing strategies, such as creating
model professional development schools, or applicants' newly designed strategies. The Secretary also recognizes
the need for professional development efforts, as identified in the Senate Report, that prepare educators for working
with other human service professionals to address non-academic student/family problems (e.g., drugs, violence,
nutrition, unemployment) as well as other conditions that place students at-risk for failure in school. The Secretary
is particularly interested in projects that provide relevant professional development opportunities for educators
who work in urban school communities. 

The Secretary strongly encourages the development of challenging and feasible school-based collaborations that
are based upon appropriate research results and exemplary teaching and professional development practices, as
well as the contributions of expert school, higher education, and community practitioners. Emphases might include
collegial strategies such as in-school mentoring for teachers; school-university teams integrating teacher preparation
and school curriculum to effectively educate at-risk students; teacher sabbaticals to work in model schools; and
practitioner-led inquiry and reform activities.

Analysis of the Comments and Changes 



In response to the Secretary's invitation in the notice of proposed priorities, eight of the eleven parties submitting
comments made recommendations. Three commenters expressed support for the priority without any recommendations
for change. An analysis of the recommendations submitted by eight commenters follows. 



Comments: 

One commenter recommends that the priority require projects to include representatives from State Boards of Education
on the advisory committee since States set the standards and policies that serve as frameworks for professional development.




Discussion: 

The priority requires that the advisory committee include State education officials. This requirement ensures
representation of the State and is broad enough to include State board members. 



Changes: 

None.

Comments: 

Three commenters recommend that the priority use more explicit language to identify the ``other'' potential project
partners. One commenter believes the priority should explicitly identify national organizations or associations
as potential partners or applicants. Another commenter requests the inclusion of non-profit organizations. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary supports extensive collaboration. The priority states that partnerships must be formed that involve
LEAs, IHEs, and others. The examples of other potential partners does not preclude national organizations, associations,
or non-profit entities. 



Changes: 

None.






Comments: 

One commenter requests that the National Staff Development Council (NSDC) be cited as a resource to applicants on
staff development standards in the Supplementary Information section of the priority. This same commenter encouraged
inclusion of the NSDC's Standards for Staff Development under the Required Activities Section of the priority. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary recognizes that many organizations have already developed and recommended, or are in the process of
developing and recommending guidelines and standards for professional development. The NSDC is a national organization
representing a key professional development audience and can appropriately be included as an example in the Supplementary
Information section of the priority. The priority requires that projects consider the applicability of several
types of standards, including those for teacher preparation and continuing development. The Secretary does not
wish to specify particular documents or sources in the text of the priority. 



Changes: 

The National Staff Development Council has been added under the Supplementary Information section of the priority.

 




Comments: 

Two commenters find the examples of possible ways to build upon existing strategies listed in the Supplementary Information
section of the priority either too limiting or not specific enough, e.g., model professional development school,
model school, and teacher sabbaticals. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary used these terms in the Supplementary Information section to give examples of possible strategies
for an applicant. The examples are illustrative only. 



Changes: 

None.

 




Comments: 

One commenter recommends that districts and States be allowed to align professional development with performance
outcomes in order to allow districts to continue to upgrade teacher skills to improve student performance in locally
developed performance outcomes. 



Discussion: 

As stated, the priority allows a project to propose this type of activity. 



Changes: 

None.

 




Comments: 

One commenter recommends that grants up to $1 million be awarded for up to three years. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary expects that a project could receive up to $1 million over a three-year period. 



Changes: 

None. 






Comments: 

One commenter recommends that methodology for teaching 
and understanding the dynamics of at-risk youth be emphasized more. 



Discussion: 

The priority permits projects to address the needs of at-risk youth through this sort of focus. 



Changes: 

None. 






Comments: 

One commenter recommends that the Secretary support model schools located in the inner city to demonstrate existing
or newly designed strategies. 



Discussion: 

The priority does not preclude such projects provided they have a professional development focus and other requirements
of the priority are met. 



Changes: 

None.

 




Comments: 

One commenter recommends changing the language of the required activity to allow an LEA to form a partnership with
either one or more institutions of higher education or with other qualified educational institutions. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary intends that projects funded under this program form cross-institutional partnerships that will
enable sites to address the career-long development of teachers and other educators in an integrated fashion. Therefore,
collaboration among those entities which influence educator development from recruitment through retirement
is essential. 



Changes: 

None.

Comments: 

One commenter recommends that training objectives highlight the need for teachers to become more effective in motivating
students to set and achieve their goals, and to help students understand the direct relationship of their success
in school (i.e., traditional academic subjects) and future success in the world of work.
