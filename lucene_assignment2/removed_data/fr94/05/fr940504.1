Sugar Import Licensing


<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) is requesting suggestions for revising the regulations and other program
provisions for the sugar import licensing programs in order to improve program efficiency and compliance as well
as to carry out relevant provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Paragraphs 21 and 22 of Annex 703.2 of Chapter 7 of the NAFTA relate to the trade of sugar and sugar containing products
which receive benefits under re-export programs. Paragraph 21 requires that the United States notify Mexico, in
writing, of any export to Mexico is not obligated to grant NAFTA duty preferences for such products. However, paragraph
22(b) provides that Mexico shall accord duty-free treatment to imports of (i) U.S. raw sugar that will be refined in
Mexico and re-exported to the United States, and (ii) refined sugar that has been refined in the United States from
Mexican raw sugar. Moreover, imports qualifying for duty-free treatment pursuant to paragraph 22(b) will not be
subject to, or counted under, any tariff rate quota. Comments with respect to implementation of these provisions
will be considered in drafting proposed regulations. 


Interested persons are encouraged to consider the rules relating to the maximum license sizes (7 CFR 1530.102(c)
and 1530.202(c)) and provide comments supporting any change. FAS is considering having all programs conform to the
metric system. This change would revise the maximum license sizes from short tons to metric tons.
Another rule change being considered relates to changes in the notice of transfer submission to the Licensing Authority.
The provisions at 7 CFR 1530.106(c) and 1530.204(c) relating to the original notice of transfer being submitted to
the Licensing Authority within 10 days of the transfer date will be reviewed for possible changes. The agency is considering
having the refiner licensee transmit to FAS the original notice of transfer within X days of the shipment date and then
simply receive and store confirmations from the manufacturer licensees. Information concerning numerous transfers
within an X-day period could be submitted to the Licensing Authority, either by mail or by electronic means.
FAS is also considering modifying the rule concerning licensee certifications in 7 CFR 1530.105(b). The additional
requirement the agency is considering is having the licensee provide certification to the Licensing Authority within
95 days of the date of export or last certification which ever comes first. An alternative could be to have periodic
reports (e.g., weekly, monthly, or quarterly depending on the volume of license activity). This change would allow
the Licensing Authority to establish greater compliance safeguards.
Licensees in the Refined Sugar Re-export program have been informed by FAS that during the time domestic marketing
allotments are in effect, licensees' sugar export shipments could not be certified to the Licensing Authority as
being eligible for license credit except when any domestic sugar can be verified as being counted against marketing
allotment allocations. FAS is interested in developing appropriate rules that would incorporate this limitation.
FAS also is interested in comments addressing the creation of a program to provide for imports of raw cane sugar exempt
from the tariff-rate quota on condition that an equivalent quantity of raw sugar is exported. Currently, subheading
1701.11.02 and additional U.S. note 3(c) to chapter 17 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS)
authorizes the sugar licensing programs but provides only for imports of raw sugar ``to be used for the production
(other than by distillation) of polyhydric alcohols, except polyhydric alcohols for use as a substitute for sugar
in human food consumption, or to be refined and re-exported in refined form or in sugar-containing products.'' This
provision would need to be amended to permit a raw sugar swap program.
FAS is interested in comments relating to the implementation of an automated data system linking licensees with the
Licensing Authority. Automated data processing procedures relating to the use of standardized forms for notices
of transfer and certifications for export credit are of particular interest. Rule change suggestions for providing
a structured data reporting format to enhance program administration and assist in verifying program compliance
are also requested.
FAS will give major consideration to the suggestions of manufacturer licensees in the sugar to be re-exported in sugar
containing products program with respect to contractual manufacturing arrangements with co-packers. Comments
should center on the control of quota-exempt sugar to prevent diversion onto the domestic market and the means by which
manufacturer licensees would establish eligibility to receive credit for sugar containing product exports for
products manufactured and exported by a co-packer.
FAS is also considering changing the licenses used under the Sugar for the Production of Polyhydric Alcohol program
from a license to import raw sugar to a license to receive transfers of refined sugar. 
Since this will be the best opportunity to modify program regulations, program participants should address any other
issues that they deem appropriate.

Denying Credit to Applicants Delinquent on Federal Debt 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Farmers Home Administration, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) proposes to amend its regulations concerning program eligibility requirements.
These revisions will direct field offices to suspend processing of an application if an applicant is found to be delinquent
on a Federal debt until the delinquency is resolved, and to deny credit if a Federal judgment is found against an applicant.
This action is necessary to implement requirements of OMB Circular A-129, ``Policies for Federal Credit Programs
and Non-Tax Receivables.'' Denying credit to applicants against whom there is a Federal judgment is mandated by provisions
of the Federal Debt Collections Procedures Act of 1990. The intended effect of this action is to instruct field offices
on how to obtain more information to be used in determining loan, grant and loan servicing eligibility. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Classification 



This rule has been determined not-significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been reviewed
by OMB. 



Environmental Impact Statement 



This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR Part 1940, Subpart G, ``Environmental Program.'' FmHA has
determined that this action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the
human environment and, in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law 91-190,
an Environmental Impact Statement is not required. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



The information collection requirements contained in these regulations have been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB control numbers 0575-0134,
0575-0141, 0575-0132, 0575-0097, 0575-0123, 0575-0074, 0575-0085, 0575-0083,
0575-0059, 0575-0045, 0575-0047, 0575-0062, 0575-0090, 0575-0130, 0575-0066,
0575-0079, 0575-0029, and 0575-0137 in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44
U.S.C. 3507). The proposed rule does not revise or impose any new information collection or recordkeeping requirement
from those approved by OMB.

Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Administrator of the Farmers Home Administration has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it contains normal business recordkeeping requirements
and minimal essential reporting requirements. 



Background Information 



The current loan application procedures require that an applicant provide certification that it is not delinquent
on a Federal debt. For the purpose of verifying an applicant's certification, FmHA proposes to amend its instructions
by revising each eligibility section to instruct the field offices to access the Department of Housing and Urban Development's
Credit Alert Interactive Voice System (CAIVRS) to verify that the applicant is not delinquent on a Federal debt. If
a delinquency is found, processing of the application will be suspended. The applicant will be notified that processing
has been suspended and will be asked to contact the appropriate Federal agency, at the telephone number provided by
CAIVRS, to resolve the delinquency. When the applicant provides FmHA with official documentation that the delinquency
has been paid in full or otherwise resolved, processing of the application will be continued. If the applicant is unable
to resolve the delinquency, or if an outstanding judgment obtained by the United States in a Federal Court (other than
the United States Tax Court), which has been recorded, is found, assistance may be denied.

ACTION:

 Notice of public meeting. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff will meet with the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) and Yankee Atomic
Electric Company (YAEC) to discuss their written comments that are responsive to the States' concerns regarding
NRC's proposed rule on the environmental review required for renewal of nuclear power plant operating licenses.
These concerns focus on provisions of the proposed rule that the States see as being in conflict with the traditional
authority of the States to regulate electric utilities with respect to non-safety aspects of nuclear power generation.
The purpose of the meeting is to assure that the NRC staff and the public understands the approaches proposed by NEI
and YAEC.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The NRC published proposed amendments to its environmental protection regulations, 10 CFR part 51, which would establish
new requirements for the environmental review of applications to renew operating licenses for nuclear power plants
(September 17, 1991; 56 FR 47016). Concurrently, the NRC published NUREG-1437, a draft Generic Environmental
Impact Statement (GEIS) that contained the analyses which the NRC proposed to codify in Part 51. In commenting on the
proposed rule and the draft GEIS, a number of States expressed dissatisfaction with the treatment of need for generating
capacity, and alternative energy sources. The States' concerns involve provisions of the proposed rule that the
States see as being in conflict with the traditional authority of the States to regulate electric utilities with respect
to non-safety aspects of nuclear power generation. The Commission instructed the NRC staff to develop options for
responding to these States' concerns and in doing so to solicit the views of the States. 


The NRC staff solicited the views of the States and others through three regional meetings and a request for written
comments (January 18, 1994; 59 FR 2542). To facilitate discussions with the States the NRC staff prepared a paper,
``Addressing the Concerns of States and Others Regarding the Role of Need for Generating Capacity, Alternative Energy
Sources, Utility Costs, and Cost-Benefit Analysis in NRC Environmental Reviews for Relicensing Nuclear Power Plants:
An NRC Staff Discussion Paper.'' The regional meetings were held in Rockville, MD, February 9, 1994; Rosemont, IL,
February 15, 1994; and Chicopee, MA, February 17, 1994. A number of parties, including NEI and YAEC, filed written
comments subsequent to the meetings. The discussion paper, meeting transcripts, and written comments, including
NEI's proposal dated March 23, 1994, and YAEC's proposal dated March 18, 1994, may be examined at the NRC Public Document
Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC 20037. 
The NEI and the YAEC proposals were not adequately developed for discussion at the time of the regional meetings, and
now the NRC staff needs to be assured that it understands the two proposals before reporting to the Commission on the
options considered. All interested persons are invited to attend as observers. After the NRC staff's questions have
been answered, time will be allowed to take questions and comments from the floor on the NEI and YAEC proposals. The
meeting minutes will be transcribed by a court reporter.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Jetstream
Model 4101 airplanes, that currently requires inspections to detect damage of the ball bearings in the aileron quadrants,
replacement of damaged ball bearings with new ball bearings, and adjustment to the secondary stops. This action would
require installation of new swivel bearings in the aileron quadrants, which would terminate the inspection requirement.
This proposal is prompted by the development of a modification that eliminates the need to inspect repetitively.
The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the bearings in the aileron quadrants,
which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane.

Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM-103,
Attention: Rules Docket No. 94-NM-25-AD, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055-4056.



Discussion



On March 3, 1994, the FAA issued AD 93-25-10, Amendment 39-8849 (59 FR 11531, March 11, 1994), applicable
to certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes, to require inspections to detect damage of the ball bearings in the aileron
quadrants, replacement of damaged ball bearings with new ball bearings, and adjustment to the secondary stops. That
action was prompted by a report that an in-flight failure of a ball bearing in a quadrant in the pilot's aileron control
system caused abnormal backlash of the pilot's aileron control. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent
reduced controllability of the airplane.

Since the issuance of that AD, Jetstream has developed new swivel bearings that allow greater swivel action, which
would significantly decrease the likelihood of abnormal backlash of the aileron control due to bearing failure.
Bearing failure in the aileron quadrants, if not corrected, could result in reduced controllability of the airplane.

Jetstream has issued Service Bulletin J41-27-027, dated January 17, 1994, that describes procedures
for installation of swivel bearings in the left and right aileron quadrants (Modification JM41307A).

Jetstream has also issued Revision 2 of Service Bulletin J41-A-27-026, dated January 17, 1994.
The inspection procedures described in this revision are identical to those described in Revision 1 of the service
bulletin (which was referenced in AD 93-25-10). The only change effected by Revision 2 is to reference
the modification described in Service Bulletin J41-27-027 as terminating action for the inspections
of the bearings in the aileron quadrants and adjustment to the secondary stops described in Service Bulletin J41-A-27-026.
The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes
in the United Kingdom.

This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the
airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA
has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary
for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93-25-10 to require installation
of new swivel bearings in the left and right aileron quadrants (Modification JM41307A) as terminating action for
the currently required inspections. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service
bulletins described previously.

Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this proposal have been revised to reference Revision 2 of Service Bulletin J41-A-27-026,
dated January 17, 1994, as an additional source of service information for accomplishing the inspections of the bearings
in the aileron quadrants and adjustment to the secondary stops.

The FAA estimates that 8 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD.

The inspections that were previously required by AD 93-25-10, and retained in this proposal, take approximately
1 work hour per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of these inspection requirements on U.S. operators is estimated to be $440, or $55 per airplane, per inspection
cycle.

The adjustment to the secondary stops that were previously required by AD 93-25-10, and retained in this
proposal, take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this adjustment requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $440,
or $55 per airplane. The FAA estimates that all affected U.S. operators have already accomplished this action; therefore,
the future cost impact of this requirement is minimal.

The installation of new swivel bearings (Modification JM41307A) that would be required by this proposal would take
approximately 10 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts
would be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to the operator. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the
modification requirement of this proposal on U.S. operators is estimated to be $4,400, or $550 per airplane.

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39



Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.



The Proposed Amendment



Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration
proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:



PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES



1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:






Authority:

 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89.



 39.13

 [Amended]



2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing amendment 39-8849 (59 FR 11531, March 11, 1994), and by adding a new airworthiness
directive (AD), to read as follows:






Jetstream Aircraft Limited:

 Docket 94-NM-25-AD. Supersedes AD 93-25-10, Amendment 39-8849.






Applicability:

 Model 4101 airplanes having constructors numbers 41004 and subsequent on which Modification JM41307A or JM41307B
has not been installed previously; certificated in any category.



Compliance:

 Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.

To prevent failure of the bearings in the aileron quadrants, which could result in reduced controllability of the
airplane, accomplish the following:

(a) Within 7 days after March 28, 1994 (the effective date of AD 93-25-10, Amendment 39-8849), perform
a detailed visual inspection to detect damage of the bearings in the aileron quadrant in the pilot's and co-pilot's
aileron control, in accordance with Jetstream Aircraft Limited Alert Service Bulletin J41-A-27-026,
Revision 1, dated December 7, 1993; or Revision 2, dated January 17, 1994.

(1) If no damaged bearing is found, repeat the inspection, thereafter, at intervals not to exceed 7 days.

(2) If any damaged bearing is found, prior to further flight, replace the damaged bearing with a new bearing in accordance
with the service bulletin, and repeat the inspection, thereafter, at intervals not to exceed 7 days.






Note 1:

 Paragraph (a) of this AD restates the requirement for an initial and repetitive inspections contained in paragraph
(a) of AD 93-25-10. Therefore, for operators that have previously accomplished at least the initial inspection
in accordance with AD 93-25-10, paragraph (a) of this AD requires that the next scheduled inspection be
performed within 7 days after the last inspection performed in accordance with paragraph (a) of AD 93-25-10.




(b) Within 7 days after March 28, 1994 (the effective date of AD 93-25-10, Amendment 39-8849), adjust
the aileron secondary stop in the pilot's and co-pilot's aileron control system in accordance with Jetstream Aircraft
Limited Alert Service Bulletin J41-A-27-026, Revision 1, dated December 7, 1993; or Revision 2,
dated January 17, 1994.






Note 2:

 Paragraph (b) of this AD restates the requirement to adjust the aileron secondary stop contained in paragraph (b)
of AD 93-25-10. As allowed by the phrase ``unless accomplished previously,'' if that requirement of AD
93-25-10 has been accomplished previously, this AD does not require that it be repeated.




(c) Within 7 days after March 28, 1994 (the effective date of AD 93-25-10, Amendment 39-8849), revise
the Abnormal Procedures Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to include the following. This
may be accomplished by inserting a copy of this AD in the AFM.

``Where abnormal aileron control backlash is experienced by one pilot, the other pilot should assume control of the
aircraft without using the disconnect facility. The disconnect facility should only be used in accordance with published
procedures in cases of control restrictions or jamming.''






Note 3:

 Paragraph (c) of this AD restates the requirement for an AFM revision contained in paragraph (c) of AD 93-25-10.
As allowed by the phrase ``unless accomplished previously,'' if that requirement of AD 93-25-10 has been
accomplished previously, this AD does not require that it be repeated.




(d) Within 180 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, install new swivel bearings in the left and
right aileron quadrants (Modification JM41307A) in accordance with Jetstream Service Bulletin J41-27-027,
dated January 17, 1994. Accomplishment of this modification constitutes terminating action for the requirements
of this AD. The AFM revision required by paragraph (c) of this AD may be removed following accomplishment of this modification.

(e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM-113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate.
Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments
and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM-113.






Note 4:

 Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained
from the Standardization Branch, ANM-113.




(f) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) 21.197 and 21.199
to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.

The Proposal



The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Arcata, CA. This proposal would provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators executing the ILS/DME
approach at Arcata, CA. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace
areas designated as transition areas for airports are published in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June
17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993).
The class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in this Order.

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It therefore_(1) Is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 10034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Proposal


The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace designated as a surface area for an airport and to modify the 700 foot transition area. An Automated Weather
Observing System has been installed at Lompoc Municipal Airport meeting the criterion for a Class E surface area.
The coordinates for this airspace are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designated as a surface area
for an airport is published in Paragraph 6002 and Class E airspace designations for airspace extending upward from
700 feet or more above ground level are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A, dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 as of September 16, 1993 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993).
The Class E airspace listed in the document would be published subsequently in the Order. The FAA has determined that
this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine
amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation,
it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Lead in Food and Color Additives and GRAS Ingredients; Request for Data; Extension of Comment Period


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Advance notice of proposed rulemaking; extension of comment period.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is extending to August 3, 1994, the comment period for the advance notice of
proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) that appeared in the 

Federal Register

 of February 4, 1994, (59 FR 5363). The document announced the agency's intent to take several related actions to reduce
the amount of lead in food from the use of food and color additives and ingredients whose uses are generally recognized
as safe (GRAS). FDA is taking this action in response to a request to allow additional time for public comment.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In the 

Federal Register

 of February 4, 1994 (59 FR 5363), FDA published an ANPRM announcing the agency's intent to take several related actions
to reduce the amount of lead in food from the use of food and color additives and GRAS ingredients. The ANPRM requested
information on whether the specifications it is considering are feasible, and if they are not, why higher levels will
not endanger the public health, and what levels are feasible. Interested persons were given until May 5, 1994, to provide
comments and information in response to the ANPRM.


FDA has received a request to extend the comment period to permit at least an additional 90 days for public comment.
The request stated that additional time is needed to undertake testing, analysis, and data collection relating to
the ANPRM. The request also asked that the extension be granted as quickly as possible, so that the requester can determine
whether there will be adequate time to perform testing.
After careful consideration, the agency has concluded that it is in the public interest to allow additional time for
interested persons to submit comments and information relating to the ANPRM. Accordingly, FDA is extending the comment
period to August 3, 1994.
Interested persons may, on or before August 3, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this ANPRM. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Revisions to Standards for Annual Fees and Use of Permit Imprints 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Postal Service. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Postal Service proposes changes in several Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards concerning bulk and presort
mailing fees and the methods of paying postage. 


E110.6.1, E312.2.6, and E411.4.0 are amended to standardize the terms of application of bulk and presort mailing
fees on First-, third-, and fourth-class mail, by requiring payment of the fee only by the party entering the mail,
regardless of whose permit imprint, precanceled stamp permit, or meter was used as the device for postage payment
on the mailing. A single fee payment would allow mailing at all bulk or presort rate categories of the corresponding
class of mail. 
E213.4.3 is amended to change the publishing requirements for Form 3526, Statement of Ownership, Management, and
Circulation, generally to allow publication anytime during October of the filing year rather than in a specific issue.

P040 is amended both to relax the conditions under which a company permit imprint may be used and to strengthen concurrently
the Postal Service's ability both to identify the place of mailing of company permit imprint mail and to obtain information
about such mailings. Generally, mailers will be allowed to use a company style imprint without having to obtain permits
at two or more post offices, but mailers will be required to show a return address at which records of the mailing will
be made available upon request. 
P040 is also amended to relax the design restrictions of permit imprint indicia. Generally, the new standards allow
for more creativity while retaining restrictions that ensure that the indicia content is readable and clearly identifiable
as postage payment. 
P200 is amended to set a sunset date for the use of key rates. 
Miscellaneous other changes are made for consistency. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This notice presents revisions to Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards suggested during the DMM revision project
begun in 1992. DMM Issue 46 (July 1993) was the first result of that project, but was not intended to make changes simultaneously
in substantive mailing requirements; such amendments were deferred for subsequent action such as this rulemaking.
This notice focuses on several matters related to the use of permit imprints (for First-, third-, and fourth-class
mail) and to the method of paying postage for second-class mail. 


1. E110.6.1, E312.2.6, and E411.4.0 are amended to standardize the assessment of bulk or presort mailing fees on First-,
third-, and fourth-class mail. Existing standards brought forward from DMM Issue 45 and earlier are inconsistent
with one another. A single standard applies to all First-Class (and Priority) Mail_that a fee must be paid once each
12-month period by any person or organization entering mail at other than the single-piece rates. Payment of that
fee allows use of any presort or bulk First-Class rate and the mailing of both the payer's mail and that of its clients.
By contrast, third-class standards distinguish between postage-affixed (precanceled and meter stamp) and permit
imprint mailers. Fourth-class presents its standards yet another way. Understandably this variation confuses
both customers and postal employees and may cause fees to be assessed incorrectly. 
The revision below amends the standards cited earlier to state them uniformly for all three classes: The mailing fee
applicable to the particular class of mail must be paid once each 12-month period at each office of mailing (except
as provided otherwise for plant-verified drop shipments) by any person or organization entering mailings of that
class at other than a single-piece or nonpresorted rate, regardless of whose permit imprint, precanceled stamp permit,
or meter was used to pay postage on the mail; payment of the one fee allows that person or organization to enter its own
mail (and that of its clients) at all the bulk or presort rates available in the corresponding class of mail. By this
revision, the Postal Service believes that confusion over this type of fee payment should be effectively eliminated.

2. E213.4.3 is amended to change the publishing requirements for Form 3526, Statement of Ownership, Management,
and Circulation. The current standard requires each publisher of a second-class publication to file Form 3526 by
October 1 of each year for each authorized publication. The information on that form (or a facsimile of the form) must
be published in the first issue after October 1 of the corresponding general or requester second-class publication.
Publishers have asked that this specification be relaxed to offer more latitude on the issue in which the information
may appear. Because 39 U.S.C. 3685 allows the Postal Service the authority to administer such details as when the form
is filed or published, the Postal Service believes it can change those criteria without adversely affecting the informational
value of what is published. The Postal Service sees no benefit from retaining a stringent requirement when a reasonable
relaxation is sought and supported by the industry. Therefore, the cited standard is amended as shown below to clarify
its applicability and require publication of Form 3526 in any issue published during October. 
3. P040 is amended to relax the conditions under which a company permit imprint may be used and to strengthen concurrently
the Postal Service's ability both to identify the place of mailing of company permit imprint mail and to obtain information
about such mailings. Current standards require a permit imprint indicium to contain the mailer's permit number and
the name of the post office where the permit is held unless, for a mailer having permit imprint authorizations at two
or more post offices, a ``company'' style indicium is used. In a company style indicium, the name of the permit holder
is substituted for the permit number and post office name. This style is preferred and used extensively by customers
who produce large mailings for entry at multiple sites, who may change printers or mailers regularly, who purchase
large quantities of envelope stock, or who simply prefer the appearance of the company style over the basic format.
Customers who have no need for multiple permit imprint authorizations have noted that it is a pointless burden on the
Postal Service and its customers to generate and maintain a second permit imprint account simply to gain access to
the company style indicium. These customers have requested relaxation of the applicable standards to let any permit
holder use the company style format. 
Current standards also require that company permit imprint mailpieces bear a complete domestic return address,
but do not specify what that address is to represent. Consequently, the Postal Service has found it difficult to trace
such mailpieces back to the point of mailing in situations where classification or postage matters have been questioned.
Moreover, no remedies exist for instances in which the permit holder deliberately frustrates the Postal Service's
efforts to identify the point of mailing, what was mailed, and whether the correct postage was paid. 
Therefore, P040 is amended as shown below to allow use of a company style permit imprint indicium by any permit mailer
regardless of the number of permits held. The Postal Service is also requiring more information to document company
permit imprint mailings (and mailings including company permit imprint pieces), is specifying the required return
address, and is enhancing its administrative remedies when the permit holder fails to supply mailing or permit use
information on the request of the Postal Service. No additional record-keeping responsibilities are being added
for either the mailer or the local post office. Rather, it is proposed that mailers use the location (the permit holder's
or its agent's) at which records for the mailing will be available to the Postal Service on request as the required return
address. The revised standards allow suspension or revocation of permits if such records are not provided in a timely
manner. The Postal Service believes the higher standards are a prudent administrative control and do not represent
an unreasonable condition: each permit holder should be able to detail what was mailed, where, and how much postage
was paid, and should have no legitimate reason to withhold such details from the Postal Service. Postal Service actions
against fraudulent uses of permits should be enhanced by these proposed measures.

4. P040 is also amended to relax the design restrictions of permit imprint indicia. Current standards allow use of
only the formats illustrated in the DMM_basically a plain box with plain lettering. While this format was adequate
for years, contemporary marketing techniques and competitive pressures among mail users have made the attractiveness
of the mailpiece a cornerstone of efforts to interest the addressee in what is inside the mailpiece. As a result, mailers
have become more interested in using artistic latitude in designing the permit imprint indicium that appears on the
mailpiece. 
The Postal Service understands the mailer interest in this matter and accepts the validity of proposals for greater
design flexibility. However, those must be balanced against the needs of the Postal Service to maintain the clear
recognition of the indicium both as evidence of postage payment and as an indicator of the mailer's identity. Therefore,
P040 is amended as shown below to allow some greater flexibility in the preparation of permit imprint indicia. Generally,
the proposed standard reinforces the distinctiveness of an indicium but allows its incorporation into a design of
the mailer's choice. The combined design must be in a prescribed area of the upper right corner of the address side,
area, or label on the mailpiece, must not imitate a stamp or meter impression, and must keep the indicia free of words
and other printing not specified by the format standards. While some mailers may prefer more latitude, the Postal
Service believes the proposed standards grant significant new flexibility to mailpiece designers in a reasonable
balance between such flexibility and the Postal Service's legitimate interest in maintaining recognizable permit
indicia. 
5. P200 is amended to set a sunset date for the use of key rates. Key rates basically represent a simplified method of
computing zone-rate postage on issues of second-class publications having a stable distribution pattern. Publishers
and others who provided the Postal Service with suggestions for simplifying these regulations noted the diminishing
use of key rates in an era of centralized postage, electronic funds transfer, multiple editions, and other industry
changes. At the same time, postal personnel, noting how seldom key rates are used and the resulting lessening of understanding
and experience in their administration, agreed that their continued availability should be questioned. 
Therefore, by the revision shown below, the Postal Service proposes to end the use of key rates. No new users would be
added after September 30, 1994, or on adoption of a final rule, whichever is later, and, to allow for an orderly transition
for remaining key rate users, termination of key rates would be deferred until March 31, 1995, or 6 months after adoption
of a final rule, whichever is later. The Postal Service recognizes that there are some publishers that may still use
key rates and does not wish to impact them more than necessary. However, the Postal Service, which also recognizes
the need to eliminate nonessential regulations if the mailing community is to be better served, feels that key rates
exemplify a potential for such action. 
Although exempt from the notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b), (c))
regarding proposed rulemaking by 39 U.S.C. 410(a), the Postal Service invites comments on the following proposed
revisions of the DMM, incorporated by reference in the Code of Federal Regulations. See 39 CFR Part 111. 


List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 111 


Postal Service. 


PART 111_[AMENDED] 


1. The authority citation for 39 CFR part 111 continues to read as follows: 





Authority:

2. Revise the following units of the Domestic Mail Manual as noted below: 


E110 Basic Standards 


* * * * * 


6.0 Fees.
6.1 Presort Mailing Fee.
A First-Class presort mailing fee must be paid once each 12-month period at each office of mailing by any person or organization
entering mailings at other than the single-piece First-Class or Priority Mail or Nonpresorted First-Class rates,
regardless of whose permit imprint, precanceled stamp permit, or meter was used to pay postage on the mail. Payment
of one fee allows that person or organization to enter its own mail (and that of its clients) at all the First-Class and
Priority Mail presort rates.

E213 Publisher Records 


* * * * * 


4.0 Statement of Ownership, Management, and Circulation.
 


* * * * * 


4.3 Publication.
During October every year, the publisher of each publication authorized second-class mail privileges as a general
or requester publication must publish a complete statement of ownership, containing all information required by
Form 3526, in the issue of the publication to which data reported on that statement relate. A reproduction of the Form
3526 submitted to the USPS may be used for this purpose. Other publications are not required to publish this statement.



* * * * * 


E312 Additional Standards Applicable to Bulk Third-Class Mail 


* * * * * 


2.0 Standards for Rates, Fees, and Postage.
 


* * * * * 


2.6 Bulk Mailing Fee.
A third-class bulk mailing fee must be paid once each 12-month period at each office of mailing (except as provided
otherwise for plant-verified drop shipments) by any person or organization entering mailings at any regular or special
bulk third-class rate, regardless of whose permit imprint, precanceled stamp permit, or meter was used to pay postage
on the mail. Payment of one fee allows that person or organization to enter its own mail (and that of its clients) at all
the third-class bulk rates. [Delete 2.7; renumber 2.8 through 2.10 as 2.7 through 2.9, respectively.] 


* * * * * 


E411 Standards Applicable to All Fourth-Class Mail 


* * * * * 


4.0 Fees.
4.1 Special Presort and DBMC Rates.
[Combine existing 4.1 and 4.3; renumber existing 4.4 as 4.3; revise 4.1 as follows:] A mailing fee must be paid once
each 12-month period at each office of mailing by any person or organization entering mailings at the special fourth-class
presort rate or (except as provided otherwise for plant-verified drop shipments) at the destination BMC (DBMC) parcel
post rates, regardless of whose permit imprint, precanceled stamp permit, or meter was used to pay postage on the mail.
A separate fee is required for each rate; payment of the applicable fee allows that person or organization to enter
its own mail (and that of its clients) at the corresponding rate. 
4.2 Pickup Service.
The parcel post pickup fee must be paid every time pickup service is provided, subject to the corresponding standards
in D010.

1.7 Suspension. 

The USPS may immediately suspend the permit holder's use of a permit imprint if the permit holder or its agent fails
to provide information as specified in 1.6. 

1.8 Revocation. 

A permit is revoked for use in operating any unlawful scheme or enterprise, for nonuse during any 12-month period,
for refusal to provide information about permit imprint use or mailings, or for any noncompliance with the standards
applicable to using permit imprints. If revocation is for nonuse but the permit holder plans to resume mailings within
a 90-day period, the permit may be continued for 90 days. The permit holder may appeal the revocation in writing to the
postmaster within 10 days of receipt of the notice. Further appeal may be made through the postmaster to the district
manager of customer service and sales or to the RCSC if the initial decision was made at the district level. 



* * * * * 



2.0 Preparing Permit Imprints.



* * * * * 



2.4 Placement.

The entire permit imprint indicium must be aligned parallel with the address of the mailpiece and placed in the upper
right corner of the address side, of the address area, or of the address label, subject to these conditions: 

a. The indicium must not encroach on reserved space on the mailpiece (e.g., the OCR read area) if such a standard applies
to the rate claimed. 

b. The position (but not the format) of the indicium may be varied so that data processing equipment can simultaneously
print the address, imprint, and other postal information. 



* * * * * 



3.0 Permit Imprint Content.



* * * * *



3.5 Company Permit Imprint.

A company permit imprint is one in which the exact name of the company or individual holding the permit is shown in the
permit imprint indicium in place of the city, state, and permit number. A customer may use a company permit imprint
indicium if: 

a. For 2 years after the last date of mailing, the permit holder keeps records for each mailing paid by company permit
imprint for USPS review on request. These records include (for each version of what was mailed, if applicable) a complete
sample mailpiece; the weight of a single piece; the total number of pieces mailed; the total postage; the date(s) and
post office(s) of mailing, and other records required by the rate of postage claimed or the method of payment used.


b. Each mailpiece bears the complete domestic return address of the mailer or the mailer's agent, that address being
the physical location at which the records listed in 3.5a are available for USPS review. On unendorsed bulk third-class
mail, the return address may be below the permit imprint. 

4.0 Formats.
 
[Renumber existing 4.0 as 4.1, and Exhibits 4.0a-c as 4.1a-c; amend and add new 4.2 as follows:] 

4.1 Basic Standard.

Unless prepared under the option in 4.2, permit imprint indicia for ordinary mail, official mail, and Mailgrams must
be prepared in one of the formats shown in Exhibit 4.1a, Exhibit 4.1b, and Exhibit 4.1c, as applicable to the rate claimed
or type of mail. 

4.2 Optional Format.

Permit imprint indicia may be prepared in a format other than the basic format described in 4.1 subject to these conditions:


a. The rule that forms a box around the content of the indicium may be omitted if the content remains as specified in 3.0
and Exhibits 4.1a-c. 

b. The indicium content specified in 3.0 is placed within a clear area no smaller than 1/2 inch high and 1/2 inch wide,
no more than 1-1/2 inches below or left from the upper right corner of the mailpiece, of the address label, or of the address
area, regardless of the processing category or the postage rate claimed. 

c. No printing appears in the indicium area other than the information required or allowed under 3.0. 

d. No printing appears above or to the right of the permit information. 

e. The permit information is printed in no smaller than 4-point type. 

f. Any decorative designs intended to be part of the permit imprint indicium design appear below or to the left of the
permit information in an area extending no farther than 4-1/2 inches to the left of the right edge, and 1-1/2 inches
below the top edge, of the mailpiece, address area, or address label, as applicable. Such designs must not resemble
or imitate a postage meter imprint, postage stamp, postcard postage, or other method of postage payment. No words
or symbols are included in a decorative design used by the USPS to identify a class of mail, rate of postage, or level
of service, unless such words or symbols are correctly used under the applicable standards for the mailpiece on which
they appear and the corresponding postage and 
fees have been paid. 

g. All other applicable standards in 1.0 through 5.0 are met. 



* * * * * 



5.0 Mailings.
 


* * * * * 



5.3 Preparation of Mailing. 

All pieces in a permit imprint mailing must be faced (i.e., have the address facing in the same direction) and meet the
preparation standards applicable to the rate claimed. Mail claimed at a rate where postage varies by zone must be separated
by zone when mailed unless authorized by the USPS. 

5.4  Place of Mailing.

Mail must be deposited and accepted at the post office that issued the permit, at a time and place designated by the postmaster,
except as provided for plant-verified drop shipments. 



* * * * * 



5.6 Prepayment. 

Payment must be made for each mailing, either in cash or through an advance deposit account, before the mailing can
be released for processing. Funds to pay postage must be deposited as prescribed by the USPS. If the funds paid or on
deposit are less than that necessary to pay for a mailing, the difference must be paid or deposited before it or other
permit imprint mailings can be accepted. Credit for postage is not allowed. Postage may not be paid partly in money
and partly by postage stamps unless permitted by standard. 



* * * * * 



P200 Second-Class Mail 



* * * * * 



3.0 Key Rate.
 


* * * * * 



3.5 Termination of Key Rate Option. 


New authorizations to use key rates may not be granted after September 30, 1994. Publications already authorized
key rates may continue to use them until March 31, 1995. Effective April 1, 1995, use of key rates is eliminated and 3.0
is deleted. 

An appropriate amendment to 39 CFR 111.3 to reflect these changes will be published if the proposal is adopted.

Refractory Ceramic Fiber; Proposed Significant New Use of a Chemical Substance; Reopening of Comment Period 



 

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; reopening of comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is reopening the comment period for a proposed significant new use rule (SNUR) under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic
Substances Control Act to require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacture, import,
or processing of refractory ceramic fiber (RCF) in any new product for or any new application of an existing product
form. The proposed rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 21, 1994. 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of March 21, 1994 (59 FR 13294), EPA proposed a significant new use rule (SNUR) under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances
Control Act to require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacture, import, or processing
of refractory ceramic fiber (RCF) in any new product form not listed, or any new application of an existing product
form not listed in the proposed rule. Written comments on the proposed rule were to be received on or before April 20,
1994. EPA received a request from a trade association seeking a 30-day extension of the public comment period
because of additional time needed to provide EPA with information on uses not listed in the proposal. EPA believes
that providing an additional 30-day period to prepare written comments is reasonable. EPA is therefore reopening
the comment period 30 days in order to give all interested persons the opportunity to comment fully. Written comments
must be received on or before June 3, 1994.

Lead Fishing Sinkers; Response to Citizens' Petition and Proposed Ban; Extension of Comment Period 





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Extension of comment period. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is extending the comment period for a proposed rule to prohibit the manufacture, processing, and distribution
in commerce of certain lead- and zinc-containing fishing sinkers which was published in the 

Federal Register

 of March 9, 1994. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

: In the 

Federal Register

 of March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11122), EPA issued a proposed rule under section 6(a) of the Toxic Substances Control Act to prohibit
the manufacture, processing, and distribution in commerce of certain lead- and zinc-containing fishing sinkers.
Written comments on the proposed rule were to be received on or before May 9, 1994. EPA received requests seeking a 60-day
extension of the public comment period because of additional time needed to provide EPA with information it requested
in the proposed rule. EPA believes that providing an additional 60-day comment period to prepare written comments
is reasonable. EPA is therefore extending the comment period 60 days in order to give all interested persons the opportunity
to comment fully. Written comments must be received by EPA on or before July 8, 1994.


A person may assert a claim of business confidentiality for any comments submitted to EPA in connection with the proposed
rule. Any person who submits a comment that contains information claimed as confidential, must also submit a nonconfidential
version. Any claim of confidentiality must accompany the information when it is submitted to EPA. Persons may claim
information confidential by circling, bracketing, or underlining it, and marking it with ``CONFIDENTIAL'' or some
other appropriate designation. EPA will disclose information subject to a claim of business confidentiality only
to the extent permitted by section 14 of TSCA and 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. If a person does not assert a claim of confidentiality
for information in comments at the time it is submitted to EPA, the Agency will put the comments in the public docket
without further notice to that person.

Price Cap Performance Review for Local Exchange Carriers


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; extension of time.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking initiating a comprehensive review of the performance of local
exchange carriers under price cap regulation. The Commission pledged to undertake this fourth-year review when
it adopted price cap regulation for the Regional Bell Operating Companies, GTE, and electing local exchange carriers.
A motion for extension of time was filed on March 30, 1994, by the United States Telephone Association and granted by
the Commission on April 7, 1994. This notice serves to grant all local exchange carriers additional time in which to
file comments and replies on the issues set forth in the above-cited NPRM.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Order




Adopted: 

April 6, 1994;
Released: April 7, 1994.



In the Matter of: Price Cap Performance Review for Local Exchange Carriers; Motion for Extension of Time.



By the Acting Chief, Common Carrier Bureau:
1. On March 30, 1994, the United States Telephone Association (USTA) filed a motion for extension of time to file comments
in response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
 in the above-captioned proceeding. Comments are scheduled to be filed by April 18, 1994 and replies by May 17, 1994.
USTA seeks an extension until May 9, 1994 for comments and until June 8, 1994 for replies.




2. USTA states that the Commission has requested that interested parties submit detailed information and quantitative
data on a wide variety of issues, ranging from the broad policy goals underlying the price cap plan, to specific details
of the plan, to transition issues related to increasing competition in access markets. USTA indicates that it is the
principal trade association representing the entire local exchange carrier industry and views this proceeding
as critically important to determining the future of the telecommunications industry. USTA asserts that the quantification
and other analyses that it will be submitting cannot be completed in time for inclusion in comments to be filed on April
18. Therefore, it argues, an extension of time is necessary for USTA to gather and analyze relevant data and to allow
its consultants to prepare their reports and obtain the approval of USTA's membership before those reports can be
incorporated in its comments.
3. The Common Carrier Bureau has reviewed USTA's request for extension of time and has determined that good cause has
been shown to grant all interested parties additional time, until May 9, 1994, to file comments and until June 8, 1994
to file reply comments.
4. Therefore, it is ordered that the United States Telephone Association's motion for extension of time is granted
to the extent specified herein.

Regulations for the Administration of Special Use Permits on National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Advance notice of proposed rulemaking and request for comments.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) gives notice to the public that it will be developing regulations that
will clarify, update, and add to existing regulations for the administration of special use permits (permits) on
national wildlife refuges (refuges) in Alaska. These changes will include but not be limited to: Permit application,
denial, and appeal procedures; permit fees; and the process for issuing permits where a competitive selection process
is used to select the permit holder (e.g., big game guide-outfitters). 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (ANILCA) (43 U.S.C. 1602-1784), the National Wildlife
Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd-668ee), and the Refuge Recreation Act of 1962 (16
U.S.C. 460k-460k-4) authorize the Secretary of the Interior to prescribe regulations as necessary to
administer permits for compatible activities on refuges in Alaska. 


The current regulations governing issuance of permits on refuge units in Alaska, codified at 50 CFR 36.41, were originally
published in the 

Federal Register

 at 46 FR 40192 on August 7, 1981, and later amended at 51 FR 44794 on December 12, 1986. Since that time, the permit administration
program on refuges in Alaska has continued to evolve. The purpose of the proposed regulations is to provide up-to-date
guidance to both commercial users and Service employees for the administration of permits in Alaska. Prior to promulgating
these revised regulations, the Service will be reviewing its existing permit administration program and will be
proposing revisions based on over 12 years of experience with the program and the implementation of ANILCA. 
The evolution of the program for administering permits has been influenced by a number of factors since the original
regulations were promulgated. One factor has been the increased public awareness and understanding of the need for
securing permits prior to engaging in many activities on refuges in Alaska.
Another factor is the November 1984 Inspector General's Audit Report that found that the Service was not collecting
fees which were commensurate with the value of the commercial activities authorized. This audit resulted in the Service
developing a fee schedule based on client use days instead of charging a fixed $100 administrative fee for all permits
regardless of the scope of income generated by the commercial permittee. 
Another event causing a significant impact on refuge permit administration in Alaska was the decision of the Alaska
Supreme Court in 

Owsichek 

v. 

State Guide Licensing and Control Board, 

763 P.2d 488 (Alaska, 1988). That ruling found the State's system of assigning exclusive guide areas unconstitutional.
Prior to this ruling, the Service had depended upon the State's system for selecting and assigning guides to areas
which were located within refuge lands. In an attempt to allow the State an opportunity to develop a constitutionally
acceptable system, and one which would satisfy Service needs, the Service imposed a moratorium on the issuance of
permits to new guide applicants. This effectively limited the availability of permits to those who were guiding at
the time of the 1988 court ruling. 
After some time, the Service decided to develop its own interim program in order to provide an equal opportunity for
all registered big game guide-outfitters to compete for permits. During late 1991 and early 1992, the Service proposed
an interim system to select big game guide-outfitters. After soliciting public comment on the system, and making
revisions based on substantive comments, an interim program was implemented in June 1992. Requests for proposals
were then solicited and applicants were notified of selections in January 1993. Successful applicants were awarded
5-year permits effective July 1, 1993. 
It now appears that the State may not be able to implement a satisfactory system for the selection of guide-outfitters
prior to the expiration of the 5-year permits the Service issued in 1993. Accordingly, the Service proposes to initiate
development of regulations related to the big game guide-outfitter program and include them in the revised regulations
pertaining to the general administration of permits in Alaska (50 CFR 36.41). 
The Service has identified several issues at this preliminary stage for which it invites public comment: 
(1) Is the existing 180 day period allowed for filing appeals of adverse decisions on permits appropriate in this instance?
Should a separate appeal system be developed which speaks directly to big game guide-outfitters? 
(2) To what extent should the existing interim system for selecting big game guide-outfitters be made part of the regulations?

(3) If the State develops a selection system that meets Service requirements, should provision be made for the suspension
of the Service permit selection system? 
Comments on the foregoing issues, as well as other related aspects of this process, are encouraged. The Service will
follow this comment period with the publication of a proposed rule which will allow, also, for additional comments
prior to publication of a final rule.

Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska; Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; proposed 1994 specification of Pacific halibut bycatch allowances; request for comments. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS proposes regulations to implement several management measures designed to prevent some Gulf of Alaska (GOA)
trawl fisheries from taking an unnecessarily large share of the GOA halibut bycatch limit; amend the directed fishing
standards to prohibit using retained amounts of arrowtooth flounder, or groundfish species that are closed to directed
fishing, as a basis for calculating retainable amounts of other, more valuable groundfish species that are closed
to directed fishing; change the opening date of the yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries in the Bering
Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI) from May 1 to January 1; and implement changes pertaining to the annual
specification and management of GOA halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limits. This action is necessary to reduce
the likelihood that one sector of the Alaska trawl fleet will preempt others for a share of the Pacific halibut bycatch
limit established for vessels using trawl gear in the GOA, and provide greater opportunity to harvest available groundfish
under halibut bycatch restrictions in both the GOA and BSAI fisheries. This action is intended to further the objectives
of the fishery management plans for the groundfish fisheries off Alaska.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The domestic groundfish fisheries in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the GOA and the BSAI are managed by the Secretary
of Commerce in accordance with the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Groundfish of the GOA and the FMP for the Groundfish
Fishery of the BSAI. The FMPs were prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson
Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). Regulations authorized under the FMP that pertain to the
U.S. groundfish fisheries appear at 50 CFR parts 672 and 675. 


At its September 1993 meeting, the Council requested NMFS to prepare a rulemaking that would implement several management
measures that are intended to prevent some GOA trawl fisheries from taking an unnecessarily large share of the halibut
bycatch limit relative to other groundfish trawl fisheries. This results in the attainment of the halibut bycatch
cap before some groundfish total allowable catches (TACs) have been taken, causing a closure of trawling operations
in the GOA even though the full groundfish harvest amount has not been taken in some fisheries. These measures were
presented to the Council in September 1993 by GOA and BSAI trawl industry representatives as an alternative to FMP
amendments under consideration by the Council that would establish a super-exclusive registration program for
vessels participating in the GOA and BSAI groundfish fisheries. 
Three measures were proposed to address the preemption of one trawl fishery sector by another:

1. Establish two GOA trawl fishery categories for the purpose of apportioning the GOA halibut bycatch limit already
established for the trawl gear fisheries ( 672.20(f)). These two categories are the following: (1) The shallow-water
fishery complex (pollock, Pacific cod, Atka mackerel, shallow-water flatfish, flathead sole, and ``other species'');
and (2) the deep-water fishery complex (the deep water flatfish, rex sole, arrowtooth flounder, sablefish, and rockfish);

2. Revise the method for calculating retainable amounts of groundfish species under directed fishing standards
( 672.20(h) and  675.20(i)). Revised methods prohibit using retained amounts of arrowtooth flounder,
or groundfish species that are closed to directed fishing, as a basis for calculating retainable amounts of other,
more valuable groundfish species that are closed to directed fishing; and 
3. Adjust the opening date for the BSAI yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries from May 1 to January 1. As a
result of this season adjustment, directed fishing standards governing retainable amounts of flatfish species
at  675.20(h)(2) are also revised. 
At its December 1993 meeting, the Council requested that NMFS implement these measures early in the 1994 fishing year
by emergency interim rulemaking. An emergency rule was issued 
on February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6222) under section 305(c) of the Magnuson Act. 
A detailed description of, and justification for, each of the proposed management measures, including editorial
changes to regulations addressing GOA halibut bycatch limits, follow. 


Establishment of Two GOA Trawl Categories for Purposes of Apportioning the Halibut Bycatch Mortality Limit 


Existing regulations at  672.20(f) establish a framework process for the annual specification of separate
Pacific halibut PSC limits for ``trawl'' and ``fixed gear'' fisheries, and for apportioning those limits by season.
Although these regulations limit the bycatch of Pacific halibut in the GOA groundfish trawl fisheries, they have
resulted in conflict among, and preemption of, groundfish trawling operations in the GOA as various trawl fishery
components compete for shares of the available halibut PSC limit. This conflict occurs due to seasonal variations
in halibut bycatch rates and amounts of halibut caught in the various trawl fisheries; NMFS lacks regulatory authority
to apportion the halibut PSC limit among separate trawl fishery categories. 
Under existing regulations, the possibility exists for the activities of one group of trawl vessels fishing for a
particular groundfish species or species complex to take a disproportionate amount of the halibut PSC limit relative
to other groundfish fisheries. The halibut PSC limit may be reached before the attainment of the fisheries' TAC amount
and cause closure of all trawling operations in the GOA, except for trawling for pollock with pelagic trawl gear. Such
closures may cause: significant amounts of economically important TAC to remain unharvested; idling of vessels
and crew; and, a disruption of processing, fishing support sectors, fishery-dependent communities, and intermediate
and final markets. Even if the total trawl PSC limit is not reached prematurely, the threat that it may be reached at
any point in the fishing year can force other user groups to incur unnecessary costs, alter fishing plans, or operate
in a manner that causes conflict among user groups. 
Many of the potentially adverse impacts of the present process used to manage halibut bycatch in the GOA trawl fisheries
could be avoided or reduced if the GOA trawl PSC limit were apportioned between competing fishery categories. Fishery
data from the GOA trawl fisheries indicate that the variation in halibut bycatch rates and associated bycatch mortality
in these fisheries appears to be relatively well demarcated by the following operational categories: (1) Those vessels
fishing for species in the ``shallow-water species complex'' (pollock, Pacific cod, shallow-water flatfish, flathead
sole, Atka mackerel, or ``other species''); and (2) those vessels fishing for species in the ``deep-water species
complex'' (sablefish, rockfish, deep water flatfish, and arrowtooth flounder). The Council's recommended management
measure included flathead sole in the deep-water complex; however, 1993 fishery data show that more than 65 percent
of the total GOA flathead sole harvest was associated with fisheries in the shallow-water complex. Therefore, NMFS
proposes to include flathead sole in the shallow-water complex. In general, the shallow-water and deep-water complexes
are associated with inshore and offshore trawl operations, respectively. 
Based on Council recommendations at its September and December 1993 meetings, NMFS proposes to apportion the 1994
GOA halibut trawl PSC limit among fisheries and seasons as set out below: 
Apportionment of the 2,000 metric ton (mt) halibut bycatch mortality limit established for the 1994 GOA trawl fisheries
among the shallow and deep-water trawl fishery complexes and seasons. Seasons open and close at 12 noon, Alaska local
time (A.l.t.), except that the first season opens at 0001 hours, A.l.t., January 20, and the last season ends at 12 midnight,
A.l.t., December 31.

<PARENT> FR940504-1-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Attainment of a seasonal (quarterly) bycatch allowance by a fishery complex would result in directed fishing closures
for each species within that fishery complex for the remainder of the quarter, except that when the halibut bycatch
allowance, or seasonal apportionment thereof, specified for the shallow-water complex is reached, directed fishing
for pollock with pelagic trawl gear may continue subject to other regulatory provisions under  672.20(f).
Any overages or shortfalls of a quarterly bycatch allowance would be accounted for in the subsequent quarterly allowance.


A detailed justification for the fishery and seasonal apportionments of the 1994 halibut PSC limit is described in
the EA prepared for this management measure (see 

ADDRESSES

). These apportionments are intended to accommodate seasonal bycatch requirements in a manner that optimizes the
1994 halibut PSC limit established for trawl gear relative to anticipated trawl fishing patterns and 1994 groundfish
TACs. 



Revision of the Methodology Used To Calculate Retainable Amounts of Groundfish Under Directed Fishing Standards




The proposed rule amends  672.20(h) and  675.20(i) to address problems with the current regulatory provisions
for calculation of ``retainable'' bycatch amounts of groundfish species for which directed fishing is closed. Current
regulations provide for an overly liberal computation of retainable amounts of groundfish bycatch species, because
the basis for bycatch retention inappropriately includes species not open for directed fishing. This compromises
the purpose of using directed fishing standards to restrict bycatch of species after directed fishery closures.
This also creates a circular process, effectively allowing excessive bycatch retention. 

An associated concern exists that operators of some vessels deliberately target on arrowtooth flounder merely to
provide a basis for retaining allowable amounts of highly valued groundfish species for which directed fishing is
closed. In this case, arrowtooth flounder is harvested solely for the purpose of providing ``directed catch'' against
which ``retainable bycatch'' quantities may be calculated and accumulated. The arrowtooth flounder directed catch
is discarded and only the economically valuable bycatch, authorized on the basis of the quantity of the arrowtooth
harvest, is actually retained for processing. This practice effectively subverts the ``bycatch only'' intent of
fishery closures and associated directed fishing standards at  672.20(g) and  675.20(h). Furthermore,
trawl operations for arrowtooth flounder experience relatively high bycatch rates of halibut and, thus, contribute
to premature attainment of the halibut PSC limit, further aggravating the competition for the halibut PSC limit in
the GOA trawl fisheries and increasing the potential for costly trawl fishery closures. 



Adjustment of Season Opening Dates for the BSAI Flatfish Fisheries 



The proposed rule would adjust the opening date for the yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries from May 1
to January 1. The purpose of this season adjustment is to provide the BSAI trawl industry with viable fishing alternatives;
reduce the need for, and likelihood of, significant movement of fishing capacity from the BSAI to the GOA; reduce competition
for the halibut PSC limit established for the GOA trawl fisheries; and reduce the likelihood that displacement of
Bering Sea trawl effort into the GOA may preempt fishing opportunities for GOA operations later in the fishing year
by exhausting the GOA trawl halibut PSC limit, thus necessitating GOA-wide trawl closures. 

The original purpose for delaying directed fishing for yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' species until May 1
was to prevent the joint venture processing (JVP) and domestic annual processing (DAP) fisheries from taking a disproportionate
share of their respective red king crab or halibut bycatch allowances established for Bycatch Limitation Zones 1
or 2H (defined at 
 675.2), before available amounts of yellowfin sole and other groundfish species were harvested. Early attainment
of red king crab or halibut bycatch allowances due to of high bycatch rates experienced in the early spring flatfish
fisheries resulted in premature fishery closures that prevented available amounts of flatfish and other groundfish
species from being harvested. Delaying the opening of the yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries until
May 1 allowed the DAP fisheries to utilize the bulk of the available Zone 1 PSC limits in the rock sole and Pacific cod
fisheries from January through April, optimizing their catch of allocated groundfish species. 

The flatfish fisheries have changed substantially since the May 1 starting date was implemented. JVP fisheries no
longer operate in the EEZ off Alaska. The domestic industry has developed profitable new markets for products from
the ``other flatfish'' complex. In addition, the yellowfin sole and rock sole/''other flatfish'' fisheries are
allocated separate bycatch allowances that may be seasonally apportioned to optimize the groundfish harvest within
the established prohibited species bycatch restrictions.

The May 1 opening date of the yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries now has the effect of preventing domestic
fishermen from harvesting these resources at the beginning of the fishing year, when few other fishing opportunities
exist. This season has contributed, for example, to a situation in which the available TAC for the ``other flatfish''
complex has been underutilized in recent years. In 1991, only about 47 percent of the TAC for this species group was
harvested. In 1992 and 1993, that figure was 38 percent and 45 percent, respectively. Nonetheless, while these resources
have been underutilized, despite an expressed interest in accessing them at the beginning of the fishing year, retention
of the May 1 opening has forced BSAI trawl fishermen either to move into the GOA deep-water flatfish fishery, which
opens in January, or cease fishing until May 1. 

The rock sole fishery in the Bering Sea currently opens at the beginning of the fishing year to allow fishing in the lucrative
``roe'' fishery. This fishery typically closes in late February or early March when the rock sole have finished spawning.
Seasonal halibut bycatch restrictions can close other fisheries (e.g., Pacific cod during 1991 and 1992), leaving,
as noted above, few alternative fishing opportunities for the BSAI groundfish fleet. Flathead sole, one of the species
in the Bering Sea ``other flatfish'' category, produce roe that matures just after rock sole roe matures. Markets
for roe-bearing flathead sole have emerged, making this fishery a natural extension of that for roe-bearing rock
sole in the Bering Sea. Other markets for these flatfish species, including a domestic fillets market, are under development.


Opening the BSAI yellowfin sole fishery and the ``other flatfish'' fishery at the beginning of the fishing year (January
1) would provide vessels operating in the Bering Sea with the opportunity to participate in a potentially profitable,
developing fishery. This opportunity is expected to reduce the need for vessels to move into the GOA trawl fisheries
early in the fishing year, and thus would decrease pressure on the GOA halibut PSC limit and diminish the probability
of preemption of existing GOA groundfish fisheries through early closure. 

The proposed rule would amend the directed fishing standard for flatfish species ( 675.20(h)(2)) to accommodate
this season change and allow sufficient bycatch amounts of rock sole, yellowfin sole, arrowtooth flounder, or ``other
flatfish'' in the flatfish fisheries, while allowing for fishing operations to minimize the discard waste of these
species. The proposed rule would also establish species-specific standards, rather than aggregate standards,
for all flatfish species closed to directed fishing. The intent of this action is to simplify directed fishing standards,
and to reduce discard waste by increasing the retainable amounts of flatfish species closed to directed fishing relative
to other flatfish species that are open to directed fishing. 



Editorial and Technical Changes to  672.20(f) 



NMFS proposes to reorganize  672.20(f) to clarify the presentation and interpretation of regulations pertaining
to halibut PSC limits. Existing regulations at  672.20(f)(1)(i) and (2)(i) would be amended and redesignated
as (f)(3)(i) and (f)(1), respectively, to implement management measures set out in this proposed rule. To eliminate
redundant regulatory language, paragraph  672.20(f)(2)(ii) would be amended and included as part of paragraph
(f)(1) to cross reference the publication of proposed and final specifications required under  672.20(c).
These documents also include proposed and final halibut PSC limits and satisfy separate publication requirements
currently set out in  672.20(f)(2)(ii). 

The following paragraphs would be redesignated as indicated; no changes would be made to the regulatory text:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940504-1-00045 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940504-1-00017 </PARENT>

The redesignated regulatory text is republished as part of the proposed rule. However, NMFS is not requesting public
comment on the redesignated paragraphs. 


Classification 


NMFS prepared an analysis of the economic impact on small entities as part of the EA/RIR. All vessels using trawl gear
to harvest BSAI or GOA groundfish and processors receiving trawl-caught groundfish could be affected by the management
measures proposed under this action. Most catcher vessels harvesting groundfish off Alaska meet the definition
of a small entity under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. In 1993, 265 catcher vessels were issued permits to harvest
groundfish with trawl gear in Federal waters. All these vessels could be affected due to adjustments in fishing patterns
resulting from (1) changing the season of the BSAI flatfish fisheries, and (2) revising the management of the GOA halibut
PSC limit established for trawl fisheries. These effects are not expected to result in a reduction in annual gross
revenues by more than 5 percent, annual compliance costs that would increase total costs of production by more than
5 percent, or compliance costs for small entities that are at least 10 percent higher than compliance costs as a percent
of sales for large entities. Therefore, the proposed action would not result in a ``significant economic impact''
on small entities under the RFA. A copy of the EA/RIR is available (see 

ADDRESSES

). 
This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.

Authority:

 16 U.S.C. 1801 

et seq. 



2. In section 672.20, paragraphs (f) and (h)(1) are revised to read as follows: 


 672.20 

General limitations. 


* * * * * 


(f) Halibut PSC limits

_(1) 

Notification of proposed halibut PSC limits. 

NMFS will publish annually in the 

Federal Register

, proposed and final halibut PSC limits and apportionments thereof authorized under this paragraph (f), in the notification
required under paragraph (c) of this section. Public comment will be accepted by NMFS on the proposed halibut PSC limits
and apportionments thereof for a period of 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. NMFS will consider comments received on proposed halibut limits and, after consultation with the Council, will
publish notification in the 

Federal Register

 specifying the final halibut PSC limits and apportionments thereof. 
(i) 

Trawl gear fisheries. 

(A) After consultation with the Council, NMFS will publish notification in the 

Federal Register

 specifying the proposed halibut PSC limit for vessels using trawl gear. The halibut PSC limit specified for vessels
using trawl gear may be further apportioned as bycatch allowances to the fishery categories listed in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(B)
of this section, based on each category's proportional share of the anticipated halibut bycatch mortality during
a fishing year and the need to optimize the amount of total groundfish harvest under the halibut PSC limit. The sum of
all bycatch allowances will equal the halibut PSC limit established under this paragraph (f)(1)(i). 
(B) For purposes of apportioning the trawl halibut PSC limit among fisheries, the following fishery categories are
specified and defined in terms of round-weight equivalents of those groundfish species for which a TAC has been specified
under paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section: 
(

1

) 

Shallow-water species fishery. 

Fishing with trawl gear during any weekly reporting period that results in a retained aggregate catch of pollock,
Pacific cod, shallow-water flatfish, flathead sole, Atka mackerel, and ``other species'' that is greater than the
retained aggregate amount of other groundfish species or species group. 
(

2

)

 Deep-water species fishery. 

Fishing with trawl gear during any weekly reporting period that results in a retained catch of groundfish and is not
a shallow-water species fishery as defined under paragraph (f)(1)(i)(B)(

1

) of this section. 
(ii) 

Hook-and-line and pot gear fisheries. 

After consultation with the Council, NMFS will publish notification in the 

Federal Register

 specifying the proposed halibut PSC limits for the hook-and-line gear fisheries. The notification may also specify
a halibut PSC limit for the pot gear fisheries. The proposed halibut PSC limit for hook-and-line gear fisheries may
be further apportioned as bycatch allowances to the directed fishery for demersal shelf rockfish in the Southeast
Outside District of the Eastern Regulatory Area and to all other hook-and-line gear fisheries. 
(iii) 

Seasonal apportionments. 

(A) NMFS, after consultation with the Council, may apportion each halibut PSC limit or bycatch allowance specified
under this paragraph on a seasonal basis. NMFS will base any seasonal apportionment of a halibut PSC limit or bycatch
allowance on the following types of information: 
(

1

) Seasonal distribution of halibut; 
(

2

) Seasonal distribution of target groundfish species relative to halibut distribution; 
(

3

) Expected halibut bycatch needs on a seasonal basis relative to changes in halibut biomass and expected catches of
target groundfish species; 
(

4

) Expected variations in bycatch rates throughout the fishing year; 
(

5

) Expected changes in directed groundfish fishing seasons; 
(

6

) Expected start of fishing effort; and 
(

7

) Economic effects of establishing seasonal halibut allocations on segments of the target groundfish industry.

(B) Unused seasonal apportionments of halibut PSC limits specified for trawl, hook-and-line, or pot gear will be
added to the respective seasonal apportionment for the next season during a current fishing year. 
(C) If a seasonal apportionment of a halibut PSC limit specified for trawl, hook-and-line, or pot gear is exceeded,
the amount by which the seasonal apportionment is exceeded will be deducted from the respective apportionment for
the next season during a current fishing year. 
(iv) 

Apportionment among regulatory areas and districts. 

Each halibut PSC limit specified under this paragraph (f) may also be apportioned among the regulatory areas and districts
of the Gulf of Alaska. 
(2) NMFS may, by notification in the 

Federal Register

, change the halibut PSC limits during the year for which they were specified, based on new information of the types
set forth in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. 
(3) 

Attainment of a halibut PSC limit or bycatch allowance

_ 
(i) 

Trawl gear fisheries. 

If, during the fishing year, the Regional Director determines that U.S. fishing vessels participating in either
of the trawl fishery categories listed in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(B) of this section will catch the Pacific halibut bycatch
allowance, or apportionments thereof, specified for that fishery category under paragraph (f)(1) of this section,
NMFS will publish notification in the 

Federal Register

 closing the entire Gulf of Alaska to directed fishing with trawl gear for each species and/or species group that comprises
that fishing category; provided, however, that when the halibut bycatch allowance, or seasonal apportionment thereof,
specified for the shallow-water species fishery is reached, fishing for pollock by vessels using pelagic trawl gear
may continue, consistent with other provisions of this part. 
(ii) 

Hook-and-line fisheries

_(A) 

Groundfish other than demersal shelf rockfish in the Southeast Outside District. 

If, during the year, the Regional Director determines that the catch of halibut by operators of vessels using hook-and-line
gear in groundfish fisheries other than the directed fishery for demersal shelf rockfish in the Southeast Outside
District will reach the halibut bycatch allowance, or seasonal apportionment thereof, specified for hook-and-line
gear under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, NMFS will publish notification in the 

Federal Register

 prohibiting directed fishing for groundfish, other than demersal shelf rockfish in the Southeast Outside District,
by vessels using hook-and-line gear for the remainder of the season to which the halibut bycatch allowance or seasonal
apportionment thereof applies. 
(B) 

Demersal shelf rockfish in the Southeast Outside District. 

If, during the year, the Regional Director determines that the catch of halibut by operators of vessels using hook-and-line
gear in the directed fishery for demersal shelf rockfish in the Southeast Outside District will reach the halibut
bycatch allowance, or seasonal apportionment thereof, specified for this fishery under paragraph (f)(1) of this
section, NMFS will publish notification in the 

Federal Register

 prohibiting directed fishing for demersal shelf rockfish in the Southeast Outside District by vessels using hook-and-line
gear for the remainder of the season to which the halibut bycatch allowance or seasonal apportionment thereof applies.

(iii) 

Pot gear fisheries. 

If, during the fishing year, the Regional Director determines that the catch of halibut by operators of vessels using
pot gear to participate in a directed fishery for groundfish will reach the halibut PSC limit, or seasonal apportionment
thereof, provided for under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, NMFS will publish notification in the 

Federal Register

 prohibiting directed fishing for groundfish by vessels using pot gear for the remainder of the season to which the
halibut PSC limit or seasonal apportionment applies. 
(4) When the vessels to which a halibut PSC limit applies have caught an amount of halibut equal to that PSC, the Regional
Director may, by notification in the 

Federal Register

, allow some or all of those vessels to continue to fish for groundfish using nonpelagic trawl gear under specified
conditions, subject to the other provisions of this part. In authorizing and conditioning such continued fishing
with bottom-trawl gear, the Regional Director will take into account the following considerations, and issue relevant
findings: 
(i) The risk of biological harm to halibut stocks and of socio-economic harm to authorized halibut users posed by continued
bottom trawling by these vessels; 
(ii) The extent to which these vessels have avoided incidental halibut catches up to that point in the year; 
(iii) The confidence of the Regional Director in the accuracy of the estimates of incidental halibut catches by these
vessels up to that point in the year; 
(iv) Whether observer coverage of these vessels is sufficient to assure adherence to the prescribed conditions and
to alert the Regional Director to increases in their incidental halibut catches; and 
(v) The enforcement record of owners and operators of these vessels, and the confidence of the Regional Director that
adherence to the prescribed conditions can be assured in light of available enforcement resources. 


* * * * * 


(h) * * * 
(1) 

Calculations.

 (i) In making any determination concerning directed fishing under paragraph (g) of this section, the amount or percentage
of any species, species group, or any fish or fish products will be calculated in round-weight equivalents. 
(ii) Arrowtooth flounder or any groundfish species for which directed fishing is closed may not be used to calculate
retainable amounts of other groundfish species under paragraph (g) of this section.

Natural Resource Damage Assessments 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of the Interior.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice solicits comment on proposed revisions of the regulations for assessing natural resource damages resulting
from a discharge of oil into navigable waters under the Clean Water Act or a release of a hazardous substance under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. The Department of the Interior has previously
developed two types of natural resource damage assessment regulations: Standard procedures for simplified assessments
requiring minimal field observation (the type A rule); and site-specific procedures for detailed assessments in
individual cases (the type B rule). 


The Department is proposing, as part of its compliance with a court remand, to revise the type B rule to address the use
of the economic methodology known as contingent valuation to assess lost values of injured natural resources. In
general, the Department is considering and soliciting comment on a proposed natural resource damage assessment
rule regarding contingent valuation recently published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
pursuant to the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. This notice constitutes the Department's proposed rulemaking document
and solicits comment on rule language under consideration for a final rule. Upon consideration of the comments received
in response to this notice, the Department intends to issue a final rule. The Department recently published a final
rule to revise the type B rule to comply with all other aspects of the court order.

I. Background 


A. Statutory Provisions 


The Clean Water Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) (CWA) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (42 U.S.C. 9601 

et seq.

) (CERCLA) authorize natural resource trustees to recover compensatory damages for injury to, destruction of, or
loss of natural resources resulting from a discharge of oil into navigable waters or a release of a hazardous substance.
CWA sec. 311(f); CERCLA sec. 107. Federal and State officials may be designated to serve as natural resource trustees
under CERCLA and CWA. CERCLA also recognizes the authority of Indian tribes to commence actions as natural resource
trustees. 
Damages may be recovered for those natural resource injuries and losses that are not fully remedied by response actions.
All sums recovered in compensation for natural resource injuries must be used to restore, rehabilitate, replace,
or acquire the equivalent of the injured natural resources. Trustee officials may also recover the reasonable costs
of assessing natural resource damages and any prejudgment interest. 
CERCLA requires the promulgation of two types of regulations for the assessment of natural resource damages resulting
either from a discharge of oil under CWA or from a release of a hazardous substance under CERCLA. CERCLA sec. 301(c).
The type A regulations constitute standard procedures for simplified assessments requiring minimal field observation.
The type B regulations constitute site-specific procedures for detailed assessments. Both regulations identify
the best available procedures for determining natural resource damages. Assessments performed by Federal and State
natural resource trustee officials in accordance with these regulations receive a rebuttable presumption in court.
CERCLA sec. 107(f)(2)(C). The promulgation of these regulations was delegated to the Department of the Interior
(the Department). E.O. 12316, as amended by E.O. 12580. 
The Oil Pollution Act (33 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) (OPA) was signed into law on August 18, 1990. Among other things, OPA amended
the natural resource damage provisions of CWA. OPA authorized the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) to develop new natural resource damage assessment regulations for discharges of oil into navigable waters.
The Department is coordinating its rulemakings with NOAA to ensure, to the maximum extent appropriate, that consistent
processes are established for assessing natural resource damages under CERCLA and OPA. OPA provides that until NOAA
develops final regulations, the Department's regulations may be used to assess natural resource damages under OPA.
OPA sec. 6001(b). 


B. Regulatory History 


The Department has issued various final rules for the assessment of natural resource damages: 51 FR 27674 (Aug. 1,
1986); 52 FR 9042 (March 20, 1987); 53 FR 5166 (Feb. 22, 1988); and 53 FR 9769 (March 25, 1988). These rulemakings are
all codified at 43 CFR part 11. The Department also recently published a final rule that has not yet been codified in
the Code of Federal Regulations. 59 FR 14261 (March 25, 1994). 
The natural resource damage assessment regulations provide an administrative process for conducting assessments
as well as technical methods for the actual identification of injuries and calculation of damages. Under the regulations,
both type A and type B, assessments consist of four major phases. 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940504-1-00051 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940504-1-00018 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The first phase of an assessment conducted under the regulations involves the activities that precede the actual
assessment. For example, upon detecting or receiving notification of a discharge or release, trustee officials
perform a preassessment screen to ascertain whether further assessment actions are warranted. 
The second phase involves the preparation of an Assessment Plan. The Assessment Plan, which is subject to public review
and comment, assists the involvement of other interested trustee officials, potentially responsible parties (PRPs),
and the general public. The Assessment Plan also ensures that assessments are performed at a reasonable cost.
In the third phase, trustee officials conduct the work described in the Assessment Plan. The work involves three steps:
Injury Determination; Quantification; and Damage Determination. In Injury Determination, trustee officials
determine whether any natural resources have been injured. If trustee officials determine that resources have been
injured, they proceed to Quantification, in which they quantify the resulting reduction in services provided by
the resources. Finally, in Damage Determination, trustee officials calculate the monetary compensation to be sought
as damages for the natural resource injuries. 
In a type A assessment, trustee officials perform Injury Determination, Quantification, and Damage Determination
through the use of standardized procedures involving minimal field work. The Department has adopted a phased approach
to developing type A procedures for different environments. Only one type A procedure has been developed to date.
The existing type A procedure provides for the use of a computer model to assess damages from small releases or discharges
in coastal or marine environments. For other releases or discharges, trustee officials conduct a type B assessment,
in which Injury Determination, Quantification, and Damage Determination are performed through the use of a range
of alternative scientific and economic valuation methodologies. This notice addresses the use of a particular valuation
methodology during the Assessment Phase.
The fourth phase of every natural resource damage assessment, whether the type A or type B rule is followed, consists
of post-assessment activities such as: Preparation of a Report of Assessment; establishment of an account for damage
assessment awards; and development of a Restoration Plan for use of the awards.


C. Judicial Review


A party may petition the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review any regulation issued under
CERCLA. CERCLA sec. 113(a). A number of parties filed such petitions for review of the natural resource damage assessment
regulations. 
The type B rule was challenged in 

State of Ohio 

v. 

United States Department of the Interior

, 880 F.2d 432 (DC Cir. 1989) (

Ohio 

v. 

Interior

). The court in 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior

 upheld various challenged aspects of the type B rule but did remand three issues. The court ordered the Department
to revise the rule to reflect the statutory preference for using restoration costs as the measure of natural resource
damages. The court used the term ``restoration costs'' to encompass the cost of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing,
and/or acquiring the equivalent of the injured natural resources. 880 F.2d at 441. 
The court also ordered the Department to allow for the assessment of all reliably calculated lost values of injured
natural resources, including both lost use values and lost nonuse values. Use values are derived through activities
such as hiking or fishing. Nonuse values are not dependent on use of the resource. Nonuse values include existence
value, which is the value of knowing that a resource exists, and bequest value, which is the value of knowing that a resource
will be available for future generations. Finally, the court asked the Department to clarify whether the natural
resource damage assessment regulations apply to natural resources that are not actually owned by the government.
The type A rule was challenged in State of 

Colorado 

v. 

United States Department of the Interior

, 880 F.2d 481 (DC Cir. 1989) (

Colorado v. Interior). The court held that, based on the reasoning in the Ohio 

v. 

Interior 

decision, the type A procedure for coastal and marine environments should be revised to allow for the calculation
of restoration costs.


D. Implementation of the Court Order


The Department published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on September 22, 1989, to announce its intent to
revise the type B rule to comply with 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior.

 54 FR 39016. The Department issued a proposed rule on April 29, 1991, with comments requested by June 28, 1991. 56 FR
19752. On July 2, 1991, the Department extended the comment period to July 16, 1991. 56 FR 30367. On July 22, 1993, the
Department reopened the comment period to allow consideration of additional comments, including newly developed
information on the contingent valuation methodology (CV), the only method currently available for the express purpose
of estimating nonuse values. 58 FR 39328. The comment period was originally reopened until September 7, 1993, and
then extended until September 22, 1993. 58 FR 45877 (Aug. 31, 1993).

After reviewing the comments received in response to the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice, the Department proposes to revise the type B rule to include appropriate standards to improve the reliability
of CV when used to estimate lost nonuse values. The Department is issuing this notice to ensure that interested parties
have an adequate opportunity for review and comment. 
On March 25, 1994, the Department published a final rule to revise the type B rule to comply with all aspects of the 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior

 remand other than the assessment of lost nonuse values. 59 FR 14281. Pending completion of this rulemaking, the Department
is temporarily leaving unchanged the language of the original type B rule concerning the assessment of lost nonuse
values. 


E. Other Rulemakings 


CERCLA mandates biennial review and revision, as appropriate, of the natural resource damage assessment regulations.
The Department plans to begin the biennial update of the type B rule in July 1994. All aspects of the administrative
process and the type B rule will be subject to review during that update. During the biennial review, the Department
will consider ways of ensuring the greatest consistency appropriate between its damage assessment regulations
and the damage assessment regulations being developed by NOAA. 
Further, later this year the Department plans to issue a proposed rule to revise the type A rule for coastal and marine
environments in compliance with 

Colorado 

v. 

Interior

. The Department is also developing an additional type A rule for assessing damages in the Great Lakes. Like the type
A rule for coastal and marine environments, the type A rule for the Great Lakes will incorporate a computer model. 


II. Calculation of Damages Under the Type B Rule 


A. Costs of Restoration, Rehabilitation, Replacement, and/or Acquisition of Equivalent Resources 


The type B rule as originally published on August 1, 1986, provided that damages consisted of the lesser of the cost
of restoring the injured resources (plus the lost interim use value) or the diminution in the value of the injured resources
without restoration. In 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior

, the court ordered the Department to revise the rule to reflect the statutory preference for using restoration costs
as the measure of natural resource damages. CERCLA provides that sums recovered in natural resource damage actions
may be used to restore, rehabilitate, replace, or acquire the equivalent of the injured natural resources. The court
used the simple term ``restoration'' costs as shorthand for the cost of performing any of these actions. 880 F.2d at
441. On March 25, 1994, the Department published a final rule that revised the type B rule to allow trustee officials
to recover the costs of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources
in all cases. 59 FR 14281. 
The March 25, 1994, final rule provides guidance on projecting the costs of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing,
and/or acquiring the equivalent of the injured resources. Under that final rule, trustee officials first identify
and consider a reasonable number of possible alternatives for restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, and/or acquiring
the equivalent of the injured resources. Trustee officials also estimate those services that are likely to be lost
to the public pending completion of each alternative under consideration. Trustee officials then select one of the
possible alternatives based on several factors. The trustee officials document their decisions in a Restoration
and Compensation Determination Plan, which is subject to public review and comment. 
Once the trustee officials select a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative,
they choose the methods they intend to use to estimate the costs of implementing that alternative. To do this, trustee
officials select among specified cost estimating methodologies. Trustee officials include the rationale for their
selection in the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan. 


B. Compensable Value 


Under the March 25, 1994, final rule, the costs of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, and/or acquiring the equivalent
of the injured resources are the basic measure of damages; however, these costs are only one component of the damages
that trustee officials may assess. Trustee officials also have the discretion to assess the value of the resource
services that the public lost from the date of the release or discharge until completion of restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources. 59 FR 14283. The term ``compensable value'' is used to
encompass all of the lost public economic values, including both lost use values and lost nonuse values. The Restoration
and Compensation Determination Plan includes a description of the methodologies trustee officials intend to use
when estimating compensable value during Damage Determination. 
The original type B rule provided a ranked list of methodologies that could be used to calculate lost use values. If
the market for the injured resource was ``reasonably competitive,'' then the diminution of the market price attributable
to the discharge or release was used to estimate damages. If a market price methodology was not applicable, then the
trustee officials were required to use appraisal methodologies. Only when neither market-price nor appraisal methodologies
were appropriate for the resources being assessed did the original version of the rule allow trustee officials to
use non-market-based methodologies.

Further,   11.83(b)(2) and 11.83(d)(5)(ii) of the original version of the type B rule provided that lost
nonuse values could only be assessed if trustee officials could not determine any lost use values. In the August 1,
1986, preamble to the original type B rule, the Department provided the following explanation for this restriction:




Ordinarily, option and existence values would be added to use values. However, section 301(c) of CERCLA mentions
only use values. Therefore, the primary emphasis in this section is on the estimation of use values * * *
Another related reason for this limitation is that more is known about the determination of use values than option
and existence values. Option and existence values are less well-defined and more uncertainty surrounds their measurement.
51 FR 27719.






Ohio

 v. 

Interior

 held that the type B rule incorrectly established a strong presumption in favor of the use of market price and appraisal
methodologies to estimate lost use values. The court also held that the Department had ``erroneously construed the
statute'' with regard to the assessment of lost nonuse values. The court stated:




(S)ection 301(c)(2) requires Interior to ``take into consideration factors including, 

but not limited to

 * * * use value.'' 42 U.S.C. 9651(c)(2) (emphasis added). The statute's command is expressly not limited
to use value; if anything, the language implies that DOI is to include in its regulations other factors in addition
to use value. 880 F.2d at 464.




The court went on to say that the Department




is entitled to rank methodologies according to its view of their reliability, but it cannot base its complete exclusion
of option and existence values on an incorrect reading of the statute. Id.




The court instructed the Department to consider a rule that would permit trustee officials to include all reliably
calculated lost values in their damage assessments. Id.



CV is currently the only method available for the express purpose of estimating nonuse values. Under the original
type B rule, CV was listed as a non-market-based methodology for calculating either lost use or lost nonuse values.


Ohio

 v. 

Interior

 upheld the Department's inclusion of CV as a ``best available procedure.'' Id. at 478. However, the court did not require
the Department to allow unlimited use of CV. Moreover, the court did not address the difference between use of CV to
calculate lost use values and use of CV to calculate lost nonuse values.

The March 25, 1994, final rule leaves trustee officials free to choose among the listed valuation methodologies,
including CV, when estimating lost use values. 59 FR 14285-86. The final rule provides a number of criteria to
guide the selection of valuation methodologies, including a requirement that the chosen methodologies are reliable
for the particular incident and type of damage being measured. The final rule renumbers   11.83(b)(2)
and 11.83(d)(5)(ii) of the original rule, which restrict the assessment of lost nonuse values to cases where lost
use values cannot be determined, as new   11.83(c)(1)(iii) and 11.83(c)(2)(vii)(B), respectively.
Pending completion of this rulemaking to address the final issue affected by the 

Ohio

 v. 

Interior

 remand, the Department is temporarily leaving unchanged the language of these renumbered sections.



III. Contingent Valuation: Discussion and Rule Language Under Consideration



CV is a survey-based approach to the valuation of nonmarket goods and services that relies on a questionnaire for the
direct elicitation of information about the value of the good or service in question. The value obtained for the good
or service is said to be contingent upon the nature of the constructed (hypothetical or simulated) market and the good
or service described in the survey scenario. In the natural resource damage assessment context, CV studies generally
derive values through elicitation of respondents' willingness to pay (WTP) to prevent injuries to natural resources
or to restore injured natural resources.

The first published CV study, valuing outdoor recreation, appeared in 1963. There are now over 1,400 documented papers,
reports, and books on CV. In recent years, CV has become one of the most widely used methods of nonmarket valuation.

Four basic elements common to CV questionnaires are: (1) An explanation of the structure and rules of the market in
which the good or service being valued is either bought or sold; (2) a description of the good or service and how it is
to be provided; (3) the value elicitation question; and (4) validation questions to verify comprehension and acceptance
of the scenario and to elicit socioeconomic and attitudinal characteristics to interpret the variation in responses
to the valuation question across respondents. There are no universal rules on how each of these elements of a CV questionnaire
should be designed, since the appropriate formulation of each depends on the good or service being valued and its context
and, consequently, will vary across applications.

CV surveys generally measure total value of a good or service, which includes both use values and nonuse values. However,
nonuse values, unlike use values, are not linked to observable behavior and, thus, are more difficult to validate
externally than use values. Therefore, criticisms of CV pertain primarily to its use in valuing the nonuse component
of total value and the difficulty of external validation of that component of total value. Among the most commonly
cited criticisms of CV studies of nonuse values are: The stated intentions of WTP in CV surveys may exceed ``true''
WTP; CV may produce results that appear inconsistent with the tenets of rational choice; respondents to CV surveys
on nonuse may be unfamiliar with the good or service being valued and therefore may not have an adequate basis for articulating
their true value; CV respondents may be expressing a value for the satisfaction (warm glow) of giving rather than the
value of the good or service in question; and respondents may fail to take CV questions seriously because the financial
implications of their responses are not binding. Most proponents of CV acknowledge that poorly designed and administered
CV studies can produce results that reflect the potential problems identified above. However, proponents also assert
that these problems are not inherent to the method and that well-designed and well-executed CV studies can eliminate
them or render them inconsequential. Proponents further assert that survey design, development, and administration
standards will improve quality control for CV surveys.

The Department received many, often conflicting, comments on the use of CV to calculate nonuse values. As the Department
noted in the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice, NOAA convened a panel of economic and survey experts (the NOAA panel), pursuant to its rulemaking authority
under OPA, to evaluate the reliability of CV to measure nonuse values. The NOAA panel issued a report in January, 1993.
58 FR 4601 (Jan. 15, 1993).

Based upon consideration of all comments received and the NOAA panel report, the Department is proposing to revise
the type B rule to include standards for the use of CV to estimate lost nonuse values. The Department believes that standards
to improve the reliability of CV surveys of lost nonuse values are needed in the Department's type B rule, because assessments
performed in accordance with the rule will be given a rebuttable presumption in litigation over the specific amount
of money a particular party must pay as compensation for liability. However, this same level of precision for CV surveys
may not necessarily be required for other applications of CV, such as use of CV in regulatory cost-benefit analyses.

On January 7, 1994, NOAA published a proposed natural resource damage assessment rule under OPA. 59 FR 1062. Section
990.78(b)(5) of NOAA's proposed rule includes standards for the use of CV. 59 FR 1182-83; see also 59 FR 1142-48.
In the interest of consistency and after consultation with other Federal agencies, the Department is soliciting
comment on whether the Department's type B rule should be revised to include standards for the use of CV substantially
similar to those proposed by NOAA. Upon consideration of the comments received in response to this notice, the Department
intends to issue a final rule.

NOAA's proposed standards for use of CV cover five areas: (1) Survey instrument design and development; (2) survey
administration; (3) the nature of the results; (4) calibration; and (5) reporting. NOAA's proposed standards are
intended to provide flexibility to trustee officials so that they can take advantage of new developments that may
occur in CV methodology. Further, any standards included in the Department's type B rule may be subject to amendment
during the statutorily required biennial review of the regulations to reflect the results of new research.



A. Survey Instrument Design and Development



The reliability of a CV study begins with the design and development of the survey instrument. NOAA has proposed several
survey instrument design and development standards. The Department solicits comment on whether the same standards
should be included in the Department's type B rule. NOAA's proposed rule language, which the Department is considering
for its type B rule, is as follows:




Survey instrument design and development_(A) Willingness to pay for Prevention or Restoration. (1) The survey instrument
shall elicit from respondents their willingness-to-pay (WTP) either to prevent described injuries to natural resources
or to restore injured resources as described to their baseline or comparable condition.

(2) The trustee(s) shall document the rationale for selecting a prevention program or restoration program as the
commodity to be valued.

(B) Commodity definition. (1) During development of the survey, the trustee(s) shall determine whether respondents
understood and found credible the description of the injuries (including whether they are permanent or interim losses)
and the program (including the timing of the process) for preventing injuries or restoring the natural resources.

(2) Prior to the value elicitation, the trustee(s) shall identify the natural resource context of the injured resources,
if related resources exist, including commodities that might serve as substitutes.

(C) Budget constraints. Prior to the value elicitation, respondents shall be reminded of their budget constraints
and their alternative expenditures. Respondents shall be reminded that their WTP for the environmental program
in question would reduce their expenditures on other goods. This reminder should be more than perfunctory, but less
than overwhelming. The goal is to induce respondents to keep in mind other likely expenditures, including those on
other environmental goods, when evaluating the main scenario. After the value elicitation, respondents shall be
reminded again of their alternative expenditure possibilities. Respondents shall be given an opportunity to reconsider
and change their votes (bid) after this second reminder of alternative expenditure possibilities.

(D) Comparability with real transactions. (1) The survey instrument shall use a credible choice mechanism and payment
vehicle.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940504-1-00055 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940504-1-00018 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) The trustee(s) shall select a choice mechanism that is incentive compatible and shall document the rationale
for the selected choice mechanism. 
(3) The trustee(s) shall ask follow-up questions to determine whether the respondents accepted the choice mechanism
and payment vehicle as credible. 
(4) (Note: Calibration requirement discussed in Section III.D of this notice)* * * 
(E) Pretesting. (1) Survey development shall include adequate field testing to ensure that the above design criteria
are met. 59 FR 1182-83. 

 

One important aspect of survey instrument design and development is the selection of a choice mechanism. Past CV studies
have used different methods to elicit values, including open-ended WTP questions; bidding cards; and voting formats
typically termed ``referenda.'' The Department believes that selection of a choice mechanism should be left to the
discretion of trustee officials, as provided in NOAA's proposed rule. Nonetheless, the Department believes that
the current state of the art shows many advantages for using a voting format as the choice mechanism for CV surveys in
natural resource damage assessments. Therefore, if trustee officials select a choice mechanism other than a voting
format, they should document the factors that led them to reject a voting format. Nevertheless, the Department solicits
comments regarding the incentive compatibility of alternative choice mechanisms and whether the final regulation
or its preamble should state a preference for the voting format. The Department also solicits comments regarding
the administrative and analytical costs associated with alternative choice mechanisms. 
The Department believes that the method of elicitation should be one with which people are familiar and one which provides
a realistic context in which respondents can choose to increase levels of public goods. Local jurisdictions and State
governments often ask voters to increase taxes on themselves so that public goods may be increased (e.g., school bond
issues; special assessments for public infrastructure). Second, in our society, most goods are offered using posted
prices. Asking an individual to reveal his or her maximum WTP for a good is both unfamiliar and unrealistic. Third,
it is important that respondents believe that they will receive the program offered in the CV survey. To CV respondents,
the cost of the program naturally determines the price they must pay. If no set price is offered, the respondents may
perceive uncertainty regarding the program's costs and, therefore, uncertainty regarding the provision of the
program. Finally, the voting format is incentive compatible. Respondents must reveal their preference and vote
for the program if they desire the program at the stated price. Voting against or refusing to vote will only lower the
probability of obtaining the program. 


B. Survey Administration 


The most carefully designed CV survey can produce unreliable results if the survey administration is faulty. NOAA
has proposed several standards for survey administration. The Department solicits comment on whether the same standards
should be included in the Department's type B rule. NOAA's proposed rule language, which the Department is considering
for its type B rule, is as follows:

 

Survey administration_(A) Sampling procedures. (1) The trustee(s) shall determine the relevant population(s)
to be sampled and document the rationale for that determination. 
(2) The trustee(s) shall draw a probability sample(s) from the target population for the administration of the final
survey. Less rigorous sampling is suitable for pretesting and pilot surveys so long as the heterogeneity of the target
population is considered. 
(3) The sample size(s) shall be sufficient to draw statistically significant population inferences and to estimate
WTP valuation functions or to test relevant statistical hypotheses. 
(4) The trustee(s) shall minimize nonresponse bias to the extent practicable by striving for as high a response rate
in the final survey as possible, consistent with the requirements of reasonable cost. In no case shall the response
rate be less than seventy percent. 
(5) The trustee(s) shall document the rationale for the selected response rate. 
(B) Mode of administration. (1) The trustee(s) shall document the rationale for the selected mode of survey administration.

(2) If interviewers are used, the survey administration shall be conducted by trained interviewers who are supervised
by experienced interviewer field managers. 
(3) Regardless of the mode of administration, the trustee(s) shall use an experienced survey research organization
to administer the survey.

<TEXT>
 

(C) Confidentiality. The trustee(s) should ensure respondent confidentiality. 59 FR 1183. 



One important aspect of survey administration is the determination of an appropriate response rate. The Department
believes that trustee officials should obtain as high a response rate as possible, consistent with the requirements
of reasonable cost, in order to ensure reliable inferences to the general population. Low response rates pose a risk
of compromising the statistical validity of the survey when nonrespondents have systematically different values
than respondents. Another risk associated with low response rates is that estimates of response variance may be significantly
affected such that the indicated confidence of survey results is questioned. Since the likelihood of these risks
cannot be determined unless nonrespondents have been surveyed, trustee officials should minimize nonresponse
in the final survey to the extent practicable. For example, trustee officials could design the survey instrument
so that individuals must decide whether to respond before the exact nature of the environmental insult is revealed.

NOAA has proposed that response rates shall not fall below 70 percent. The Department solicits comments on whether
there should be a specified minimum response rate and, if so, whether 70 percent is a reasonable floor. Further, the
Department solicits comments regarding the administrative costs associated with alternative response rates.

Another important aspect of survey administration is selection of the mode of administration. The three generally
used CV survey administration modes are in-person, mail, and telephone. There are advantages and disadvantages
of each method, and often the selection of the appropriate method is dependent on a number of factors such as cost, turn-around
time, desired response rate, type of information to be conveyed, use of visual aids, required population coverage,
and the ultimate use of the survey results. For example, telephone surveys can approximate simple random sampling
of households through random digit dialing; can produce fast results; are relatively easy to administer; and are
less expensive than in-person interviews. On the other hand, visual aids cannot be used; interviews need to be relatively
short; interviewer bias may be involved; and individuals without telephones are necessarily omitted from the sample.
Self-administered mail surveys are the least costly of the three methods. However, probability sampling is difficult;
respondents can review the survey before deciding to participate (imparting self-selection bias); there can be
no random selection within the household and no control of question sequencing; and a higher number of incomplete
responses are likely to result because there is no interviewer to motivate the respondent. Finally, in-person interviews
permit random selection of the respondent within the household; maintain control of question ordering; allow the
use of visual materials; and generate high response rates. In-person interviews, though, are the most costly method
to administer; require complex field operations; involve the use of many documents and forms (e.g., calling cards,
interviewer evaluation forms, verification forms); and may involve interviewer bias. For a more in-depth discussion
of each method, see EPA, ``Survey Management Handbook,'' vol. II, pp. 24-35, 230/12-84-002, December,
1984. 
The Department believes that selection of a mode of administration should be left to the discretion of trustee officials,
as provided in NOAA's proposed rule. Nonetheless, the Department believes that in-person interviews provide certain
advantages in the natural resource damage assessment context. Therefore, if trustee officials select a mode of administration
other than in-person interviews, they should document the factors that led them to reject in-person interviews.
The Department solicits comments on whether the final regulation or its preamble should state a preference for in-person
interviews. 
While recognizing that mail surveys can provide invaluable information for many academic studies and regulatory
purposes (e.g., the U.S. decennial census), the Department believes that mail surveys at this time lack certain features
that are desirable for use in the natural resource damage assessment context. Telephone surveys also have limitations.
A CV survey designed for natural resource damage assessment purposes is likely to impart a large amount of information
to respondents causing interviews to be lengthy and often complex. In-person interviews offer the opportunity to
motivate the respondents and to hold their interest by providing important information in a graphic and pictorial
format and asking interactive questions regarding the respondents' understanding and acceptance of key features
of the survey instrument. In-person interviews also permit interviewers to record verbatim responses to important
open-ended questions. Such information may be critical in demonstrating that a trustee official has adhered to regulatory
standards for the design and administration of the CV study. 
The Department also believes that trustee officials should consider the use of modes of administration other than
in-person interviews during the survey instrument development stage. For example, a telephone survey may be an appropriate
and cost-effective method to test a design feature such as question ordering or the understanding of technical terms.
Further, the Department is interested in comparative empirical testing of other administration modes, such as random
digit dialing for initial contacts, followed by mailed descriptive information and visual materials, culminating
with a telephone survey. If such testing demonstrates that other modes can produce the type of information and results
comparable to in-person interviews, the Department would consider encouraging trustee officials to use those methods
for the final survey. 
Regardless of the mode of administration, the Department believes that all surveys should be administered by a survey
research organization, as provided in NOAA's proposed rule. The Department believes that use of a survey research
organization is necessary because the preparation and administration of a general population survey require practical
survey expertise and substantial logistical support. The Department also believes that trustee officials should
select a survey research organization that has implemented procedures to meet the standards outlined in either the
Council of American Survey Research Organizations' Code of Standards for Survey Research or the American Association
for Public Opinion Research's Code of Professional Ethics and Practices. Use of such an organization would help to
maintain reliability and confidentiality. Further, such organizations are likely to have proven track records
and the staff necessary to conduct a survey in accordance with any regulatory standards. Nevertheless, the Department
solicits comments regarding the requirement that surveys be administered by an experienced survey research organization.
Further, comments regarding alternative codes of standards for survey administration are solicited.

C. Nature of Results 



A commonly expressed concern about CV is that it can produce results that are not sensitive to all relevant characteristics
of the described natural resource injuries and methods of preventing or restoring the injured resources. NOAA has
proposed a test to address this concern. The Department solicits comment on whether the same test should be included
in the Department's type B rule. NOAA's proposed rule language, which the Department is considering for its type B
rule, is as follows:




Nature of results. (A) Scope test. Controlling for attitudinal, demographic, perceptual, and other differences
across respondents, the trustee(s) shall demonstrate statistically that the aggregate WTP across all respondents
for the prevention or restoration program increases (decreases) as the scope of the environmental insult is expanded
(contracted). The scope of the environmental insult is characterized by the severity of the natural resource injuries
and the level of effectiveness and timing of the restoration or prevention program. The demonstration shall be conducted
through the use of split samples. 

(B) Number of scenarios. The trustee(s) shall administer to split samples different survey instruments containing
three variations of the scope of the environmental insult that respondents perceive as different unless the trustee(s)
can provide a reasonable showing that the three-scenario test is infeasible due to considerations of cost or lack
of plausibility of scenarios. Where three scenarios are feasible, the statistical test shall involve pairwise comparisons.
In either case, the scenarios may vary along any of the margins of intensity, geography, and duration of damage and,
for prevention scenarios, the probability of an event occurring. The trustee(s) shall document the rationale for
the selected variations of the scope of the environmental insult. In determining the descriptions to be used with
the split samples, the trustee(s) shall use realistic injury scenarios and prevention or restoration programs that
the respondents accept as credible. 

(C) Maximum amount of difference between scenarios. The trustee(s) shall develop scenarios for the total value test.
Prior to the performance of the test, the trustee(s) shall demonstrate that not more than ninety-five percent of respondents
in a pre-test or in focus groups indicate that there are meaningful value differences between the scenarios to be tested
in any pairwise comparison. The demonstration shall be based on a minimum of sixty valid responses. The trustee(s)
shall exclude from this demonstration any individuals who indicate in screening questions that they are not willing
to pay anything for any size environmental cleanup or who would be willing to pay unrealistically large and invariant
amounts for any size environmental cleanup. 59 FR 1183.




If this test were included in the Department's type B rule, one important aspect would be the determination of the relevant
dimensions of the scope of the environmental insult. The scope of an environmental insult such as a discharge of oil
or release of a hazardous substance is multi-dimensional, where the dimensions are influenced by biological and
social attributes. A discharge or release can affect all or part of an ecosystem. Its effects can be short- or long-lived,
lethal or sublethal, geographically contained or widely dispersed. From the human perspective, the effects of a
discharge or release may be directly visible and disturbing, or out of sight and perceived only indirectly once there
is knowledge about the loss of natural resources. 

In the first phase of NOAA's proposed test, the relevant dimensions of the scope of the discharge or release under investigation
would need to be identified. Once the trustee official had defined the relevant dimensions of scope, the trustee official
would employ a split sampling technique where some respondents were provided with an alternative survey instrument.
The trustee official would begin the analysis with the primary survey instrument that would be used to estimate the
values lost due to the discharge or release in question. This instrument would be designated the base instrument.
Trustee officials would pre-test and perform pilot tests on the instrument to ensure that the instrument met any design
and development standards. Analyses performed using incompletely developed or tested preliminary instruments
would not be considered evaluations of scope sensitivity because in these situations it would not be possible to distinguish
the effects of variations in survey instrument design from the effects of changes in the scope of the injury or proposed
prevention or restoration program. 

In designing a CV survey instrument, trustee officials would determine the dimensions of scope that were relevant
to the discharge or release under investigation and decide whether there existed a subset of dimensions that were
important to the values being measured or whether all of the dimensions were linked and therefore equally important.
In cases where a subset were deemed important, trustee officials would choose whether to scale these dimensions up
or down in relation to the levels described in the base instrument and by how much to scale the dimensions. If all relevant
dimensions were to be scaled, trustee officials would still decide in which direction and magnitude to scale each
dimension. 

After the trustee officials had decided on the dimensions to be scaled, in what direction and by how much, they would
produce second and third instruments that differed from the base instrument only with respect to the scope dimensions.
Trustee officials could choose to scale dimensions regarding the injury description, dimensions concerning the
prevention or restoration programs offered to respondents, or both. Regardless, trustee officials must take care
to ensure that the expected ordinal change in WTP remains unambiguous when simultaneously scaling different dimensions.


The scope test would be designed to determine ordinal changes in the aggregate WTP estimates. The Department is considering
a hierarchy of preferred scope tests. The first priority in this hierarchy would be to demonstrate the transitivity
of aggregate WTP estimates with respect to the scope of the environmental insult. The second priority would be to demonstrate
the sensitivity of aggregate WTP estimates to both an expansion and a contraction of the environmental insult. 

The most preferred test would involve two alternative instruments: One reflecting an expansion of the environmental
insult from that described by the base instrument and the other reflecting a contraction of the environmental insult
from that described by the base instrument. Joint pairwise comparisons would determine whether the three aggregate
WTP estimates were transitive (i.e., A<B and B<C, where B is the aggregate WTP estimate of the base instrument).


The Department recognizes that such a test may not be feasible all cases. It may not be feasible in some cases to design
credible alternative instruments reflecting either an expansion or a contraction of the environmental insult.
For those cases, the second most preferred test would involve two alternative instruments: Both reflecting either
an expansion or a contraction of the environmental insult from that described by the base instrument. Regardless,
joint pairwise comparisons would determine whether the three aggregate WTP estimates were transitive (e.g., A<C
and C<B, where B is the aggregate WTP estimate of the base instrument). 

Alternatively, it may not be feasible in some cases to determine whether the three aggregate WTP estimates were transitive
if different dimensions were scaled in the two alternative instruments. For those cases, the third most preferred
test would involve separate pairwise comparisons to determine ordinal changes in the aggregate WTP estimates (e.g.,
A<B and C<B, where B is the aggregate WTP estimate of the base instrument).

<TEXT>
 

Finally, it may not be feasible in some cases to design two credible alternative instruments. For those cases, the
test would involve one alternative instrument reflecting either an expansion or a contraction of the environmental
insult from that described by the base instrument. This would be the least preferred test. In all cases, trustee officials
would be required to document the rationale for the selected scope test. The Department solicits comments on the need
for and desirability of such a hierarchy of preferred scope tests. 

After the scaled instruments were pretested, all three instruments would be employed in a split sample design. Since
inferences to the relevant population would not be part of a scope analysis, true probability sampling would not be
required and convenience samples could be employed so long as random assignment of the different treatments were
maintained. Trustee officials would endeavor to employ large samples in these analyses since changes in scope could
be small and large samples may be needed to attain significant differences in WTP. Trustee officials would be free
to demonstrate sensitivity to scope using statistical techniques of their choosing. 

The validity of the scope test could depend on the respondents' perception of differences in the scope dimensions
across the three treatments. Trustee officials would include questions that could be used to determine whether respondents
understood and found credible the description of the injuries. 

The three-scenario approach would not be required when trustee officials provided a reasonable showing that it was
infeasible due to considerations of cost or lack of plausibility of the scenarios. In such circumstances, trustee
officials could perform the analysis using only the original scenario and one alternative scenario. However, as
CV surveys are routinized and their costs fall, trustee 
officials may find that the three-scenario analysis is feasible in most cases. 

Concern has been expressed that differences between the scenarios not be so large that passing the scope test would
be a foregone conclusion, nor so small that it would be very difficult to demonstrate statistical differences without
extremely large (and costly) split samples. The issue is complicated by the possibility, based on the State of Alaska-sponsored
study of the Exxon Valdez spill, that a significant minority of the population may be insensitive to any reasonable
differences in scenarios: Some individuals may not be willing to pay anything for any environmental cleanup, others
may be willing to pay unrealistically high (and invariant) amounts for any size environmental cleanup. In response
to this concern, NOAA has proposed that trustee officials should develop procedures for identifying and eliminating
these responses, so that the demonstration that the scenarios are meaningfully different would rest on the remaining
participants. To accept the scenarios for the scope test, no more than 95 percent of the remaining participants could
indicate that the differences between the scenarios were real and meaningful, i.e. that the values of the respective
commodities differed. The Department is seeking comment on ways to design such a procedure to demonstrate differences
in scenarios, and on alternative schemes to achieve a comparable goal. For example, should ``insensitive'' individuals
be excluded from the survey and, if so, how should such individuals be identified? How should the threshold defining
``meaningful differences'' be characterized? Should the threshold criterion for determining ``meaningful difference''
be adjusted, since individuals impose internal consistency on their answers in the face of direct comparisons (recognizing
much finer differences than in split samples)? Once a procedure has been developed to determine if individuals are
sensitive to the scope of the environmental insult, should this information be incorporated into the selection of
the sample for the scope test? 

While NOAA's proposed rule would require a split sample with multiple scenarios for demonstrating the scope test,
the Department seeks comment on the option of alternatively using an indirect test to explain variation in WTP as a
function of a set of explanatory variables, including belief in the size of the damage scenario, and/or effectiveness
of the prevention or restoration program. Commenters should consider under what circumstances such an indirect
test should be allowed for performing the scope test. An indirect approach examines the sensitivity to scope indirectly
through the use of a WTP valuation function, relying entirely on the base instrument. In the context of a single dichotomous
choice referendum (or a double-bounded formulation), a WTP valuation function may relate the probability of a yes
vote to a list of variables assumed to underlie the voting decision (e.g., the amount the household is asked to pay,
household demographics, etc.). The indirect approach may expand this list to include variables based on information
collected from respondents that are related to the scope dimensions of the discharge or release. These measures must
be meaningful to the respondent given the information provided in the survey. For example, a useful question following
the WTP elicitation question is one that asks whether the respondent believed the injuries caused by the discharge
or release to be more or less severe than described. All other things being equal (i.e. similar preferences, budget
constraints, etc.), respondents believing the injuries to be worse than described, and having equal confidence
in the prospects for restoring the injured resources through the offered plan, might be willing to pay more. Such a
finding would be an indirect verification of scope sensitivity.

D. Calibration



NOAA has proposed a requirement that trustee officials calibrate WTP values derived from CV studies to ``actual''
WTP. The Department is aware of a number of studies examining the relationship between ``hypothetical'' WTP and ``actual''
WTP. In this work, an effort is made to calibrate hypothetical WTP values derived from CV studies to actual WTP. The
results of this work are not definitive and are based on CV studies of a lower quality survey design than would be required
under NOAA's proposed rule. However, because of uncertainty associated with CV estimates, the Department is soliciting
comment on whether the calibration requirement in NOAA's proposed rule should be included in the Department's type
B rule. NOAA's proposed rule language requiring calibration is as follows:




The survey instrument or analysis method shall provide a factor for calibrating hypothetical WTP to actual WTP. The
trustee(s) shall document the rationale for the selected calibration factor. If the survey instrument or analysis
method fails to provide such a factor or the trustee(s) fails to document the rationale for the selected factor, actual
WTP shall be presumed to be one-half of stated WTP. 59 FR 1183.




As NOAA's preamble recognizes, the proposed default factor was included for the purpose of soliciting comment. 59
FR 1146.

The Department seeks comment on a number of questions regarding the calibration of CV results. Is a calibration requirement
necessary in light of the other proposed standards for survey instrument design and development, survey administration,
and nature of results? Is a calibration requirement warranted given that, but for the difficulties in elicitation,
willingness to accept (WTA) would be a more appropriate measure of damages than WTP? The economics literature concludes
that, for changes in the provision of a public good, the difference between WTA and WTP depends on the availability
of substitute goods. The fewer substitutes available, the greater the difference between WTA and WTP. See W.M. Hanemann,
``Willingness to Pay and Willingness to Accept: How Much Can They Differ?'' American Economic Review, vol. 81, pp.
635-647 (1991). This result suggests that WTP may significantly understate WTA, the more appropriate measure
of damages for natural resource injuries. The Department also seeks comment on: The rationale for calibration or
the justification for assuming that hypothetical WTP equals actual WTP; the appropriate default, if any, for a calibration
factor; whether a calibration requirement should be included in a technical information document rather than in
the rule; and whether inclusion of a calibration requirement is consistent with the 

Ohio

 v. 

Interior

 decision upholding the inclusion of all reliably calculated values in a damage assessment.

Finally, the Department solicits comments regarding whether marketing research which attempts to establish relationships
between stated intentions to purchase and actual purchase behavior for private goods is relevant to the calibration
of CV results for natural resource damage assessments. If commenters believe that research to be relevant, additional
comments are solicited regarding the appropriate actual behavior with which similar relationships could be established
the hypothetical behavior elicited by CV studies. Commenters should explicitly state the behavioral links between
the suggested actual behavior and the hypothetical behavior elicited by CV studies.

The Department wishes to emphasize to those who support the use of a default calibration factor that they should supply
specific information to support whatever factor they believe the Department should adopt. The adoption of a definite
calibration factor would have to be supported by information in the administrative record.



E. Reporting



NOAA has proposed a standard for reporting the results of CV surveys. The Department solicits comment on whether the
same standard should be included in the Department's type B rule. NOAA's proposed rule language, which the Department
is considering for its type B rule, is as follows:




Reporting. The trustee(s) shall ensure that reports of contingent valuation studies discuss the relevant factors
identified in the standards pertaining to survey instrument design and development, survey administration, and
nature of results in this section. A copy of the survey instrument shall be included. 59 FR 1183.

F. Additional Requests for Comment



1. Prior Knowledge



The objective of conducting a CV study in a natural resource damage assessment is to determine the damages suffered
by the public as a result of a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance into the environment. For consideration
of lost nonuse values, the relevant public may include the entire U.S. population, or may include a regional subset
of the population. Damages may be sustained by each individual in the relevant public, but only a small fraction of
the public will actually participate in the survey. The damages an individual suffers from a discharge or release
depend on many factors. These include the effects of the discharge or release on natural resources, how much the individual
uses the services provided by the injured resources, individual preferences, and the individual's information
about the release or discharge and the world in general.

In conducting the survey, it is necessary to educate the respondent about the natural resource itself, the facts surrounding
a discharge or release, and the impacts of the discharge or release on the resource. This education process greatly
changes the respondent's information set. Upon gaining this new information, respondents are then asked to place
a value on the losses suffered. There is general agreement that the losses an individual experiences from a discharge
or release after learning the new information are likely to be systematically different than the losses they would
experience prior to learning the new information.

Some commenters have argued that the fact that the CV method itself actively changes the information set of an individual
prior to valuing the good or service makes it fundamentally different from other economic valuation methodologies.
These commenters have questioned whether it is appropriate to extrapolate value estimates based on post-survey
information to the general population. Given the assessment's objective of estimating damages owed to the public
at large, and the small fraction of the public that actually participates in the survey, some have argued that the relevant
information set for the purposes of extrapolating to the general population is the pre-survey information set. One
way to move towards value estimates that reflect the information set of the general public is to obtain information
in the survey itself regarding the respondents' pre-existing knowledge about the resource and injury to it. Regardless
of the value a respondent states after learning information from the survey, those respondents who were not aware
of the resource or an injury to it or both would be assigned a value of zero. The rationale for assigning a zero value is
that if X percent of the survey respondents did not know about the resource or injury, then X percent of the relevant
public is likely to be similarly uninformed. (Implicit is the assumption that individuals who are unaware of the injury
at the time of the survey would continue unaware, but for the survey, for the foreseeable future.)

Other commenters have articulated the point of view that the level of respondents' prior information about the injury
is irrelevant to the determination of natural resource damages. According to these commenters, an education process
increases the reliability of CV by exposing respondents to a uniform set of information regarding the characteristics
of the commodity, availability of substitutes, and prices. Consumers undertake a similar education process in private
markets to form their demands for other commodities. In this sense, the education process is necessary so that CV is
not fundamentally different from other valuation methodologies. Further, these commenters have stated that the
fact that an individual is not informed of a specific injury does not mean that he or she suffers no loss as a result of
the injury. Natural resources are held in trust for the public. Therefore, WTA rather than WTP would be the most appropriate
measure of lost values of injured resources, were it not for the technical difficulties involved in eliciting WTA.
Each member of the public has an interest in the injured natural resources being valued regardless of whether he or
she is aware of the particular resources and injuries. Therefore, these commenters believe it would be inappropriate
to require that CV respondents' values only be counted if they were aware of the injured resources before the survey.

The Department seeks comments on whether it is appropriate to use information regarding pre-existing knowledge
of respondents to reassign to zero any positive values expressed by individuals who were unaware of the injuries prior
to the survey in the calculation of damages. Commenters who believe it is appropriate to assign zero damages to individuals
with limited prior knowledge should articulate the rationale for doing so. Commenters who believe that it is inappropriate
to assign zero damages to individuals with limited prior knowledge should articulate their rationale for using the
post-survey information set to extrapolate damages to a public that only has pre-survey information.

2. Screening or Threshold Factor 


Because of concern by many commenters that CV surveys may be undertaken in damage cases where expected damages may
be too small to justify the costs of the CV survey, the Department is seeking comment on the concept of a screening factor
that trustee officials should apply in deciding whether to conduct a CV survey of nonuse values in a particular case.
Factors currently limiting the use of CV include the high costs of surveys to meet NOAA's proposed standards, trustee
budget and staff limitations, and trustee desire for speedy judgment to enable expeditious restoration activities.
To employ an additional screening factor, expected damages might be estimated using a small sample with protocols
designed to minimize survey costs and, therefore, not necessarily subject to the standards contained in NOAA's proposed
rule. Alternatively, expected damages might be estimated by scaling damages estimated in other CV studies. Other
methods may be possible. Several possible thresholds have been suggested. These possibilities include setting
the threshold for a particular case at the greater of twice the expected cost of a full CV survey or the product of multiplying
$5 per household by the number of households expected to hold nonuse values for the resource of concern. The Department
is specifically seeking comment on: Whether such a screening factor would be appropriate; what form a factor might
take; whether the factor should apply to total damages or only to lost nonuse values; and whether inclusion of a screening
factor is consistent with the 

Ohio

 v. 

Interior

 decision upholding the inclusion of all reliably calculated values in a damage assessment. 



IV. Technical Information Document



The Department intends to work with NOAA and other interested agencies to develop a guidance document on use of CV.
This document will provide additional technical information on possible means of satisfying any standards contained
in the damage assessment regulations as well as other issues involved in conducting CV studies. Once a draft of the
document has been prepared, the Department will publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 announcing its availability and soliciting comment. 

The Department requests comments on additional tests for determining the reliability of CV estimates for possible
inclusion in the technical information document. In order to evaluate any additional tests, the Department requests
that commenters provide a complete list of the behavioral assumptions underlying their theoretical framework of
rational choice. The Department assumes that commenters will begin with what economists consider to be the generally
accepted axioms of neoclassical consumer choice theory or revealed preference theory. The Department requests
that commenters clearly state all further assumptions underlying the test and describe the sensitivity of the test's
results to the assumptions presented. Second, if commenters are proposing tests that rely on marginal or infra-marginal
changes in the scope of the injuries, the commenters should describe how the variation of scope dimensions involved
in the test would be quantified. Third, and perhaps most important, the Department asks that commenters explain how
any proposed test can be accomplished feasibly within the survey instrument design and development and survey administration
standards specified in NOAA's proposed rule. Tests causing CV surveys to violate these standards are themselves
unreliable tests. Fourth, the commenter should give examples of how these tests would be structured in the context
of a hazardous substance release.

Finally, commenters have expressed concern about the valuation of past nonuse losses. The Department believes that
when little time has elapsed since the occurrence of a nonuse loss, trustee officials might conclude that CV respondents'
WTP is not likely to have changed significantly. On the other hand, in cases where a great deal of time has elapsed since
the occurrence of the nonuse loss, determination of WTP becomes more problematic. Therefore, the Department is soliciting
comment on methods for estimating nonuse values lost over a significant amount of time for possible inclusion in the
technical information document.



V. Response to Comments



The Department received numerous comments on the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice. The Department appreciates the time and effort expended by the commenters. This notice discusses only those
comments concerning the assessment of lost nonuse values or the use of CV. All other comments submitted on the July
22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice are addressed in the notice of final rulemaking to revise the Department's type B rule, which was published
on March 25, 1994. 59 FR 14261.

Comment: 

The comments on the assessment of lost nonuse values were widely divergent but generally fell into two primary schools
of thought. One set of commenters thought that trustee officials should have the discretion to decide on a case-by-case
basis when lost nonuse values should be included in a damage assessment. These commenters stated that assessment
of lost nonuse values is necessary to ensure that the public is made whole for natural resource injuries. One commenter
noted that inclusion of lost nonuse values in damage assessments is particularly crucial in the case of injuries to
tribal resources because of the special spiritual and cultural significance that natural resources hold for Indian
tribes. Some commenters stated that if the Department does not include provisions for assessing lost nonuse values
in the regulations, then the Department would send inappropriate economic signals to PRPs and could cause risky activities
to be directed toward pristine environments where use values are very low. 

Further, this set of commenters thought that CV is a reliable methodology for calculating lost nonuse values. Some
of these commenters stated that studies purporting to demonstrate that CV produces unreliable results have failed
to distinguish between well and poorly designed CV surveys. A few of these commenters took issue with the Department's
discussion in the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice of the potential for bias in CV studies. Some commenters stated that the Department had failed to recognize
that the real bias lies in using methodologies that consistently undervalue public losses by computing compensable
value based solely on lost use values. Other commenters questioned the Department's statement in the July 22, 1993,


Federal Register

 notice that although all valuation methodologies have potential reliability problems, CV, when used to estimate
lost nonuse values, poses more significant problems because the per-person bias is multiplied by a larger population.
These commenters thought that the Department's line of reasoning, if taken to its logical extreme, would dictate
the nonsensical result that only small values should be measured. A number of commenters made reference to the report
issued by the NOAA panel. According to these commenters, the NOAA panel report concluded that CV can produce reliable
estimates of lost nonuse values.

The other set of commenters thought that the rule should not include any provisions for the assessment of lost nonuse
values. These commenters stated that assessment of lost nonuse values is not necessary to compensate the public because
trustee officials already have the discretion to assess lost use values in addition to the cost of restoring, rehabilitating,
replacing, and/or acquiring the equivalent of the injured resources. These commenters stated that assessment of
lost nonuse values was inconsistent with general legal principles designed to prevent speculative damages. For
example, the commenters noted that courts only allow certain categories of individuals to recover damages for pain
and suffering in tort cases. Other commenters stated that allowing assessment of lost nonuse values would be punitive
because it amounts to charging PRPs for hurting the public's feelings. Some commenters expressed concern that allowing
assessment of nonuse values could drive companies out of business and cause an increase in consumer prices. A few commenters
expressed skepticism that nonuse values were actually economic values.

This set of commenters also thought that CV cannot reliably calculate nonuse values. These commenters stated that
the results of CV studies are inconsistent with rational decisionmaking. For example, a number of commenters cited
CV surveys in which stated WTP did not respond to increases in the commodity being valued. Some commenters stated that
the results of CV surveys are overly sensitive to the wording and administration of the survey instrument. Several
commenters thought that CV results seem unrealistically high compared to actual contributions to environmental
causes. Some commenters stated that such disparities result because CV respondents do not adequately consider their
budget constraints when determining their WTP. A number of commenters thought that responses to CV surveys were likely
to reflect feelings of vengeance toward PRPs or the warm glow of supporting a worthy cause rather than the respondents'
actual WTP to prevent injury to the specific resources in question. Other commenters noted that CV studies require
respondents to perform difficult valuation tasks with which they have little prior experience. A few commenters
expressed particular concern about the public's ability to provide accurate values for injuries in industrial areas
where contamination may exist that is unrelated to the release in question.

Some commenters provided citations to studies purporting to demonstrate the unreliability of CV. A number of commenters
stated that even some CV practitioners have called CV experimental. Other commenters noted that the NOAA panel did
not conclude that CV could produce estimates of lost nonuse values that were reliable enough to be granted a rebuttable
presumption. Rather, according to these commenters, the NOAA panel stated that even if a CV study met a number of strict
standards, it would only be reliable enough to serve as a starting point in litigation. Therefore, these commenters
thought that even if the Department allowed CV to be used to estimate lost nonuse values, it should not grant the results
of CV studies of lost nonuse values a rebuttable presumption. Finally, most of the commenters who thought that CV was
unreliable when used to estimate lost nonuse values also thought that this unreliability was the result of fundamental
flaws that economists do not know how to correct at this time.

Response: 

Section 11.80(b) of the March 25, 1994, final rule provides that trustee officials have the discretion to include
all or a portion of compensable value in their natural resource damage assessments. 59 FR 14283. 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior 

held that the Department's type B rule should allow for the recovery of all reliably calculated lost values of injured
resources, including lost nonuse values. 880 F.2d at 464. Therefore, the focus of this notice is not whether lost nonuse
values per se are an appropriate component of a natural resource damage assessment. This notice addresses whether
lost nonuse values can be reliably calculated and, if so, under what conditions. 

The Department acknowledges that a poorly designed or administered CV study, like any poorly designed or administered
valuation study, can produce unreliable results. However, based on the evidence received to date, the Department
does not believe that CV is a fundamentally flawed methodology. The Department believes that a properly 
designed and administered CV study can produce reliable estimates of lost nonuse values. 

The Department also believes that the results of a CV study of lost nonuse values performed in accordance with whatever
standards are ultimately included in the type B rule should receive a rebuttable presumption. CERCLA provides that
the natural resource damage assessment regulations are to identify the best available procedures and that assessments
performed in accordance with the regulations receive a rebuttable presumption. 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior 

further instructed the Department to consider a rule that would permit trustee officials to include all reliably
calculated lost values in their damage assessments. The Department believes that a properly designed and administered
CV study is a best available procedure and can produce reliable estimates of lost nonuse values. 



Comment: 

There were numerous comments on possible guidance for the conduct of CV studies. A few commenters thought that guidance
was unnecessary. Most commenters, though, thought that some guidance was advisable. A number of commenters, noting
that NOAA is developing standards based on the NOAA panel report, suggested that the Department postpone development
of guidance until NOAA evaluates the report and issues a proposed rule. Some commenters thought that the Department
should incorporate NOAA's rulemaking record before deciding on guidance. Other commenters urged the Department
to make any proposed guidance available for public review and comment before issuing a final rule. 



Response: 

The Department believes that standards for the use of CV should be included in the type B rule to improve reliability.
The Department does not think it is advisable to incorporate NOAA's rulemaking record because that record covers
a wide range of issues beyond CV. However, the Department did consider the NOAA panel report. Also, numerous commenters
on the Department's July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice submitted copies of comments they had provided to NOAA on its rulemaking. The Department agrees that commenters
should have an adequate opportunity to review and comment on the standards being considered for the use of CV; therefore,
the Department has issued this notice. The Department invites commenters on NOAA's proposed rule to submit comments
to the Department on this proposed rule as well. 



Comment: 

A number of commenters responded to the Department's request for suggestions on the content of possible guidance
on the use of CV to estimate lost nonuse values. Several commenters suggested that the Department adopt some or all
of the standards contained in the NOAA panel report. Some commenters thought that the Department should include both
the standards in the NOAA panel report and additional standards. Other commenters offered their own standards. The
suggested standards covered six major areas: restrictions on the type of resource for which lost nonuse values could
be assessed; restrictions on the relevant population; protection against the influence of improper motives; standards
for ensuring that respondents consider all relevant factors when estimating their WTP; standards for determining
whether CV results are consistent with basic tenets of rationality; and methods of calibrating CV results. 

Some commenters thought that assessment of lost nonuse values should be limited to cases where there have been long-lasting
injuries to resources with few substitutes. These commenters stated that such a limitation was necessary to prevent
speculative claims. These commenters also agreed with the Department's statement in the July 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice that in cases where injuries are of short duration and where the injured resources have many substitutes, nonuse
losses are likely to be minimal. Other commenters objected to such a limitation noting that there is no empirical evidence
that there cannot be a loss of nonuse values in cases where injuries are of short duration or where there are many substitutes
for the injured resources. These commenters also noted that such a restriction is unrelated to reliability. Some
commenters stated that such a limitation might prevent assessment of lost nonuse values where individual animals
had been killed but overall population levels were unaffected. These commenters stated that the public may well experience
nonuse losses for the death of the individual animals since each individual animal is, in some sense, irreplaceable.

A number of commenters suggested that trustee officials be required to limit the relevant population to those persons
with prior knowledge of the release or discharge and the affected resources. These commenters thought that if individuals
did not have prior knowledge of the injury, then they could not have experienced a loss. 

Several commenters suggested that the Department develop standards to protect against the influence of improper
motives. These commenters expressed concern that respondents might provide answers based on the warm glow of supporting
a worthy cause rather than their WTP for injury prevention or resource restoration. These commenters also thought
that the Department should ensure that respondents are not motivated by vengeance against PRPs. In particular, some
commenters suggested that trustee officials be required to demonstrate that the results of a CV study do not change
if res
