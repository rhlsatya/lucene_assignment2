<USBUREAU>Foreign-Trade Zones Board</USBUREAU>




Foreign-Trade Zone 146; Lawrenceville, IL; Proposed Reorganization and Expansion of Foreign-Trade Subzones 146A
& 146B North American Lighting, Inc. 
(Motor Vehicle Lighting Products) Flora, IL 



An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the Bi-State Authority, grantee
of FTZ 146, Lawrenceville, Illinois, requesting authority for reorganization of and the expansion of zone activity
at Subzone 146A and Subzone 146B at the North American Lighting, Inc. (NAL), facilities in Flora, Illinois, and the
inclusion of a new facility in Salem, Illinois, as part of the reorganized subzone. The application was submitted
pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations
of the Board (15 CFR Part 400). It was formally filed on April 14, 1994. 

Subzones 146A and 146B were approved by the Board in 1988 for two adjacent manufacturing plant sites of NAL, both of
which are located within the Flora Industrial Park, Flora, Illinois (Board Order 371, 53 FR 5436, 2-24-88).
The two facilities (222,000 sq.ft./14 acres) were granted subzone authority to manufacture motor vehicle lighting
components and other related auto parts. Subzone 146B was formerly operated by Hella Electronics, Inc., a NAL affiliate.
Both plants are now operated as an integrated manufacturing unit by NAL. 

NAL has added a third manufacturing site (380,000 sq. ft. on 22 acres), located in the Salem Industrial Park, 1075 West
Main Street, Salem (Marion County), Illinois (30 miles west of Flora), which would become part of the reorganized
zone. Construction is underway at the Flora facilities which will increase manufacturing space to 355,000 square
feet. The completed expansion will yield a combined production capacity of some 28 million units annually. Based
on the restructured management of the operations, the applicant requests that all three manufacturing facilities
be consolidated under one subzone designation_146A. 

The production activity that would occur within the consolidated subzone would be essentially the same as that currently
occurring at the Flora facilities. The finished products would involve motor vehicle lighting components. Materials
purchased from abroad include: various polymers and resins in primary form (HTSUS Ch. 39), articles of rubber and
plastic, fasteners, optical elements of glass, certain electrical apparatus, lamps and lenses, insulated wire,
optical fiber and cable/bundles (duty rates: free-16%, 3.1$/kg+9%). 

Zone procedures exempt NAL from Customs duty payments on the foreign materials used in export production. On domestic
sales, the company is able to choose the duty rates that apply to finished automotive lighting equipment and parts
(free-10%) for the foreign components noted above. The auto duty rate (2.5%) applies if the finished products are
shipped via zone-to-zone transfer to U.S. motor vehicle assembly plants with subzone status. 

In accordance with the Board's regulations (as revised, 56 FR 50790-50808, 10-8-91), a member of
the FTZ Staff has been designated examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board. 

Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall
be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is July
5, 1994. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during
the subsequent 15-day period (to July 18, 1994). 

A copy of the application and the accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following
locations:




U.S. Department of Commerce District Office, 8182 Maryland Avenue, Suite 303, St. Louis, MO 63105.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



The Department may revoke an antidumping duty order or finding if the Secretary of Commerce concludes that it is no

we are notifying the public of our intent to revoke the following antidumping duty orders and findings for which the
Department has not received a request to conduct an administrative review for the most recent four consecutive annual
anniversary months:






If interested parties do not request an administrative review in accordance with the Department's notice of opportunity
to request administrative review, or domestic interested parties do not object to the Department's intent to revoke
pursuant to this notice, we shall conclude that the antidumping duty orders and findings are no longer of interest
to interested parties and shall proceed with the revocation.



Opportunity to Object



No later than 30 days from the publication date of this notice, domestic interested parties, as defined in  353.2(k)(3),
(4), (5), and (6) of the Department's regulations, may object to the Department's intent to revoke these antidumping
duty orders and findings.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of opportunity to request administrative review of antidumping or countervailing duty order, finding, or
suspended investigation.







BACKGROUND: 

Each year during the anniversary month of the publication of an antidumping or countervailing duty order, finding,
or suspension of investigation, an interested party as defined in section 771(9) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended,
may request, in accordance with   353.22 or 355.22 of the Commerce Regulations (19 CFR 353.22/355.22
(1993)), that the Department of Commerce (``the Department'') conduct an administrative review of that antidumping
or countervailing duty order, finding, or suspended investigation.




OPPORTUNITY TO REQUEST A REVIEW: 

Not later than May 31, 1994, interested parties may request administrative review of the following orders, findings,
or suspended investigations, with anniversary dates in May for the following periods:

<TEXT>
 

In accordance with   353.22(a) and 355.22(a) of the Commerce regulations, an interested party may request
in writing that the Secretary conduct an administrative review. For antidumping reviews, the interested party must
specify for which individual producers or resellers covered by an antidumping finding or order it is requesting a
review, and the requesting party must state why the person desires the Secretary to review those particular producers
or resellers. If the interested party intends for the Secretary to review sales of merchandise by a reseller (or a producer
if that producer also resells merchandise from other suppliers) which was produced in more than one country of origin,
and each country of origin is subject to a separate order, then the interested party must state specifically which
reseller(s) and which countries of origin for each reseller the request is intended to cover.

Seven copies of the request should be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, International
Trade Administration, room B-099, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230. The Department also
asks parties to serve a copy of their requests to the Office of Antidumping Compliance, Attention: John Kugelman,
in room 3065 of the main Commerce Building. Further, in accordance with   353.31(g) or 355.31(g) of the
Commerce regulations, a copy of each request must be served on every party on the Department's service list.

The Department will published in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of ``Initiation of Antidumping (Countervailing) Duty Administrative Review'', for requests received
by May 31, 1994.

If the Department does not receive, by May 31, 1994, a request for review of entries covered by an order or finding listed
in this notice and for the period identified above, the Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess antidumping
or countervailing duties on those entries at a rate equal to the cash deposit of (or bond for) estimated antidumping
or countervailing duties required on those entries at the time of entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption
and to continue to collect the cash deposit previously ordered.

This notice is not required by statute, but is published as a service to the international trading community.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Receipt of applications for experimental fishing permits. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS announces receipt of experimental fishing permit (EFP) applications from Terra Marine Research and Education
(TMRE), and Coastal Villages Fishing Cooperative (CVFC) and Golden Age Fisheries (GAF). TMRE requests approval
of an EFP to retain salmon caught incidentally in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) during the 1994 pollock
``B'' and the 1995 pollock ``A'' season fisheries and the 1995 BSAI directed Pacific cod trawl fishery. The purpose
is to assess whether the quantities of salmon donated to a foodbank program are sufficient to justify the costs associated
with the processing and shipping of the product. CVFC and GAF request approval of an EFP to assess the feasibility of
the establishment of an inshore fishery in the Kuskokwim Bay in the BSAI by the residents of this area.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Fishery Management Plan (FMP) and its implementing regulations specify that EFPs may be issued to authorize fishing
that otherwise would be prohibited by the FMP and regulations. The procedures for issuing permits are contained in
the regulations at  675.6. 


The EFP applications submitted by TMRE, CVFC, AND GAF have been accepted for review and copies were forwarded to the
North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council). The Council reviewed these applications at its April 18-22,
1994, meeting, which was held in Anchorage, AK. 
TMRE proposes to assess the feasibility of a voluntary donation of salmon caught incidentally in the directed 1994
pollock ``B'' and the 1995 pollock ``A'' season fisheries and the 1995 BSAI directed Pacific cod trawl fishery for
the purpose of distribution to foodbanks. CVFC and GAF propose to assess the commercial feasibility of fishing for
groundfish in the Kuskokwim Bay by the residents of this area by establishing a 500 metric ton allocation of groundfish
in this area during the period May 1 through September 30, 1994. Vessels participating in these EFPs will accommodate
a NMFS-certified observer at all times with costs paid for by operators of vessels fishing for the applicants. Information
regarding project design, disposition of fish harvested, and other matters is contained in the applications. 
Copies of the applications may be obtained from and comments should be addressed to the NMFS Regional Director (see

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy has issued a study comparing the transportation alternatives for the Waste Isolation Pilot
Plant (WIPP) transuranic waste shipping campaign in support of the disposal phase at the WIPP facility. The study
compares truck and train transport, including the use of dedicated trains. The study includes a consideration of
the following elements in association with each transportation mode: occupational and public risks and exposures,
other environmental impacts, emergency response capabilities, and an estimation of comparative costs. The report
is available upon request.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

WIPP is a research and development facility located in Southeastern New Mexico with the mission to demonstrate the
safe disposal of transuranic radioactive wastes resulting from defense activities and programs of the United States.
The study describes relevant transportation requirements and responsibilities of the U.S. Department of Energy,
the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the U.S. Department of Transportation. Responsibilities of States,
local governments, and Indian tribes are also included. The proposed transportation system is discussed which includes:
The shipping containers to be used, the transportation fleet, shipment options, waste volumes, training, and the
transportation tracking system. Risk analysis data is represented in the study in terms of occupational health and
public exposure risks, as well as environmental impacts associated with the proposed WIPP shipping campaign. Emergency
response capabilities for accidents involving radioactive materials for the states through which transuranic
waste will be transported during the disposal phase are outlined. Finally, cost comparative data is presented for
transportation by truck, regular train, and dedicated train.

<DOCTITLE>Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Gas Supply Realignment Costs; Supplemental Notice </DOCTITLE>






April 26, 1994.


On March 30, 1994, the Commission issued a notice (59 FR 16198, April 6, 1994) scheduling a public conference on May
26, 1994 in RM94-12-000 to examine the use of pricing differential mechanisms by interstate natural gas
pipelines to recover gas supply realignment costs. The Commission is redocketing this proceeding as Docket No. PL94-1-000.


At the conference, the Commission would be interested in hearing commenters' views on the following issues: 

1. The pricing differential mechanisms were designed to lessen the pipelines' costs of renegotiating gas supply
contracts. The theory was that providing pipelines a means to honor existing contracts while they were being renegotiated
would be less expensive for consumers than requiring contracts to be bought out immediately. Has this theory been
validated? 

2. How are the pricing differential cost (PDC) mechanisms functioning? 

a. What impact, if any, do the PDC mechanisms have on pipelines' renegotiations with producers? 

b. While the pipelines have been recovering PDCs, what percentage of their overall contract volumes and costs have
been finally resolved? 

3. What impact, if any, does the two-year authorization have on the use of the PDC mechanisms? What type of review should
the Commission undertake to evaluate specific PDC mechanisms if a pipeline seeks to extend the authorization? If
the Commission were to extend a pipeline's 2-year authorization period, what effect would that have on your response
to question 1? 

4. Are there alternatives to the PDC mechanisms? 

a. If so what are they? 

b. What impact would these alternatives have on the timing of cost recovery? 

5. There are various procedural ways the Commission can deal with subsequent quarterly PDC filings where the first
filing has been set for hearing. Possible alternative approaches include: establishing new hearings; consolidating
new filings with the existing hearing; or, making subsequent filings subject to the first proceeding. Are there other
approaches that should also be considered? 

The Commission will provide for remote viewing of the conference in Hearing Room 1, 810 First Street, NE., Washington,
DC. In addition, if there is sufficient interest, the Capitol Connection may broadcast the conference in the Washington,
DC metropolitan area or nationally. Those interested in the local or national television broadcast should call The
Capitol Connection at (703) 993-3100 no later than May 4, 1994. Requests from viewers outside of Washington,
DC should be directed to Julia Morelli or Shirley Al-Jarani. 

Any person who wishes to make a formal presentation to the Commission should submit a written request to the Secretary
of the Commission no later than May 2, 1994. Written statements to accompany oral presentations are welcomed, but
not required. Persons providing written statements should file 15 copies of the statement with the Office of the Secretary
by May 16, 1994, and 100 copies at least one hour prior to their oral presentation. 

All questions concerning the format of the technical conference should be directed to: Mary Hain, Office of the General
Counsel, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Room 4010J, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426,
Telephone: (202) 208-2143.

<DOCTITLE>Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp.; Notice of Request Under Blanket Authorization</DOCTITLE>




April 28, 1994.




Take notice that on April 22, 1994, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (TGPL), P.O. Box 1396, Houston, Texas
77251, filed in Docket No. CP94-372-000 a request pursuant to  157.205 and 157.212 of the Commission's
Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.212) for authorization to construct a new delivery point
under TGPL's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-426-000 pursuant to section 7 of the Natural
Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection


.

TGPL proposes to construct a new delivery point to Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont) in Mecklenburg County,
North Carolina. TGPL states that the new delivery point, referred to as the ``Hicks Crossroads Meter Station'', will
consist of a sixteen-inch tap on TGPL's Main Line ``C'', a sixteen-inch tap on Main Line ``D'' and a new metering and
regulating station, all located approximately at milepost 5.0 on TGPL's Cowan Ford Loop.

TGPL states that the Hicks Crossroads Meter Station will be used by Piedmont to receive into its distribution system
up to 204,000 Mcf of gas per day on a firm and/or interruptible basis TGPL states that it has sufficient system delivery
flexibility to accomplish these deliveries without detriment or disadvantage to TGPL's other customers.



TGPL further states that it is not proposing to alter the total volumes authorized for delivery to Piedmont. TGPL also
states that the addition of such delivery point will have no impact on TGPL's peak day deliveries and little or no impact
on TGPL's annual deliveries, and is not prohibited by TGPL's FERC Gas Tariff.

TGPL states that the construction and operation of its facilities will comply with the environmental requirements
set forth in  157.206(d) of the Commission's regulations, and that TGPL will obtain all required clearances
prior to the commencement of any construction work in the vicinity of the delivery point.



Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file
pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention
and pursuant to  157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request.
If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective
the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time
allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to
section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.

<DOCTITLE>Transwestern Pipeline Co.; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>



April 28, 1994.


Take notice that on April 25, 1994, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern) tendered for filing as part of its
FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheet, with a proposed effective date of April 25,
1994:




3rd Revised Sheet No. 5M




On August 6, 1994, the Commission issued its Order on Rehearing and Terminating Technical Conference, in the above-referenced
proceedings, directing Transwestern within thirty days to file revised tariff sheets to reflect the removal of:

(1) $4,200,000 of producer pricing settlement amounts,

(2) $2,219,314 of prior period adjustments, and

(3) $510,146 from Transwestern's direct bill to its former sales customers, and to refund with interest all the costs
excluded from its Account No. 191 direct bill filings (August 6 order). In the August 6 order, the Commission specifically
provided that Transwestern would be permitted to propose ``a prospective charge to recover these costs from its current
open access transportation customers.''

Transwestern requested rehearing of the August 6 order and, in addition, filed motions requesting additional time
with which to comply with the requirements of the August 6 order, which extensions were granted by the Commission.
On March 25, 1994, the Commission issued its ``Order Denying Rehearing,'' directing Transwestern to comply with
the requirements of the August 6 order and reiterated that Transwestern could file to recover the disallowed costs
through a mechanism that does not constitute a surcharge to its ``former sales customers based upon their past sales
contract demand'' (``March 25 order''). Accordingly and without waiving its rights to file an alternate rate mechanism
to recover the disallowed costs, Transwestern is filing a revised tariff sheet in compliance with the August 6 and
March 25 orders. The only changes Transwestern is proposing in Sheet No. 5M are to adjust the direct bill amounts in
accordance with such orders and to explain in footnote one that section 24, ``Gas Supply Inventory Charge'', has been
canceled.

Transwestern requested any waiver of any Commission Regulation and its tariff provisions as may be required to allow
the tariff sheet referenced above to become effective on April 25, 1994.

Transwestern states that copies of the filing were served on its gas utility customers, interested state commissions,
and all parties to this proceeding.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure. All such protests should be filed on or before May 5, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission
in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding.
Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

<DOCTITLE>Molokai Aquifer, Maui County, HI: Sole Source Aquifer Determination </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final determination. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to section 1424(e) of the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Regional Administrator of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency has determined that the aquifer underlying Molokai, Hawaii is the sole or principal source of drinking
water for the island. The Regional Administrator has determined that contamination of this aquifer would create
a significant hazard to public health. As a result of this determination, Federally financially assisted projects
constructed anywhere in the designated area will be subject to EPA review to ensure that they do not contaminate the
aquifer through a recharge zone so as to create a significant hazard to public health.

<DOCNO> FR940504-2-00036 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940504-2-00033 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Although the project review process cannot be delegated, EPA will consider, to the maximum extent possible, any existing
or future state, tribal, and local control mechanisms in protecting the groundwater quality of the aquifer. 


VI. Summary of Public Comments 


EPA received six letters during the comment period. Sixteen people spoke at the public hearing at Kaunakakai, Molokai,
Hawaii on January 6, 1994. Of those who expressed an opinion, six supported the designation of a Sole Source Aquifer
for Molokai, whereas one opposed a designation. The public's written and oral comments are fully addressed in EPA's
Responsiveness Summary which is available to the public during normal business hours at EPA, Water Management Division,
75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, California. 


VII. Economic and Regulatory Impact 


Pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that the attached
rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of this certification,
the term ``small entity'' shall have the same meaning as given in Section 601 of the RFA. This action is only applicable
to the area within the boundaries of the Molokai Sole Source Aquifer. The only affected entities will be those businesses,
organizations, or governmental jurisdictions that request Federal financial assistance for projects which have
the potential for contaminating the aquifer so as to create a significant hazard to public health. EPA does not expect
to be reviewing small, isolated commitments of financial assistance on an individual basis; accordingly, the number
of affected small entities will be minimal. 
For those small entities which may be subject to review, the impact of this action will not be significant. For most
projects subject to this review, a ground water impact assessment will be required pursuant to other federal laws,
such as the National Environmental Policy Act, as amended (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321, 

et seq.

 Integration of those related reviews with Sole Source Aquifer review will allow EPA and other federal agencies to
avoid delay or duplication of effort in approving financial assistance, thus minimizing any adverse effect on those
small entities which are affected. Finally, today's action does not prevent grants of Federal financial assistance
which may be available to any affected small entity in order to pay for the redesign of the project to assure protection
of the aquifer. 
Under Executive Order 12866, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``significant'' and therefore subject to the
requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis. This regulation is not significant because it will not have an annual
effect of $100 million or more on the economy, will not cause any major increase in costs or prices, and will not have
significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability
of United States enterprises to compete in domestic or export markets. This action only affects the area within the
boundaries of the Molokai Sole Source Aquifer. As a result of this action, no commitment of Federal financial assistance
(through a grant, contract, loan guarantee, or otherwise) may be entered into for any project which the Administrator
determines may contaminate such aquifer through a recharge zone so as to create a significant hazard to public health,
but a commitment for Federal financial assistance may, if authorized under another provision of law, be entered into
to plan or design the project to assure that it will not so contaminate the aquifer.

<USDEPT>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Meeting Held To Discuss Role of Cable in Proposed Changes to the Emergency Broadcast System


April 28, 1994.


The Federal Communications Commission is nearing completion of a rulemaking proceeding to modernize the present
Emergency Broadcast System (EBS), Docket FO 91-171 and FO 91-301. One of the areas under consideration
is the inclusion of cable television systems as an equal partner with broadcast stations in a new emergency alerting
system. On Wednesday, April 27, 1994, members of the Commission staff met in Washington, DC with some of the cable television
equipment manufacturers and cable operators that had filed comments in the docket on the integration of cable systems
into an alerting system.
The purpose of the meeting was to attempt to clarify and further document the estimated costs of emergency alerting
equipment in cable systems. Such costs include the purchase of equipment, and the operation of such an alerting system
over the multi-channel cable systems. While the discussions centered upon comments already filed with the Commission,
it was hoped that this further discussion would enhance the Commission's understanding of the nuances and details
for cable implementation of an alerting system.
An audio recording of the meeting was made and has been placed in the record as a part of the official proceeding in the
docket. The public and all interested parties are invited to review this recording which consists of approximately
six hours of discussion by the approximately 25 participants.
For further information contact the EBS staff at (202) 632-3906.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Region X Office of the Federal Emergency Management Agency gives notice that it has received a radiological emergency

governments near the WNP-2 Nuclear Power Plant located in Benton County, Washington.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 For continued operation of nuclear power plants, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires approved licensee
and State and local governments' radiological emergency response plans. In support of the Federal requirement for
emergency response plans, 44 CFR 350, Review and Approval of State and Local Radiological Emergency Plans and Preparedness,
describes its procedures for review and approval of State and local governments' radiological emergency response
plans. Pursuant to 44 CFR 350.7, Application by State for Review and Approval, the State of Oregon submitted its Radiological
Emergency Plan for the State of Oregon and Affected Counties to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Region X
Office, for review and approval under 44 CFR part 350.



Included are radiological emergency response plans for local governments that are wholly or partially within the
plume exposure pathway emergency planning zones of the WNP-2 Nuclear Power Plant. The Manual covers:

(1) Oregon's WNP-2 Emergency Response Plan, dated December 1993,

(2) Oregon's Hanford Emergency Response Plan, and

(3) Guidelines the State of Oregon, Morrow County, and Umatilla County will use to implement the plans in a WNP-2
and Hanford emergency. Oregon is not requesting FEMA review of the Oregon Hanford Plan section.

Copies of the Manual are available for review and copying at the FEMA Region X Office, or they will be made available
upon request in accordance with the fee schedule for FEMA Freedom of Information Act requests, as set out in subpart
C of 44 CFR part 5. There are 510 pages in this document; reproduction fees are $0.10 per page, payable with the request
for a copy.

44 CFR 350.10 also calls for a public meeting prior to approval of the plans. This meeting will be held in accordance
with 44 CFR 350.10 in Hermiston, Oregon, in advance of FEMA approval.

<DOCTITLE>Mellon Bank Corp.; Acquisition of Companies Engaged in Nonbanking Activities</DOCTITLE>



Mellon Bank Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (applicant), has applied pursuant to Section 4(c)(8) of the
Bank Holding Company Act (BHC Act) (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) and  225,23 of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23)
to acquire, directly or indirectly, all of the voting securities of the following directly or indirectly held subsidiaries
of the Dreyfus Corporation, New York, New York (Dreyfus):

(1) The Dreyfus Security Savings Bank, F.S.B., Paramus, New Jersey (DSSB), a federal savings bank (insured by the
FDIC, Bank Insurance Fund), and thereby engage in operating a savings association pursuant to 12 CFR 225.25(b)(9);


(2) The Dreyfus Trust Company, Uniondale, New York (DTC), a trust company holding a limited purpose charter from the
New York Department of Banking, and thereby engage in operating a trust company pursuant to 12 CFR 225.25(b)(3);

(3) Dreyfus Realty Advisors, Inc., New York, New York and Atlanta, Georgia (DRA), and thereby engage in certain investment
advisory activities related to the acquisition, management, and disposition of real estate and real estate-related
investments (DRA also has 21 wholly-owned corporate subsidiaries, each of which acts as a managing general partner
in certain real estate limited or general partnerships); and

(4) The Truepenny Corporation, New York, New York (Truepenny), a holding company for the Trotwood Corporation (Trotwood),
New York, New York, and thereby engage in certain community development initiatives and, with two of their subsidiaries
and through several partnerships, in a real estate development project in New York City, known as the Queens West Redevelopment
Project.

(5) Dreyfus Partnership Management, Inc., New York, New York (DPM), and thereby serve as a non-managing general partner
of two mutual funds organized as limited partnerships which are sponsored, advised and managed by Dreyfus;

(6) Major Trading Corporation, New York, New York (MTC), and thereby engage primarily in investing in securities,
including shares of certain mutual funds advised by Dreyfus-affiliates; and

(7) Dreyfus Acquisition Corporation, New York, New York (DAC), and thereby engage in making equity and debt investments,
including investments in certain mutual funds advised by Dreyfus-affiliates and in certain limited partnerships.


Applicant proposes to acquire the above companies simultaneously with the proposed acquisition of Dreyfus by its
subsidiary, Mellon Bank, N.A., which has filed a notice with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regarding
such proposed acquisition of Dreyfus. Applicant proposes to acquire DSSB, DTC, DRA, DPM, MTC, and DAC through a wholly
owned subsidiary, MBC Investments Corporation (MBC), and to acquire Truepenny directly.
Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
that the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires
that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine
that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case
that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public
benefits that outweight possible adverse effects.
A particular activity may be found to meet the closely related to banking test if it is demonstrated that banks have
generally provided the proposed activity; that banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally
similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity; or that banks
generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their provision
in a specialized form. 

National courier Assn 

v. 

Board of Governors

, 516 F.2d 1229, 1237 (DC Cir. 1975). In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the
activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement Regarding
Regulation Y (49 FR 806, January 6, (1984).
In order to satisfy the proper incident to banking test, section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act requires the Board to find that
the performance of the activities of the subsidiaries that Applicant proposes to acquire can reasonably be expected
to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency that
outweight possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition,
conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices. Applicant believes that the proposed activities will benefit
the public by enabling Applicant to provide a broader range of services to its customers and thereby enhance Applicant's
ability to compete and expand its participation in the investment advisory business. Applicant also believes that
the proposed activities will not result in any unsound banking practices or other adverse effects.

The Board has previously determined in   225.25(b)(9) and 225.25(b)(3) of Regulation Y that the operation
of a savings association and a trust company, respectively, are activities closely related to banking and permissible
for bank holding companies. Applicant states that DSSB and DTC will be operated in accordance with these sections.
DSSB operates out of a principal office in Paramus, New Jersey, has a branch office in San Francisco, California, and
has received approval from the Office of Thrift Supervision to open 13 additional interstate offices.

Applicant asserts that DRA's real estate-related investment activities are permissible under  225.25(b)(4)
of Regulation Y. Applicant has committed that DRA will cease to engage in any activities that are impermissible for
bank holding companies or their nonbank subsidiaries and that all subsidiaries of DRA will cease to engage in impermissible
activities or be divested within 2 years after consummation of the proposed transaction.

According to Applicant, the direct and indirect investments of Truepenny and Trotwood are authorized under  225.25(b)(6)
of Regulation Y as equity and debt investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community
welfare. Applicant asserts that the Queens West Redevelopment Project is designed to make affordable housing available
to persons of lower middle income and will create significant employment opportunities for low- and moderate-income
communities.

Applicant contends that its proposed investments in DPM, MTC and DAC are authorized under section 4(c)(7) of the BHC
Act, which permits bank holding companies to acquire shares of investment companies that engage solely in acquiring
5 percent or less of the securities of other companies. With respect to the role of DPM as non-managing general partner
to 2 mutual funds, Applicant claims that DPM engages only in investment activity permitted by section 4(c)(7) of the
BHC Act and that the managing general partners have complete and exclusive control over the management, conduct and
operation of the funds' business. Applicant commits to reduce any investment of DPM, MTC and DAC to below the 5% threshold
in section 4(c)(7) of the BHC Act, including limited partnership interests that qualify as voting securities under
 225.2(p) of Regulation Y.

In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice
of the proposal is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application
and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the
BHC Act.

Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551, not later than May 30, 1994. Any request for a hearing
on this application must, as required by  262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be accompanied
by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically
any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating
how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.

This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.

<USDEPT>GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the Construction of the Montgomery County, Maryland,
Campus for the Headquarters of the Food and Drug Administration</DOCTITLE>



Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 as implemented by the Council
on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508), and the General Services Administration (GSA)
guidelines PBS P 1095.4B, GSA and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announce their intent to prepare an Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) for the acquisition of 350 to 400 acres in Montgomery County, Maryland for the construction
of 2.1 million occupiable square feet (osf) of office and laboratory space for use by the FDA to house approximately
5,645 employees with 5,415 parking spaces. Acquisition of this site and construction of this facility will provide
one of three campuses planned to allow FDA to consolidate its facilities. FDA is located in three buildings within
the District of Columbia and 35 buildings in Maryland.

In March 1994, GSA advertised for expressions of interest from potential offerors to provide the required site. The
site is to accommodate the construction of a campus for the Headquarters of the Food and Drug Administration. The list
of sites that will be considered as alternatives in the EIS are as follows (not listed in order of preference):



 The Clarksburg Triangle Site



Approximately 535 acres in Clarksburg, Maryland, (bounded by Interstate 270, Route 121/Clarksburg Road, and Old
Baltimore Road).



 The King Farm Site



Approximately 355 acres in the vicinity of Gaithersburg and Rockville, Maryland, (bounded by Route 355/Frederick
Road, Shady Grove Road, Gude Drive and Interstate 270 at Piccard Drive).



 The Marriott/Milestone Site



Approximately 443 acres in Germantown, Maryland, (bounded by Interstate 270, Route 118/Germantown Road, and Route
355/Frederick Road).



 The National Geographic Site



Approximately 380 acres in Gaithersburg, Maryland, (bounded by Route 28/Darnestown Road, Great Seneca Highway,
Route 124/Quince Orchard Road, and Muddy Branch Road).

The EIS will focus on the Government's programmatic needs and potential short and long-term impacts that may result
from new construction. The consulting firms of Leo A. Daly and Greenhorne & O'Mara have been retained to prepare
the draft and final EIS.

GSA will initiate a scoping process for the purpose of determining the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying
the significant issues related to this proposed action. A public scoping meeting will be held on May 16, 1994, at 7 p.m.
at Rockville High School, 2100 Baltimore Road, Rockville Maryland.

A short, formal presentation will precede the request for public comments. GSA and FDA representatives will be available
at this meeting to receive comments from the public regarding issues of concern. It is important that Federal, State,
and County Agencies, interested individuals, and groups take this opportunity to identify environmental concerns
and significant issues that should be addressed by the EIS. In the interest of available time, each speaker will be
asked to limit their oral comments to five (5) minutes.

Agencies and the general public are also invited and encouraged to provide written comment in addition to, or in lieu
of, comments at the public meeting. To be most helpful, scoping comments should clearly describe specific issues
or topics which the commentator believes the EIS should address. Written statements concerning the alternatives
should be postmarked no later than June 6, 1994, to Mr. Andrew Dempster, Planning Staff (WPL) room 7618, National Capital
Region, General Services Administration, Room 7618, 7th and D Streets, SW, Washington, DC, 20407, Telephone (202)-708-5530.

<DOCTITLE>Meeting</DOCTITLE>





The National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), announces
the following meeting.




Name: Poverty-Associated Mental Retardation (PAMR) Prevention Technical Assistance Workshop for Planning Grant
Recipients.



Time and Date: 8:30 a.m.-4:30 p.m., May 10, 1994.


Place: Swissotel Atlanta, 3391 Peachtree Road, NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30326.

Status: Open to the public; limited only by the space available.


Purpose: The primary purpose of this workshop is to provide technical assistance to recipients of CDC grants as they
plan programs to prevent PAMR. The workshop is not designed to provide general information on mental retardation
or on prevention of PAMR.






<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The workshop will convent a group of recipients of CDC PAMR Planning Grants.





Seven of every 1,000 ten-year old children suffer from mild mental retardation, and three of every 1,000 suffer from
more serious mental retardation. Poor children, especially those whose mothers have less than a high school education,
are at risk of cognitive delay of as much as one standard deviation of IQ (15 points) at age three. Studies such as the
Infant Health and Development Program and the Carolina Abecedarian Project have proven that an intensive early health
and development intervention can prevent or reduce as much as two-thirds of PAMR. CDC is actively involved in research
and planning to help States develop a community-based program to prevent PAMR.








CONTACT PERSON FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: 

Edward A. Brann, M.D., Chief, Mental Retardation Prevention Section, Developmental Disabilities Branch, Division
of Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, NCEH, CDC, Mailstop F-15, 4770 Buford Highway, NE., Atlanta,

Public Workshop on Improvements in the Drug Master File System; Reopening of Comment Period


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; reopening of comment period.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reopening until June 3, 1994 the comment period for a notice that appeared
in the 

Federal Register

 of January 14, 1994 (59 FR 2413). The document announced a public workshop on possible improvements in the drug master
file (DMF) system. This action is based on a request for an extension of the comment period.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In the 

Federal Register

 of January 14, 1994 (59 FR 2413), FDA announced that on January 31, 1994, the agency would be holding a public workshop
on possible improvements in the DMF system, especially Type II DMF's, which concern drug substances, drug substance
intermediates, and materials used in their preparation, or drug products. The workshop focused on alternative ways
for the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) to review Type II DMF's for drug substances and intermediates.
The agency announced that it would accept data, information, or views on this subject until March 14, 1994.


The International Pharmaceutical Excipients Council (IPEC) requested that FDA extend the comment period for an
additional 60 days. IPEC explained that several of its members could not attend the public workshop because of a scheduling
conflict with the U.S. Pharmacopeia's Second Open Conference on Excipient Harmonization and that the members are
reviewing the transcript and summary of the workshop.
The purpose of reopening the comment period is to provide an opportunity for interested persons to submit comments
for review by CDER in considering possible improvements in the DMF system. FDA believes that reopening the comment
period until June 3, 1994, provides sufficient opportunity to comment on the workshop transcript and summary.
Interested persons may, on or before June 3, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this notice. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Announcement of Availability of Funds for Family Planning Service Grants

ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Population Affairs announces the availability of funds for FY 1995 family planning services grant projects
under the authority of Title X of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300, 

et seq.

) and solicits applications for competing grant awards to serve the areas and/or populations set out below.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Title X of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 300, 

et seq

., authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award grants to public or private nonprofit entities
to assist in the establishment and operation of voluntary family planning projects to provide a broad range of acceptable
and effective family planning methods and services (including natural family planning methods, infertility services,
and services for adolescents). The statute requires that, to the extent practicable, entities shall encourage family
participation. Also, Title X funds may not be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning. Implementing
regulations appear at 42 CFR part 59 subpart A.




On February 5, 1993, HHS published at 58 FR 7462 an interim rule that suspends the 1988 Title X rules (popularly known
as the ``Gag Rule''), pending the promulgation of new regulations. The principle effect of this action was to suspend
the definitions of ``family planning,'' ``grantees,'' ``prenatal care,'' ``Title X,'' ``Title X Program,'' and
``Title X Project'' presently found at 42 CFR 59.2 and 42 CFR 59.7-59.10. Proposed rules were also published
at 58 FR 7464 on the same date. During the pendency of rulemaking, the compliance standards that were in effect prior
to the issuance of the 1988 rule, including those set out in the 1981 Family Planning Guidelines, will be used to administer
the program. Copies of the pre-1988 compliance standards are available from the Regional Program Consultants listed
above.

The Title X program has established these five priorities:

(1) Expansion of current clinic sites and development of new clinics in high-need areas;

(2) Outreach to low-income women, adolescents and persons at high risk of unintended pregnancy or infection with
STD (including HIV) not now receiving family planning services;

(3) Increased emphasis on services to adolescents, including enhanced counseling as well as new service arrangements
for providing services to teens;

(4) Increased focus on quality and comprehensiveness of services, including treatment of STDs, screening for cervical
and breast cancer, substance abuse counseling, and counseling on avoidance of high risk behavior which may place
clients at risk for STD and HIV; and

(5) Increased emphasis on training and retention of family planning nurse practitioners, particularly minority
nurse practitioners and those working in clincis serving high-need populations.

These program priorities represent overriding goals which are being pursued to the extent that funding increases
or increases in program efficiency allow. Some funding may be available to Title X grantees to improve and expand services.

The Administration's FY 1995 budget request for this program is $199 million. This amount represents a 10 percent
increase over the appropriation for FY 1994 of $181 million, of which $168 million will be made available to Title X
service grantees. Approximately 16 percent of the funds appropriated for FY 1995 and made available to Title X service
grantees will be used for competing grants. The remaining funds will be used for non-competing continuation grants.
This program announcement is subject to the appropriation of funds and is a contingency action being taken to ensure
that, should funds become available for this purpose, they can be awarded in a timely fashion consistent with the needs
of the program as well as to provide for the distribution of funds throughout the fiscal year. Since the precise funding
levels for FY 1995 are uncertain at this point, the funding levels set out below are based on the FY 1993 appropriation
level. However, it is expected that funding levels will be increased if the appropriation for FY 1995 increases.

Approximately $168 million will be awarded nationwide during FY 1994 for Title X services. The entire $168 million
will be allocated among the 10 DHHS regions, and will be in turn awarded to public and private non-profit agencies located
within the regions. Each regional office is responsible for evaluating applications, establishing priorities,
and setting funding levels according to criteria in 42 CFR 59.11. 

This notice announces the availability of funds to provide family planning services in 11 States, Washington, DC
and Guam. Competing grant applications are invited for the following areas:

Applications must be postmarked or, if not mailed, received at the appropriate Grants Management Office no later
than close of business on application due dates listed above. Private metered postmarks will not be acceptable as
proof of timely mailing. Applications which are postmarked or, if not sent by U.S. mail, delivered to the appropriate
Grants Management Office later than the application due date will be judged late and will not be accepted for review.
(Applicants should request a legibly dated postmark from the U.S. Postal Service.) Applications which do not conform
to the requirements of this program announcement or do not meet the applicable regulatory requirements at 42 CFR part
59, subpart A will not be accepted for review. Applicants will be so notified,and the applications will be returned.

Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria:

(1) The number of patients and, in particular, the number of low-income patients to be served;

(2) The extent to which family planning services are needed locally;

(3) The relative need of the applicant;

(4) The capacity of the applicant to make rapid and effective use of the Federal assistance;

(5) The adequacy of the applicant's facilities and staff;

(6) The relative availability of non-Federal resources within the community to be served and the degree to which those
resources are committed to the project; and

(7) The degree to which the project plan adequately provides for the requirements set forth in the Title X regulations.

The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity for setting priority areas. This announcement is related to the
priority areas of Family Planning. Potential applicants may obtain a copy of Healthy People 2000 (Full Report: Stock
No. 017-001-00474-0) or Healthy People 2000 (Summary Report: Stock No. 017-001-00473-1)
through the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402-9325 (Telephone
(202) 783-3238).

The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people.



Application Requirements



Applications kits (including the application form, PHS 5161) and technical assistance for preparing proposals
are available from the regional offices. An application must contain:

(1) A narrative description of the project and the manner in which the applicant intends to conduct it in order to carry
out the requirements of the law and regulations;

(2) A budget that includes an estimate of project income and costs, with justification for the amount of grant funds
requested;

(3) A description of the standards and qualifications that will be required for all personnel and facilities to be
used by the project; and

(4) Such other pertinent information as may be required by the Secretary as specified in the application kit. In preparing
an application, applicants should respond to all applicable regulatory requirements. (The information collections
contained in this notice have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned control number 0937-0189.)



Application Review and Evaluation



Each regional office is responsible for establishing its own review process. Applications must be submitted to the
appropriate regional office at the address listed above. Staff are available to answer questions and provide limited
technical assistance in the preparation of grant applications.



Grant Awards



Grant projects are generally approved for 3 to 5 years with an annual non-competitive review of a continuation application
to obtain continued support. Non-competing continuation awards are subject to factors such as the project making
satisfactory progress and the availability of funds. In all cases, continuation awards require a determination
by HHS that continued funding is in the best interest of the Federal Government.



Review Under Executive Order 12372



Applicants under this announcement are subject to the review requirements of Executive Order 12372, State Review
of applications for Federal Financial Assistance, as implemented by 45 CFR part 100. As soon as possible, the applicant
should discuss the project with the State Single Point of Contact (SPOC) for each State to be served. The application
kit contains the currently available listing of the SPOCs which have elected to be informed of the submission of applications.
For those States not represented on the listing, further inquiries should be made by the applicant regarding the submission
to the Grants Management Office of the appropriate region. State Single Point of Contact comments must be received
by the regional office 30 days prior to the funding date to be considered.

When final funding decisions have been made, each applicant will be notified by letter of the outcome of its application.
The official document notifying an applicant that a project application has been approved for funding is the Notice
of Grant Award, which specifies to the grantee the amount of money awarded, the purpose of the grant, and terms and conditions
of the grant award.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent to award a competing renewal clinical training grant for the Minority Fellowship Program (MFP) to
the American Psychological Association. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) is publishing this notice to provide information to the public of its
intent to award a competing renewal MFP grant award to the American Psychological Association for the clinical training
of psychology students who are ethnic minorities for entry into service careers in mental and addictive health areas.
The project period for the competing renewal grant is anticipated to be three years. The first year's award will be
approximately $266,000. This is not a general request for applications. The competitive renewal clinical training
grant will only be made to the American Psychological Association.

 


AUTHORITY: 

The award will be made under the authority of section 303 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act. The authority to administer
this program has been delegated to the Director, CMHS. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number for this
program is 93.244.

 


BACKGROUND: 

CMHS has the responsibility for mental health workforce development, including the clinical training of mental
health professionals concerned with the treatment of underserved priority populations: Seriously mentally ill
adults; seriously emotionally disturbed children; and elderly, ethnic minorities and rural populations with mental
disorders; and individuals with co-occurring mental and addictive disorders. CMHS also has responsibility for
training ethnic minorities to become mental health professionals, which is a very significant task in light of the
gap between the growing ethnic minority populations requiring mental health services (approaching 25% of the total
population) and the much smaller number of ethnic minority mental health professionals (less than 10% of the total).




Over the past several decades, the Federal mental health clinical training program at NIMH (and currently at CMHS)
has addressed this gap primarily by attempting to increase the numbers of ethnic minority professionals. Ethnic
minority professionals understand the customs and language of their own particular ethnic group and, therefore,
are more likely to render high-quality mental health services to mentally ill minorities. 

The CMHS MFP is designed to facilitate the entry of minority students into mental health careers. The long-term goal
is to increase the number of professionals trained at the doctoral level to teach and provide mental health services,
especially to ethnic minority groups. 

The MFP was started at NIMH in the 1970s. This program for clinical training provides grants to each of the four core
mental health professional organizations: The American Nurses Association, the American Psychological Association,
the American Psychiatric Association, and the Council on Social Work Education. These 4 MFP grantees, in turn, conduct
national competitions to make individual graduate fellowship awards to minority students throughout the country.
Each of the four professional organizations has unique access to those students entering its profession. Each of
the four has recruited the best students, assured that all program requirements were satisfied, and monitored the
progress of fellows during and after the fellowship period. In short, there has been no reason to change the program
structure or the grantees administering the four-discipline program; thus, the mechanism of peer-reviewed competing
renewal clinical training grant has been appropriate. 

Therefore, because the American Psychological Association's MFP grant support will end in FY 1994, the CMHS is providing
additional support for up to three years via a competing renewal grant award. The American Nurses Association, the
American Psychiatric Association and the Council on Social Work Education have ongoing CMHS MFP grant support.

ACTION: 

Notification of resource management planning schedule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Resource management planning for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administered lands is governed by regulations
in 43 CFR 1610.2(b). These regulations require that the BLM publish a planning schedule advising the public of the
status of resource management plans (RMP's) in preparation. Projected new RMP starts for the three succeeding fiscal
years are also identified to provide the public an opportunity to comment on the projected planning schedule and aid
in the coordination of the schedule with other agencies.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A limited number of new starts for RMP's are projected. There are currently 34 RMP efforts underway (not including
amendments and revisions). It is forecasted that 11 of the RMP's will be completed in fiscal year 1994 and an additional
11 will be completed in fiscal year 1995. These efforts are having a significant effect on BLM capability to initiate
new RMP's and complete maintenance/monitoring and implementation of the existing RMP's. 




Upon completion of a major portion of the current ongoing RMP's, the BLM will start a limited number of new RMP's or RMP
revisions within its current capability. A priority ranking system will be utilized to allocate the limited new planning
efforts. New RMP starts for fiscal year 1994 include Snake River/Deep Creek RMP (Idaho). New starts for 1995 include
Malheur/Jordan RMP (Oregon) and Price RMP (Utah). New starts for 1996 include Andrews RMP (Oregon) and Winnemuca/Surprise
(Nevada). 

The planning process begins with the publication of a Notice of Intent to initiate an RMP. A public notice and and an
opportunity for participation in each RMP are provided as required by the regulations (43 CFR 1610.2(f)). Publication
of the draft RMP and associated draft environmental impact statement as indicated on the schedule is a key opportunity
for public comment. 

A key to the abbreviations used is provided after the schedule.

<DOCTITLE>Development of Permit Policy for Import of Giant Pandas; Suspension of Consideration of Giant Panda Import Permit
Applications, and a Review of Existing Policy on Giant Panda Import Permits </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces that it is suspending the review and processing of all future
import permit applications of giant pandas for temporary exhibition and/or captive-breeding loans until it has
completed an evaluation of available information and existing policies and guidelines relating to the import of
giant pandas and has published a new panda policy. This will allow the agency to examine the potential impact of future
imports on the survival of the giant panda. The Service will consider whether, and if so, how such imports into the United
States might contribute to giant panda conservation. Any draft policy or guidelines developed as a result of this
review will be published in the 

Federal Register

 for public review and comment. A public working meeting or meetings will be used to assist the Service in formulating
the draft policy.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The giant panda (

Ailuropoda melanoleuca

) is subject to U.S. and international protection as a result of its listing as an endangered species under the U.S.
Endangered Species Act and its inclusion in Appendix I to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Section 2(b) of the Endangered Species Act (Act) states that the purposes of the Act
``...are to provide a means whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend may
be conserved, to provide a program for the conservation of such endangered species and threatened species, and to
take such steps as may be appropriate to achieve the purposes of the treaties and conventions set forth in subsection
(a) of this section.'' CITES is one of the Conventions cited in subsection (a) of this statement. 



The Service is responsible for deciding whether to issue import and export permits required by the Act and CITES for
giant panda loans. Therefore, the Service must determine whether the purposes for such imports influence the continued
existence of giant pandas in the wild. The Service believes that existing regulations and policy, including its March
14, 1991 ``Policy on Giant Panda Import Permits'' (56 FR 10809) have been sufficient for individual panda import permit
decisions made to date. However, there is the possibility that an increasing number of import permits for numerous
pandas will be sought for captive breeding purposes in the United States in the near future. 

Before any import permit will be granted, it must be reviewed in terms of the application requirements of CITES and
the Act by the Service's Offices of Management and Scientific Authorities. Issuance of an import permit under CITES
requires prior findings that: (1) the proposed import would not be for purposes detrimental to the survival of the
species; (2) the import would not be for primarily commercial purposes; and (3) the permit applicant is suitably equipped
to house and care for the animal(s). Issuance of a permit under the Act requires prior determinations that, among other
things: (1) the import would be for scientific purposes or to enhance the propagation or survival of the species in
a manner consistent with the purposes and policies of the Act; and (2) issuance of the import permit would not be likely
to jeopardize the continued existence of the species. These requirements are further implemented by application
requirements and issuance criteria found in 50 CFR 13.12, 17.22, 23.14, and 23.15. With regard to making the first
finding listed above under both CITES and the Endangered Species Act, the issue is whether the detrimental effects
that might result from a loan would be sufficiently offset by specific enhancement features to allow a determination
that the import would be for purposes that are not detrimental and that would, in fact, enhance the survival of the species.


While the Service was processing a previous application to import a pair of giant pandas for a temporary exhibition
loan, the CITES Secretariat requested that the Service reevaluate its ``Policy on Giant Panda Import Permits'' for
temporary exhibition loans. Therefore, the Service published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 on June 29, 1992 (57 FR 28825), requesting public comments on this policy. Before this evaluation was completed, the
Service received additional applications for the import of giant pandas for purposes other than for temporary exhibition
loans, and determined the need for additional review and comment, resulting in this notice. To date, comments received
have not been incorporated into any revision of its existing policy, since such comments only were solicited on temporary
exhibition loans. 

On February 19, 1993, the Service received an application from the Zoological Society of San Diego to import a pair
of giant pandas for a captive-breeding loan. Shortly afterwards, on April 20, 1993, the American Zoo and Aquarium
Association (AZA) announced the development of a Giant Panda Conservation Action Plan, which currently includes
approximately 29 zoological institutions that have agreed to participate in a giant panda captive-breeding program
in North America.

It is estimated that there are fewer than 1000 giant pandas remaining in the wild in scattered and isolated populations,
and that approximately 100 are held in captivity. Conservation of the giant panda appears to involve two broad areas
of activities: habitat protection, management and expansion; and the captive breeding of animals with the ultimate
goal of reintroductions into available habitat. The primary concerns associated with individual giant panda import
permit applications are: (1) the potential for stimulating the unwarranted removal of additional pandas from the
wild; (2) the need for a clear connection between imports and conservation activities for giant pandas; (3) the need
to ensure that imports will not disrupt or defer existing captive-breeding efforts; and (4) the potential for planned
captive-breeding efforts in the U.S. to maximize the probability of enhancing international captive-breeding
efforts. With the possibility of receiving an increased number of import permit applications for giant pandas for
public exhibition and/or captive breeding purposes, the Service feels that a re-examination of the long-range implications
of panda imports is necessary to further ensure that such imports best serve the conservation needs of the species.

In response to these rapidly developing events and the increased interest in a coordinated captive-breeding program
for the giant panda, the Service has decided to suspend the review and processing of future permit applications for
the import of giant pandas until it has had an opportunity to evaluate additional and pertinent information on the
subject, and has developed, if necessary, new policy or guidelines for the issuance of import permits for giant pandas.
During this moratorium the Service will evaluate the potential effects of further loans on the survival of the giant
panda, including the cumulative impacts of an anticipated increase in the number of import permit applications from
U.S. institutions. 

As part of the review process, the Service will convene a public working meeting on May 26, 1994, (see 

DATES

 section of this notice), and perhaps additional meetings, to provide active participation in the process of developing
a proposed policy. The meeting will provide an opportunity for discussion of specific topics presented below. Interested
organizations and individuals that cannot participate in the meeting may submit comments on these issues to the address
given above (see 

ADDRESSES

 section) by June 30, 1994. 
In addition, at appropriate times during the review the Service will engage in direct discussions with representatives
of the government of the People's Republic of China, and with the Secretariat of CITES in Geneva, Switzerland. Such
discussions will be designed to ensure full understanding of the respective policies and goals of each country for
implementation of CITES in general and for panda conservation in particular. 



PUBLIC COMMENTS SOLICITED: 

The Service intends to complete the review and development of any necessary new policy or guidelines as quickly as
possible. Interested organizations and the public are invited to comment on the existing need for new policy or guidance
for the evaluation of giant panda import permit applications in the future, to suggest criteria that should be included
or considered when developing new policy or guidance, and to suggest any other issues relative to giant panda conservation
that the Service should consider during this review. Suggested criteria should take into account the necessary applicability
of the requirements of the Endangered Species Act and CITES regarding permit issuance. Any draft policy or guidelines
developed as a result of this review will be published in the 

Federal Register

 for review and comment.

 



Authority:

 The authority for this action is the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (TIAS 8249), the Endangered
Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

), and the Federal Advisory Committee Act.

Genesee and Wyoming Industries, Inc.; Continuance in Control Exemption; GWI Switching Services, L.P.


Genesee and Wyoming Industries, Inc. (GWI), has filed a notice of exemption to continue in control of GWI Switching
Services, L.P. (GWISS),
 upon GWISS becoming a class III rail carrier.






GWISS, a noncarrier, has concurrently filed a notice of exemption in Finance Docket No. 32481, GWI Switching Services,
L.P._Operation Exemption_Southern Pacific Transportation Company, to operate a rail car storage yard owned by
CMC Railroad I Ltd., and to operate under trackage rights over a railroad line owned by Southern Pacific Transportation
Company (SP) between SP's rail yard and CMC's yard in the vicinity of Dayton, TX.
 That transaction was expected to be consummated on or after April 5, 1994. 






GWI also directly controls eight existing class III common carriers by rail: the Allegheny & Eastern Railroad,
Inc., the Bradford Industrial Rail, Inc., Buffalo & Pittsburgh Railroad, Inc., the Dansville and Mount Morris
Railroad, the Louisiana & Delta Railroad, Inc., the Rochester & Southern Railroad, Inc., and the Willamette
& Pacific Railroad, Inc.

GWI indicates that: (1) The rail lines to be acquired and operated will not connect with any of GWI's rail subsidiaries;
(2) the continuance in control is not a part of a series of anticipated transactions that would connect the railroads
with each other or any other railroad in their corporate family; and (3) the transaction does not involve a class I carrier.
The transaction therefore is exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343. See 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2).

As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees affected by the transaction will be protected by the conditions
set forth in New York Dock Ry._Control_Brooklyn Eastern Dist., 360 I.C.C. 60 (1979).

Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke
will not automatically stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: James B. Gray,
Jr., 700 Midtown Tower, Rochester, NY 14604.




Decided: April 28, 1994.

storage has entrance connections at Baytown Branch SP mileposts 2.0 and 3.3. The incidental trackage rights cover
the rail line between the two rail yards from the Baytown Branch SP milepost 5.0 to Baytown Branch SP milepost 0.0, which
is also Lafayette Main Line SP milepost 327.8, and then from that point to the entrance to the SP yard at Lafayette Main
Line SP milepost 328.0. The proposed transaction was expected to be consummated on or after April 5, 1994.





This proceeding is related to Finance Docket No. 32482, Genesee and Wyoming Industries, Inc._Continuance in Control
Exemption_GWI Switching Services, L.P., wherein Genesee and Wyoming Industries, Inc., has concurrently filed
a notice of exemption under 1180.2(d)(2) to continue in control of GWISS and eight other class III rail carriers
 when GWISS becomes a class III rail carrier upon consummation of the transaction described in this notice.
 





Any comments must be filed with the Commission and served on: James B. Gray, Jr., 700 Midtown Tower, Rochester, New

<DOCTITLE>Northeast Nuclear Energy Co.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing </DOCTITLE>




The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR-21, issued to Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (NNECO/the licensee), for operation of the
Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 2, located in New London County, Connecticut. 

The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) to change the laboratory testing protocol
for the charcoal absorbers for the Control Room Emergency Ventilation System (TS 3.7.6.1) and the Enclosure Building
Filtration System (TS 3.6.5.1). 

Because the present TS requires a test on carbon samples of charcoal absorbers that the licensee's vendor had not and
could not perform, the TS must be changed to allow testing of carbon samples to a standard that is more accurate and capable
of performance. The plant is presently operating and during a review of the recent ventilation system testing, the
licensee's Quality Services Department discovered a discrepancy in the references identified in the vendor test
procedure as compared to the Millstone Unit 2 TS requirements. Further, on April 12, 1994, the licensee discovered
that the vendor's test equipment could not support the laboratory test required by the testing standard currently
referenced in the Millstone Unit No. 2 TS. The inplace charcoal for the ``B'' facilities of the Control Room Emergency
Ventilation System and the Enclosure Building Ventilation System were conservatively determined to be inoperable
because the surveillance performed on these units had been satisfied utilizing a standard (ASTM Standard D3803-79/86)
not specified in the Millstone Unit 2 TS. Thus the licensee immediately declared the affected facilities inoperable
and entered the 7 day action statement. The action statements require the affected systems to be restored to an operable
status within 7 days or the plant be placed in at least hot standby within the next 6 hours and in cold shutdown within
the following 30 hours. Due to the fact that the time necessary to process the application for amendment would be longer
than the remaining time of the 7 day action statement, exigent action is justified in order to reduce the time of enforcement
discretion which was granted until the license amendment is issued. 

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. 

Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine
that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations
in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue
of no significant hazards (SHC) consideration, which is presented below: 

The proposed changes do not involve a SHC because the changes would not: 




1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed. 

NNECO's proposal to revise Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications 4.6.5.1.b.2., 4.6.5.1.c, 4.7.6.1.c.2,
4.7.6.1.d, 4.9.15.b.2, and 4.9.15.c will permit carbon samples to be tested in accordance with ASTM D3803-89
versus ANSI N509-1976. ASTM Standard D3803-89 is used industry wide, and is acknowledged by the NRC as
an acceptable method for the testing of activated charcoal bed filters. In addition, testing in accordance with ASTM
Standard D3803-89 yields more accurate results than testing in accordance with ANSI N509-1976. The removal
efficiency requirement is not affected by the proposed changes. 

NNECO's proposal to correct the reference to Regulatory position C.6.a in Technical Specification 4.9.15.b.2 is
an editorial correction. 

Based on the above, the proposed changes do not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously analyzed. 

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

The proposed changes to Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications 4.6.5.1.b.2, 4.6.5.1.c, 4.7.6.1.c.2, 4.7.6.1.d,
4.9.15.b.2, and 4.9.15.c do not involve any physical modifications to any equipment, structures, or components,
nor do they involve any changes to any plant operating procedures. The only change would be to use a more reliable method
to determine filter efficiency at the laboratory. 

NNECO's proposal to correct the reference to Regulatory Position C.6.a in Technical Specification 4.9.15.b.2 is
an editorial correction. 

Thus, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
analyzed.

<TEXT>
 

3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
The proposed changes to Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications 4.6.5.1.b.2, 4.6.5.1.c, 4.6.5.1.c.2, 4.7.6.1.d,
4.9.15.b.2, and 4.9.15.c do not modify the requirement for carbon sample removal efficiency, do not involve a change
in any safety limits, setpoints, or design margins, and do not affect any protective boundaries. Additionally, the
proposed methodology has been determined to be more accurate. 
NNECO's proposal to correct the reference to Regulatory Position C.6.a in Technical Specification 4.9.15.b.2 is
an editorial correction. 
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a reduction in the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration. 
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 15 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 15-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
15-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register 

a notice of issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register 

notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. 
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. 
By June 3, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Learning Resource Center, Three Rivers Community-Technical
College, Thames Valley Campus, 574 New London Turnpike, Norwich, Connecticut 06360. If a request for a hearing or
petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board,
designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request
and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing
or an appropriate order. 
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularly the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. 
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in providing
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
If the amendment is issued before the expiration of the 30-day hearing period, the Commission will make a final determination
on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. If a hearing is requested, the final determination will serve
to decide when the hearing is held. 
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to John F. Stolz, Director, Project Directorate I-4: petitioners' name
and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Gerald Garfield, Esquire, Day, Berry & Howard, City Place, Hartford, Connecticut
06103-3499, attorney for the licensee.

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated April 14, 1994, as supplemented
April 20, 1994, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,
2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room, located at the Learning Resource Center,
Three Rivers Community-Technical College, Thames Valley Campus, 574 New London Turnpike, Norwich, Connecticut

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Meridan National Corporation,
Common Stock, $0.01 Par Value) File No. 1-10286</DOCTITLE>



April 28, 1994.



Meridan National Corporation (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission''), pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2-2(d)
promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the Boston Stock
Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'').

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:

According to the Company, its Board of Directors (the ``Board'') unanimously approved resolutions on October 25,
1993, to withdraw the Company's Common Stock from listing on the BSE. The Company's Common Stock will continue to be
traded in the over-the-counter market. The decision of the Board was based upon belief that listing of the Company
on the BSE was not beneficial to its stockholders in that there was little or no activity in the Company's Common Stock.

Any interested person may, on or before May 19, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Environmental Impact Statement: Alameda and Contra Costa Counties, CA</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Notice of intent.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an Environmental Impact Statement will be prepared for a proposed
transportation project in Alameda and Contra Costa Counties, California.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and the California Toll Road
Company (CTRC) will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on a proposal to construct a toll-operated highway
facility in a corridor between Route 4 and Route 84 in Alameda and Contra Costa Counties, a distance of approximately
48-kilometers (30 miles). The proposed facility would consist generally of a divided limited access roadway. It
is anticipated that majority of the roadway will be located on new alignment. Major roadways in the area are presently
operating at peak hour levels of service (LOS) D to F, and are expected to decline to LOS F before the year 2010. There
are also problems with the regional movement of freight on local roads because of the lack of regional transportation
facilities.



Alternatives under consideration are:

(1) The ``No-Build'' Alternative;

(2) A Transportation Systems Management/Transportation Demand Management Alternative providing incremental
improvements;

(3) A Mass Transit Alternative providing transit improvements, including buses and rail modes;

(4) A divided limited access toll road in a 48-kilometer (30 miles) corridor from the I-680/Route 84 Interchange
southwest of the City of Livermore to Route 4 near Antioch; and 

(5) A freeway in the same 48-kilometer (30-mile) corridor. In addition to the alternatives noted above, any other
alternatives identified in the scoping process meetings will be studied and considered during the project development
stage.

Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments were sent to the appropriate Federal, State and local
agencies, and to private organizations and citizens who have expressed or are known to have interest in this proposal.
Public scoping and community participation meetings will be held on May 10, 1994 at 6 p.m. at the Tracy Community Center,
300 East 10th Street, Tracy; on May 11, 1994 at 5 p.m. at the Brentwood Lions Club, 3700 Walnut Boulevard, Brentwood
and; at the Triad Corporation Cafeteria at 3055 Triad Drive, Livermore, on May 12, 1994 at 5 p.m. An agency scoping meeting
is scheduled at the Contra Costa Transportation Authority, Pacific Plaza Bldg., 1340 Treat Blvd., Suite 150, Walnut
Creek at 10 a.m. May 12, 1994. The Public Participation Program for this study includes additional community information
meetings and a Public Hearing.

To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified,
comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties.

Comments or questions concerning this proposed action and the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) should be directed
to the FHWA at the address provided above.

Notice-request for proposals.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The United States Information Agency (USIA) invites applications from eligible institutions under the auspices
of the North-South Center's 1994 Research Grant Programs. The North-South Center is located at the University of
Miami and is funded through a Congressional appropriation managed through the Bureau of Educational and Cultural
Affairs of the United States Information Agency. The Center's External Research Grant Program and Short-Term Field
Research Program support selected research activities which are of importance to the people and governments of the
Western Hemisphere. Through grant awards, the Center brings together human and technical resources to address major
themes relevant to policy making in North, South, and Central America and the Caribbean. The Grant Programs provide
funding for research projects with innovative approaches to contemporary concerns throughout the region. There
are currently two grant competitions for which solicitation of research proposals is being sought:





External Research Grant Program:

 The Program supports research, analysis, and the exchange of information important to the economic, social, political,
and cultural development of the countries of the Western Hemisphere. The general aim of the grant program is to promote
scholarly research of contemporary regional issues including: Democratization, social change and equity, trade,
debt, investment, environment, and drug policy. Since 1991, approximately 100 External Research Grants have been
awarded involving over 250 institutions throughout the hemisphere.


Short-term Field Research Grant Program on Poverty and Urban Violence: 

Designed to coincide with the upcoming United Nations World Summit for Social Development (March 1995) these awards
are to be specifically focused around the theme of poverty. Research proposals will be accepted from various disciplines
for research projects or field research to investigate issues of poverty and its relationship to migration pressures
and illegal immigration, youth and violence, distributional equity, and the impact of stabilization and adjustment
measures on the overall well-being of the population. The one-time competition for the Short-Term Field Research
Grants on Poverty and Urban Violence will be held in Spring of 1994.


Dates/Deadlines:

 It is the responsibility of each grant applicant to ensure that proposals are received by the stated deadlines for
selected program.


External Research Grant Program:

 For information purposes the External Research Grant Program requires one original and nineteen (19) copies of the
final proposal, written in English, and have been received at the Office of Grant Programs, North-South Center by
5 p.m. Miami time on Monday, May 2, 1994. Please conserve paper by making copies double-sided. Faxed documents will
not be accepted, nor will documents postmarked on May 2, 1994 but received at a later date. Project activities should
begin no earlier than July 1, 1994 and should run no longer than September 30, 1995. An additional External Research
Grant Program will be announced in July of 1994, with projects to begin no earlier than September 1994.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Proposals from all parts of the world, except where prohibited by U.S. law that are consistent with the mission of the
North-South Center and are of sound intellectual justification will be considered. Funding will not be authorized
for any private for-profit institutions, profit-oriented individuals' initiatives, projects of a proprietary
nature, or for projects of a partisan political nature. Principal investigators should have completed advanced
degrees and must demonstrate an institutional affiliation. Pre and post doctoral scholars are eligible to complete
for the Short-term Field Research Grants on Poverty and Urban Violence, however the investigators must demonstrate
an institutional affiliation. The Center and its Grant Review Panel will not use political tests or political qualifications
and will not discriminate in any manner whatsoever in selecting grantees.




Funding Limitations: 

The grant awards should not be used in lieu of salary or to support projects which could be funded by private foundations
or government. In addition, applicants are encouraged to seek supplemental funding for projects.
Successful projects will be funded by means of a cost reimbursement subcontract agreement between the North-South
Center, the University of Miami, and the applicant's institution. All current policies and requirements that govern
federal research grants will be applied to the grant award.
Pursuant to the USIA's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs authorizing legislation, programs must maintain
a non-political character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social
and cultural life.
External Research Grant Program: North-South Center External Research Grant Awards will be capped at $50,000. Multi-year
proposals will be funded on a yearly basis upon recommendation of the Grant Review Panel, contingent upon Congressional
funding of the North-South Center.
Short-term Field Research Grant Program on Poverty and Urban Violence: The maximum award for this program will be
$20,000. Support will include international travel expenses, domestic transportation, limited living expenses,
and research and pre-publication expenses.
Overview_The general aim of the North-South Center's grant programs is to promote scholarly research that will increase
knowledge and broaden understanding of contemporary regional issues. The long-term aims of the programs are to support
scholarship in inter-American affairs, encourage collaboration in various fields of research among institutions
throughout the hemisphere, stimulate discussion of policy-relevant issues, and promote scholarship from which
policy solutions may derive.
Guidelines_The Center gives priority to projects involving the collaboration of institutions in more than one country
and to projects addressing issues encompassing several countries. The Programs provide funding for projects that
demonstrate a clear analytical focus, a solid method to achieve research goals in a timely manner, and relevance to
contemporary policy. Research activities should generate a product of enduring value such as a publication or a series
of publications.

Proposed Budget_Applicants must submit a comprehensive line item budget for which specific details are available
in the application packet. The Center does not pay for costs that are not directly related to the specific project being
funded (e.g., indirect costs). No support will be given for the purchase or lease of capital equipment (e.g., fax machines,
computers), or other related infrastructural costs. Some degree of institutional support should be reflected in
the proposed project budget. Salary support must be fully justified by the specific requirements of the projects
and should not represent a major portion of total project expense. Salary support should be calculated as a percentage
of time spent on research for the duration of the project. It is not permissible to request support in lieu of responsibilities
for university course instruction.



Review Process:

 Grants made through the North-South Center External Research Grant Program are awarded through a competitive review
process. The Grant Programs Office will acknowledge receipt of all proposals, and the Center's Executive Staff will
review every proposal for eligibility, completeness, and competitiveness. Outside reviewers with expertise in
a particular subject area may be called upon to provide critique on proposals. Proposals will be deemed ineligible
if they do not fully adhere to the guidelines established herein and in the application packet. All eligible and complete
proposals will be submitted to the Center's Grant Re
