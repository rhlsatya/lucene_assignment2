<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations by adding new provisions designed to implement
the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA). The EAJA provides for the award of fees and expenses to certain individuals
and businesses that prevail in agency formal adjudicatory proceedings in which the agency's position is determined
not to have been substantially justified.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



I. Background.
II. Responses to Comments Received. 
III. Administrative Statements. 



I. Background 


The Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) became law on October 21, 1981 (5 U.S.C. 504). The EAJA authorizes agencies to
award attorney fees and other expenses to parties that prevail over an agency in certain agency proceedings under
specified circumstances. Generally, for an award to be made, the proceeding must be one that is ``required by statute
to be determined on the record.'' 

See, Ardestani 

v. 

U.S. Department of Justice, 

____ U.S. ____, 112 S.Ct. 515 (1991). 
On October 28, 1981 (46 FR 53189), the NRC published a proposed rule designed to implement the EAJA in the 

Federal Register

. However, serious doubt developed as to the need for the regulations. A significant consideration in this regard
was the impact of a statutory bar against the use of funds appropriated to the NRC ``to pay the expenses of, or otherwise
compensate, parties intervening in regulatory or adjudicatory proceedings.'' This provision first appeared in
the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of 1981 (Pub. L. No. 966-367, Sec. 502, 94 Stat. 1344, 1345
(1980)), and has continued to appear each year in subsequent NRC appropriation acts. In addition, case law developed
in the 1980's indicating that the Commission would receive judicial support if it determined that no NRC license proceeding
of any kind is covered by the EAJA. 
With the enactment of the Inspector General Act Amendments of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-504, 1102 Stat. 2515), which
established an Office of the Inspector General in the NRC, the NRC became subject to the Program Fraud Civil Remedies
Act (PFCRA), 31 U.S.C. ch. 38. Hearings under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act are expressly covered by the EAJA,
necessitating the issuance of EAJA regulations by the NRC. However, because of the length of time that had gone by since
the NRC issued the 1981 proposed EAJA rule, the Commission replaced it with a new proposed rule, published on August
2, 1993 (58 FR 41061). The new proposed rule was essentially similar to a model rule suggested by the Administrative
Conference of the United States (ACUS) for agency adoption. (May 6, 1988, 51 FR 16665.) 


II. Responses to Comments Received


In response to the August 2, 1993 proposed rule, the NRC received one set of comments from ACUS and one set from the Nuclear
Management and Resources Council (NUMARC). The NRC's consideration of the comments follows. 


A. Time Deadlines 


1. Decision on the Petition for Increase of Maximum Rate for Attorney Fees




Comment. 

ACUS recommended that the rule provide a specific time frame for agency action on a petition for rulemaking to increase
the maximum rate for attorney fees. 


Response.

 The EAJA provides a $75 hourly ceiling on attorney fees, but allows agencies to raise the statutory ceiling by regulation.
The proposed rule provides that any person may file with the Commission a petition for rulemaking to increase the $75
maximum hourly rate for attorney fees, and refers to 10 CFR 2.802 and 2.803 for the procedures to be followed with respect
to such petitions. Neither the proposed rule nor 10 CFR 2.802 nor 10 CFR 2.803 provides a specific time frame for agency
action on the petition for rulemaking. A sentence has been added to 10 CFR 12.107 requiring the Commission to determine
what action it will take on the petition within 90 days after the petition is filed. 


2. Decision on the Application for Award of Attorney Fees

Comment. 

ACUS recommended that the rule provide a specific time frame for the adjudicative officer to issue an initial decision
on the application for award of attorney fees. 


Response. 

10 CFR 12.307 of the proposed rule states requirements for the adjudicative officer's initial decision on the application
for award of attorney fees, but does not prescribe a time limit for the adjudicative officer to issue the decision.
A sentence has been added to 10 CFR 12.307 requiring the initial decision to be issued within 90 days after completion
of proceedings on the application, but permitting the adjudicative officer to extend the time limit after notice
to the parties of the reason for the delay. Authority is provided for the adjudicative officer to extend the time period
in order to prevent the interruption of cases presenting pressing health and safety concerns. The NRC expects that
extensions will be issued sparingly. 


B. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies 




Comment. 

ACUS stated that if the NRC believes that a request for administrative review should be a prerequisite to judicial
review, it should recast 10 CFR 12.308 (Agency review) in light of the Supreme Court's decision in 

Darby 

v. 

Cisneros,

 

XXX

 U.S. 

XXX

, 113 S.Ct. 2539 (June 21, 1993). 


Response. 

Within the last year, the Supreme Court cast new light on the requirements for exhaustion of administrative remedies
before appealing an agency decision to the courts. In 

Darby 

v. 

Cisneros

, the Court held that an agency cannot insist on exhaustion of intra-agency appeals prior to judicial review unless
the agency promulgates rules that require intra-agency appeals and stay the effect of agency decisions during such
appeals. The Commission believes that for purposes of judicial and administrative economy a request for administrative
review should be a prerequisite to judicial review, particularly because the NRC frequently entertains proceedings
that encompass highly technical matters. 
The cross-reference in 10 CFR 12.308 to the review procedures set out in 10 CFR 2.786 should be sufficient to satisfy
the commenter that the NRC has addressed the 

Darby

 case ruling in these regulations, because 10 CFR 2.786(b)(1) expressly provides that the filing of a petition for
review is mandatory for a party to exhaust its administrative remedies. Nevertheless, it may be considered fairer
notice to state the requirement in 10 CFR 12.308 itself. Therefore, the NRC has amended 10 CFR 12.308 to state unambiguously
that an aggrieved party is required to seek Commission review of the adjudicative officer's initial decision. 
The application of the part of the Court's opinion on staying the effect of the initial decision seems inapposite in
the context of an EAJA administrative proceeding, because it makes little sense to speak of a stay of an initial decision
denying the application for award of attorney fees, which is the type of decision most likely to be appealed. A successful
applicant for an award is not likely to appeal unless he or she is dissatisfied with the amount of the award. This poses
a very different type of situation from that in the 

Darby

 case, where the Court had before it an agency decision debarring petitioners from participating in Federal programs.
Nevertheless, in what is perhaps an excess of caution, we have included in NRC's EAJA rule a statement on staying the
effect of the initial decision during an appeal to the Commission. 


C. Proceedings Subject to the EAJA 




Comment.

 NUMARC commented that the rule should be revised to make clear that the only proceedings subject to NRC's EAJA rule
are those conducted pursuant to the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act. 


Response.

 The EAJA applies only to an agency adversary adjudication. 50 U.S.C. 504(a). The term ``adversary adjudication''
is defined by 5 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(C) to mean an appeal of a decision made pursuant to section 6 of the Contract Disputes
Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 605) before an agency board of contract appeals, a hearing conducted under 31 U.S.C. ch. 38 (PFCRA),
and an adjudication under 5 U.S.C. 554 (the Administrative Procedure Act). Section 554 of the Administrative Procedure
Act expressly states that (with certain exceptions) it applies ``in every case of adjudication required by statute
to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing.'' 
A proceeding for the purpose of granting or renewing a license is expressly excluded from EAJA coverage by 5 U.S.C.
504(b)(1)(C). However, there is no express exclusion of proceedings suspending, revoking, or amending a license,
including that for a nuclear reactor. As indicated in the Supplementary Information for NRC's proposed EAJA rule,
the question of such proceedings was at least addressed partially in 1983, when a materials license amendment proceeding
was judicially held as not being required by statute to be conducted ``on the record.'' In that case, the court declined
to read section 189(a) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA) as requiring an on-the-record hearing, in the absence
of clear Congressional intent to trigger the formal on-the-record hearing provisions of the Administrative Procedure
Act. 

West Chicago, Ill. 

v. 

U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,

 701 F.2d 632 (1983). Since that time, the Commission has gone on record that it interprets section 189a of the AEA as
not requiring formal hearings in reactor licensing proceedings. 

En Banc 

Brief for Respondents dated August 30, 1991 (filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,
No. 89-1381, 

Nuclear Information and Resource Service

 v.

 NRC,

 at pp 32-38). 
In light of the above, it is not unreasonable to conclude that no NRC proceeding other than an appeal to a board of contract
appeals under the Contract Disputes Act or a Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act hearing is covered by the EAJA. Nevertheless,
the Commission does not wish to frame its EAJA regulations in such a way as to preclude potential applicants for attorney
fee awards from raising the issue of EAJA coverage, if they can make a good faith argument that the proceeding in which
they have been involved falls under the EAJA. In addition, there is always the possibility of new enactments that could
make the EAJA applicable to proceedings not previously entertained by the agency. Therefore, the Commission has
decided not to state that the NRC's EAJA rule applies only to a proceeding under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act.

Nevertheless, the Commission has decided to amend 10 CFR 12.101, 12.102, and 12.103 to clarify its intent regarding
the scope of coverage of the regulations. The amendment does not make express reference to any type of proceedings
other than appeals under the Contract Disputes Act and adjudications conducted pursuant to the Program Fraud Civil
Remedies Act, but it contains a general provision that will encompass other types of proceedings that may fall within
the parameters of the EAJA. This leaves room for case-by-case determinations on applicants' claims of coverage in
areas that have not been addressed previously by statute, case law, or express Commission interpretation.

III. Administrative Statements 


Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion 


The NRC has determined that this regulation is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c).
Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this
rule. 


Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 


The information collection requirements contained in this rule are exempt from the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980
(44 U.S.C. 3518(c)(1)). 


Regulatory Analysis 


The EAJA provides that individuals and businesses that meet certain net worth and other requirements and prevail
over the NRC in an adversary adjudication in which the NRC's position is not substantially justified may be awarded
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding. Recent events, most notably the NRC's publication
of a final rule implementing the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act and actions thereunder, suggest that it is necessary
for the NRC to adopt procedures to govern the receipt and determination of applications for EAJA fees. The procedures
adopted mirror in important respects the model rule promulgated by the ACUS. The NRC has fulfilled the statutorily
mandated process of consultation between the Chairman of the ACUS and the agency with respect to EAJA implementing
procedures. See 5 U.S.C. 504(c)(1). The Commission believes that the procedures adopted are preferable to other
procedural requirements that might 
be imposed. The foregoing discussion constitutes the regulatory analysis for this final rule. 


Regulatory Flexibility Certification 


In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commission certifies that if promulgated,
this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule merely will
establish a procedural framework for the submission and determination of applications for fees and expenses incurred
in participating in NRC adjudications and will not itself impose significant economic benefits or burdens. 


Backfit Analysis 


The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this rule, because these amendments do
not involve any provisions which would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1).

Adversary adjudications, Award, Equal Access to Justice Act, Final disposition, Net worth, Party.



For the reasons set out in the preamble and under the authority of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Energy
Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, and 5 U.S.C. 552 and 553, the NRC is adopting a new 10 CFR part 12.

Subpart A_General Provisions 


 12.101 

Purpose. 


The purpose of this Part is to state the regulatory requirements for award of attorney fees to eligible individuals
and entities in certain administrative proceedings before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in implementation
of the Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (EAJA), which provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses
to parties to ``adversary adjudications'', as defined in 5 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(C). In general, an ``adversary adjudication''
is an adjudication that is required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for hearing before
an agency of the United States and in which the position of the agency, or any component of the agency, is presented by
an attorney or other representative who enters an appearance and participates in the proceeding. However, some agency
adjudications are expressly excluded from coverage by 5 U.S.C. 504 (e.g., an adjudication for the purpose of granting
or renewing a license) even though they fall within this general definition, and certain appeals before an agency
board of contract appeals and Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act hearings conducted under 31 U.S.C. ch. 38 are expressly
covered. 
An eligible party may receive an award in an adversary adjudication when the party prevails over the Commission, unless
the Commission's position was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. The regulations
in this part describe the parties eligible for awards and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to
apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that the Commission will use to make them. 


 12.102 

When the EAJA applies. 


The EAJA applies to any covered adversary adjudication pending or commenced before the Commission on or after August
5, 1985. 


 12.103 

Proceedings covered. 


(a) The EAJA applies to the following proceedings: 
(1) Hearings under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act (31 U.S.C. 3801-12); 
(2) Any appeal of a decision made pursuant to section 6 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 605) before an
agency board of contract appeals as provided in section 8 of that Act (41 U.S.C. 607); and 
(3) Adversary adjudications conducted by the Commission pursuant to any other statutory provision that requires
a proceeding before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to be so conducted as to fall within the meaning of ``adversary
adjudication'' under 5 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(C). 
(b) The Commission's failure to identify a type of proceeding as an adversary adjudication shall not preclude the
filing of an application by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the EAJA. Whether the proceeding is covered
will then be an issue for resolution in proceedings on the application. 
(c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the EAJA and matters specifically excluded from coverage, any
award made will include only fees and expenses related to covered issues. 


 12.104 

Eligibility of applicants. 


(a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses under the EAJA, the applicant must be a party to the
adversary adjudication for which it seeks an award. The term ``party'' is defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3). The applicant
must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart and in subpart B. 
(b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows: 
(1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million; 
(2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth of not more than $7 million, including both personal
and business interests, and not more than 500 employees; 
(3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26
U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not more than 500 employees; 
(4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a))
with not more than 500 employees; and 
(5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or organization with a net worth
of not more than $7 million and not more than 500 employees. 
(c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the
date the proceeding was initiated. 
(d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered as an ``individual'' rather than a ``sole
owner of an unincorporated business'' if the issues on which the applicant prevails are related primarily to personal
interests rather than to business interests. 
(e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly perform services for remuneration for the applicant,
under the applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included on a proportional basis. 
(f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine
eligibility. Any individual, corporation, or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority
of the voting shares or other interests of the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant
directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest, will be considered an affiliate
for purposes of this part, unless the adjudicative officer determines that such treatment would be unjust and contrary
to the purposes of the Act in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the adjudicative
officer may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in this paragraph
constitute special circumstances that would make an award unjust.

<TEXT>
 

(g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on behalf of one or more other persons or entities that
would be ineligible is not itself eligible for an award. 


 12.105 

Standards for awards. 


(a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and expenses incurred in connection with a proceeding or a
significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless the position of the Commission over which
the applicant has prevailed was substantially justified. The position of the Commission includes, in addition to
the position taken by the Commission in the adversary adjudication, the action or failure to act by the Commission
upon which the adversary adjudication is based. The burden of proof that an award should not be made to a prevailing
applicant because the Commission's position was substantially justified is on the Commission counsel. 
(b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly or unreasonably protracted the proceeding or if special
circumstances make the award sought unjust. 


 12.106 

Allowable fees and expenses. 


(a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents,
and expert witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at reduced rate to the applicant.

(b) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under this part may exceed $75.00 per hour. No award to compensate an expert
witness may exceed the highest rate at which the Commission pays expert witnesses. However, an award may also include
the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent, or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent, or witness ordinarily
charges clients separately for these expenses. 
(c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent, or expert witness, the adjudicative
officer shall consider the following: 
(1) If the attorney, agent, or witness is in private practice, his or her customary fees for similar services, or, if
an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated costs of the services; 
(2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent, or witness ordinarily
performs services; 
(3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant; 
(4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and 
(5) Other factors that bear on the value of the services provided. 
(d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project, or similar matter prepared on
behalf of a party may be awarded, to the extent that the charge for the services does not exceed the prevailing rate for
similar services, and the study or other matter was necessary for preparation of applicant's case. 


 12.107 

Rulemaking on maximum rates for attorney fees. 


(a) If warranted by an increase in the cost of living or by special circumstances (such as limited availability of attorneys
qualified to handle certain types of proceedings), the Commission may adopt regulations providing that attorney
fees may be awarded at a rate higher than $75 per hour in some, or all of the types of proceedings covered by this part.
The Commission will conduct any rulemaking proceedings for this purpose under the informal rulemaking procedures
of the Administrative Procedure Act. 
(b) Any person may file with the Commission a petition for rulemaking to increase the maximum rate for attorney fees,
in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 2.802. The petition should identify the rate the petitioner believes
the Commission should establish and the types of proceedings in which the rate should be used. It should also explain
fully the reasons why the higher rate is warranted. Within 90 days after the petition is filed, the Commission will
determine whether it will initiate a rulemaking proceeding, deny the petition, or take other appropriate action
on the petition. The Commission will act on the petition in accordance with 10 CFR 2.803. 


 12.108 

Awards against other agencies. 


If an applicant is entitled to an award because it prevails over another agency of the United States that participates
in a proceeding before the Commission and takes a position that is not substantially justified, the award or an appropriate
portion of the award shall be made against that agency. 


 12.109 

Decisionmaking authority. 


Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission in a particular proceeding, each application under this part shall be
assigned for decision to the official or decisionmaking body that entered the decision in the adversary adjudication.
That official or decisionmaking body is referred to in this part as the ``adjudicative officer.'' 


Subpart B_Information Required From Applicants 


 12.201 

Contents of application. 


(a) An application for an award of fees and expenses under the EAJA shall identify the applicant and the proceeding
for which an award is sought. The application shall show that the applicant has prevailed and identify the position
of the Commission or other agency that the applicant alleges was not substantially justified. Unless the applicant
is an individual, the application shall also state the number of employees of the applicant and describe briefly the
type and purpose of its organization or business. 
(b) The application shall also include a statement that the applicant's net worth does not exceed $2 million (if an
individual) or $7 million (for all other applicants, including their affiliates). However, an applicant may omit
this statement if: 
(1) The applicant attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service that it qualifies as an organization described
in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) or, in the case of a tax-exempt organization
not required to obtain a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that describes
the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under this section; or 
(2) The applicant states that it is a cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing
Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)). 
(c) The application shall state the amount of fees and expenses for which an award is sought.

<TEXT>
 

(d) The application may also include any other matters that the applicant wishes the Commission to consider in determining
whether, and in what amount, an award should be made. 
(e) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an authorized officer or attorney of the applicant. It shall
also contain or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or under penalty of perjury that the information
provided in the application is true and correct. 


 12.202 

Net worth exhibit. 


(a) Each applicant, except a qualified tax-exempt organization or cooperative association must provide with its
application a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as defined in  12.104(f)
of this part) when the proceeding was initiated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides
full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether
the applicant qualifies under the standards in this part. The adjudicative officer may require an applicant to file
additional information to determine its eligibility for an award. 
(b) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public record of the proceeding. However, an applicant
that objects to public disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes there are legal grounds
for withholding it from disclosure may submit that portion of the exhibit directly to the adjudicative officer in
a sealed envelope labeled ``Confidential Financial Information,'' accompanied by a motion to withhold the information
from public disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to be withheld and explain, in detail, why
it falls within one or more of the specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information
Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9), why public disclosure of the information would adversely affect the applicant,
and why disclosure is not required in the public interest. The material in question shall be served on counsel representing
the agency against which the applicant seeks an award, but need not be served on any other party to the proceeding. If
the adjudicative officer finds that the information should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed in
the public record of the proceeding. Otherwise, any request to inspect or copy the exhibit shall be disposed of in accordance
with the Commission's established procedures under the Freedom of Information Act, 10 CFR part 9, subpart A. 


 12.203 

Documentation of fees and expenses. 


The application shall be accompanied by full documentation of the fees and expenses, including the cost of any study,
analysis, engineering report, test, project, or similar matter for which an award is sought. A separate itemized
statement shall be submitted for each professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the application,
showing the hours spent in connection with the proceeding by each individual, a description of the specific services
performed, the rates at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which reimbursement is sought, the total
amount claimed, and the total amount paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for the services
provided. The adjudicative officer may require the applicant to provide vouchers, receipts, logs, or other substantiation
for any fees or expenses claimed, pursuant to  12.306 of this part. 



 12.204 

When an application may be filed. 


(a) An application may be filed whenever the applicant has prevailed in the proceeding or in a significant and discrete
substantive portion of the 
proceeding, but in no case later than 30 days after the date on which a decision or order disposing of the merits of the
proceeding or any other complete resolution of the proceeding, such as a settlement or voluntary dismissal, becomes
final and unappealable, both within the NRC and to the courts. 
(b) If after the filing of an application for an award, review or reconsideration is sought or taken of a decision as
to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the award of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition
of the underlying controversy. When the United States appeals the underlying merits of an adversary adjudication
to a court, no decision on an application for fees and other expenses in connection with that adversary adjudication
shall be made until a final and unreviewable decision is rendered by the court on the appeal or until the underlying
merits of the case have been finally determined pursuant to the appeal. 


Subpart C_Procedures for Considering Applications 


 12.301 

Filing and service of documents. 


Any application for an award or other pleading or document related to an application shall be filed and served on all
parties to the proceeding in the same manner as other pleadings in the proceeding, except as provided in  12.202(b)
for confidential financial information.

 12.302 

Answer to application. 



(a) Within 30 days after service of an application, counsel representing the NRC against which an award is sought may
file an answer to the application. Unless the NRC counsel requests an extension of time for filing or files a statement
of intent to negotiate under paragraph (b) of this section, failure to file an answer within the 30-day period may be
treated as a consent to the award requested. 

(b) If the NRC counsel and the applicant believe that the issues in the fee application can be settled, they may jointly
file a statement of their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement shall extend the time for filing
an answer for an additional 30 days, and further extensions may be granted by the adjudicative officer upon request
by the NRC counsel and the applicant. 

(c) The answer shall explain in detail any objections to the award requested and identify the facts relied on in support
of the NRC counsel's position. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the proceeding,
the NRC counsel shall include with the answer either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under
 12.306. 



 12.303 

Reply. 



Within 15 days after service of an answer, the applicant may file a reply. If the reply is based on any alleged facts not
already in the record of the proceeding, the applicant shall include with the reply either supporting affidavits
or a request for further proceedings under  12.306. 



 12.304 

Comments by other parties. 



Any party to a proceeding other than the applicant and the NRC counsel may file comments on an application within 30
days after it is served, or on an answer within 15 days after it is served. A commenting party may not participate further
in proceedings on the application unless the adjudicative officer determines that the public interest requires
participation in order to permit full exploration of matters raised in the comments. 



 12.305 

Settlement. 



The applicant and the NRC counsel may agree on a proposed settlement of the award before final action on the application,
either in connection with a settlement of the underlying proceeding, or after the underlying proceeding has been
concluded, in accordance with the NRC's standard settlement procedure. If a prevailing party and the NRC's counsel
agree on a proposed settlement of an award before an application has been filed, the application shall be filed with
the proposed settlement. 



 12.306 

Further proceedings. 



(a) Ordinarily, the determination of an award will be made on the basis of the written record. However, on request of
either the applicant or the NRC counsel, or on the adjudicative officer's own initiative, the adjudicative officer
may order further proceedings, such as an informal conference, oral argument, additional written submissions or,
as to issues other than substantial justification (such as the applicant's eligibility or substantiation of fees
and expenses), pertinent discovery or an evidentiary hearing. Further proceedings shall be held only when necessary
for full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the application, and shall be conducted as promptly as possible.
Whether or not the position of the agency was substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the administrative
record, as a whole, which is made in the adversary adjudication for which fees and other expenses are sought. 

(b) A request that the adjudicative officer order further proceedings under this section shall specifically identify
the information sought or the disputed issues and shall explain why the additional proceedings are necessary to resolve
the issues. 



 12.307 

Decision. 



(a) The adjudicative officer shall issue an initial decision on the application within 90 days after completion of
proceedings on the application. If the adjudicative officer fails to issue an initial decision within 90 days, he
or she shall notify the parties of the reason for the delay and shall set a new deadline. 

(b) The initial decision shall include written findings and conclusions on the applicant's eligibility and status
as a prevailing party, and an explanation of the reasons for any difference between the amount requested and the amount
awarded. The decision shall also include, if at issue, findings on whether the NRC's position was substantially justified,
whether the applicant unduly protracted the proceedings, or whether special circumstances make an award unjust.
If the applicant has sought an award against more than one agency, the decision shall allocate responsibility for
payment of any award made among the agencies, and shall explain the reasons for the allocation made.

 12.308 

Agency review. 



(a) Either the applicant or the NRC counsel may seek review of the initial decision on the fee application, or the Commission
may decide to review the decision on its own initiative, in accordance with the Commission's review procedures set
out in 10 CFR 2.786. The filing of a petition for review is mandatory for a party to exhaust its administrative remedies
before seeking judicial review. If neither the applicant nor NRC counsel seeks review and the Commission does not
take review on its own initiative, the initial decision on the application shall become a final decision of the NRC
forty (40) days after it is issued. 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other part of the Commission's regulations, the initial decision
shall be inoperative (i.e., the decision shall not be final and any award made shall not be paid) until the later of_


(1) The expiration of the forty-day period provided in paragraph (a) of this section; or 

(2) If within the forty-day period provided in paragraph (a) of this section the Commission elects to review the decision,
the Commission's issuance of a final decision on review of the initial decision. 

(c) Whether to review a decision on its own motion is a matter within the discretion of the Commission. If review is taken,
the Commission will issue a final decision on the application or remand the application to the adjudicative officer
for further proceedings. 



 12.309 

Judicial review. 



Judicial review of final agency decisions on awards may be sought as provided in 5 U.S.C. 504(c)(2). 



 12.310 

Payment of award. 



An applicant seeking payment of an award shall submit to the appropriate official of the paying agency a copy of the
Commission's final decision granting the award, accompanied by a certification that the applicant will not seek
review of the decision in the United States courts. Where the award is granted against the Commission, the applicant
shall make the submission to the Director, Division of Accounting and Finance, Office of the Controller, U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. The NRC will pay the amount awarded to the applicant within 60 days.

 


Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 29th day of April 1994.

 


For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

<USDEPT>FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM</USDEPT>








Securities Credit Transactions; 
List of Marginable OTC Stocks; List of Foreign Margin Stocks 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; determination of applicability of regulations. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The List of Marginable OTC Stocks (OTC List) is composed of stocks traded over-the-counter (OTC) in the United States
that have been determined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to be subject to the margin requirements
under certain Federal Reserve regulations. The List of Foreign Margin Stocks (Foreign List) is composed of foreign
equity securities that have met the Board's eligibility criteria under Regulation T. The OTC List and the Foreign
List are published four times a year by the Board. This document sets forth additions to and deletions from the previous
OTC List and additions to the Foreign List. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Listed below are additions to and deletions from the OTC List. This supersedes the last OTC List which was effective
February 14, 1994. Additions and deletions to the OTC List were last published on February 1, 1994 (59 FR 4549). A copy
of the complete OTC List is available from the Federal Reserve Banks. 


The OTC List includes those stocks that meet the criteria in Regulations G, T and U (12 CFR parts 207, 220 and 221, respectively).
This determination also affects the applicability of Regulation X (12 CFR part 224). These stocks have the degree
of national investor interest, the depth and breadth of market, and the availability of information respecting the
stock and its issuer to warrant regulation in the same fashion as exchange-traded securities. The OTC List also includes
any OTC stock designated for trading in the national market system (NMS security) under a Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) rule. Additional OTC stocks may be designated as NMS securities in the interim between the Board's
quarterly publications. They will become automatically marginable upon the effective date of their NMS designation.
The names of these stocks are available at the SEC and at the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and will
be incorporated into the Board's next quarterly publication of the OTC List. 
Also listed below are the additions to the Board's Foreign List, which was last published on February 1, 1994 (59 FR
4549), and became effective February 14, 1994. There are no deletions from the Foreign List. The Foreign List includes
those foreign securities that meet the criteria in section 220.17 of Regulation T and are eligible for margin treatment
at broker-dealers on the same basis as domestic margin securities. A copy of the complete Foreign List is available
from the Federal Reserve Banks. 


Public Comment and Deferred Effective Date 


The requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to notice and public participation were not followed in connection with
the issuance of this amendment due to the objective character of the criteria for inclusion and continued inclusion
on the Lists specified in 12 CFR 207.6 (a) and (b), 220.17 (a), (b), (c), and (d), and 221.7 (a) and (b). No additional
useful information would be gained by public participation. The full requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to
deferred effective date have not been followed in connection with the issuance of this amendment because the Board
finds that it is in the public interest to facilitate investment and credit decisions based in whole or in part upon
the composition of these Lists as soon as possible. The Board has responded to a request by the public and allowed approximately
a two-week delay before the Lists are effective.

(Regulation T), and 12 CFR 221.2(j) and 221.7 (Regulation U), there is set forth below a listing of deletions from and

Airworthiness Directives; Aerospatiale Model ATR72 Series Airplanes, Equipped With Dunlop Main Landing Gear Wheels,
Part Number AHA1752 Pre Mod 6 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Aerospatiale Model ATR72 series
airplanes, that requires inspections to detect cracking in the brake side half hub in the bearing housing area of certain
main landing gear (MLG) wheels, and replacement of the MLG wheel, if necessary. This amendment also requires the eventual
replacement of certain MLG wheels with other wheels, as terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This
amendment is prompted by in-service experience that indicates the possibility of fatigue cracking occurring in
the subject 
area. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the brake side half hub due to fatigue cracking,
which could lead to separation of the MLG wheel and tire from the axle.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain Aerospatiale Model ATR72 series airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 19, 1993 (58 FR 61038). That action proposed to require repetitive eddy current inspections to detect
cracking in the bearing housing of the brake side half hub of Dunlop MLG wheels, part number AHA1752 Pre Mod 6. Additionally,
that action proposed to require that, if any cracked half hub assemblies are detected, the complete 
wheel must be replaced. If certain improved replacement wheels are installed, the repetitive eddy current inspections
may be discontinued. That action also proposed to require the eventual replacement of all MLG wheels having part number
AHA1752 Pre Mod 6 with other (improved) wheels, as terminating action for the repetitive inspections. 



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the single comment received. 

The commenter supports the proposed rule. 

After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 

The FAA estimates that 16 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 2 work
hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on
these figures, the total cost impact of the inspection actions on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,760, or $110
per airplane, per inspection. Should a cracked half hub assembly be found, replacement wheel assemblies will be provided
by Dunlop at no charge to the operator. 


The required wheel replacement action will require approximately 2 work hours to accomplish, at an average labor
charge of $55 per work hour. Replacement parts will be provided by Dunlop at no charge to the operators, as part of Dunlop's
repair/replacement program. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the replacement actions on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $1,760, or $110 per airplane. 

The total cost impact figures discussed above are based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of
the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were
not adopted. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at
the location provided under the caption

Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Model A300-600 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Model A300-600 series
airplanes. This action requires replacement of certain Feel and Limitation Computers (FLC) with modified FLC's.
This amendment is prompted by reports that the elevator control on several in-service airplanes operated with stiffness.
The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent stiff operation of the 
elevator control and undetected loss of the rudder travel limitation function, which may adversely affect controllability
of the airplane. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Airbus Model A300-600 series airplanes.
The DGAC advises that operators of Model A300-600 series airplanes reported that the elevator control on several
in-service airplanes operated with stiffness. Investigation into the cause of this stiffness revealed that the
Feel and Limitation Computer (FLC) may be detecting spurious low voltage. This condition, if not corrected, could
result in stiff operation of the elevator control and undetected loss of the rudder travel limitation function, which
may adversely affect controllability of the airplane. 


Airbus has issued Service Bulletin A300-27-6025, dated September 15, 1993, that describes procedures
for replacement of certain FLC's with modified FLC's. These replacement FLC's have been modified in accordance with
Aerospatiale Service Bulletin 35-900-27-013, dated September 29, 1993 (for FLC's having part
number 35-900-2000-200), or Aerospatiale Service Bulletin 35-900-27-012,
dated September 29, 1993 (for FLC's having part number 35-900-2000-201). The Aerospatiale service
bulletins describe procedures for adjustment of the ``UNDERVOLTAGE DETECTION'' signal with new values to preclude
stiff operation of the elevator control. The DGAC classified the Airbus service bulletin as mandatory and issued
French Airworthiness Directive 94-046-156(B), dated February 16, 1994, in order to assure the continued

airworthiness of these airplanes in France.

This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of  21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described
above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action
is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent stiff operation of the elevator control
and undetected loss of rudder travel limitation function, which may adversely affect controllability of the airplane.
This AD requires replacement of certain FLC's with modified FLC's. The actions are required to be accomplished in
accordance with the Airbus service bulletin described previously. 
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 



Comments Invited 


Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption 

ADDRESSES

. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, 
environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted
will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested
persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in
the Rules Docket. 
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments 
submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement
is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-54-AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned
to the commenter. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if 
filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule, request for comments. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Allied-Signal Inc., Garrett
Engine Division, TPE331 series turboprop and Model TSE331-3U turboshaft engines. This action requires inspection
of certain third stage turbine stator assemblies, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable assemblies.
This amendment is prompted by reports of six third stage turbine stator assemblies assembled with inner seal supports
made of incorrect material that results in a significantly reduced cyclic life. The actions specified by this AD are
intended to prevent an uncontained failure of the third stage turbine wheel. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has received reports of six third stage turbine stator assemblies assembled
with inner seal supports made of incorrect material that significantly reduces the cyclic life of the assembly. The
manufacturer has identified part serial numbers of 150 third stage turbine stator assemblies that may contain the
inner seal supports made of Hastelloy S material. These assemblies were repaired at the Garrett General Aviation
Service Division (GGASD) facility in Phoenix, Arizona between November 1988 and May 1991. Fatigue failure of the
inner seal support has resulted in the seal support moving aft and contacting the third stage turbine wheel. This condition,
if not corrected, can result in an uncontained failure of the third stage turbine wheel. 



The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of AlliedSignal Aerospace Alert Service Bulletin (ASB)
No. TPE331-A72-0906, dated October 15, 1993, that describes procedures for inspecting the third stage
turbine stator assemblies, and replacing, if necessary, with serviceable assemblies. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other engines of this same type design,
this AD is being issued to prevent an uncontained failure of the third stage turbine wheel. This AD requires inspection
of third stage turbine stator assemblies to determine the acceptability of the inner seal supports, and replacement,
if necessary, with serviceable assemblies. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service
bulletin described previously. 

Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 



Comments Invited 



Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption


ADDRESSES

. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed.

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93-ANE-80.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.

It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Airworthiness Directives; de Havilland, Inc., Model DHC-7 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain de Havilland Model DHC-7 series
airplanes, that requires a one-time inspection to assess the adequacy of the clearance between various adapter plates
and seal retaining angles on the fuselage side access panel, and modification of both the forward and rear seal retention
angles. This amendment is prompted by reports of incidents involving corrosion and fatigue cracking in commuter-class
airplanes that are approaching or have 
exceeded their economic design goal. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent degradation of the structural
capabilities of the affected airplanes. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain de Havilland Model DHC-7 series airplanes was published as a supplemental notice of proposed
rulemaking (NPRM) in the 

Federal Register

 on January 4, 1994 (59 FR 266). That action proposed to require a one-time inspection to assess the adequacy of the clearance
between various adapter plates and seal retaining angles on the fuselage side 
access panel, and modification of both the forward and rear seal retention angles. 


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the single comment received. 
The commenter supports the proposed rule.
After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
The FAA estimates that 44 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 8 work
hours per airplane to accomplish the modifications and inspections, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work
hour. Required parts will be nominal in cost. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $19,360, or $440 per airplane. 
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at
the location provided under the caption

Airworthiness Directives; General Electric Company CF6 Series Turbofan Engines 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CF6-45/-50
series turbofan engines, that requires installation of a fan stator case stiffening ring assembly, and a new stage
one fan shroud. This amendment is prompted by a report of an uncontained stage one fan blade failure, which resulted
in an inflight engine shutdown, and damage to the aircraft. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent
an uncontained stage one fan blade failure, which can result in an inflight engine shutdown, and damage to the aircraft.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CF6-45/-50 series turbofan engines was published in the


Federal Register

 on January 11, 1994 (59 FR 1503). That action proposed to require installation of a fan stator case stiffening ring
assembly and a new stage one fan shroud, which will result in reduced running clearances, and lower fan blade stresses.
The compliance end date of December 31, 1996, ensures timely compliance without forced engine removals based on hardware
availability. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with GE CF6-50 Service Bulletin
(SB) No. 72-573, Revision 5, dated September 15, 1981. 



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 

Two commenters support the rule as proposed. 

One commenter states that the compliance end-date of August 31, 1995, in compliance paragraph (a) of the proposed
rule should be extended to December 31, 1996, in order to avoid forced engine removals. The Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) concurs. The FAA has determined that flight safety will not be compromised by extending the compliance end-date
to December 31, 1996. The final rule has been changed accordingly. 

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change described previously. The FAA has determined
that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 

There are approximately 67 GE CF6-45/-50 series turbofan engines of the affected design in the worldwide
fleet. The FAA has been advised by the manufacturer that there are no engines on U.S. registered aircraft that would
be affected by this AD. However, should an affected engine be imported on an aircraft and placed on the U.S. registry
in the future, it would take approximately 48 work hours to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor
rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $9,360 per engine. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of the AD is estimated to be $12,000 per engine. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CF6-6/-45/-50
series turbofan engines, that requires an inspection for cracks in the stage 1 high pressure turbine (HPT) disk rim
bolt holes, and stage 2 HPT disk rim and inner bolt holes; and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable parts. This
amendment is prompted by a report of an uncontained stage 1 HPT disk failure which resulted in an aborted takeoff. The
actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent an uncontained stage 1 or stage 2 HPT disk failure, which could
result in an inflight engine shutdown, rejected takeoff, or damage to the aircraft. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CF6-6/-45/-50 series turbofan engines was published
as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the 

Federal Register

 on October 19, 1993 (58 FR 53893). That action proposed to require an eddy current inspection for cracks in the stage
1 high pressure turbine (HPT) disk rim bolt holes, and stage 2 HPT disk rim and inner bolt holes; and replacement, if
necessary, with serviceable parts. The inspection, and replacement, if necessary, would be performed in accordance
with GE CF6-6 Service Bulletin (SB) No. 72-1002, dated February 12, 1993; CF6-6 SB No. 72-1003,
Revision 1, dated June 17, 1993; CF6-50 SB No. 72-1057, Revision 1, dated June 17, 1993; and CF6-50
SB No. 72-1059, dated February 12, 1993. 


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
One commenter supports the rule as proposed. 
One commenter states that the compliance end-date of February 28, 1994, in compliance paragraph (b)(6) of the proposed
rule should be replaced by 1,000 cycles in service (CIS) after the effective date of this AD, in order to avoid forced
engine removals. The FAA concurs. This change is consistent with the results of the failure analysis performed by
the manufacturer, and is supported by the positive inspection results to date. This final rule has been revised accordingly.

One commenter states that the compliance end-date of February 28, 1994, in compliance paragraph (b)(6) of the proposed
rule should be extended to one year after the effective date of this AD, in order to avoid forced engine removals. The
FAA concurs in part. The FAA agrees that the current compliance end-date may cause forced engine removals; however,
an extension of this date alone may still cause an undue burden on low cycle/low time operators. A cyclic definition
in lieu of a compliance end-date will help alleviate this potential problem. The manufacturer has informed the FAA
that a typical operator accumulates approximately 1,000 CIS in one year. This change is consistent with the results
of the failure analysis performed by the manufacturer, and is supported by the positive inspection results to date.
Therefore, the compliance end-date of February 28, 1994, in paragraph (b)(6) in the proposed rule has been replaced
in this final rule by 1,000 CIS after the effective date of this AD. 
Two commenters state that the compliance end-date of May 31, 1994, in compliance paragraph (a)(1) and (a)(2) should
be removed, and 4,500 cycles since new (CSN) should be replaced by 5,400 CSN to avoid forced engine removals. The FAA
concurs. This change is consistent with the results of the failure analysis performed by the manufacturer, and is
supported by the positive inspection results to date. This final rule has been revised accordingly. 
Two commenters state that the compliance end-date of May 31, 1994, in compliance paragraph (a)(3) should be replaced
by 1,400 CIS after the effective date of this AD to avoid forced engine removals. The FAA concurs. This change is consistent
with the results of the failure analysis performed by the manufacturer, and is supported by the positive inspection
results to date. This final rule has been revised accordingly.

Two commenters state that the compliance end-date of February 28, 1994, in compliance paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (a)(4)(ii)
should be removed, 3,500 CSN should be replaced by 4,500 CSN, and 3,000 CSN should be replaced by 3,500 CSN to avoid forced
engine removals. The FAA concurs in part. The FAA agrees that the current compliance end-date may cause forced engine
removals, but the proposed CSN changes are not consistent with the results of the failure analysis performed by the
manufacturer. The results of this analysis suggest that 3,500 CSN can be changed to 4,000 CSN; however, 3,000 CSN can
not be changed. This final rule has been revised accordingly.

One commenter states that the compliance end-date of May 31, 1994, in compliance paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (a)(5)(ii)
should be removed, and 4,500 CSN should be replaced by 6,000 CSN to avoid forced engine removals. The FAA concurs in
part. The FAA agrees that the current compliance end-date may cause forced engine removals, but the proposed CSN change
is not consistent with the results of the failure analysis performed by the manufacturer. The results of this analysis
suggest that 4,500 CSN can be changed to 5,400 CSN. The final rule has been revised accordingly. 


One commenter states that the compliance end-date of May 31, 1994, in compliance paragraph (a)(5)(iii) should be
replaced by 2,000 CIS after the effective date of this AD to avoid forced engine removals. The FAA concurs in part. The
FAA agrees that the current compliance end-date may cause forced engine removals, but the proposed CIS is not consistent
with the results of this failure analysis performed by the manufacturer. The results of this analysis suggest that
1,400 CIS is appropriate. This final rule has been revised accordingly. 


Although no comments were received regarding compliance paragraphs (b)(1) to (b)(5), the FAA has changed these paragraphs
to be consistent with the corresponding paragraphs in paragraph (a) of this final rule. 


The economic analysis section of the proposed rule assumed that all inspected disks would require replacement. The
manufacturer has informed the FAA that this assumption is overly conservative based on analysis and inspection results
to date, and that only approximately 2% of the inspected disks will require replacement. The 2% figure translates
to approximately 10 disks installed on aircraft of U.S. registry. The economic analysis section of this final rule
has been revised accordingly. 


After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 


There are approximately 650 GE CF6-6/-45/-50 series turbofan engines of the affected design in
the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 500 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by
this AD, that it will take approximately 108 work hours per engine to accomplish the required actions, and that the
average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $77,314 per engine. Based on these
figures, and assuming that 10 of the inspected disks will require replacement, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S.
operators is estimated to be $3,743,140. 


The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 


For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

Airworthiness Directives; Jetstream Model ATP Airplanes


<AGENCY>

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Jetstream Model ATP airplanes, that requires
a one-time inspection and appropriate torque loading check of certain wing top surface stringer joint fasteners,
and correction of discrepancies. This amendment is prompted by a report of loose fasteners on the wing top surface
stringer joint bolts at Rib 0. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent reduced structural integrity
of the wing top surface stringer joints at Rib 0, which subsequently could lead to reduced structural integrity of
the wing.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to Jetstream Model ATP airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 15, 1993 (58 FR 65569). That action proposed to require a one-time inspection and appropriate torque loading
check of certain wing top surface stringer joint fasteners, and correction of discrepancies.


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the single comment received.
The commenter supports the proposal.
Since issuance of the notice, Jetstream Aircraft Limited has issued Revision 3 of BAe ATP Service Bulletin ATP-57-14,
dated December 15, 1993. This revision of the service bulletin is essentially identical to Revision 1, which was referenced
in the notice, but contains certain editorial changes. The FAA has revised the final rule to include a reference to
Revision 3 of the service bulletin as an additional source of appropriate service information.
After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined
that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.
The FAA estimates that 10 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 50
work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based
on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $27,500, or $2,750 per airplane.
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted.
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

Applicability:

 Model ATP airplanes; serial numbers 2001 through 2053 inclusive, and 2055; certificated in any category. 


Compliance:

 Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 
To prevent reduced structural integrity of the wing top surface stringer joints at Rib 0, which subsequently could
lead to reduced structural integrity of the wing, accomplish the following: 
(a) Prior to the accumulation of 10,000 total hours time-in-service, or within the next 600 hours time-in-service
after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, perform a detailed visual inspection and appropriate
torque loading check of the fasteners in the stringer joint brackets (part number JD534J0015) at the wing top surface
stringer joints for stringers 1 through 19 at Rib 0, in accordance with paragraph 2.A. of British Aerospace BAe ATP
Service Bulletin ATP-57-14, Revision 1, dated September 27, 1993; or Revision 3, dated December 15, 1993.
If any discrepancy, as specified in the service bulletin, is detected, prior to further flight, correct it in accordance
with the service bulletin. 
(b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM-113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate.
Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments
and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM-113.





Note:

 Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained
from the Standardization Branch, ANM-113.



(c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) 21.197 and 21.199
to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. 
(d) The inspection, torque loading check, and correction of discrepancies shall be done in accordance with the following
British Aerospace BAe ATP Service Bulletins, which contain the specified list of effective pages:

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Jetstream Model ATP airplanes,
that requires replacement of certain circuit breakers on the left- and right-hand AC generator panel assemblies
with new circuit breakers. This amendment is prompted by reports of failures due to localized overheating of the electric
power circuit for the air conditioning recirculation fan in the environmental control system (ECS). The actions
specified by this AD are intended to prevent the recirculation fan circuit from overheating, which could lead to smoke
and/or flame in the fuselage. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain Jetstream Model ATP airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 22, 1993 (58 FR 61635). That action proposed to require replacement of certain Texas Instrument circuit
breakers on the left- and right-hand AC generator panel assemblies with certain Genelco circuit breakers.

 

Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the single comment received. 

 The commenter supports the proposed rule. 

 After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 

 The FAA estimates that 10 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 2 work
hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts will cost approximately $225 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $3,350, or $335 per airplane. 

 The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 

 The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not

Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model DC-10 Series Airplanes and 
KC-10A (Military) Airplanes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
applicable to all McDonnell Douglas Model DC-10 series airplanes and KC-10A (military) 
airplanes. This action requires inspections to determine the serial numbers and to detect 
defects in the upper and lower lock links on the nose landing gear (NLG), and rework or 
replacement of any defective link found. This amendment is prompted by reports of 
cracking and subsequent failure of certain lock links on these airplanes, which have been 
attributed to forging defects in the lock links. The actions specified in this AD are 
intended to prevent collapse of the NLG. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The FAA has received a report of cracking and 
subsequent failure of an upper lock link on the center landing gear (CLG) of a McDonnell 
Douglas Model MD-11 series airplane. Results of a subsequent analysis attributed the 
failure to forging defects in the lock link. An investigation conducted by the manufacturer 
revealed two additional upper links on the CLG with similar forging defects. The lower 
lock link on the CLG and the upper and lower lock links on the nose landing gear (NLG) 
are similar in design and are manufactured by the same supplier as the upper lock link on 
the CLG; therefore, defective lock links could be installed at any of these locations. 
Failure of the lock links on the CLG would result in collapse of the CLG; collapse of the 
CLG would not present an unsafe condition. However, cracking and subsequent failure of 
the lock links on the NLG, if not corrected, could result in collapse of the NLG. This 
situation could result in reduced controllability of the airplane during takeoff or landing. 



The FAA has issued a separate AD to address this unsafe condition on Model 
MD-11 series airplanes [reference AD 94-09-01, amendment 39-8889 (59 FR 18722, 
April 20, 1994)]. However, since the NLG lock links used on Model MD-11 series 
airplanes can also be used on Model DC-10 series airplanes and KC-10A (military) 
airplanes, the FAA finds that the latter airplane models also are subject to the identified 
unsafe condition. 

The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas DC-10 Alert Service 
Bulletin A32-237, dated April 11, 1994, that describes procedures for a visual inspection 
to determine the serial numbers of the upper and lower NLG lock links; an eddy current 
inspection to detect defects in suspect lock links; and rework of any defective lock link 
found, or replacement of any defective lock link with a servicable link. Reworking or 
replacing the lock links will minimize the possibility of failure of the lock links on NLG 
and subsequent collapse of a landing gear. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
other Model DC-10 series airplanes and KC-10A (military) airplanes of the same type 
design, this AD is being issued to prevent collapse of the NLG. This AD requires 
inspections to determine the serial numbers and to detect defects in the upper and lower 
lock links on the NLG, and rework or replacement of any defective link found. The 
actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described 
previously. This AD also requires that operators submit a report of inspection findings to 
the FAA. 

Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is 
found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and 
that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days. 

The required compliance time of 120 days is usually sufficient to allow for a brief 
comment period before adoption of a final rule. In this AD, however, that compliance 
time was selected because of a short-term problem with availability of sufficient 
replacement parts if defects are found; a shorter compliance time might have resulted in 
the unnecessary removal of airplanes from service pending delivery of replacement parts. 
Nevertheless, the FAA has determined that immediate adoption is necessary in this case 
because of the importance of initiating the required inspections as soon as possible.




Comments Invited 



Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements 
affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public 
comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment 
on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. 
Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to 
the address specified under the caption 

ADDRESSES.

 All communications received on 
or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended 
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's 
ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action 
and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed. 

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, 
environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. 
All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for 
comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that 
summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be 
filed in the Rules Docket. 

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments 
submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on 
which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-53-AD.'' 
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
Assessment. 

The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must 
be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant 
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further that this 
action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation 
otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final 
regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if 
filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Airworthiness Directives; Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7R4 Series Turbofan Engines 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7R4 series
turbofan engines, that requires initial and repetitive fan blade leading edge inspections, and either installation
of fan blade sets with modified fan blade shrouds or rework of the fan blade shrouds as a terminating action to the inspections.
This amendment is prompted by reports of flutter-induced fan blade fractures. The actions specified by this AD are
intended to prevent fan blade fracture and uncontained engine failure, resulting in possible damage to the aircraft.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to Pratt & Whitney (PW) JT9D-7R4 series turbofan engines was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 2, 1993 (58 FR 31356). That action proposed to require initial and repetitive on-wing or shop fan blade leading
edge inspections to check for leading edge damage in accordance with PW Service Bulletin (SB) No. 72-255, Revision
5, dated January 8, 1990; and to require fan blade set replacement or optional rework of the fan blade shrouds in accordance
with PW SB No. 72-309, Revision 9, dated June 12, 1991. Though the NPRM referenced PW SB No. 72-309, Revision
9, dated June 12, 1991, this final rule incorporates the later Revision 10, dated September 2, 1993, which is substantially
unchanged from Revision 9. Rework of the fan blade shrouds in accordance with PW SB No. 72-309, Revision 9, dated
June 12, 1991, is an acceptable alternate means of compliance for paragraphs (c) and (d) of this AD. 




Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 


One comment states that the proposed 90-day requirement for initializing the inspection program poses a significant
hardship and economic impact due to difficulty in scheduling engine maintenance. This comment requests extending
the initializing period to 180 days. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) agrees that the proposed initial
90-day eddy current inspection requirement may be burdensome to some operators. The FAA has therefore added a visual
inspection as an option to the eddy current inspection in this final rule. This visual inspection offers greater flexibility
in scheduling as it can easily be performed in the field. The FAA does not concur, however, in extending the initializing
period to 180 days, as this time period does not offer an adequate level of safety based on risk analysis results. This
final rule establishes an interval of 200 cycles in service (CIS) before visual or eddy current inspection that should
enable operators to initialize the inspection program with minimum disruption to scheduling without reducing flight
safety. Also, the FAA has added guidance emphasizing the manner in which the visual inspection should be performed.


One comment requests eliminating the reference in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the proposed rule to the leading edge refurbishment
described in PW Service Bulletin (SB) No. 72-117, as the determining factor for beginning the inspection program.
The comment further states that a previous AD, 90-14-08, already requires the leading edge refurbishment
described in PW SB No. 72-117, and therefore meets the intent of paragraphs (a) and (b) of the proposed rule. The
FAA concurs. Repetitive leading edge refurbishment as described in PW SB No. 72-117 is already required by AD
90-14-08. The compliance section of this AD has been changed from the wording in the NPRM to eliminate reference
to leading edge refurbishment, and combines paragraphs (a) and (b) of the proposed rule into a new paragraph (a) which
has the same inspection requirements and interval of 200 CIS as the repetitive inspections of paragraph (c) of the
proposed rule.

One comment states that the mandatory incorporation of the fan blade shroud angle rework to 52 degrees as described
in PW SB No. 72-309 should be relaxed from within two years after the effective date of this AD to the next engine
shop visit, thereby reducing the potential for on-wing maintenance induced error. The FAA does not concur. The FAA
has determined that it is necessary to expeditiously remove fan blades with the 62 degree shroud configuration, thereby
reducing the potential for operating the fan blade in flutter. The FAA has reviewed a risk analysis study that indicates
that a two-year time period for incorporating this modification is required to lower the risk sufficiently to avert
future potential uncontained fan blade failures.
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.
There are approximately 730 PW JT9D-7R4 series engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA
estimates that 220 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this AD, and that the average
labor rate is $55 per work hour. The inspections required by this AD will take approximately 1.6 work hours per engine.
The blade rework will cost approximately $15,600 per engine. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD
on U.S. operators is estimated to be $3,451,360.
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

Airworthiness Directives; Teledyne Continental Motors IO-346, IO-520, and IO-550 Series Piston
Engines 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM)
IO-346, IO-520, and IO-550 series piston engines, that requires initial and repetitive inspections
of the engine mount brackets for cracks, and if found cracked, replacement with improved design engine mount brackets.
All engine mount brackets require replacement with improved design engine mount brackets at the next engine removal
after the effective date of this AD. This amendment is prompted by reports of cracks in engine mount brackets on engines
that have completed at least one overhaul cycle. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent engine separation
from the aircraft due to cracks in the engine mount brackets.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) IO-346, IO-520, and IO-550 series piston engines
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 20, 1993 (58 FR 54072). That action proposed to require initial and repetitive dye penetrant inspections
for cracks in certain lower left engine mount brackets, Part Number (P/N) 630695. If the lower left engine mount bracket
is found cracked, that proposed rule would require replacing both the lower left and lower right engine mount brackets
with improved design engine mount brackets, P/N 653306 and 653305, respectively. If a crack is not detected, the lower
left engine mount bracket would require repetitive inspections at intervals not to exceed 500 hours time in service
(TIS) until the next engine removal, at which time engine mount brackets, P/N 630694 and 630695, would be replaced
with improved design engine mount brackets, P/N 653306 and 653305. Installation of these improved design engine
mount brackets would constitute terminating action to the inspection requirements of that AD. The actions would
be required to be accomplished in accordance with TCM Service Bulletin (SB) No. M92-13, dated September 4, 1992.



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the one comment received. 
The commenter supports the proposed rule but states that the interval for the repetitive inspections should be reduced
from 500 hours TIS to 100 hours TIS. The commenter states that if the bracket is found broken, the airframe engine mount
and surrounding areas should be inspected for damage and the upper brackets and all bolts and nuts should be replaced
as they may be overstressed. The commenter further states that the pilot should visually inspect the brackets on each
preflight. 
The FAA does not concur with the recommendation to reduce the repetitive inspection interval to 100 hours TIS. Data
provided from the manufacturer indicates that the repetitive inspection interval of 500 hours TIS is sufficient
once the initial inspection is satisfactorily completed. 
The FAA does not concur with the commenter's recommendation to inspect the airframe engine mount and surrounding
areas for damage and to replace all bolts and nuts if the bottom brackets are found broken. Once the bottom brackets
are broken, there is essentially no load being transmitted to the lower airframe structure. In addition, a structural
analysis of the bolt strength indicates that with only the two upper mounts securing the engine, safety factors exceed
required values for normal category ``g'' loading. Therefore, none of the bolts and nuts should be overstressed.

The FAA does not concur with the commenter's recommendation to require the pilot to visually inspect the brackets
on each preflight. Based on the data presented above, the FAA has determined that it is not necessary to inspect the
brackets on each preflight. 
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed.

There are approximately 9,750 TCM IO-346, IO-520, and IO-550 series piston engines of the affected
design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 8,300 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be
affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 2 work hours per inspection, and if the engine mount brackets must
be replaced, an additional 4 work hours will be required. The average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts
will cost approximately $320 per engine. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is
estimated to be $5,395,000. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration
amends 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: 


PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 


1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:

 



Authority:

 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. 


 39.13


[Amended] 


2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive:

 



94-09-07 Teledyne Continental Motors: 

Amendment 39-8896. Docket 92-ANE-50.

 



Applicability: 

Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) engine models IO-346A, IO-346B, IO-520C, IO-520CB, and
IO-550C; rebuilt engine model IO-520C with serial numbers (S/N) 287051-R and lower; rebuilt engine

and lower; and all factory overhauled IO-520C, IO-520CB, and IO-550C engines with a build date prior
to 
August 6, 1992. These engines are installed on but not limited to Beech model A23, A23A, 95-C55, 95-C55A,
D55, D55A, E55, E55A, 58, and 58A airplanes. 


Compliance: 

Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 
To prevent engine separation from the aircraft due to cracks in the engine mount brackets, accomplish the following:

(a) For engines with engine mount brackets that have completed at least one engine overhaul cycle, or have accumulated
2,500 or more hours time in service (TIS) on the effective date of this AD, inspect the lower left engine mount bracket,
Part Number (P/N) 630695, for cracks using the dye penetrant techniques specified in this paragraph and in accordance
with TCM Service Bulletin (SB) No. M92-13, dated September 4, 1992, within the next 50 hours TIS after the effective
date of this AD. 
(1) Perform the dye penetrant inspection as follows:

<TEXT>
 

(i) 

Preparation: 

clean and dry all parts in such a manner as to leave the surfaces free from grease, oil, soaps, alkalies, and other substances
which would interfere with inspection. Vapor degreasing is generally suitable for this purpose. 
(ii) 

Penetrant Application Procedure: 

after preparation, spray or brush the parts with the penetrant, and allow to stand for not less than 5 minutes. The effectiveness
of the penetrant increases if left standing for a longer time, as the penetrant will reach finer discontinuities.

(iii) 

Penetrant Cleaning: 

clean the parts thoroughly using a medium which will remove penetrant from the surfaces of parts; wash with water when
the penetrant is water soluble. When other than water soluble penetrants are used, the penetrant shall be removed
with a suitable cleaner. Avoid excessive cleaning which would remove the penetrant from discontinuities. 
(iv) 

Drying: 

dry the parts as thoroughly as possible. Drying of parts may be accomplished by evaporation at room temperature or
by placing the parts in a circulating warm air oven or in the air stream of a hot air dryer. Avoid excessive drying time
or drying temperatures above 75
 C (165
 F) to prevent excessive evaporation of the penetrant. If heat is used for drying parts, cool parts to approximately
50
 C (120
 F) before proceeding to the developing procedure. 
(v) 

Developing: 

apply the developer to the dry parts as lightly and as evenly as possible, using as thin a coating of developer as is possible.
A translucent film is adequate. Mix wet developer by agitation immediately prior to applying it. After applying the
developer, take care that no penetrant indication is disturbed or obliterated in subsequent handling. 
(vi) 

Examination: 

examine the developed penetrant indications in accordance with the dye penetrant manufacturer's instructions.
Examine parts for indications of discontinuities open to the surface. 
(vii) 

Final cleaning: 

clean the parts following the inspection to remove penetrant and developer.





Note 1: 

Caution: 

Because of differences among penetrants, take care to ensure that the final cleaner, the penetrant, the penetrant
remover, and the developer are suitable for use with each other.





Note 2: 

Caution: 

All penetrant materials should be kept as free from moisture as possible.





Note 3: 

Caution: 

Most penetrants, cleaning agents, and developer suspensions are low flash point material; use caution to prevent
fires. 
(2) If no crack is detected, inspect in accordance with paragraph (a) of this AD at intervals not to exceed 500 hours
TIS since the last inspection. 
(3) If a crack is detected, prior to further flight replace both the lower left engine mount bracket, P/N 630695, and
lower right engine mount bracket, P/N 630694, with improved design engine mount brackets, P/N 653306 and 653305,
respectively. 
(b) For all engines, replace both the lower left engine mount bracket, P/N 630695, and lower right engine mount bracket,
P/N 630694, with improved design engine mount brackets, P/N 653306 and 653305, respectively, at the next engine removal
after the effective date of this AD. 
(c) Installation of the improved design engine mount brackets, P/N 653306 and 653305, constitutes terminating action
to the inspection requirements of this AD. 
(d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office. The request should be forwarded
through an appropriate FAA Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Atlanta Aircraft
Certification Office.

Airworthiness Directives; Teledyne Continental Motors (Formerly Bendix) Magnetos 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule, request for comments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document publishes in the 

Federal Register

 an amendment adopting airworthiness directive (AD) 94-06-09 that was sent previously to all known U.S.
owners and operators of Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) (formerly Bendix) SC-20, SC-200, and S-1200
series magnetos by individual letters. This AD requires inspection to determine if capacitors that may have an intermittent
open circuit condition are installed in magnetos, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable capacitors.
This amendment is prompted by reports that TCM produced and delivered magneto capacitors that have the potential
for an intermittent open circuit condition that may exist between the internal through-lead and the p-lead stud terminal.
The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent possible injury or death to ground personnel due to a non-grounded
magneto.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On March 9, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued priority letter airworthiness directive (AD)
94-06-09, applicable to Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) (formerly Bendix) SC-20, SC-200,
and S-1200 series magnetos, which requires inspection to determine if capacitors that may have an intermittent
open circuit condition are installed in magnetos, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable capacitors.
That action was prompted by reports that TCM produced and delivered magneto capacitors, Part Number (P/N) 10-349276,
which have the potential for an intermittent open circuit condition that may exist between the internal through-lead
and the p-lead stud terminal. The potential open circuit condition was initially discovered during a production
engine test run at TCM. Further investigation revealed this problem to be limited to two lot numbers, 93-40 and
93-42, approximately 500 capacitors total. To date 241 of the capacitors have been found and taken out of service.
These parts were used in magnetos produced at TCM for company use, Textron Lycoming use, after market sales, and for
individual capacitors sold as spares to the field after October 27, 1993. These individual replacement parts can
be fitted into TCM or Bendix magnetos. 




A capacitor with the intermittent open circuit condition described can result in a ``hot mag'' (i.e. the magneto is
not grounded when the ignition/magneto switch is placed in the off position). The magneto is therefore capable of
producing ignition, and if the propeller is moved with some residual fuel left in the cylinders, the engine could start
momentarily. This momentary engine start could turn the propeller with enough force to cause injury or death to ground
personnel struck by the turning propeller. Capacitors with an intermittent open circuit condition may show no revolutions
per minute (RPM) drop-off during the magneto check prior to flight. This condition, if not corrected, could result
in possible injury or death to ground personnel due to a non-grounded magneto. 


The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of TCM Critical Service Bulletin (CSB) 641, dated February
1, 1994, that describes procedures for determining if magnetos contain capacitors, P/N 10-349276, that may
have an intermittent open circuit condition. 


Since the unsafe condition described is likely to exist or develop on other products of the same type design, the FAA
issued priority letter AD 94-06-09 to prevent possible injury or death to ground personnel due to a non-grounded
magneto. The AD requires inspection within 10 hours time in service after the effective date of this AD to determine
if affected capacitors are installed in magnetos, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable capacitors.
All affected magnetos must be metal stamped with the letter ``E'' to show compliance. The actions are required to be
accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 


Since it was found that immediate corrective action was required, notice and opportunity for prior public comment
thereon were impracticable and contrary to the public interest, and good cause existed to make the AD effective immediately
by individual letters issued on March 9, 1994, to all known U.S. owners and operators of TCM (formerly Bendix) SC-20,
SC-200, and S-1200 series magnetos installed on but not limited to reciprocating engine powered Beech,
Cessna, Maule, Mooney, Piper, and Robinson aircraft. These conditions still exist, and the AD is hereby published
in the 

Federal Register

 as an amendment to  39.13 of part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) to make it effective to all persons.



Comments Invited 





Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption


ADDRESSES

. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 





Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 





Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-ANE-12.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 




The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26,




1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed,
may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Paperwork Reduction Act 


The collection-of-information requirements contained in the 
final regulations under sections 2701(e)(6) and 2702 have been 
reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget in 
accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act 
(44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) under control number 1545-1273. The 
estimated average annual burden per recordkeeper attributable to 
these final regulations is two minutes. The estimated average 
annual burden per respondent attributable to these final 
regulations is ten minutes. 
These estimates approximate the average time expected to be 
necessary for the collection of information. They are based upon 
the information available to the IRS and do not include an 
estimate of annual burden per recordkeeper applicable to Forms 
706 and 709. Individual respondents and recordkeepers may 
require more or less time depending on their particular 
circumstances. 
Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and 
suggestions for reducing this burden should be sent to the 
Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, 
PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224, and to the Office of Management 
and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the 
Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 
Washington, DC 20503. 


Background 


Proposed Regulations 


Proposed  25.2701-5 (relating to adjustments to mitigate 
double taxation) was published in the 

Federal Register

 on 
February 4, 1992. This document adopts final regulations under 
 25.2701-5. 


Mitigation of Effects of Double Taxation 


Section 2701 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) provides 
special valuation rules to determine the amount of the gift when 
an individual transfers an equity interest in a corporation or 
partnership to a member of the individual's family. For section 
2701 to apply, the transferor or an applicable family member 
must, immediately after the transfer, hold an equity interest 
having liquidation rights or distribution rights that are 
preferential to the rights of the transferred interest (an 
applicable retained interest). 
If section 2701 applies to a transfer, the amount of the 
transferor's gift is determined using a subtraction method of 
valuation. Generally, in determining the value of any applicable 
retained interest held by the transferor or an applicable family 
member, liquidation rights and certain distribution rights in a 
controlled entity are valued at zero. 
Section 2701(e)(6) provides that if there is a subsequent 
transfer or inclusion in the gross estate of any applicable 
retained interest that was valued under the rules of section 
2701, appropriate adjustments are to be made, pursuant to 
regulations, to reflect the increase in the amount of any prior 
taxable gift made by the transferor or decedent by reason of such 
valuation.

The proposed regulations mitigate the effect of double 
taxation through a reduction to a decedent's adjusted taxable 
gifts. In general, the amount of the reduction is the lesser of: 
(1) The amount by which the transferor's taxable gifts were 
increased as a result of the application of section 2701 to the 
initial transfer, or (2) the amount by which the individual's 
taxable transfers were increased as a result of not applying the 
valuation rules of section 2701 upon the subsequent transfer of 
the applicable retained interest. 
Under certain circumstances, the proposed regulations 
provide that the transferor's spouse is treated as the transferor 
for purposes of making the adjustment. However, because a 
transferor will often acquire (by gift, inheritance, or purchase) 
an applicable retained interest initially held by an applicable 
family member and because of the administrative complexity 
inherent in allowing assignability of the adjustment between the 
transferor and any other applicable family member, the proposed 
regulations do not provide for an adjustment by any individual 
other than the transferor or the transferor's spouse. 


Potential for Loss of Benefit 


One commentator argued that some taxpayers will be deprived 
of the benefit of the adjustment if it is not: (1) Available for 
lifetime transfers, and (2) freely assignable to all applicable 
family members. In response to this comment, the final 
regulations adopt a rule generally allowing the adjustment in the 
computation of the transferor's gift tax if either the transferor 
or an applicable family member transfers an applicable retained 
interest to or for the benefit of an individual other than the 
transferor or an applicable family member. 
In addition, if the applicable retained interest has not 
been so transferred prior to the death of the transferor, the 
executor of the transferor's estate is entitled to make the 
adjustment in computing the transferor's estate tax provided that 
the executor can demonstrate the fair market value of the 
applicable retained interest as of the date of death of the 
transferor. 
However, after carefully considering the merits of a freely 
assignable adjustment, the IRS and the Treasury have determined 
that in light of the relief otherwise provided, the 
administrative complexity involved in tracking the adjustment 
would far outweigh the additional benefit that would be gained 
therefrom. 


``Purge'' Method 


One commentator argued that double taxation is avoided only 
if the adjustment produces no greater tax than would be produced 
if the initial transfer had not been made (and the value of the 
entity did not change prior to the transferor's death). In the 
view of this commentator, section 2701 requires prepayment of 
transfer tax as the ``cost'' of a corporate or partnership freeze. 
Under this view, the section 2701(e)(6) adjustment would be 
accomplished through a mechanism whereby the transferor's 
transfer tax base is ``purged'' of the effect of section 2701.

<TEXT>
 

The final regulations continue the approach of the proposed regulations in that they provide the same relief as that
advocated above except in those cases where the retained interest declines in value between the date of the initial
transfer and the date of the subsequent transfer. Because a reduction in the value of the entity may occur as the result
of indirect (hard to 
detect) transfers to younger generations, the IRS and the Treasury believe that adoption of the purge method is inconsistent
with the purpose of section 2701 and would perpetuate the abuses Congress sought to eliminate. 



Split Gifts 



The proposed regulations provide that the effects of section 2513 (pertaining to gift splitting between spouses)
are to be ignored in making the adjustment under section 2701(e)(6). One commentator argued that part of the adjustment
could be lost depending upon which spouse died first. In response to this comment, the final regulations provide adjustments
for split 
gifts that are generally consistent with the principles of section 2001(d) and (e) (pertaining to the treatment of
split gifts in the computation of the estate tax). 



Transfers to Spouse 



Under the proposed regulations, the transfer of an applicable retained interest to the transferor's spouse results
in the automatic assignment of the adjustment to the spouse. One commentator argued that this automatic assignment
will result in loss of the adjustment if the spouse has not made sufficient prior gifts. Under the final regulations,
the adjustment is not 
assigned to the spouse but, instead, is generally available to the transferor or the executor of the transferor's
estate. 



Effect on Prior Section 2701 Transfers 



The final regulations are effective with respect to section 2701 interests transferred after May 4, 1994. For section
2701 transfers occurring on or before May 4, 1994, taxpayers may rely on the final regulations, the previously proposed
regulations or any other reasonable interpretation of the statute. 



Final Regulations Under Section 2702 



The final regulations contain a technical amendment to the regulations under section 2702 pertaining to the governing
instrument requirements for qualified interests under section 2702. The amendment, pertaining to the treatment
of short taxable years, simplifies the valuation of an annuity or unitrust interest by eliminating the need to pro-rate
the first year's 
payment in the case of a short taxable year. 



Special Analyses 



It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedures
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and, 
therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration
for comment on its impact on small business. 



Drafting Information 



The principal author of these regulations is Fred E. Grundeman, Office of Chief Counsel, IRS. Other personnel from
the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development.

Adjustments to mitigate double taxation.



(a) 

Reduction of transfer tax base

_(1) 

In general.

 This section provides rules under which an individual (the initial transferor) making a transfer subject to section
2701 (the initial transfer) is entitled to reduce his or her taxable gifts or adjusted taxable gifts (the reduction).
The amount of the reduction is determined under paragraph (b) of this section. See paragraph (e) of this section if
section 2513 (split gifts) applied to the initial transfer.

(2) 

Federal gift tax modification.

 If, during the lifetime of the initial transferor, the holder of a section 2701 interest (as defined in paragraph (a)(4)
of this section) transfers the interest to or for the benefit of an individual other than the initial transferor or
an applicable family member of the initial transferor in a transfer subject to Federal estate or gift tax, the initial
transferor may reduce the amount on which the initial transferor's tentative tax is computed under section 2502(a).
The reduction is first applied on any gift tax return required to be filed for the calendar year in which the section
2701 interest is transferred; any excess reduction is carried forward and applied in each succeeding calendar year
until the reduction is exhausted. The amount of the reduction that is used in a calendar year is the amount of the initial
transferor's taxable gifts for that year. Any excess reduction remaining at the death of the initial transferor may
be applied by the executor of the initial transferor's estate as provided under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
See paragraph (a)(4) of this section for the definition of a section 2701 interest. See  25.2701-6 for
rules relating to indirect ownership of equity interests transferred to trusts and other entities.

(3) 

Federal estate tax modification.

 Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(3), in determining the Federal estate tax with respect to an initial
transferor, the executor of the initial transferor's estate may reduce the amount on which the decedent's tentative
tax is computed under section 2001(b) (or section 2101(b)) by the amount of the reduction (including any excess reduction
carried forward under paragraph (a)(2) of this section). The amount of the reduction under this paragraph (a)(3)
is limited to the amount that results in zero Federal estate tax with respect to the estate of the initial transferor.

(4) 

Section 2701 interest.

 A section 2701 interest is an applicable retained interest that was valued using the special valuation rules of section
2701 at the time of the initial transfer. However, an interest is a section 2701 interest only to the extent the transfer
of that interest effectively reduces the aggregate ownership of such class of interest by the initial transferor
and applicable family members of the initial transferor below that held by such persons at the time of the initial transfer
(or the remaining portion thereof).

(b) 

Amount of reduction.

 Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c)(3)(iv) (pertaining to transfers of partial interests) and (e) (pertaining
to initial split gifts) of this section, the amount of the reduction is the lesser of_

<DOCNO> FR940505-0-00064 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940505-0-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) The amount by which the initial transferor's taxable gifts were increased as a result of the application of section
2701 to the initial transfer; or 

(2) The amount (determined under paragraph (c) of this section) duplicated in the transfer tax base at the time of the
transfer of the section 2701 interest (the duplicated amount). 

(c) 

Duplicated amount

_(1) 

In general

. The duplicated amount is the amount by which the transfer tax value of the section 2701 interest at the time of the subsequent
transfer exceeds the value of that interest determined under section 2701 at the time of the initial transfer. If,
at the time of the initial transfer, the amount allocated to the transferred interest under  25.2701-3(b)(3)
(

Step 3

 of the valuation methodology) is less than the entire amount available for allocation at that time, the duplicated
amount is a fraction of the amount described in the preceding sentence. The numerator of the fraction is the amount
allocated to the transferred interest at the time of the initial transfer (pursuant to  25.2701-3(b)(3))
and the denominator of the fraction is the amount available for allocation at the time of the initial transfer (determined
after application of  25.2701-3(b)(2)). 

(2) 

Transfer tax value_in general

. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, for purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section the transfer
tax value of a section 2701 interest is the value of that interest as finally determined for Federal transfer tax purposes
under chapter 11 or chapter 12, as the case may be (including the right to receive any distributions thereon (other
than qualified payments)), reduced by the amount of any deduction allowed with respect to the section 2701 interest
to the extent that the deduction would not have been allowed if the section 2701 interest were not included in the transferor's
total amount of gifts for the calendar year or the transferor's gross estate, as the case may be. Rules similar to the
rules of section 691(c)(2)(C) are applicable to determine the extent that a deduction would not be allowed if the section
2701 interest were not so included. 

(3) 

Special transfer tax value rules

_(i) 

Transfers for consideration

. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, if, during the life of the initial transferor, a section
2701 interest is transferred to or for the benefit of an individual other than the initial transferor or an applicable
family member of the initial transferor for consideration in money or money's worth, or in a transfer that is treated
as a transfer for consideration in money or money's worth, the transfer of the section 2701 interest is deemed to occur
at the death of the initial transferor. In this case, the estate of the initial transferor is entitled to a reduction
in the same manner as if the initial transferor's gross estate included a section 2701 interest having a chapter 11
value equal to the amount of consideration in money or money's worth received in the exchange (determined as of the
time of the exchange). 

(ii) 

Interests held by applicable family members at date of initial transferor's death

. If a section 2701 interest in existence on the date of the initial transferor's death is held by an applicable family
member and, therefore, is not included in the gross estate of the initial transferor, the section 2701 interest is
deemed to be transferred at the death of the initial transferor to or for the benefit of an individual other than the
initial transferor or an applicable family member of the initial transferor. In this case, the transfer tax value
of that interest is the value that the executor of the initial transferor's estate can demonstrate would be determined
under chapter 12 if the interest were transferred immediately prior to the death of the initial transferor. 

(iii) 

Nonrecognition transactions

. If an individual exchanges a section 2701 interest in a nonrecognition transaction (within the meaning of section
7701(a)(45)), the exchange is not treated as a transfer of a section 2701 interest and the transfer tax value of that
interest is determined as if the interest received in exchange is the section 2701 interest. 

(iv) 

Transfer of less than the entire section 2701 interest

. If a transfer is a transfer of less than the entire section 2701 interest, the amount of the reduction under paragraph
(a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section is reduced proportionately.

<PARENT> FR940505-0-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(v) 

Multiple classes of section 2701 interest

. For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, if more than one class of section 2701 interest exists, the amount of
the reduction is determined separately with respect to each such class. 

(vi) 

Multiple initial transfers

. If an initial transferor has made more than one initial transfer, the amount of the reduction with respect to any section
2701 interest is the sum of the reductions computed under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to each such initial
transfer. 

(d) 

Examples

. The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.







Facts

. (1) 

In general

. (i) P, an individual, holds 1,500 shares of $1,000 par value preferred stock of X corporation (bearing an annual noncumulative
dividend of $100 per share that may be put to X at any time for par value) and 1,000 shares of voting common stock of X. There
is no other outstanding common stock of X. 

(ii) On January 15, 1991, when the aggregate fair market value of the preferred stock is $1,500,000 and the aggregate
fair market value of the common stock is $500,000, P transfers common stock to P's child. The fair market value of P's
interest in X (common and preferred) immediately prior to the transfer is $2,000,000, and the section 2701 value of
the preferred stock (the section 2701 interest) is zero. Neither P nor P's spouse, S, made gifts prior to 1991. 

(2) 

Additional facts applicable to Examples 1 through 3

. P's transfer consists of all 1,000 shares of P's common stock. With respect to the initial transfer, the amount remaining
after Step 2 of the subtraction method of  25.2701-3 is $2,000,000 ($2,000,000 minus zero), all of which
is allocated to the transferred stock. P's aggregate taxable gifts for 1991 (including the section 2701 transfer)
equal $2,500,000. 

(3) 

Additional facts applicable to Examples 4 and 5

. P's initial transfer consists of one-half of P's common stock. With respect to the initial transfer in this case,
only $1,000,000 (one-half of the amount remaining after Step 2 of the subtraction method of  25.2701-3)
is allocated to the transferred stock. P's aggregate taxable gifts for 1991 (the section 2701 transfer and P's other
transfers) equal $2,500,000. 



Example 1

. 

Inter vivos transfer of entire section 2701 interest

. (i) On October 1, 1994, at a time when the value of P's preferred stock is $1,400,000, P transfers all of the preferred
stock to P's child. In computing P's 1994 gift tax, P, as the initial transferor, is entitled to reduce the amount on
which P's tentative tax is computed under section 2502(a) by $1,400,000. 

(ii) The amount of the reduction computed under paragraph (b) of this section is the lesser of $1,500,000 (the amount
by which the initial transferor's taxable gifts were increased as a result of the application of section 2701 to the
initial transfer) or $1,400,000 (the duplicated amount). The duplicated amount is 100 percent (the portion of the
section 2701 interest subsequently transferred) times $1,400,000 (the amount by which the gift tax value of the preferred
stock ($1,400,000 at the time of the subsequent transfer) exceeds zero (the section 2701 value of the preferred stock
at the time of the initial transfer)). 

(iii) The result would be the same if the preferred stock had been held by P's parent, GM, and GM had, on October 1, 1994,
transferred the preferred stock to or for the benefit of an individual other than P or an applicable family member of
P. In that case, in computing the tax on P's 1994 and subsequent transfers, P would be entitled to reduce the amount on
which P's tentative tax is computed under section 2502(a) by $1,400,000. If the value of P's 1994 gifts is less than
$1,400,000, P is entitled to claim the excess adjustment in computing the tax with respect to P's subsequent transfers.




Example 2

. 

Transfer of section 2701 interest at death of initial transferor.

 (i) P continues to hold the preferred stock until P's death. The chapter 11 value of the preferred stock at the date of
P's death is the same as the fair market value of the preferred stock at the time of the initial transfer. In computing
the Federal estate tax with respect to P's estate, P's executor is entitled to a reduction of $1,500,000 under paragraph
(a)(3) of this section. 

(ii) The result would be the same if P had sold the preferred stock to any individual other than an applicable family
member at a time when the value of the preferred stock was $1,500,000. In that case, the amount of the reduction is computed
as if the preferred stock were included in P's gross estate at a fair market value equal to the sales price. If the value
of P's taxable estate is less than $1,500,000, the amount of the adjustment available to P's executor is limited to
the actual value of P's taxable estate. 

(iii) The result would also be the same if the preferred stock had been held by P's parent, GM, and at the time of P's death,
GM had not transferred the preferred stock. 



Example 3

. 

Transfer of after-acquired preferred stock

. On September 1, 1992, P purchases 100 shares of X preferred stock from an unrelated party. On October 1, 1994, P transfers
100 shares of X preferred stock to P's child. In computing P's 1994 gift tax, P is not entitled to reduce the amount on
which P's tentative tax is computed under section 2502(a) because the 1994 transfer does not reduce P's preferred
stock holding below that held at the time of the initial transfer. See paragraph (a)(4) of this section. 



Example 4

. 

Inter vivos transfer of entire section 2701 interest

. (i) On October 1, 1994, at a time when the value of P's preferred stock is $1,400,000, P transfers all of the preferred
stock to P's child. In computing P's 1994 gift tax, P, as the initial transferor, is entitled to reduce the amount on
which P's tentative tax is computed under section 2502(a) by $700,000. 

(ii) The amount of the reduction computed under paragraph (b) of this section is the lesser of $750,000 (($1,500,000
 x  .5 ($1,000,000 over $2,000,000)) the amount by which the initial transferor's taxable gifts were increased
as a result of the application of section 2701 to the initial transfer) or $700,000 (($1,400,000  x  .5) the duplicated
amount). The duplicated amount is 100 percent (the portion of the section 2701 interest subsequently transferred)
times $700,000; e.g., one-half (the fraction representing the portion of the common stock transferred in the initial
transfer ($1,000,000/$2,000,000)) of the amount by which the gift tax value of the preferred stock at the time of the
subsequent transfer ($1,400,000) exceeds zero (the section 2701 value of the preferred stock at the time of the initial
transfer). 



Example 5

. 

Subsequent transfer of less than the entire section 2701 interest

. On October 1, 1994, at a time when the value of P's preferred stock is $1,400,000, P transfers only 250 of P's 1,000 shares
of preferred stock to P's child. In this case, the amount of the reduction computed under paragraph (b) is $175,000
(one-fourth (250/1,000) of the amount of the reduction available if P had transferred all 1,000 shares of preferred
stock).

(e) 

Computation of reduction if initial transfer is split 
under section 2513_

(1) 

In general. 

If section 2513 applies to 
the initial transfer (a split initial transfer), the special 
rules of this paragraph (e) apply. 


(2) 

Transfers during joint lives. 

If there is a split 
initial transfer and the corresponding section 2701 interest is 
transferred during the joint lives of the donor and the 
consenting spouse, for purposes of determining the reduction 
under paragraph (a)(2) of this section each spouse is treated as 
if the spouse was the initial transferor of one-half of the split 
initial transfer. 


(3) 

Transfers at or after death of either spouse_

(i) 

In 
general. 

If there is a split initial transfer and the 
corresponding section 2701 interest is transferred at or after 
the death of the first spouse to die, the reduction under 
paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section is determined as if 
the donor spouse was the initial transferor of the entire initial 
transfer. 


(ii) 

Death of donor spouse. 

Except as provided in paragraph 
(e)(3)(iv) of this section, the executor of the estate of the 
donor spouse in a split initial transfer is entitled to compute 
the reduction as if the donor spouse was the initial transferor 
of the section 2701 interest otherwise attributable to the 
consenting spouse. In this case, if the consenting spouse 
survives the donor spouse_

(A) The consenting spouse's aggregate sum of taxable gifts 
used in computing each tentative tax under section 2502(a) (and, 
therefore, adjusted taxable gifts under section 2001(b)(1)(B) (or 
section 2101(b)(1)(B)) and the tax payable on the consenting 
spouse's prior taxable gifts under section 2001(b)(2) (or section 
2101(b)(2))) is reduced to eliminate the remaining effect of the 
section 2701 interest; and 


(B) Except with respect to any excess reduction carried 
forward under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the consenting 
spouse ceases to be treated as the initial transferor of the 
section 2701 interest. 


(iii) 

Death of consenting spouse. 

If the consenting spouse 
predeceases the donor spouse, except for any excess reduction 
carried forward under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the 
reduction with respect to any section 2701 interest in the split 
initial transfer is not available to the estate of the consenting 
spouse (regardless of whether the interest is included in the 
consenting spouse's gross estate). Similarly, if the consenting 
spouse predeceases the donor spouse, no reduction is available to 
the consenting spouse's adjusted taxable gifts under section 
2001(b)(1)(B) (or section 2101(b)(1)(B)) or to the consenting 
spouse's gift tax payable under section 2001(b)(2) (or section 
2101(b)(2)). See paragraph (a)(2) of this section for rules 
involving transfers by an applicable family member during the 
life of the initial transferor. 


(iv) 

Additional limitation on reduction. 

If the donor spouse 
(or the estate of the donor spouse) is treated under this 
paragraph (e) as the initial transferor of the section 2701 
interest otherwise attributable to the consenting spouse, the 
amount of additional reduction determined under paragraph (b) of 
this section is the amount determined under that paragraph with 
respect to the consenting spouse. If a reduction was previously 
available to the consenting spouse under this paragraph (e), the 
amount determined under this paragraph (e)(3)(iv) with respect to 
the consenting spouse is determined as if the consenting spouse's 
taxable gifts in the split initial transfer had been increased 
only by that portion of the increase that corresponds to the 
remaining portion of the section 2701 interest. The amount of 
the additional reduction (i.e., the amount determined with 
respect to the consenting spouse) is limited to the amount that 
results in a reduction in the donor spouse's Federal transfer tax 
no greater than the amount of the increase in the consenting 
spouse's gift tax incurred by reason of the section 2701 interest 
(or the remaining portion thereof).


(f) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the 
provisions of paragraph (e) of this section. The examples assume 
the facts set out in this paragraph (f).

Facts

. (1) In each example assume that P, an individual, holds 1,500 shares of $1,000 par value preferred stock of X corporation
(bearing an annual noncumulative dividend of $100 per share that may be put to X at any time for par value) and 1,000 shares
of voting common stock of X. There is no other outstanding stock of X. The annual exclusion under section 2503 is not
allowable with respect to any gift.

(2) On January 15, 1991, when the aggregate fair market value of the preferred stock is $1,500,000 and the aggregate
fair market value of the common stock is $500,000, P transfers all 1,000 shares of the common stock to P's child. Section
2701 applies to the initial transfer because P transferred an equity interest (the common stock) to a member of P's
family and immediately thereafter held an applicable retained interest (the preferred stock). The fair market value
of P's interest in X immediately prior to the transfer is $2,000,000 and the section 2701 value of the preferred stock
(the section 2701 interest) is zero. With respect to the initial transfer, the amount remaining after Step 2 of the
subtraction method of  25.2701-3 was $2,000,000 ($2,000,000 minus zero), all of which is allocated to
the transferred stock. P had made no gifts prior to 1991. The sum of P's aggregate taxable gifts for the calendar year
1991 (including the section 2701 transfer) is $2,500,000. P's spouse, S, made no gifts prior to 1991.

(3) P and S elected pursuant to section 2513 to treat one- half of their 1991 gifts as having been made by each spouse.
Without the application of section 2701, P and S's aggregate gifts would have been $500,000 and each spouse would have
paid no gift tax because of the application of the unified credit under section 2505. However, because of the application
of section 2701, both P and S are each treated as the initial transferor of aggregate taxable gifts in the amount of $1,250,000
and, after the application of the unified credit under section 2505, each paid $255,500 in gift tax with respect to
their 1991 transfers. On October 1, 1994, at a time when the value of the preferred stock is the same as at the time of the
initial transfer, P transfers the preferred stock (the section 2701 interest) to P's child.



Example 1. Inter vivos transfer of entire section 2701 interest. 

P transfers all of the preferred stock to P's child. P and S are each entitled to a reduction of $750,000 in computing
their 1994 gift tax. P is entitled to the reduction because P subsequently transferred the one-half share of the section
2701 interest as to which P was the initial transferor to an individual who was not an applicable family member of P.
S is entitled to the reduction because P, an applicable family member with respect to S, transferred the one-half share
of the section 2701 interest as to which S was the initial transferor to an individual other than S or an applicable family
member of S. S may claim the reduction against S's 1994 gifts. If S's 1994 taxable gifts are less than $750,000, S may
claim the remaining amount of the reduction against S's next succeeding lifetime transfers.



Example 2. Inter vivos transfer of portion of section 2701 interest. 

P transfers one-fourth of the preferred stock to P's child. In this case, P and S are each entitled to a reduction of $187,500,
the corresponding portion of the reduction otherwise available to each spouse (one-fourth of $750,000).



Example 3. Transfer at death of donor spouse. 

P, the donor spouse in the section 2513 election, dies on October 1, 1994, while holding all of the preferred stock.
The executor of P's estate is entitled to a reduction in the computation of the tentative tax under section 2001(b).
Since no reduction had been previously available with respect to the section 2701 interest, P's estate is entitled
to a full reduction of $750,000 with respect to the one-half share of the preferred stock as to which P was the initial
transferor. In addition, P's estate is entitled to an additional reduction of up to $750,000 for the remaining section
2701 interest as to which S was the initial transferor. The reduction for the consenting spouse's remaining section
2701 interest is limited to that amount that will produce a tax saving in P's Federal estate tax of $255,500, the amount
of gift tax incurred by S by reason of the application of section 2701 to the split initial transfer.



Example 4. Transfer after death of donor spouse. 

The facts are the same as in 

Example 3

, except that S acquires the preferred stock from P's estate and subsequently transfers the preferred stock to S's
child. S is not entitled to a reduction because S ceased to be an initial transferor upon P's death (and S's prior taxable
gifts were automatically adjusted at that time to the level that would have existed had the split initial transfer
not been subject to section 2701).



Example 5. Death of donor spouse after inter vivos transfer.

 (i) P transfers one-fourth of the preferred stock to P's child. In this case, P and S are each entitled to a reduction
of $187,500, the corresponding portion of the reduction otherwise available to each spouse (one-fourth of $750,000).
S may claim the reduction against S's 1994 or subsequent transfers. P dies on November 1, 1994.

(ii) P's executor is entitled to include, in computing the reduction available to P's estate, the remaining reduction
to which P is entitled and an additional amount of up to $562,500 ($750,000 minus $187,500, the amount of the remaining
reduction attributable to the consenting spouse determined immediately prior to P's death). The amount of additional
reduction available to P's estate cannot exceed the amount that will reduce P's estate tax by $178,625, the amount
that S's 1991 gift tax would have been increased if the application of section 2701 had increased S's taxable gifts
by only $562,500 ($750,000 ^ $187,500).




(g) 

Double taxation otherwise avoided. 

No reduction is available under this section if_

(1) Double taxation is otherwise avoided in the computation of the estate tax under section 2001 (or section 2101);
or

(2) A reduction was previously taken under the provisions of section 2701(e)(6) with respect to the same section 2701
interest and the same initial transfer.

(h) 

Effective date. 

This section is effective for transfers of section 2701 interests after May 4, 1994. If the transfer of a section 2701
interest occurred on or before May 4, 1994, the initial transferor may rely on either this section, project PS-30-91
(1991-2 C.B. 1118, and 1992-1 C.B. 1239 (see  601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

Special Bulk Third-Class Eligibility Restrictions 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Postal Service. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On October 28, 1993, the President signed into law Public Law 103-123, the Treasury, Postal Service, and General
Appropriations Act for 1994. Title VII of the Act, the Revenue Forgone Reform Act, amends 39 U.S.C. 3626 by adding provisions
to subsection (j) and new subsection (m). These sections concern the administration of special bulk third-class
postage rates for certain qualified organizations. The provisions, which were not to take effect until after December
31, 1993, make certain types of advertisements, promotions, and offers, as well as some products, ineligible to be
mailed at the special bulk third-class rates. This document contains regulations implementing the legislative
changes. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Postal Service published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 64918-64919) on December 10, 1993, a proposal to amend the Domestic Mail Manual to implement certain provisions
of Public Law 103-123, the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Appropriations Act for 1994. These provisions
made certain types of matter ineligible to be mailed at the special bulk third-class postage rates, which are available
for use by certain qualified nonprofit organizations and political committees. The Postal Service requested comments
by January 10, 1994. Subsequently, the comment period was extended to February 9, 1994, by notice in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 65959) on December 17, 1993. At the request of postal customers, the Postal Service held a public meeting on January
28, 1994, as announced in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 1512) on January 11, 1994, to facilitate the receipt of comments regarding the proposal to implement new statutory
restrictions on the use of special bulk third-class mail. 


The new legislation establishes additional content-based restrictions on matter eligible for special bulk third-class
rates. In order for material that advertises, promotes, offers, or for a fee or consideration, recommends, describes,
or announces the availability of any product or service to qualify for mailing at these rates, the sale of the product
or the providing of the service must be substantially related to the exercise or performance by the organization of
one or more of the purposes constituting the basis for the organization's authorization to mail at such rates. The
determination whether a product or service is substantially related to an organization's purpose is to be made in
accordance with standards established under the Internal Revenue Code. 
The legislation also establishes restrictions for mailing products at the special rates. The only products mailable
at the special bulk third-class rates are low-cost products as defined under the Internal Revenue Code, items donated
or contributed to the qualified organization, and periodical publications of qualified organizations. The Postal
Service views the new provisions as supplementary to, rather than a change to or replacement for, existing restrictions
on special rate mailings. That is, mailings ineligible for the special rates under existing rules remain ineligible
for these rates, regardless of whether they violate the new restrictions. Further, mailings that violate the new
restrictions would not be eligible for the special rates, regardless of whether they would be eligible under existing
rules. 
As a general matter, it should be recognized that the Postal Service has limited discretion on what may be mailed at
the special rates. These historically subsidized rates are based on statutes that prescribe standards for who may
mail at the special rates and what may be sent at those rates. The Postal Service views its role as the administrator
of these laws. Accordingly, its goal in this rulemaking is to promulgate rules implementing Public Law 103-123.

As explained below, the new rules deny the use of special bulk third-class rates for mailpieces that contain advertisements
for products or services of the qualified organization that are not ``substantially related'' to a purpose on which
the organization's authorization to mail at the special bulk third-class rates is based. This prohibition applies
to catalogs and publications containing such advertisements, regardless of the inclusion of other advertisements
that do qualify for mailing at those rates. Paid advertisements that do not violate any of the current restrictions
will continue to be allowed in publications sent at the special bulk third-class rates, as long as they pass the ``substantially
related'' test. These new rules are in addition to, and are designed to be compatible with, existing prohibitions
on the use of special bulk third-class rates for improper cooperative mailings, and certain advertising for credit
cards, insurance policies, and travel arrangements. As a separate matter, the Postal Service will revise mailing
statements for special bulk third-class mailings by citing the appropriate Domestic Mail Manual section to call
mailers' attention to provisions with which they need to be familiar. 


Evaluation of Comments Received 


Written comments from almost 600 religious, educational, fraternal, charitable, labor, and agricultural organizations
and individuals were received by the Postal Service. In addition, 14 commenters offered oral comments at the public
meeting. 
Four hundred seventeen comments oppose enforcement of the ``substantially related'' test to determine whether
an advertisement, promotion, or offer is mailable at the special bulk third-class rates. They state that the test
would be detrimental to fundraising activities needed to sustain operating budgets, harm religious publications
of all faiths, and impair organizations' abilities to carry on their religious, educational, or charitable functions.

As explained above, the Postal Service's responsibility is to implement and administer a new statutory provision
restricting the use of special bulk third-class rates. This law specifically requires that the sale of a product or
the providing of a service must be ``substantially related (aside from the need, on the part of the organization promoting
such product or service, for income or funds or the use it makes of the profits derived) to the exercise or performance
by the organization of one or more of the purposes constituting the basis for the organization's authorization to
mail at such rates'' (i.e., special bulk third-class rates). Consequently, the Postal Service and qualified organizations
are required to use the ``substantially related'' test to determine whether an advertisement, promotion, or offer
is mailable at the special bulk third-class rates.

The statute further states that the ``substantially related'' test for products and services must be consistent
with the standards established by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and courts reviewing IRS decisions. Accordingly,
the rules adopted by the Postal Service follow these standards. 
To be ``substantially related'' in accordance with IRS standards, an advertised product or service must contribute
importantly to the accomplishment of one or more of the purposes of the qualified organization. This means that the
sale of the product or service must be directly related to accomplishing one or more of the purposes on which the organization's
authorization to mail at the special bulk third-class rates is based. The sale of the product or offering of the service
must have a causal relationship to the achievement of the exempt purposes (other than through the production of income)
of the qualified organization. (Whether an activity generates income that will be used to accomplish one or more of
the purposes of the qualified organization is not to be used as a factor in determining whether an advertisement passes
the ``substantially related'' test.) A synopsis of IRS rulings regarding the definition of ``substantially related''
is in Internal Revenue Manual, sec. 7751, part (36) 40 (Exempt Organizations Handbook). Additionally, the Postal
Service expects to publish a handbook that will provide further guidance to mailers. 
One of the major points of contention throughout this rulemaking has been the classification of third-class newsletters,
bulletins, and other publications containing paid advertising from parties other than the publisher. The proposed
rule published on December 10, 1993, sets forth the Postal Service's view that these publications are subject to the
new statutory restrictions, and would be excluded from mailing at the special bulk third-class rates if they contained
paid advertising that did not comply with the ``substantially related'' test. Numerous commenters have opposed
this interpretation, arguing that the statute contains a general exception for these publications, or that it reflects
the intent of Congress to permit paid advertising, as distinguished from an organization's own advertising, to be
sent at the special rates. The Postal Service believes that these objections are not well taken, and that the terms
of the statute contain no special exception from the ``substantially related'' test for the advertising content
of third-class publications. 
The ``substantially related'' test is contained in new subparagraph (D) of 39 U.S.C. 3626(j)(1), which forbids the
application of special bulk third-class rates to ``mail which advertises, promotes, offers, or, for a fee or consideration
recommends, describes, or announces the availability of'' certain categories of products and services. The types
of advertising already restricted under paragraph (j)(1) include advertisements for credit cards by subparagraph
(A), for insurance policies by subparagraph (B), and for travel arrangements by subparagraph (C). Subparagraphs
(A), (B), and (C) contain no exception for paid advertising in third-class publications, and the Postal Service has
not applied any such exception in its enforcement of these provisions. 
Unlike the earlier provisions, however, new subparagraph (D) does contain a specific exception related to publications.
Subclause (D)(ii)(II) provides that ``clause (i) [containing the substantially related test] shall not apply if
the product involved is a periodical publication described in subsection (m)(2) [a periodical publication of a qualified
nonprofit organization] (including a subscription to receive any such publication).'' By its terms, this provision
recognizes that a periodical publication may also be a product that a nonprofit organization wishes to advertise,
and it exempts the advertising for the publication (or for subscriptions to the publication) from the ``substantially
related'' test. It in no way prevents the application of the test to third-party paid advertising for other products
or services that may be contained in an issue of the publication itself. 
A second specific exception concerning publications is contained in new 39 U.S.C. 3626 (m), which restricts what
``mail consisting of products'' may be sent at the special bulk third-class rates. Under paragraph (m)(1), such products
must either have been received by the mailing organization as gifts or contributions, or be ``low-cost articles''
as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Paragraph (m)(2) makes an exception from these requirements for a ``periodical
publication of a qualified nonprofit organization.'' Thus, the statute recognizes that a periodical publication
may also be a product that a nonprofit organization wishes to mail, whether as a benefit to members or a premium for potential
donors in the course of a fundraising appeal, and allows such mailings to go at the special rates. By its terms, however,
the ``product rule'' of subsection (m) does not override the separate and distinct ``advertising rules'' of subsection
(j), and the Postal Service believes that it would be erroneous to construe subsection (m) as a blanket exception to
those rules. Such interpretation would rob the new ``substantially related'' test of subparagraph (j)(1)(D) of
much of its effectiveness, by allowing mailers to convert ineligible third-class catalogs into eligible third-class
``publications,'' and overturn the Postal Service's established enforcement policies regarding the credit card,
insurance, and travel advertising restrictions in subparagraphs (j)(1)(A), (B), and (C). 
The new restrictions do not apply to publications mailed at the special nonprofit second-class rates. However, if
a publisher wishes to mail copies of a special second-class rate publication at the special bulk third-class rates
as provided for in DMM E215.2.6, those copies are subject to these new rules. Accordingly, those copies may not be mailed
at the special bulk third-class rates if they contain any material ineligible for the special rates.

It should be emphasized that the application of the ``substantially related'' test to third-party paid advertising
in publications does not preclude all paid advertising in publications mailed at the special bulk third-class rates.
If the product or service advertised is substantially related to one or more of the nonprofit's qualifying purposes,
the publication may still be mailed at the special rates. Each situation must be considered on a case-by-case basis,
including consideration of the product or service advertised and the nature of the nonprofit organization. Examples
of acceptable types of advertisements include an advertisement for a blood glucose tester in a nonprofit diabetes
association's publication and an advertisement for courses at one college in another college's publication. 

It should also be noted that the ``substantially related'' test and other advertising restrictions do not apply if
the material in question is not considered an advertisement under postal rules. The Postal Service received numerous
comments concerning the listing of contributors in publications, such as the lists of individuals and firms that
appear on the back page of many church bulletins. For purposes of these rules, acknowledgments of organizations or
individuals who have contributed to the nonprofit mailer are not generally treated as advertising. 39 U.S.C. 3626(j)(2)(A).
To prevent technical disputes in individual cases concerning the distinction between an advertisement and an acknowledgment,
the rule will consider material to be acknowledgments, rather than advertising, if they appear on a page headed ``Sponsors,''
``Contributors,'' ``Donors'' or a similar term, and each acknowledgment does not exceed the size of a business card
(approximately 7 square inches). The listings should not be labeled as advertising in other portions of the publication
or elsewhere (such as rate cards). 

Similarly, organizations may still include information and response cards concerning membership benefits in publications
sent at the special third-class rates. Such matter will still be required to comply with the restrictions in 39 U.S.C.
3626(j)(2)(B). 

Consistent with Postal Service practice and policy, public service announcements for which no consideration has
been paid will not be considered advertising, and may be included in publications sent at the special bulk third-class
rates. 

Finally, announcements of activities substantially all the work of which is contributed by the members or supporters
of a qualified organization without compensation and advertisements for products and services, including products
and services offered as prizes or premiums, substantially all of which have been received by a qualified organization
as gifts or contributions, are considered to be ``substantially related'' to the organization's purposes. 

One hundred twenty-seven comments asserted that the Postal Service's proposed rule did not follow the intent of Congress
to base mailing restrictions on whether the qualified organization pays unrelated business income tax on the particular
activity advertised. The law, however, does not adopt the test urged by the comments. Instead it clearly states that
the products or services advertised must be ``substantially related'' to the purpose(s) on which the qualified organization's
authorization to mail at special bulk third-class rates is based. This ``relatedness'' test is only one of the factors
considered by the IRS in determining whether unrelated business income tax must be paid, but this part of the test is
singled out by the statute as the standard that the Postal Service must follow. Accordingly, the Postal Service is
directed to rely on the ``substantially related'' portion of the unrelated business income tax analysis but not the
other parts. 

Twenty-five comments oppose or protest increases in rates for nonprofit mailers over the next 6 years, the end of subsidized
funding for nonprofit postage rates, and other aspects of the Revenue Forgone Reform Act that will have an adverse
effect on the mailing activities of churches and church organizations. In general, these types of comments are beyond
the scope of this rulemaking. These comments also questioned whether including new member information, financial
information, attendance information, and announcements of upcoming church events would disqualify church bulletins
from being sent at the special bulk third-class rates. This kind of information concerning the qualified organization's
activities would generally be considered to be substantially related to the nonprofit religious purposes of a church.


Three comments requested that scholarly journals be allowed to continue to accept exchange advertisements and paid
advertisements to attract new subscriptions and promote books and journals. The final rule allows paid advertisements
to be in materials that are mailed at the special bulk third-class rates as long as the advertisements are for products
or services related to the purposes on which the qualified organization's authorization to mail at special bulk third-class
rates is based. Although each advertisement must be considered on a case-by-case basis, the inclusion of exchange
advertisements and third-party paid advertisements under the circumstances described would not appear to violate
the ``substantially related'' test. 

Ten comments stated that the proposed definition of ``low-cost items'' was inconsistent with the Internal Revenue
Service definition. These comments are correct.

Accordingly, the definition for ``low-cost items'' in the final rule is the same definition that the Internal Revenue
Service uses and includes a provision for annually increasing the cost of such items based on the cost of living. 

Ten comments stated that requiring a separate certification at the time of mailing would be an administrative and
logistical burden for mailers and the Postal Service, urged that mailers needed more information about the process
and the consequences of improper certification, and questioned why such a statement could not be included on the mailing
statement for each mailing. It was also suggested that the application for special bulk third-class mailing privileges
be modified to state that the organization will submit only mailings it thinks qualify for the special bulk third-class
rates. In response to these comments, it should be noted that the intended purpose of the certification statement
was more instructive than regulatory. That is, the Postal Service was concerned that nonprofits should be aware of
the restrictions on nonprofit rates. Because mailing statements are often signed by agents, there was concern that
the nonprofits themselves may not be aware of the new rules. Further, although the publication of these rules and a
one-time notice to the nonprofit organization would provide sufficient legal notice, the Postal Service took notice
that the officers of nonprofit organizations, particularly smaller ones, regularly change, and was concerned that
new officers might not be aware of the rules. Nevertheless, in view of the hardships noted by comments, a separate certification
will not be required. Instead, the mailing statement that must be completed for each mailing will be modified to refer
to the DMM section in which the standards for advertisements are located, as a reminder and a reference. The Postal
Service will also explore other ideas to promote awareness of the rules, such as providing information pertaining
to this final rule to qualified organizations before the effective date of the rule change. 

Four comments expressed confusion between advertising, public ``thank yous,'' and free advertisements, and asked
for clarification. The definition for advertising that will be used to administer the new eligibility requirements
for special bulk third-class matter is in DMM E211.11.1. As discussed above, public service announcements for which
no consideration is paid are not considered advertising as stated in DMM E211.11.2. Two examples of a public service
announcements are ``Support the Red Cross Blood Drive'' and ``Buy U.S. Savings Bonds.'' 

Eighty-one comments raised a variety of conflicting views from the perspective of commercial mailers and small or
local religious and charitable organizations. The commercial mailers stated that it is unfair to business owners
who are not members of a qualified organization to allow qualified organizations to include advertisements of their
members in the materials they mail at the special bulk third-class rates, and higher postage should be paid when third-party
advertisements are mailed with materials of a qualified organization. The small nonprofit organizations argued
against imposing additional restrictions on the advertising in their publications and other materials they mail
at the special bulk third-class rates. In general, those comments concern suggestions that the Postal Service has
no authority to implement. The Postal Service is required to administer the statutory provisions that prohibit only
certain types of advertising in nonprofit mail matter. 

Three comments (two colleges and a religious organization) stated that advertisements for similar types of organizations
and affiliated organizations should be permitted in materials mailed at the special bulk third-class rates. The
statutes and implementing rules look to the nature of the product or service promoted, rather than to the identity
of the advertiser. As noted above, paid advertisements for ``substantially related'' products or services may be
mailed at the special bulk third-class rates, regardless of the identity of the advertiser. 

One comment stated that the proposed regulations do not include provisions for informing mailers of enforcement
decisions or of measures that may serve to assist mailers plan future mailings. Notice of changes in these standards
will be published by the Postal Service in accordance with its usual procedures for rulemaking. 

Two comments suggested that the proposed definition of ``periodical publication'' goes beyond the requirements
of the new statute. Nothing in the new statute suggests an intent to modify the established postal definition of periodical
publication derived from statutory standards, which the Postal Service believes to be consistent with the common
usage and understanding of that term among mailers. The use of the existing definition for a periodical publication
would seem consistent with the statute and would in addition help avoid ambiguity and confusion. 

Seventy-six comments stated that the proposed rule change is vague and complex, does not clearly define ``substantially
related'' and ``contribute importantly,'' and does not indicate whether ``front-end'' and ``back-end'' premiums
as well as emblematic products will qualify for mailing at the reduced rates. The Postal Service does not believe the
rule is unclear. Moreover, the final rule clearly states that the phrases ``substantially related'' and ``contribute
importantly'' will be administered in accordance with Internal Revenue Service rulings and precedents. In addition,
as discussed, the Postal Service will produce a publication to provide further guidance and examples concerning
the rules. The question whether front-end and back-end premium products, as well as emblematic products, are eligible
for the special rates will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the statutory restrictions concerning the mailing
of ``products.'' That is, these products must meet the definition for low-cost items, be donated or contributed to
the mailing organization, or be periodical publications. 

Thirty-seven comments stated that they oppose retroactive applicability of eligibility restrictions if the qualified
organization made an innocent mistake or lacked knowledge of the restriction at the time of mailing, and requested
that the Postal Service excuse ``minor infractions'' regarding advertisements that do not meet the ``substantially
related'' test. The statute does not provide any such exceptions, and the Postal Service is required to ``maintain
procedures for the prompt collection of postage deficiencies arising from'' these rules. 39 U.S.C. 3626(k)(3).
See also 39 U.S.C. 2601(a)(1), which requires the Postal Service to ``collect debts due to the Postal Service.'' Indeed,
the granting of an exception to some noncomplying mailers would appear to discriminate against mailers who pay postage
at the appropriate rate. 39 U.S.C. 403(c). Here, the final rule is being published in advance of its effective date
to give mailers time to adjust their methods of operation, and the regulations contain sufficient detailed information
to help mailers ensure that they comply with the new eligibility restrictions. In addition, mailers may obtain private
legal or financial advice and counsel to assist in making their decisions. Nevertheless, the Postal Service will
continue to consider requests for compromise or settlement of revenue deficiencies on a case-by-case basis, consistent
with existing postal policies.

Five comments stated that the Postal Service needs to establish a procedure for mailers to obtain advance binding
rulings regarding whether materials and products will be mailable at the special bulk third-class rates. In general,
as discussed above, the Postal Service does not believe such a procedure is necessary because mailers have access
to the many IRS determinations and precedents that govern how the eligibility restrictions are administered. The
Postal Service also believes that nonprofit mailers that engage in any considerable amount of commercial advertising
or business activity may have already obtained private legal or financial counsel to help them deal with such matters.
The Postal Service further notes that it does not have the staffing to provide a large volume of such rulings in a timely
and consistent fashion, has not had a formal procedure for providing such opinions in mail classification matters,
and does not believe that it is feasible to provide such a procedure. 

One comment was concerned that the Postal Service may disqualify a mailing announcing a meeting, seminar, or conference
sponsored by the qualified organization if it contains a brochure for the hotel where the meeting will be held. This
decision must necessarily be determined upon the specific circumstances of the mailing. Nevertheless, the Postal
Service does not believe that the inclusion of such a brochure would necessarily prevent the mailpiece from being
mailed at the special rates. For instance, it would be significant whether the brochure is donated to the qualified
organization as information for individuals that will or may attend a meeting, seminar, or conference sponsored
by the qualified organization at that hotel, as opposed to being provided by the hotel to the nonprofit with payment
for inclusion in the mailpiece. 

Seven comments stated that a ``grace period'' should be authorized to allow qualified organizations to mail materials
that are in the process of being prepared for mailing to avoid having to discard them or pay a higher postage rate than
was planned for the mailing. One comment suggested that the grace period be allowed and that the Postal Service publish
a graduated phase-in schedule, beginning January 1, 1996, to allow for the acceptance of materials in the process
of being prepared for mailing. One comment suggested a 90-day grace period consistent with this comment. The final
rule will be effective September 4, 1994, more than 4 months after it is published. Although the Postal Service is sympathetic
with the concerns expressed by comments seeking a more extended period, these interests must be balanced against
the additional revenue loss caused by any delay in the effective date of the rules. This loss will ultimately be borne
by postal customers. Additionally, it is noted that the rules will not become effective until a full 8 months after
the January 1, 1994, date authorized in the legislation. 

One comment from a nonprofit society stated that the regulations should provide specific ``procedural rules'' for
reliance on Internal Revenue Service regulations and court decisions regarding the ``substantially related''
test. It is not clear what type of ``procedural rules'' the comment envisions. Nevertheless, the final rule makes
it clear, as specified by Public Law 103-123, that the Postal Service will use standards established by the Internal
Revenue Service and the courts with respect to determining whether a product or service is substantially related
to the purpose(s) on which the qualified organization's authorization to mail at special bulk third-class rates
is based. 

Three comments stated that the Postal Service should determine that the ``substantially related'' test does not
apply to an offer for a ``back-end premium'' (a product or service provided to a donor who first contributes a certain
sum of money). To be mailable at the special bulk third-class rates, the ``back-end premium'' itself, if it is a product,
must be a ``low-cost'' item or otherwise comply with 39 U.S.C. 3626(m). The solicitation seeking donations and offering
the ``back end premium'' is, moreover, an advertisement, covered by the new ``substantially related `` test. Accordingly,
the solicitation is mailable at the special rates only if the premium is substantially related to the nonprofit's
qualifying purposes. 

One comment stated that organizations that market training and education through the mail should not be allowed to
mail at the special bulk third-class rates if they are not accredited educational institutions. The statutory provisions
do not restrict the use of special rates in this manner, and this suggestion is beyond the authority of the Postal Service
to adopt. 

One comment stated that the Postal Service should allow third-class periodical publications that contain advertisements,
have no subscribers, and meet the definition of a periodical to be mailable at the special bulk third-class rates until
the Postal Service obtains approval from the Postal Rate Commission to accept such periodicals as second-class matter.
Again, the statutory provisions do not authorize an exception of this type, and it is beyond the authority of the Postal
Service to adopt. Organizations that wish to mail publications at the special second-class rates will be required
to obtain authorization, under the existing eligibility requirements, to mail at those rates, which would generally
require that the publication be primarily circulated to paid subscribers. Subscriptions may be paid for with dues
or contributions, if the dues or contributions and the subscription price are separated to show the amount paid for
the subscription. A membership organization applying for second-class mailing privileges under the narrowly defined
``Publications of Institutions and Societies'' category (see DMM E222) may pass a resolution specifying the amount
that is to be used for a subscription to receive its periodical publication if each member knows how much is being paid
for the subscription. Mailers should contact their postmasters for advice on the exact procedures they must follow
to qualify their publications for special second-class mailing privileges.

For the reasons discussed above, the Postal Service hereby adopts the following amendments to the Domestic Mail Manual,
which is incorporated by reference in the Code of Federal Regulations (see 39 CFR part 111). 



PART 111_[AMENDED] 



1. The authority citation for 39 CFR part 111 is revised to read as follows: 






Authority:

 5 U.S.C. 552(a); 39 U.S.C. 101, 401, 403, 404, 3001-3011, 3201-3219, 3403-3406, 3621, 3626, 5001.





2. Domestic Mail Manual section E370 is amended by renumbering old 5.6 and 5.7 as 5.7 and 5.8, respectively; renumbering
old 5.9 as 5.10; and adding new 5.4(d), 5.6, 5.7c, and 5.9. The text is as follows: 



E-Eligibility 



* * * * * 



E370 Special (Nonprofit) Bulk Rates 



* * * * * 



5.0 Eligible and Ineligible Matter 



* * * * * 



5.4 Prohibitions 



Except under 5.7, special bulk third-class rates may not be used for the entry of material that advertises, promotes,
offers, or, for a fee or consideration, recommends, describes, or announces the availability of: 



* * * * * 



[Add new 5.4d as follows:] 




d. Any product or service (other than those described in 5.4a , 5.4b, or 5.4c), if the sale of the product or the providing
of such service is not substantially related to the exercise or performance by the organization of one or more of the
purposes used by the organization to qualify for mailing at the special bulk third-class rates. The criteria in 5.6
are used as the bases for determining whether an advertisement, promotion, or offer for a product or service is mailable
at the special bulk third-class rates. 




[Change title of 5.5 as follows:] 



5.5 Definitions, Insurance 




[Add new 5.6 and renumber existing 5.6 and 5.7 as 5.7 and 5.8, respectively:] 



5.6 Definitions, Substantially Related Advertising, Products 



For the standards in 5.4d: 

a. To be ``substantially related,'' the sale of the product or the providing of the service must contribute importantly
to the accomplishment of one or more of the qualifying purposes of the organization. This means that the sale of the
product or the providing of the service must be directly related to accomplishing one or more of the purposes on which
the organization's authorization to mail at the special bulk third-class rates is based. The sale of the product or
the providing of the service must have a causal relationship to the achievement of the exempt purposes (other than
through the production of income) of the qualified organization. (Whether selling the product or providing the service
generates income that is used to accomplish the purposes of the qualified organization is not used as a factor in determining
whether such activity is substantially related to the qualifying purpose or purposes of the organization.) 

b. Standards established by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the courts with respect to 26 U.S.C. 513 (a) and
(c) of the Internal Revenue Code are used to determine whether an advertised product or service, whether sold or offered
by the organization or by another party, is ``substantially related'' to the qualifying purposes of an organization.


(1) If the advertising material is for a product or service that is not substantially related, the material is not mailable
at the special bulk third-class rates. 

(2) If an organization pays unrelated business income tax on the sale of a product or the providing of a service, that
activity is by IRS definition not substantially related to the organization's qualifying purposes. The fact that
an organization does not pay such tax, however, does not establish that the activity is substantially related, because
other criteria may exempt the organization from payment. Thus, the inclusion of an advertisement for a product or
service in a mailpiece may disqualify the piece from using special bulk third-class rates, even if the mailer does
not pay unrelated business income tax on its sale. 

(3) Advertisements in the qualified organization's newsletter or other publication for one or more products or services
that are not substantially related to the qualified organization's purposes, notwithstanding the presence of advertisements
that are so related, are not mailable at the special bulk third-class rates. Third-party paid advertisements may
be included in a publication mailed at the special bulk third-class rates if the products or services advertised are
substantially related to one or more of the purposes for which the qualified organization is authorized to mail at
the special bulk third-class rates. If the publication contains one or more advertisements ineligible for the special
rates, the publication is not eligible for the special rates. 

(4) Advertising for one or more products or services that are not substantially related to the qualified organization's
purpose included in a catalog that also offers items that are so related is not mailable at the special bulk third-class
rates. If the catalog contains one or more advertisements ineligible for the special rates, the catalog is not eligible
for the special rates. 

c. Public service announcements, e.g., ``Support the Red Cross Blood Drive,'' for which no consideration has been
paid are mailable at the special bulk third-class rates.

d. Announcements of activities, e.g., bake sale, car wash, charity auction, oratorical contest, substantially
all the work of which is conducted by the members or supporters of a qualified organization without compensation are
mailable at the special bulk third-class rates. Such activities are considered to be ``substantially related''
to the organization's purposes.
e. Advertisements for products and services, including products and services offered as prizes or premiums, substantially
all of which have been received by a qualified organization as gifts or contributions. Such products and services
are considered ``substantially related'' to the organization's purposes.
f. An advertisement, promotion, or offer for a periodical publication, including subscription order forms, meeting
the eligibility criteria in E211 and published by one of the types of qualified nonprofit organizations listed in
E370.2.0 is mailable at the special bulk third-class rates.


5.7 Other Matter


* * * * *


[Add new 5.7c as follows:]



c. A listing in a qualified organization's newsletter or other publication of the names of individuals or organizations
who sponsor the publication or other activities of the qualified organization. The Postal Service presumes that
an item is an acknowledgment of a sponsor and not an advertisement ineligible for special rates if it occupies not more
than 7 square inches (the approximate size of a business card) and if it appears in a portion of the publication titled
``Sponsors,'' ``Contributors,'' ``Donors,'' or a similar designation.



[Renumber old 5.9 as 5.10 and add new section 5.9 as follows:]


5.9 Products Mailable at Special Bulk Third-Class Rates


The following products are mailable at special bulk third-class rates:
a. Low-cost items within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. 513(h)(2), Internal Revenue Code. Under this standard, low-cost
items are currently those having a cost of not more than $6.39 as of January 1, 1994. At the beginning of each calendar
year, the value of low-cost items is adjusted for cost of living. The cost is the cost to the qualified nonprofit organization
that mails the item or on whose behalf the item is mailed.
b. Items donated or contributed to the qualified organization. Such items need not meet the definition of low cost
as described in 5.9a.
c. Periodical publication of a qualified nonprofit organization that does not contain any advertisements or other
material ineligible to be mailed at the special bulk third-class rates under 5.4 a, b, c, or d. Periodical publication
and qualified nonprofit organization are defined in 5.6f.
A transmittal letter making these changes in the pages of the Domestic Mail Manual will be published and will be transmitted
to subscribers automatically. Notice of issuance will be published in the 

Federal Register

 as provided by 39 CFR 111.3.

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Louisiana; Correction of Volatile Organic Compound
Reasonably Available Control Technology Rules



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action approves revisions to the Louisiana State Implementation Plan (SIP) as submitted by the Governor on the
following days: June 13, 1990, October 26, 1990, 
May 24, 1991, and March 24, 1992. These revisions and this action are necessary for several reasons. First, on 
May 26, 1988, the EPA notified the State of Louisiana that its SIP for attaining the National ambient air quality standard
(NAAQS) for ozone was substantially inadequate as it applied to the seven parishes comprising the Baton Rouge ozone
nonattainment area: Ascension, East Baton Rouge, Iberville, Livingston, 
Pointe Coupee, St. James, and West Baton Rouge. This document called for the State to correct deficiencies in its Volatile
Organic Compound (VOC) Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) rules as they applied to those parishes.
Second, on November 8, 1989, the EPA notified Louisiana that its ozone SIP was substantially inadequate as it applied
to Calcasieu Parish, which comprises the Lake Charles ozone nonattainment area, and also called for the State to correct
existing deficiencies in its VOC RACT rules as these applied to Calcasieu Parish. Third, the Clean Air Act Amendments
(CAAA) of 1990, required the State to revise its SIP to correct VOC RACT deficiencies within six months of enactment.
Finally, the VOC RACT rules must be recodified to provide consistency between the State's code and the SIP. The effect
of today's action will be to correct existing deficiencies in the VOC RACT rules of the Louisiana SIP as required by
the EPA notices of deficiency and the CAAA and to recodify the VOC RACT rules to conform with the State's code. This action
is being taken under section 110 and part D of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended by the CAAA of 1990.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 on November 24, 1987, the EPA's Proposed Post-1987 Policy for Ozone and Carbon Monoxide stated that air quality
monitors revealed continued exceedances of the ozone standard in the Baton Rouge area of Louisiana and that a ``SIP
call'' would be issued (See 52 FR 45044). A SIP call is a finding by the EPA that the SIP does not provide for attainment
by the required date.

1

 In a letter dated May 26, 1988, to Governor Buddy Roemer, the EPA notified the State of Louisiana that because the Baton
Rouge area had failed to attain the NAAQS for ozone by December 31, 1987, as required under section 172 of the CAA, its
SIP was substantially inadequate and would need to be revised. Later, on November 8, 1989, the EPA notified the State
that its SIP as it applied to Calcasieu Parish was substantially inadequate to achieve the ozone NAAQS in that area
(i.e., LakeCharles).

2

 The EPA requested that the State respond to the SIP calls in two phases. Pursuant to the first phase, the State was to:
(1) Correct identified deficiencies in the existing SIP's VOC regulations; (2) adopt VOC regulations previously
required or committed to but never adopted; and (3) update the area's base year emissions inventory. Just as the Post
1987 SIP calls were being anticipated, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality recodified its air quality
regulations. The bulk of this effort was conditionally approved March 8, 1989, at 54 FR 9783.

3

 The VOC RACT rules were not approved as part of the recodification at that time because the majority of the VOC RACT rules
as recodified were substantially changed from the rules previously approved as part of the SIP. This is because the
State had revised its VOC RACT rules for various reasons, but the revisions had not been incorporated into the federally-approved
SIP. Given the discrepancies between the State code and the SIP, the EPA decided not to approve the recodification
of the VOC RACT rules to avoid confusing the public about which version was part of the federally-approved SIP. Now
that the revised VOC regulations are considered acceptable, the EPA is simultaneously approving the substantive
revisions and the recodification and will refer to the VOC RACT rules by the recodified designations. 







Since the Post 1987 SIP calls, Congress amended the CAA on November 15, 1990. Public Law 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399,
codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q. Under the CAAA, those areas that were designated nonattainment before enactment
of the CAAA, and which retained that designation and were classified as marginal or above as of enactment,

4

 were required to meet the section 182(a)(2)(A) RACT fix-up requirement by May 15, 1991. The 
Baton Rouge and Lake Charles nonattainment areas are classified as serious and marginal, respectively, and therefore,
are subject to the RACT fix-up requirement. Under section 182(a)(2)(A), those areas were required to correct RACT
as it was required 
under pre-amendment guidance.

5

 The Post 1987 SIP call letters interpreted that guidance and indicated corrections necessary for specific nonattainment
areas. 






The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) adopted revisions to the VOC RACT rules in a series of actions
making revisions to various sections of LAC:33:III: Chapter 1 (pertaining to General Provisions), Chapter 21 (pertaining
to Control of Emissions of Organic Compounds), and Chapter 61 (pertaining to Test Methods). The first submittal in
response to the Post 1987 SIP calls, sent to the EPA in a letter dated 
June 13, 1990

6

, contained revisions to Chapter 21 as adopted on January 20 and February 20, 1990. The second submittal from the Governor,
dated October 26, 1990, contained further corrections to Chapter 21 as adopted July 20, 1990. A third submittal dated
May 9, 1991, contained revisions as adopted by emergency rulemaking procedures on May 1, 1991. A fourth submittal,
received May 24, 1991, contained revisions to the VOC regulations adopted by the LDEQ on November 20, 1990, and April
20, 1991.





Because the LDEQ could not meet the statutory deadline using its regular rulemaking procedures, it resorted to emergency
procedures allowed under the State's Administrative Procedures Act (LSA R.S. 49:953(B), 30:2011, and 30:2054)
to make final corrections to the VOC RACT rules. These procedures allow rules to be revised without public hearing
but limit their effectiveness to 120 days. By using these procedures, Louisiana was able to make the required submission
on May 9, 1991. However, since the rules are only effective for 120 days, the LDEQ also used its regular rulemaking process
and adopted these rules again on July 20, 1991. These regulations were submitted to the EPA on March 26, 1992. 
The Louisiana emergency measures submitted on 
May 9, 1991, were not subject to notice and public hearing at the State level. Pursuant to section 110(a)(1) of the CAAA,
the EPA requires States to submit SIPs and SIP revisions that the State has adopted ``after reasonable notice and public
hearing.'' The State cured this defect through its submittal of March 26, 1992. At that time, the State resubmitted
the same rules, after it fulfilled the public notice and hearing requirements. Therefore, the EPA is approving these
submittals in this action.
At the same time that Louisiana submitted the rules that went through the public participation process, Louisiana

resubmitted the recodification of the VOC RACT rules and submitted rules adopting capture efficiency test methods.
Due to deficiencies in the recodified rules, they could not be approved when they were originally submitted. Because
the deficiencies have now been corrected, the EPA can now approve the rules, and the State was asked to resubmit the
recodified VOC RACT rules. The recodified VOC RACT rules, first submitted in 1988, serve as the baseline superseding
all previous revisions concerning VOC RACT rules. 
On September 30, 1992 (57 FR 45012), the EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 

Federal Register

 to approve the above rules into the Louisiana SIP because they correct the specified deficiencies identified under
the SIP call and satisfied the requirements of section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAAA. For a complete discussion of the EPA's
evaluation of the submitted rules, the reader is directed to the 

Federal Register

 document referenced above. The EPA provided a 30 day comment period on the notice of proposed rulemaking. No adverse
public comments were received.



Action


The EPA approves revisions to the Louisiana SIP as submitted on June 13, 1990, October 26, 1990, May 24, 1991, and March
26, 1992. These revisions to the VOC RACT rules satisfy the requirements of the May 26, 1988, SIP call for the 
Baton Rouge nonattainment area, the November 8, 1989, SIP call for the Lake Charles nonattainment area and the RACT
fix-up requirements of section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAAA. The recodification meets the requirements of section 110
and part D of the CAAA.
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities (5 U.S.C.603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, 
part D, of the CAAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing.
Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have
a significant 
impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAAA,
preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness
of State action. The CAAA forbids the EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (

Nothing in this action should be construed as allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision
to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economical,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
This action makes final the action proposed on 
September 30, 1992, at 57 FR 45012. As noted elsewhere in this document, the EPA received no adverse public comment
on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has reclassified this action from Table One
to Table Two under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, 
January 19, 1989.
Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by July 5, 1994. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings
to enforce its requirements. See section 307(b)(2).
This action has been classified as a Table Two action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published
in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). A revision to the SIP processing review tables was approved by the Acting
Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional
Administrators). A future document will inform the general public of these tables. Under the revised tables, this
action remains classified as a Table Two. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
Two and Table Three SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years.
The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table Two and Table Three SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed
to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on the EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive
Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; New Mexico; Albuquerque/Bernalillo County Carbon
Monoxide Contingency Measures



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action approves a revision to the New Mexico State Implementation Plan (SIP) addressing carbon monoxide (CO)
contingency measures and a proposed clean fuel vehicle fleet demonstration project for Albuquerque/Bernalillo
County, outside the boundaries of Indian lands. The CO contingency measures constitute one of the required elements
of the complete Albuquerque/Bernalillo County CO SIP.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


Background


Albuquerque/Bernalillo County, New Mexico, was designated nonattainment for CO and classified as moderate with
a design value below 12.7 parts per million (ppm.) (specifically 
11.1 ppm.), under sections 107(d)(4)(A) and 186(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments
(CAAA) of 1990.

1

 Please reference 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 57 FR 13498 and 13529 (April 16, 1992). The air quality planning
requirements for moderate CO nonattainment areas with a design value less than or equal to 12.7 ppm. are set out in subparts
one and three of part D, title I of the CAA. Subpart one contains provisions generally applicable to all nonattainment
areas, and subpart three contains provisions specifically applicable to CO nonattainment areas.





On November 5, 1992, the Governor of New Mexico submitted to the EPA a SIP revision for CO concerning Albuquerque/Bernalillo
County that was intended to satisfy CAA requirements due on November 15, 1992. This submittal included the 1990 base
year CO emissions inventory, the oxygenated fuels program, and the winter woodburning program. On November 29, 1993,
the EPA published the final approval of the emissions inventory, oxygenated fuels program, and the winter woodburning
program (58 FR 62535).

This action approves CO contingency measures for Albuquerque/Bernalillo County, submitted to the EPA by the Governor
of New Mexico by cover letter dated November 12, 1993. This submittal satisfies the requirement, as per 
section 172(c)(9) of the CAA, that all nonattainment area SIPs must contain contingency measures (due November 15,
1993) that are to be implemented if the area fails to make reasonable further progress (RFP) or to attain the applicable
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by the applicable date. The contingency measures are to be implemented
immediately after the EPA determines failure of RFP or attainment of the applicable NAAQS, without further action
by the State or the EPA.



Analysis of City/County Submission


A. Procedural Background


The CAA requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans for submission
to the EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the CAA provides that each implementation plan submitted by a State must be adopted
after reasonable notice and public hearing (see also section 110(l) of the CAA). Also, the EPA must determine whether
a submittal is complete, and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565).
The EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. The EPA attempts to make
completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However, a submittal is deemed complete by
operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by the EPA six months after receipt of the submission.

After providing adequate notice, the City of Albuquerque held a public hearing on October 13, 1993, to entertain public
comment on proposed revisions to the CO SIP narrative, and on proposed revisions to Regulation 35 addressing CO contingency
measures, entitled Alternative Fuels. Public comments were received and adequately addressed by the City/County.
Following the public hearings, the revisions to the CO SIP narrative and to Regulation 35 were adopted by the Albuquerque/Bernalillo
County Air Quality Control Board, and submitted as a SIP revision to the EPA by cover letter from the Governor dated
November 12, 1993.
The SIP revision was reviewed by the EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with
the completeness criteria referenced above. A letter dated
December 27, 1993, was forwarded to the Governor indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to
be taken in the review process.



B. Review of CO Contingency Measures


Albuquerque/Bernalillo County filed revisions to 
Regulation 35 with the State of New Mexico Records and Archives Center on November 10, 1993. Regulation 35 contains
the oxygenated fuel provisions for Albuquerque/Bernalillo County. The revisions being approved in this action
consist of the implementation of a more stringent oxygenated fuels program in Bernalillo County beginning November
1, 1996, if the County does not achieve attainment of the CO NAAQS by December 31, 1995 (i.e., one or more quality assured
violations of the CO NAAQS are recorded in calendar years 1994 and/or 1995). Specifically, the revisions would require
gasoline sold in Bernalillo County during the winter control period (November 1 to the end of February) to contain
not less than 3.0% oxygen by weight for ethanol blends. The current program requires not less than 2.7% oxygen by weight
for all blends. In addition, the revisions mandate that as a contingency measure, all oxygenated fuel would be blended
prior to removal by tank truck from primary supply points (such as refineries and terminals).



C. Review of Proposed Clean Fuel Vehicle Fleet Demonstration Project


The City/County also included in the November 12, 1993, submittal, a proposed demonstration project to convert certain
fleet vehicles (select medium and heavy duty passenger vans) to alternative fuel use (e.g., compressed natural gas,
electricity). The City/County included a description of this proposed demonstration project in the revisions to
the CO SIP narrative. The proposed project is expected to show air quality benefits (e.g., CO tailpipe emission reductions)
and fuel cost savings for natural gas conversions. The EPA in this action is approving the revisions to the Albuquerque/Bernalillo
County CO SIP narrative to include the proposed clean fuel vehicle fleet demonstration project discussed above.
It is important to note that the proposed clean fuel vehicle fleet demonstration project is not required by the EPA,
and is not being approved as a contingency measure in the Albuquerque/Bernalillo County, New Mexico, SIP. The approval
of the revised CO SIP narrative acknowledges that the City/County is taking its own initiative in exploring means
of obtaining additional, but undefined, CO emission reductions.



Final Action


This action approves a revision to the New Mexico SIP to include for Albuquerque/Bernalillo County, outside the boundaries
of Indian lands: (1) CO contingency measures; and (2) a proposed clean fuel vehicle fleet demonstration project.
The CO contingency measures constitute one of the required elements of the complete Albuquerque/Bernalillo County
CO SIP.
The EPA has reviewed these revisions to the New Mexico SIP and is approving them as submitted. The EPA is publishing
this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates
no adverse comments. This action will be effective July 5, 1994 unless, by June 6, 1994, notice is received that adverse
or critical comments will be submitted.
If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing two subsequent documents.
One document will withdraw the final action, and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the
action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action
will be effective July 5, 1994.



Miscellaneous


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities 
(5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D, of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids the EPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (

Union Electric Co.

 v. 

U.S. E.P.A.

, 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)).
Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by July 5, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)



Executive Order



This action has been classified as a table two action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published
in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these revised
tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived table two and three SIP revisions (54 FR
2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The EPA has submitted a request
for a permanent waiver for table two and three SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time
as it rules on the EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive
Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Temporary rule; request for comments.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS establishes all inshore and offshore waters from Cape Canaveral, Florida (28
 24.6
' N latitude), to the North Carolina-Virginia border (36
 30.5
' N latitude) as the leatherback conservation zone and notifies owners and operators of shrimp trawlers operating
in that zone that short-term area closures may be required if high abundance levels of leatherback turtles are documented.
NMFS will close those areas to any shrimp trawler required to have a turtle excluder device (TED) installed in each
net that is rigged for fishing unless the TED installed is a NMFS-approved Taylor TED or a Morrison TED with either of
the two NMFS-approved modifications made in May 1993. This temporary rule is necessary to reduce mortality of endangered
leatherback sea turtles incidentally captured in shrimp trawls. 




Specific area closures will be announced in the 

Federal Register

, on the NOAA weather channel and in newspapers and other media. Shrimp trawlers in the leatherback conservation zone
are responsible for monitoring the NOAA weather channel for closure announcements. Shrimp fishermen may also call
(813) 893-3163 for updated closure information. 

Owners and operators of shrimp trawlers operating in closed areas with modified TEDs must register with the Director,
Southeast Region, NMFS, and may be required to carry an observer and provide information on trawling hours, gear modifications
and turtle captures if requested by the Regional Director.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



All sea turtles that occur in U.S. waters are listed as either endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species
Act (ESA) of 1973. The Kemp's ridley (

Lepidochelys kempii

), leatherback (

Dermochelys coriacea

), and hawksbill (

Eretmochelys imbricata

) are listed as endangered. Loggerhead (

Caretta

) and green (

Chelonia mydas

) turtles are listed as threatened, except for breeding populations of green turtles in Florida and on the Pacific
coast of Mexico, which are listed as endangered. The incidental take and mortality of these species, as a result of
fishing activities, have been documented in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic seaboard. 

Under the ESA and its implementing regulations, it is prohibited to take sea turtles. The incidental taking of turtles
during fishing in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of the southeastern United States and in the Gulf of Mexico is excepted
from the taking prohibition if specified sea turtle conservation measures are used. 

Existing sea turtle conservation regulations (50 CFR part 227) require most shrimp trawlers to have a NMFS-approved
TED installed in each net rigged for fishing throughout the year. The use of TEDs significantly reduces mortalities
of loggerhead, green, Kemp's ridley, and hawksbill sea turtles. Because leatherback turtles are larger than the
escape openings of most NMFS-approved TEDs, use of these TEDs is not an effective means of protecting leatherback
turtles. 

The existing sea turtle conservation regulations allow the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries (AA), NOAA, to
restrict fishing activities in order to conserve a species listed under the ESA (50 CFR 227.72(e)(6)(ii)). This action
may be taken if the AA determines that restrictions are necessary to avoid unauthorized takings that may likely jeopardize
the continued existence of a listed species. The provision is particularly applicable to leatherback turtles, where
despite the use of TEDs, taking by shrimp trawlers can occur. In accordance with the endangered status of leatherback
turtles, NMFS considers preventable take of leatherbacks to be inappropriate. If the leatherbacks are relatively
abundant in areas where shrimp trawlers are fishing, restrictions to minimize the take of leatherbacks must be imposed.

Because of their primarily pelagic existence, leatherbacks normally occur outside of areas where they would be subject
to take by shrimp trawlers. During most months of the year, leatherbacks are not considered abundant in shrimping
areas, and only isolated incidents of take by trawlers are expected. However, the coastal waters of northern Florida,
Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina experience relatively high abundance levels of leatherbacks as a periodic
spring phenomenon. When leatherback abundance is high and shrimp trawlers are fishing, leatherback stranding pulses
have been documented on adjacent beaches. A NMFS Biological Opinion prepared for a revision to the sea turtle conservation
regulations made on December 4, 1992, (52 FR 24244) episodic stranding events from Florida through North Carolina
and required NMFS to develop and implement a contingency plan to solve this problem. 

A contingency plan for protection of leatherback turtles on the Atlantic seaboard that can be implemented, if necessary,
was prepared in cooperation with State officials from Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina. The necessity for implementation
of protective measures for leatherback turtles is expected to be short-term and apply to specific areas. The plan
considers several options to provide protection, and any or all of them may be implemented, if necessary, pursuant
to 50 CFR 227.72(e)(6). These options include, closure of areas to all fishing, use of restricted tow-times in lieu
of TEDs, mandatory observers, and use of modified TEDs designed to exclude leatherback turtles. 



Presence of Leatherback Turtles 



During December of 1993 and January and February 1994, NMFS received regular reports of leatherback sightings in
northern Florida. These sightings occurred during aerial surveys for right whales, conducted by the state of Florida
from St. Marys, Georgia, to Sebastian Inlet, Florida. During December, sighting rates ranged from 12 to 49 leatherbacks
per survey. During the first week of January, 15 sightings were reported. The level of leatherback turtle sightings
at this time of the year is consistent with data from previous years. The turtles normally migrate northward during
the months of March through June from Florida waters to those off North Carolina.
