<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) proposes to amend its regulations on the monitoring of lender's collection activity
after a final loss is paid, when a guaranteed borrower's account remains unsatisfied. This action is taken to further
define criteria, by which FmHA will monitor the lender's future recovery from unsatisfied guaranteed borrower accounts.
There is no formal procedure at present for monitoring these accounts. The intended effect is to maximize collections
from unsatisfied guaranteed borrower accounts and to minimize the financial loss to the Government.

Airworthiness Directives; Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) Model 1125 Westwind Astra Airplanes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain IAI Model
1125 Westwind Astra airplanes. This proposal would require relocation of the ground cable in the slat power drive
unit. This proposal is prompted by a report that the drive system for the leading edge slat stopped in transit during
flight on a Model 1125 Westwind Astra airplane. This incident was caused by an improper ground connection for the electric
motor of the slat drive system, which resulted in arcing and an open electrical circuit. The actions specified by the
proposed AD are intended to prevent possible fuel vapor fire due to electrical arcing in an area where fuel vapors might
be present and the inability to move the slats during flight due to an open electrical circuit.

Discussion 




The Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), which is the airworthiness authority for Israel, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) Model 1125 Westwind Astra airplanes.
The CAAI advises that it has received a report that the drive system for the leading edge slat stopped in transit during
flight on a Model 1125 Westwind Astra airplane. The cause of this incident 
has been attributed to an improper ground connection for the electric motor of the leading edge slat drive system,
which resulted in arcing and an open electrical circuit. The ground connection for the electric motor is located in
the area just forward of the wing spar. Since the fuel system is integrated into the structure of the wing, the area is
subject to fuel leakage. An improper ground connection for the subject motor, if not corrected, could 
result in possible fuel vapor fire due to electrical arcing in an area where fuel vapors might be present, and the inability
to move the slats during flight due to an open electrical circuit. 

Astra Jet Corporation has issued Service Bulletin SB 1125-27-110, Revision 1, dated February 16, 1994,
that describes procedures for relocation of the ground cable in the slat power drive unit (Modification 6350). Accomplishment
of this modification involves routing the ground cable for the slat power drive located in the aircraft secondary
structure to the aircraft primary structure. Relocating the ground cable will improve electrical grounding for
the slat power drive unit. The CAAI classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Airworthiness Directive
No. 93-02, dated December 2, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Israel.

This airplane model is manufactured in Israel and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of  21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAAI has kept the FAA informed of the situation described
above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAAI, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action
is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require relocation of the ground cable in the slat power
drive unit. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.


The FAA estimates that 52 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts would cost approximately $53 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on
U.S. operators is estimated to be $11,336, or $218 per airplane. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it
may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

OSM is announcing receipt of a proposed amendment to the Indiana regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the
``Indiana program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed amendment
consists of revisions to the Indiana statutes as made by the Indiana General Assembly and contained in Senate Enrolled
Act (SEA) 179. The amendment is intended to revise the Indiana program concerning disturbances in a floodway on a mine
site.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



I. Background on the Indiana Program

II. Discussion of the Proposed Amendment

III. Public Comment Procedures

IV. Procedural Determinations



I. Background on the Indiana Program



On July 29, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Indiana program. Background information
on the Indiana program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval
can be found in the July 26, 1982, 

Federal Register

 (47 FR 32071). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments can be found at 30
CFR 914.10, 914.15, and 914.16.



II. Discussion of the Proposed Amendment



By letter dated October 1, 1993, (Administrative Record No. IND-1325) Indiana submitted a proposed amendment
to its program pursuant to SMCRA. The amendment consists of statute changes made by the Indiana General Assembly and
contained in the 1993 SEA 179. SEA 179 contains numerous amendments to Indiana statutes, but only those which pertain
to the Indiana program are discussed below.



IC 13-4.1-4 Permit Approval or Denial



Indiana has amended subsection IC 13-4.1-4-3(a) concerning the findings required to be made by
the director of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) prior to issuing a permit. New subdivision 3(a)(10)
is added to provide as follows:




(10) if any part of the operation would take place in a floodway (as defined in IC 13-2-22-3), the operation
will not:

(A) result in unreasonably detrimental effects upon the fish, wildlife, or botanical resources;

(B) adversely affect the efficiency; or

(C) unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway.




In its submittal of this amendment, Indiana explained that the proposed language quoted above is being added to the
Indiana program as a consequence of an amendment to IC 13-2-22-13. New subdivision 13(c)(3) is added
to IC 13-2-22-13 to provide that operations conducted under IC 13-4.1 (Indiana SMCRA) are
exempted from the need for a ``construction in a floodway'' permit issued by the IDNR, Division of Water. Instead,
any activity in a floodway which is to be conducted as part of an operation regulated under IC 13-4.1 must be identified
in the permit application to the Division of Reclamation. A determination must then be made by the Division of Reclamation
that the environmental standards identified in the proposed language are met. This determination will then become
part of the ``Findings Document'' which accompanies each of the Division's final permit recommendation.

III. Public Comment Procedures



In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies
the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part
of the Indiana program.



Written Comments



Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under 

DATES

 or at locations other than the Indianapolis Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking
or included in the Administrative Record.



Public Hearing



Persons wishing to speak at the public hearing should contact the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

 by 4 p.m., e.s.t. on May 20, 1994. The location and time of the hearing will be arranged with those persons requesting
the hearing. If no one requests an opportunity to testify at the public hearing, the hearing will not be held.

Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission
of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate
questions.

The public hearing will continue on the specified date until all persons scheduled to speak have been heard. Persons
in the audience who have not been scheduled to speak, and who wish to do so, will be heard following those who have been
scheduled. The hearing will end after all persons scheduled to speak and persons present in the audience who wish to
speak have been heard.



Public Meeting



If only one person requests an opportunity to speak at a hearing, a public meeting, rather than a public hearing, may
be held. Persons wishing to meet with OSM representatives to discuss the proposed amendment may request a meeting
by contacting the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

. All such meetings will be open to the public and, if possible, notices of meetings will be posted in advance at the locations
listed under 

ADDRESSES

. A written summary of each meeting will be made a part of the Administrative Record.



IV. Procedural Determinations



Executive Order 12866



This proposed rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866
(Regulatory Planning and Review).



Executive Order 12778



The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.



National Environmental Policy Act



No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).



Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.

).



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

II. Proposed Amendment



By letter dated April 13, 1994, (Administrative Record No. IA-397) Iowa submitted a proposed amendment to its
program pursuant to SMCRA. Iowa submitted the proposed amendment with the intent of satisfying the required program
amendments at 30 CFR 915.16 (a) and (b) and at the State's own initiative to improve its program.

The substantive changes proposed by Iowa are discussed briefly below:



(1) IAC 27-40.3(207), General



Iowa proposes to add a statement that in lieu of the regulations previously deleted at 30 CFR 700.12 concerning ``Petitions
to initiate rulemaking,'' rules of the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship at 21 IAC Chapter 3, ``Petitions
for Rulemaking'' shall serve as the basis for submitting petitions to initiate rulemaking.



(2) IAC 27-40.4(9), Definitions



Iowa proposes to delete its definition of ``previously mined area'' as incorporated by reference and replace it such
that ``[p]reviously mined area'' means the land affected by surface coal mining operations prior to August 3, 1977,
that has not been reclaimed to the standards of 30 CFR chapter VII.



(3) IAC 27-40.31(14), Requirements for Permits and Permit Processing



Iowa proposes to remove and reserve this subrule concerning willful suppressing or falsifying of facts or data that
OSM previously reviewed but did not approve.



(4) IAC 27-40.32(207), Revision or Amendment, Renewal, Transfer, Assignment, or Sale of Permit Rights



Iowa proposes to replace its regulations concerning requirements for defining and processing significant permit
revisions and nonsignificant permit revisions. Iowa uses the term ``permit revision'' to mean significant permit
revision and the term ``amendment'' to mean nonsignificant permit revision.



(5) IAC 27-40.51(7), Bond and Insurance Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations Under
Regulatory Programs



Iowa proposes to delete its existing subrule and replace it with the requirement that an application for bond release
shall not be considered filed until a written determination of completeness for the bond release application has
been provided to the applicant by the division.



(6) IAC 27-40.63(2), Backfilling and Grading: Time and Distance Requirements



Iowa proposes to delete its incorporation by reference of 30 CFR 816.101 [Backfilling and grading: Time and distance
requirements] and replace it with the requirement that (a) except as provided in paragraph ``b'' of the subrule, rough
backfilling and grading for surface mining activities shall be completed within 180 days following coal removal,
and not more than four spoil ridges behind the pit being worked, the spoil from the active pit constituting the first
ridge; (b) the division may extend the time allowed for rough backfilling and grading for the entire permit area or
for a specified portion of the permit area if the permittee demonstrates in accordance with 27 IAC 40.36/30 CFR 780.18(b)``3''
of these rules that additional time is necessary.



(7) IAC 27-40.74(3), Civil Penalties



Iowa proposes to adopt specific State counterpart rule cites for those Federal rule cites at 30 CFR 845.15(b)(2) that
were previously incorporated by reference by the State.



(8) IAC 27-40.75(2), Individual Civil Penalties



Iowa proposes to adopt a specific State Code reference (Iowa Code 207.15(3)) counterpart to section 518(b) of the
Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act in its definition of ``Violation, failure, or refusal.''



III. Public Comment Procedures



In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies
the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part
of the Iowa program.



Written Comments



Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issue proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under 

DATES

 or at locations other than the Kansas City Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking
or included in the administrative record.



Public Hearing



Persons wishing to testify at the public hearing should contact the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

 by 4 p.m., c.d.t. May 20, 1994. The location and time of the hearing will be arranged with those persons requesting the
hearing. If no one requests an opportunity to testify at the public hearing, the hearing will not be held.

Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission
of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate
questions.

The public hearing will continue on the specified date until all persons scheduled to comment having been heard. Persons
in the audience who have not been scheduled to testify, and who wish to do so, will be heard following those who have been
scheduled. The hearing will end after all persons scheduled to testify and persons present in the audience who wish
to testify have been heard.

Public Meeting


If only one person requests an opportunity to testify at a hearing, a public meeting, rather than a public hearing,
may be held. Persons wishing to meet with OSM representatives to discuss the proposed amendment may request a meeting
at the OSM office listed under

ADDRESSES

. A written summary of each meeting will be made a part of the administrative record.


IV. Procedural Determinations


Compliance With Executive Order 12866


This proposed rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866
(Reduction of Regulatory Burden).


Compliance With the National Environmental Policy Act


No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA [30 U.S.C. 1292(d)] provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).


Compliance With the Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.


Compliance With Executive Order 12778


The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsection (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs
and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is
consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730,
731, and 732 have been met.


Compliance With the Paperwork Reduction Act


This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.

Safety Zone Regulations; St. Johns River, Jacksonville, FL


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard proposes to establish a permanent safety zone in the St. Johns River around barges launching fireworks
located between the Hart and Acosta Bridges. The permanent safety zone will relieve the need to establish temporary
safety zones for the purpose of regularly scheduled fireworks displays. The zone will be placed into effect during
fireworks displays to protect vessels in the vicinity from safety hazards associated with the storage, preparation
and launching of fireworks. It will automatically terminate at the conclusion of the fireworks display unless terminated
earlier by the Captain of the Port of District Commander.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Interested persons are invited to participate in this rulemaking by submitting written views, data or arguments.
Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this notice (94-027) and the
specific section of the proposal to which their comments apply, and give reasons for each comment.


The regulations may be changed in light of comments received. All comments received before the expiration of the comment
period will be considered before final action is taken on this proposal. No public hearing is planned, but one may be
held if written requests for a hearing are received and it is determined that the opportunity to make oral presentations
will aid the rulemaking process.


Drafting Information


The drafters of this notice are Lieutenant A. Varamo, project officer for the Captain of the Port Jacksonville, and
Lieutenant J. Losego, project attorney, Seventh Coast Guard District Legal Office.


Discussion of Proposed Regulations


The events requiring this regulation are fireworks displays which necessitates that an area within 500 yards of fireworks
barges remain clear of all vessels. The safety zone will be in effect around the barges when fireworks are prepared
and launched. Vessels are prohibited from anchoring, mooring, or transiting the St. Johns River within the prescribed
area while the safety zone is in effect to avoid potential hazards associated with the fireworks display. The need
to establish this permanent safety zone is based on the number of safety zones issued for fireworks displays in this
area over the last year. Between April 1993 and April 1994, 15 safety zones were established in this area of the St. Johns
River. The creation, review, and submission of the large number of individual field regulations for these safety
zones presents a significant administrative burden. The permanent safety zone would alleviate this burden.
This regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1231 as set out in the authority citation for all of part 165.


Federalism


This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.


Environmental Assessment


The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposal consistent with section 2.B.2.C of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B and the establishment of safety zones has been determined to be categorically excluded from
further environmental documentation.


Economic Assessment and Certification


This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 on Federal Regulation and is nonsignificant
under the Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). The
economic impact of this proposal is expected to be so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation is unnecessary. The
safety zone will only be in effect during the preparation and launching of fireworks. The Coast Guard will notify the
public of the activation of the safety zone by transmitting a Broadcast Notice to Mariners on appropriate VHF-FM
radio frequencies in advance of each fireworks display. The exact time of each safety zone will be included in the Broadcast
Notice to Mariners. Each safety zone is expected to last for approximately one hour, which includes the time immediately
prior to, during, and after the fireworks display.
Since the impact of this proposal is expected to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies that, if adopted, it will not
have significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.


List of Subjects in 33 CFR part 165

Tariff of Tolls: Proposed Revision



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation and the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority of Canada have jointly established
and presently administer the St. Lawrence Seaway Tariff of Tolls. This Tariff sets forth the level of tolls assessed
on all commodities and vessels transiting the facilities operated by the Corporation and the Authority. To improve
the competitiveness of the Seaway, the Corporation and the Authority are proposing that the Tariff be amended to provide
that the charges for the 1994 season under the Tariff Schedule be the same as for the 1993 season, except the toll for
steel slab. In an effort to increase steel slab shipments, the Corporation and the Authority are proposing a separate,
lower toll for this commodity, which is now included under the general cargo rate. In addition, the Corporation and
the Authority are proposing for competitive purposes that the Incentive Tolls Program be continued and be revised
by increasing the amounts of the discounts and rebates and their applicability.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In and effort to improve the Seaway's competitiveness, it is proposed to amend  402.8, the Schedule of Tolls,
to provide the charges for the 1994 season under the Tariff Schedule be the same as for the 1993 season, except the toll
for steel slab. In an effort to increase steel slab shipments, the Corporation and the Authority are proposing a separate,
lower toll for this commodity, which is now included under the general cargo rate. This separate toll would be a 25 cents
per metric ton reduction for each of the two Seaway segments, a net reduction of 50 cents per metric ton for vessels transiting
both segments. As a conforming amendment, paragraph (i) of  402.3, the definition of ``general cargo'' would
be amended to reflect that steel slab is no longer included in this category. The Corporation and the Authority also
are proposing, for competitive purposes, that the Incentive Tolls Program be continued and be revised. Section 402.9
would be amended to provide that a new business incentive of a 50% discount would be granted to a carrier immediately
upon application before transit or upon arrival at its destination. In addition, North American origins and destinations
will be grouped into five geographic regions to discourage cargo diversions. It is additionally proposed to amend
 402.11 to provide that volume rebates of 50% would be available to both shippers and receivers of cargoes with
a satisfactory three year traffic history for the commodity involved. When a particular shipper's or receiver's
shipments of a specific commodity exceed their highest single season tonnage amount of that commodity of the previous
three seasons by at least 25,000 metric tons, the rebate would be applied to all tons exceeding that previous high.
This change will target to rebates more directly to shippers and receivers. The alternate use of bulkers program (section
402.13) would be continued, but amended to include steel slab as a separate commodity. That section would also be amended
to make clarifying, editorial changes that have proved necessary from experience, but the manner in which the provisions
is interpreted and administered would not change. Finally, a new section 402.15 would be added to clarify that carriers,
shippers, or receivers would be eligible to receive only one of the incentives, 

i.e.,

 new business, discount, bulk trade discount, or volume rebate, for any one shipment.

Regulatory Evaluation


This proposed regulation involves a foreign affairs function of the United States, and therefore, Executive Order
12866 does not apply. This proposed regulation has also been evaluated under the Department of Transportation's
Regulatory Policies and Procedures and the proposed regulation is not considered significant under those procedures
and its economic impact is expected to be so minimal that a full economic evaluation is not warranted.


Regulatory Flexibility Act Determination


The Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation certifies that this proposed regulation, if adopted, would not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The St. Lawrence Seaway Tariff of Tolls
relates to the activities of commercial users of the Seaway, the vast majority of whom are foreign vessel operators.
Therefore, any resulting costs will be borne mostly by foreign vessels.


Environmental Impact


This proposed regulation does not require an environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy
Act (49 U.S.C. 4321, 

et seq.

) because it is not a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of human environment.


Federalism


The Corporation has analyzed this proposal under the principles and criteria in Executive Order 12612 and has determined
that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.


List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 402


Vessels, Waterways.
Accordingly, the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation proposes to amend 33 CFR Part 402 as follows:


PART 402_TARIFF OF TOLLS


1. The authority citation for 33 CFR part 402 continues to read as follows:





Authority:

(i) 

General cargo

 means all goods not included in the definitions under paragraphs (b), (g), (h), and (j) of this section, but excluding

4. Section 402.9 would be revised to read as follows:


 402.9 

Incentive tolls.


(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Tariff, the portion of the composite toll related to charges per metric
ton of cargo charged on new business shall be reduced by fifty percent for a Seaway transit beginning and ending during
the 1994 navigation year.
(b) The discount mentioned in paragraph (a) of this section shall be granted for the remainder of the navigation season
if:
(1) A vessel carries, for each transit, 1,000 metric tons or more of new business or a minimum of 1,000 cubic meters of
new business project cargo; and
(2) A complete and accurate application for a new business discount is submitted to the Authority or the Corporation,
on the form provided by the Authority or the Corporation, for evaluation and audit by the Authority or the Corporation
prior to the beginning of a Seaway transit.
(c) For the purposes of this section, ``new business'' means cargo that has not moved through a Seaway lock between
an origin and a destination as defined in this paragraph (c) during the navigation seasons of 1991, 1992, and 1993 or
cargo that has moved through a Seaway lock in quantities representing less than five percent of the average of Seaway
traffic between an origin and a destination during the navigation seasons of 1991, 1992, and 1993. For the purposes
of this paragraph (c), ``origin'' and ``destination'' mean the country in which the cargo is loaded or unloaded, but
if the cargo is unloaded in North America, ``origin'' and ``destination'' mean the geographic region in which the
cargo is unloaded, those geographic regions being as follows:
(1) The Gulf of St. Lawrence and St. Lambert Lock;
(2) St. Lambert Lock to Cape Vincent on the St. Lawrence River, Lake Ontario and the Welland Canal;
(3) Lake Erie, Lake Huron, and connecting waters;
(4) Lake Michigan;
(5) Lake Superior and St. Mary's River; and
(6) Ports elsewhere in North America in regions not specifically described in paragraphs (c) (1) through (5) of this
section.
5. Section 402.11 would be revised to read as follows:


 402.11 

Volume discount.


(a) A volume rebate shall be granted to a shipper of downbound cargo or to a receiver of upbound cargo at the end of the
1994 navigation season after payment of the full toll specified in the schedule under the tariff in section 402.8 if
shipments of a particular commodity during 1994 exceed by a minimum of 25,000 tons the shipper's or receiver's highest
tonnage for that particular commodity during 1991, 1992, or 1993 in the Seaway. Shippers will be qualified based upon
the particular commodity loaded at their port of origin and receivers will be qualified based on the particular commodity
unloaded at their port of destination. Shippers and receivers located within the Seaway will be qualified based on
the total of their upbound and downbound shipments or receipts of the particular commodity. Should a shipper or receiver
of the same commodity qualify for a volume rebate, the rebate will be divided equally between the shipper and receiver.
(b) Volume rebates shall be granted only with respect to commodities whose shipper and receiver have shipped or received
the subject commodity in the years 1991, 1992, and 1993 and have not been subject of a merger or take-over during 1991,
1992, 1993, or 1994.
(c) The volume rebate shall be equal to a 50 percent reduction of the portion of the composite toll related to charges
per metric ton of cargo paid for the shipments that surpass the shippers or receiver's highest tonnage for that commodity
during 1991, 1992, or 1993. Payment of rebates will be made directly to the qualified shipper or receiver.
(d) The Seaway traffic history describing the shipper's or receiver's tonnage shall be submitted by the shipper or
receiver prior to the end of 1994 and shall be subject to audit by the Authority.
(e) Cargoes having been the subject of a new business discount or an alternate use of bulker discount described in section
402.13 of this Part shall be excluded from the statistics used for calculation of volume rebates.
6. Section 402.13 would be revised to read as follows:


 402.13 

Vessels engaged primarily in the bulk trade.


Notwithstanding anything contained in this Tariff, the toll for steel slab, general, or containerized cargo for
any vessel documented under the laws of the United States or registered in Canada in accordance with the laws of Canada
that has been engaged primarily in the bulk trade within the St. Lawrence Seaway/Great Lakes system during the three
navigation seasons immediately preceding the applicable season shall, upon written application to the Authority
or the Corporation prior to the beginning of a Seaway transit, be the toll charged for food grains specified in the schedule
under the Tariff in  402.8 of this part.
7. A new  402.15 would be added to read as follows:


 402.15 

Single season discounts or rebate for same shipment.


Notwithstanding anything in the Tariff, a carrier, shipper, or receiver shall obtain during a single navigation
season, with respect to the same shipment, only one of the following three: A new business discount, as described in
 402.9; a bulk trade discount, as described in  402.13; or a volume rebate, as described in  402.11.



Issued at Washington, DC on April 25, 1994.

Financial Responsibility Requirements for Nonperformance of Transportation




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

 Federal Maritime Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed Rule; Extension of Comment Period.









</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

By Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published March 31, 1994 (59 FR 15149), as corrected by a document published April
18, 1994 (59 FR 18443), the Federal Maritime Commission proposed to remove the $15 million unearned passenger revenue
(``UPR'') ceiling now applicable to passenger vessel financial responsibility requirements for nonperformance
of transportation, because some vessel operators now have UPRs significantly exceeding $15 million. The Commission
also proposed to revise the current UPR sliding scale accordingly_and to require coverage of 110 percent of UPR up
to $25 million per operator, with coverage of 90 percent of UPR for amounts exceeding $25 million. Comment was also
sought on an alternative proposal to require coverage of 110 percent of UPR up to $25 million per operator; 75 percent
of UPR between $25 million and $50 million per operator; and 50 percent coverage for UPR over $50 million per operator.
Additionally, the Commission proposed to remove self-insurance as an option for section 3 coverage (except for state
or federal entities). Existing self-insured commercial operations would be provided one year following the effective
date of any final rule in this matter to obtain other evidence of financial responsibility. These changes are deemed
necessary to ensure that cruise passengers are adequately protected in the event of nonperformance of transportation.
The Delta Queen Steamboat Co. now has requested a ninety day extension of the comment period and the International
Council of Cruise Lines has requested that the comment period be extended to June. 15, 1994. The Commission has determined
to extend the comment period to June 10, 1994.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; notice of inquiry.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Notice of Inquiry in MM Docket No. 94-34 seeks comment on the Commission's current equal employment opportunity
(EEO) rules and policies, and proposals for changes in promoting equality of employment opportunity and promotion
opportunity in the cable, broadcast, and other telecommunications industries. This proceeding is initiated in
order to assist the Commission in complying with section 22(g) of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition
Act of 1992, which requires the Commission to file a report to Congress on the effectiveness of its EEO policies.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a synopsis of the Notice of Inquiry in MM Docket No. 94-34, FCC 94-103, adopted April 20, 1994, and
released April 21, 1994. The complete text of this Notice of Inquiry is available for inspection and copying during
normal business hours in the FCC Reference Center (room 239), 19919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC, and may also be purchased
from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, at (202) 857-3800, 2100 M Street,
NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037.



Synopsis of Notice of Inquiry



1. To assist the Commission in implementing section 22(g) of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition
Act of 1992, which requires the Commission to file a report to Congress on the effectiveness of its EEO policies, the
Commission adopted a notice of inquiry. This notice of inquiry outlines the Commission's broadcast and cable EEO
rules, policies and procedures; suggests proposals for changes to these rules; and invites comments on ways that
the Commission can more efficiently enforce these rules. To focus the comments the Commission has set forth a number
of areas where changes might be considered.

2. The Commission asks how its EEO policies can reflect the concerns of broadcasters who indicate difficulties in
meeting EEO requirements due to their location in small markets. The Commission seeks information concerning how
``small market broadcasters'' should be defined and what process should be implemented to identify such broadcasters.

3. The Commission asks if there is a way to decrease any administrative burdens placed on broadcasters by the Commission
without decreasing the effectiveness of the Commission's broadcast EEO enforcement. The Commission's primary
focus is on full-time hires and employment. The Commission seeks comment as to whether the requirement for efforts
documentation of part-time hires should be eliminated for all broadcasters. The Commission seeks comment as to whether
its inquiry letters should be revised to request information for the entire license term or for some other period to
time instead of the three years of information that is presently asked for. It also seeks comment as to whether to supplement
its renewal inquiry procedures by conducting on-site audits. The Commission seeks comment on possible revisions
to the Broadcast Renewal Application which presently asks for examples of recruitment sources contacted, the number
of female and minority referrals received from recruitment sources and the number of overall as well as upper-level
hires occurring during the 12-month period prior to filing the application. These revisions include requesting
information for only full-time hires, requesting that the information required by the form be divided by full and
part-time hires and requesting more detailed recruitment and hiring information. The Commission also requests
comment on revising the Broadcast Station Annual Employment Report to request information be collected for the same
15 job categories as is now required for cable operators and multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs).

4. The Commission requests comment as to whether broadcasters should be required to encourage minority and female
entrepreneurs to conduct business with all parts of their operation given that the Commission already requires cable
operators and MVPDs to do so. Given that the Commission now gives credit to broadcasters and cable operators for using
minority/female sources and/or obtaining minority/female referrals with other licensees and cable operators,
respectively, the Commission seeks comment as to what it can do to encourage joint recruitment efforts by licensees
and joint recruitment efforts by licensees and joint recruitment efforts by cable operators.

5. The Commission asks if its broadcast and cable EEO enforcement is adequate regarding the promotion and retention
of minority and female employees and, if not, to what extent should changes be made.

6. The Commission asks if there is a way to decrease any administrative burdens placed on a cable operators by the Commission
without decreasing the effectiveness of the Commission's cable EEO enforcement. It asks for comment on the job title
information and information regarding 15 job categories required in the Cable Television Annual Employment Reports.
It also seeks comment on whether it should require cable operators to maintain certain types of records about their
recruitment efforts for a specified period of time. It seeks comment on its present method for selection cable audit
locations. This method is to select a region of the country based on such factors as the concentration of minorities
in the available labor force and the number of employment units in the area and then review Cable Television Annual
Employment Reports of units in that area that fall below the processing guidelines and/or have employment discrepancies.
The Commission also seeks comment on whether the remedies and sanctions available to redress violations of the cable
EEO rules, which include admonishment, reporting conditions, forfeitures and suspension of the cable antenna real
service license, are adequate. If not, the Commission asks what other remedies and sanctions Congress might provide
in order to enforce the cable EEO rules, particularly with respect to furthering the congressional goal of increased
opportunities for minorities and women in managerial positions.

7. The Commission seeks comment as to how it can better enable cable operators and MVPDs to meet their EEO goals and as
to how it can better inform cable operators, MVPDs and the public about their EEO obligations.

8. The Commission seeks comment on all of the foregoing as well as the appropriate application and enforcement of its
EEO policies in connection with new and Emerging communication technologies.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission denies the petition for rulemaking filed by Ocracoke Broadcasters requesting the substitution of
Channel 224C1 for Channel 225A at Ocracoke, NC, and the modification of its construction permit for a new Class A station
to specify operation on the higher class channel. See 59 FR 40401, July 28, 1993. The Commission found that the proposed
site would not permit compliance with Section 73.315 of the Commission's Rules regarding 70 dBu city-grade coverage.
The Commission also denies the counterproposal filed by Lawrence F. and Margaret A. Loesch to substitute Channel
273C1 for Channel 273C2 at Edenton, NC, reallot Channel 273C1 to Columbia, NC, substitute Channel 224A for unoccupied
but applied-for Channel 272A at Pine Knoll Shores, NC, and modify Station WERX-FM's license to specify Columbia
as its community of license. The Commission found that the proposed transmitter site is located in a swamp and no showing
that a suitable transmitter site exists was provided. With this action, this proceeding is terminated.

Denial of Petition for Rulemaking Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 105 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Denial of petition for rulemaking. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice denies a petition for rulemaking by Volkswagen of America, Inc. (VW) to amend Standard No. 105 by reducing
the required height for lettering on antilock brake failure indicator lights. VW wants the reduction to facilitate
its efforts to develop a single indicator light design that complies with both U.S. and Canadian requirements. Standard
105 provides that if a separate indicator light is provided for antilock brake failure, the indicator must bear one
of the following: ``Antilock,'' ``Anti-lock'' or ``ABS.'' Canada requires use of the ISO brake failure symbol. VW's
single design would consist of the letters ``ABS'' placed inside the ISO symbol. A letter size reduction would enable
VW to avoid having to use what it regards as an overly large ISO symbol. 


NHTSA is denying this petition for two reasons. First, NHTSA believes that reducing the minimum letter height would
make it impossible for many drivers, particularly elderly ones, to read the words and thus discern when there is a brake
system failure. Second, the agency is not convinced that the international symbol, by itself, is sufficiently recognizable
to be understood as an indication of brake failure by persons unfamiliar with that symbol. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) 101 and 105, promulgated in 1978 and 1976, respectively, establish
requirements for vehicle panel displays, including indicators warning of brake failure. The two FMVSS's prescribe
the wording of the failure warning displays, as well as their dimensions and colors. 


S5.3.5(a) of FMVSS 105 (Hydraulic Brake Systems) requires that each indicator lamp shall have letters which are not
less than 1/8-inch high, and which must be visible and legible to a vehicle's driver in daylight. In the case of brake
warning displays, FMVSS 105 prescribes that the word ``Brake'' be used. (S5.3.5(c)(1)). If a separate indicator
lamp is provided for an anti-lock brake system (ABS), the word ``Antilock,'' ``Anti-lock'' or the abbreviation ``ABS''
must be used (S5.3.5(c)(1)(C)). Table 2 of FMVSS 101 (Controls and Displays), echoes FMVSS 105, permitting use of
the words ``antilock,'' ``anti-lock'' or ``ABS.'' 
On July 6, 1993, Volkswagen of America, Inc. (VW) petitioned the agency to modify FMVSS 105 to require the letters in
the word or acronym on the ABS warning indicator to have a minimum height of 2.4 mm (3/32-inch) instead of the current
1/8 inch (3.2 mm). VW apparently desires the reduction to facilitate its efforts to develop a single dashboard indicator
light design that complies with both U.S. and Canadian requirements. VW stated that Transport Canada had amended
Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (CMVSS) 101 to require use of the ISO symbol for brake failure. CMVSS 101 requires
the ISO symbol to be at least 1/8-inch high. The amendment to CMVSS 101 becomes effective on September 1, 1994. 
VW's single design would consist of the letters ``ABS'' placed inside the ISO symbol. VW wants the letter size reduction
in order to avoid having to use what it regards as an overly large ISO symbol. It states that in order to put the currently
required 1/8-inch high letters inside the ISO symbol, the latter would have to be 10.18 mm (2/5 inch). VW states that
such a size would be three times larger than required for all other warning indicators. In the alternative, a manufacturer
would need two different designs: One for installation in vehicles sold in Canada, and one for installation in vehicles
sold in the United States. 
VW requested the agency to reduce the required minimum dimensions for ``ABS,'' when used inside the ISO brake failure
symbol, from 3.2 mm (1/8-inch) high to 2.4 mm (3/32-inch) high. It admitted that letters inside the symbol would be
``extremely small.'' VW suggested that an ISO symbol 7 mm (1/4-inch) high could accommodate letters 2.2 mm (0.0866
inches) high. VW did not state how much larger the ISO symbol would have to be to include letters 2.4 mm high, as requested
in its petition.

The agency has addressed the issue of the ISO symbol previously. For instance, in a supplemental notice of proposed
rulemaking (SNPRM) for proposed Standard No. 135, which provides for harmonization of international standards
for passenger car hydraulic brake systems (see 56 FR 30528, July 3, 1991), the agency stated that it had denied several
petitions for inconsequential noncompliance based on the use of ISO symbols in place of words or symbols required
by Standard No. 101. In those cases, the agency stated in the SNPRM, it had believed the meaning of the ISO symbols would
be unclear or ambiguous to drivers. 
Additionally, the agency conducted a rulemaking proceeding between 1982 and 1987 in which the agency amended Standard
No. 101 by permitting various words and symbols to be used, while rejecting others. In a NPRM (47 FR 49994, November
4, 1982), the agency discussed allowing the ISO symbol for brake failure, and sought comment. It noted that the symbol
for brakes was of ``particular safety importance'' to drivers, and stated the agency's concern that ``the symbol
may not be immediately recognizable.'' Two years later, in a final rule (49 FR 30191, July 27, 1984), the agency expressed
its concern that ``too many symbols, or symbols that are not easily recognizable, are not in the public's or industry's
interest.'' The agency delayed a decision on brake failure warning indicators in that final rule, addressing them
instead in another final rule issued a year later (50 FR 23426, June 4, 1985). The agency rejected use of the ISO symbol
in the 1985 rule based on a study published by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). That study found the percentage
recognition or understanding of the ISO brake symbol among a survey sample of people unfamiliar with that symbol to
be very low (i.e., about one-quarter of the survey sample). By comparison, 87 percent of the survey sample recognized
the meaning of the word ``brake'' when it was illuminated. In addition, a comment from General Motors stated that the
ISO was adopting new symbols by consensus and without resort to its prior practice of extensive international testing
as to the symbol's recognizability and suitability. In a final rule published on May 28, 1987 (52 FR 19872), the agency
declined to adopt the ISO symbol as an alternative to the words ``Antilock'' or ``ABS'', once again citing the SAE study
discussed above. In all of the above final rules, the agency discussed the desirability of increased harmonization
of symbols and words as a way to eliminate language barriers and decrease manufacturer costs. However, notwithstanding
its general wish to increase harmonization, NHTSA has consistently deemed it prudent to reject symbols and words
that could have a negative safety impact, whether in the short run during a transitional period of familiarization
or in the long run. 
In its petition, VW stated it was not aware of any definitive studies showing the need for a 1/8-inch minimum height
requirement for lettering on indicator lamps. VW maintained that the slightly smaller letters it requested in its
petition, combined with the slightly larger ISO symbol, would be sufficient to convey the intended meaning (i.e.,
brake failure) to the driver of a vehicle. 
VW points to FMVSS 208 (Occupant Crash Protection), S4.5.1, which requires occupant crash protection maintenance
schedules to be permanently affixed on a label inside the vehicle, as permitting letters of 3/32-inch high. 3/32-inch
(or 2.4 mm) is insignificantly larger than the 2.2 mm letter height that VW says would fit inside the 7 mm ISO symbol.

NHTSA disagrees with VW's statement that decreasing the minimum letter height would have no effect on a driver's ability
to understand the warning indicator. Contrary to VW's assertion that there is no definitive study showing the need
for a 1/8-inch minimum height requirement, NHTSA research report, ``Specification of Control Illumination Limits''
(DOT-HS-4-00864, 1974) found that instrument-panel labels consisting of .09 inch letters (2.3
mm, or 0.1 mm smaller than that requested by VW) could not be read by older drivers, regardless of letter brightness
or background contrast. VW has provided no data supporting its contention that a letter height of 2.4 mm would be readable
by all drivers, including older drivers. 
The agency also takes issue with the comparison of the letter height requirements of FMVSS 105 and those of FMVSS 208.
The words required under FMVSS 105 warn of an impending or actual failure in the brake system of the vehicle. The indicator
light in this situation must be seen and understood by all drivers in all lighting conditions as quickly as possible.
In an emergency situation involving brake failure, the agency believes that it would be the word, ``antilock'' or
the letters ``ABS'' that would convey the desired message. If the minimum height of the letters were reduced to the
point of illegibility, the successful communication of the message would rest solely on the accompanying ISO symbol.
NHTSA believes that the symbol would not be adequate by itself to alert many drivers to the occurrence of brake failure.

The wording required by FMVSS 208 is a standard and permanent notice of maintenance. It is a reminder to the vehicle
owner when to have the occupant crash protection system serviced. It need not be seen and immediately understood,
as with a warning indicator. The two requirements are obviously for different purposes and to be read at different
times. Therefore, they need not have identical letter height requirements. 
NHTSA has no objection to use of the ISO symbol, 

per se. 

However, the ISO symbol may only be used as an addition to the words or acronym required by FMVSS's 101 and 105 and not
as a substitute. VW may, if it so chooses, meet the requirements of FMVSS 105 by including ``ABS'' inside the ISO symbol
for brake failure, provided that the letters ``ABS'' are 1/8-inch in height. Alternatively, it may place the word
``antilock'' or letters ``ABS'', in compliance with the requirements of FMVSS's 101 and 105, next to a 1/8-inch ISO
symbol brake failure indicator. Both options would meet the requirements of CMVSS 101 and the FMVSS's 101 and 105,
obviating the need for VW to install different components in vehicles sold in the U.S. or Canada. 
Based on the foregoing, NHTSA concludes that there is no reasonable possibility that the requested amendment would
be issued at the conclusion of a rulemaking proceeding and therefore denies VW's petition.

Petition for Rulemaking; American Car Rental Association 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Denial of petition for rulemaking.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice denies a petition filed by the American Car Rental Association, requesting that the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration amend its regulation concerning odometer disclosure requirements to accommodate
the needs of car rental companies purchasing fleets of new vehicles. The petition is denied, because the agency concludes
that its authority to grant relief extends only to vehicles for which the odometer reading is not relied upon as an indicator
of mileage or condition.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Title IV of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 1981-1991) (``the Act'') sets forth
certain requirements concerning odometers in motor vehicles. Among other things, the Act prohibits disconnecting,
resetting, or altering motor vehicle odometers and requires the execution of an odometer disclosure statement incident
to the transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle. The Act also subjects violators to civil and criminal penalties, and
provides for Federal injunction, State enforcement, and a private right of civil action. The provisions requiring
odometer disclosure statements on titles were added by the Truth in Mileage Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-579), and
reflect Congress' intent to address the growing national problem of odometer tampering in motor vehicles. 
Section 408 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1988) directs the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate rules governing the
making of odometer disclosure statements. In accordance with that mandate, NHTSA published a regulation (49 CFR
part 580) which requires, in connection with the transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle, that each transferor must
disclose the mileage to the transferee in writing on the title (or in some cases on the document being used to reassign
the title). The regulation details the minimum contents of the disclosure, requires the disclosure to be signed by
both the transferor and the transferee, and provides that no person shall sign an odometer disclosure statement as
both the transferor and transferee in the same transaction, except in limited situations (described below). 
The regulation allows a number of exemptions of relevance to the instant petition. Section 580.6(b) provides that
``[a] transferor of a new vehicle prior to its first transfer for purposes other than resale need not disclose the vehicle's
odometer mileage.'' In practice, this provision exempts a motor vehicle manufacturer from the odometer disclosure
requirement with respect to a vehicle transferred to a dealer for purposes of resale as a new vehicle. Section 580.5(h),
which prohibits a person from signing an odometer disclosure statement as both transferor and transferee, allows
an exemption in situations where the exercise of a power of attorney is authorized under   580.13 or 580.14.
The power of attorney allows a transferee to make an odometer disclosure on behalf of his transferor only in cases where
the transferor's title is held by a lienholder or where the transferor to whom the title was issued by the State has lost
his title and the transferee obtains a duplicate title on behalf of the transferor. 



The Petition 


The American Car Rental Association (ACRA) filed a petition dated November 29, 1993, seeking an amendment to NHTSA's
regulation, under which its member car rental companies would be relieved of certain odometer disclosure requirements
when purchasing new vehicles. ACRA describes a process, referred to as ``drop-shipment,'' by which many nationwide
car rental companies purchase fleets. According to ACRA, the companies receive vehicle deliveries directly from
the manufacturers but, due to franchising agreements between manufacturers and dealers, the purchase must be handled
through a dealer. In some cases, the manufacturer ships both the vehicles and the title documents directly to the car
rental company, while in other cases, it ships the vehicles to the car rental company and the ownership documents to
the dealer. In either of these cases, ACRA asserts, car rental companies experience significant logistical problems
in complying with the odometer disclosure regulations, because they must secure odometer disclosure statements
from dealers that never take possession of the vehicles or, in some cases, the title documents. 
ACRA explains that the required odometer disclosure is currently accomplished through the grant of a power-of-attorney
from the dealer to a third party (not related to the limited power of attorney between transferor and transferee authorized
under   580.13 and 580.14). The third party certifies the vehicle's odometer reading on behalf of the
dealer, conveys the manufacturer's certificate of origin (MCO), and performs other services incidental to titling
and registering the vehicle. ACRA acknowledges that this system works, but claims that it imposes a significant cost
on the car rental industry, because the dealers pass on the costs associated with third party services to the car rental
companies. ACRA estimates the cost to the average nationwide car rental company to be in the tens of thousands of dollars
per year, and asserts that the process delays the introduction of vehicles into a car rental fleet without a legitimate
law enforcement purpose, given the extremely low mileage on these new vehicles.

In early 1993, following informal discussions with NHTSA, ACRA submitted a written request for a legal interpretation
of a proposal to list both the dealer and the car rental company as joint transferees on a vehicle's MCO. ACRA sought
assurances that, under this arrangement, it would be permissible for only one of these entities to sign the odometer
disclosure statement as transferee in the initial transfer and as transferor in a subsequent transaction. It was
ACRA's hope that this procedure would alleviate the burdens associated with the use of third party agents. NHTSA confirmed
that only one of several listed transferors or transferees need execute an odometer disclosure statement in the course
of a vehicle transfer. However, NHTSA also noted that, in this case, the listing of joint transferees on the MCO would
defeat the vehicle manufacturer's exemption from the odometer disclosure requirements (under Section 580.6(b)),
as one of the listed transferees would be using the vehicle for purposes other than resale. It is ACRA's position that
vehicle manufacturers would be unwilling to undertake the burden of executing odometer disclosure statements,
and it now seeks other avenues of relief. 
ACRA proposes three alternative regulatory approaches to alleviate the burden imposed on the car rental industry.
First, it proposes to exempt the transferor of a new vehicle that is dropped-shipped to a car rental company from the
requirement to make an odometer disclosure. It would accomplish this by adding a definition of ``new vehicle'' to
 580.3 (``any vehicle driven no more than the limited use necessary in moving or road testing a vehicle prior
to delivery by a manufacturer and/or a dealer'') and a new exemption to  580.6 (``a transferor of new vehicle
to a business engaged in the leasing of automobiles for a period of thirty (30) days or less need not disclose the vehicle's
odometer mileage''). Under this approach, with the dealer and the car rental firm listed as joint transferees on the
MCO, the car rental firm would make any required odometer disclosure without involving the dealer. 
Alternatively, ACRA proposes to extend the circumstances under which a transferor could give its transferee power
of attorney to make the odometer disclosure ordinarily required of the transferor. ACRA would also extend the power
of attorney from the transferee to the transferor. To accomplish this objective, ACRA proposes to amend  580.13
as follows:




(a) If the transferor's title is physically held by a lienholder, or if the transferor transfers the title of a new vehicle
to a transferee engaged in the business of leasing new vehicles for a period of thirty (30) days or less, or if the transferor
to whom the title was issued by the State has lost his title and the transferee obtains a duplicate title on behalf of
the transferor, and if otherwise permitted by State law, the transferor may give a power of attorney to his transferee,
or the transferee may give a power of attorney to his transferor, for the purpose of mileage disclosure only. The power
* * *.




As a final option, ACRA proposes to exempt the initial transfer on all fleet purchases of new vehicles from the odometer
disclosure requirements. To implement this approach, ACRA suggests including the definition of ``new vehicle''
set forth in the first suggested approach, and adding a definition of ``fleet purchases'' (``the annual aggregate
transfer of new vehicles in quantities over 500 vehicles from a manufacturer to a transferee for use in the transferee's
rental, lease, or corporate fleet.'') Section 580.6 would then be amended to read as follows: 




``Notwithstanding the requirements of   580.5 and 580.7: 
(a) A transferor or a lessee of any of the following motor vehicles need not disclose the vehicle's odometer mileage:



* * * * * 




(5) A new vehicle transferred by a manufacturer as part of a fleet purchase.



This approach would exempt the manufacturer from the odometer disclosure requirements, even though the car rental
company and the dealer are listed on the MCO as joint transferees.

ACRA asserts that under any of the three approaches, the opportunity for odometer fraud is minimal. It notes that,
under the first two approaches, the universe of vehicles potentially qualifying for exemption is carefully limited
to new vehicles (registering very low mileage), and only those new vehicles transferred to a business engaged in ``short-term
leasing.'' Under the third approach, ACRA views the combination of factors (i.e., new vehicle, fleet purchase) to
pose a similarly low risk of fraud, while eliminating the need for manufacturer disclosures in cases involving joint
dealer and car rental company transferees. 


Discussion 


The central purpose of the Truth in Mileage Act was to make the title document the sole vehicle for odometer disclosure.
Congress sought to institute a uniform system of disclosure that would be readily available to assist the consumer
in making motor vehicle purchasing decisions. Prior to that time, the use of separate documents for odometer disclosure
was not uncommon, and was found to be vulnerable to abuse. 
Subsequent statutory amendments in 1988 and 1990 have deviated from the absolute requirement to use the title document,
by authorizing the use of powers of attorney in strictly limited circumstances when titles are physically held by
lienholders. Additionally, Congress has authorized the approval of alternate odometer disclosure procedures,
provided they are determined to be consistent with the Act, but only when these procedures are submitted by a State.
However, there is no indication that Congress intended to extend the opportunity to seek alternate procedures to
any other entities. Indeed, such a course of action would seem anomalous, considering that it is the States that are
charged with institutionalizing the odometer disclosure procedures. The limited circumstances articulated for
deviation from the primary intent of the Act reflect Congress' reluctance to stray from the overriding goal of achieving
comprehensive odometer disclosure procedures to protect the public. 
It is significant that several States have voiced concern regarding the granting of additional exemptions to the
disclosure requirements, arguing that new exemptions would introduce serious burdens to an already complex titling
review process. Even under the current procedures, NHTSA is aware that some States have administratively rejected
certain exemptions provided for in NHTSA's regulation. The differing practices among States with respect to the
existing exemptions have resulted in a disruption of interstate vehicle transfers, as title transfer documents
from some States have been rejected by other States. Favorable action on this petition would likely compound the problem,
in apparent contradiction to the intent of Congress that the interests of the States be accommodated, where consistent
with the Act. 
Apart from issues of Congressional intent evident in the legislation, the agency's authority to deviate from the
Act has, over the years, been thrown into question by court decisions rejecting one of NHTSA's regulatory exemptions
under Section 580.6. Several courts have ruled that NHTSA does not have the authority to exempt vehicles with a Gross
Vehicle Weight Rating in excess of 16,000 pounds from the odometer disclosure requirement. See W. W. Wallwork, Inc.


v. 

Duchscherer, 

501 N.W.2d 751 (N.D. 1993); 

Davis 

v. 

Dils Motor Co., 

566 F. Supp. 1360 (S.D.W.Va. 1983); 

Lair 

v. 

Lewis Service Center, 

428 F. Supp. 778 (D. Neb. 1977). It is significant that these courts reached such a conclusion despite NHTSA's administrative
determination that, in transfers of the subject vehicles (heavy trucks), maintenance records are of key importance
but the odometer reading is not generally relied upon in determining value or condition. NHTSA continues to believe
that it has the requisite authority to consider exemptions in cases where odometer readings are not relied upon in
the course of vehicle transfers. However, the vehicles that are the subject of this petition do not enjoy such a distinction,
and so it is especially doubtful that the courts would support the requested broadening of exemptions. 
In view of these limitations, the agency's discretion to allow exemptions to the odometer disclosure requirements
is highly circumscribed. This is especially true in the instant case, where the proposed changes have been requested
by an entity other than a State (whose right to seek approval of alternate requirements is the only one specifically
recognized by the Act) and, moreover, would target a large vehicle population (the top ten companies had over one million
vehicles in their fleets in 1992, according to ACRA's figures). Each of the proposed solutions advanced by ACRA raises
serious problems. The first and third proposed solutions would introduce a new exemption, in the face of court decisions
increasingly rejecting NHTSA's authority to grant such exemptions. Moreover, they would do so for vehicles with
respect to which mileage is relied upon as an indicator of value or condition. The second proposed solution would expand
the use of the power of attorney, in the face of Congressional intent that it be strictly limited. All of the proposed
solutions would compromise the States' implementation procedures. Under the circumstances, and mindful of the
fact that the petitioner is not a State, NHTSA concludes that it does not possess the authority to implement any of the
proposed amendments. 
NHTSA is aware of ACRA's assertions that the current procedures are causing hardship to the car rental industry, and
that its proposed solutions would not compromise the integrity of the system. Although the denial of this petition
rests on the agency's lack of authority, the agency offers the following comments on ACRA's assertions.

ACRA acknowledges that its existing procedures achieve compliance with odometer disclosure requirements, but
cites costs to the average nationwide car rental company of tens of thousands of dollars per year and the time-consuming
nature of the process. Given the large number of vehicles at issue, this compliance cost does not appear unreasonable,
and certainly does not compel a conclusion of hardship. Nor is such a conclusion compelled by concerns about the time
expended in achieving compliance. 
In the world of motor vehicle transfers, NHTSA is aware of other situations in which companies incur similar costs
and time burdens associated with the employment of personnel that provide titling and registration services and
act as agents for the purpose of odometer disclosure. For example, companies that lease vehicles for long terms also
rely on ``drop shipments'' or ``courtesy deliveries'' when obtaining new vehicles. In these situations, the leasing
companies typically pay set fees to dealers to prepare the new vehicles for operation and process the paperwork associated
with the transfer of both the new and the old vehicles. In many instances, the services performed include executing
mileage disclosures. These firms also experience similar, normal delays incident to obtaining the proper disclosures.
NHTSA cannot conclude that the costs or burdens to the car rental industry are excessive or beyond those reasonably
contemplated by the Congress in enacting the disclosure requirements. 
It is impossible to downplay the large number of vehicles proposed for exemption or alternate treatment under this
petition. The total rental fleet put into service in 1992 numbered 1,532,000 passenger cars and light trucks,

1

 or almost 13 percent of the 12 million new passenger cars and light trucks sold in the country during that year.

2

 Moreover, NHTSA cannot distinguish the merits of ACRA's arguments from those that might be advanced by the leasing
industry, as discussed above. If a similar exemption were granted to the leasing industry, which placed a total of
1,543,000 passenger cars and light trucks into service in 1992,

3

 it would encompass an additional 13 percent of the new vehicles sold that year. While the risk to the integrity of the
system may not appear great in the rental industry situation, the same cannot be said with respect to the leasing industry.
Prior to the passage of the Act, odometer tampering in leased vehicles was rampant, and served as a major impetus for
Congressional action. 






In conclusion, NHTSA does not believe that it possesses the authority to grant the relief requested by the petitioner,
based on the intent of Congress and recent court decisions. Moreover, granting the relief requested would be against
the expressed interest of the States, the very entities charged with enforcing the odometer disclosure procedures.

For the foregoing reasons, the petition is denied.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Under the authority of section 110(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act (CAA or ``the Act''), EPA today proposes federal implementation
plans (FIPs) to attain, by the applicable statutory deadlines, the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS)
for ozone in the Sacramento and Ventura nonattainment areas, and to attain the NAAQS for ozone and carbon monoxide
in the South Coast nonattainment area. EPA's final FIPs must be signed by the EPA Administrator no later than February
1995. EPA requests comment on these proposed FIPs. 



EPA expects the California Low Emitting Vehicle (LEV) program will substantially reduce emissions from cars and
light trucks, compared to the federal standard. In addition, for motor vehicles, EPA requests comment on an enhanced
in-use compliance program to provide extra emissions.

The FIP proposes a federal enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program. If California adopts
an approvable enhanced I/M program, EPA will either withdraw or refrain from promulgating this federal program.


The FIP proposes stringent emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles and provisions to limit usage of older and
dirtier heavy-duty trucks within the State and the FIP areas. 

The FIP describes federal rulemakings in progress for both light and heavy-duty categories of nonroad engines, and
proposes additional measures in the FIP areas. 

The proposed FIP includes innovative control programs to reduce emissions associated with airports and, particularly
within the South Coast, emissions from locomotives, ships, and ports.

EPA proposes rules, specific to each area, for industrial and commercial sources, and proposes to implement on a statewide
basis federal rules for architectural coatings, consumer products, aerosol spray paints, and pesticides. EPA also
proposes an ``emissions cap'' program, which allows sources the flexibility to develop their own compliance approach
in order to achieve the needed annual emissions reductions. 

Finally, EPA proposes to approve in part and disapprove in part the proposed South Coast CO State Implementation Plan
(SIP) revision designed to address CO requirements of the 1990 Amendments to the Act.

I. Executive Summary 





A. Introduction 





EPA issues this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking under court orders to propose by February 1994, and promulgate by February
1995, federal implementation plans (FIPs) to attain the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) in the
Sacramento and Ventura areas,
 and to attain both the ozone and carbon monoxide (CO) NAAQS in the South Coast area. These obligations arise from provisions
of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1977 and 1990, from successful citizen suits to compel disapproval of 1982
attainment plans for the three areas, and from district court orders requiring EPA to prepare federal plans demonstrating
attainment of the NAAQS.
 








Specifically, these proposals are the result of the historical inability of each of the three areas to develop adequate
state implementation plans (SIPs) under the Clean Air Act of 1977. Because of these failures, EPA was required by law
to produce federal plans. The courts have interpreted that this federal responsibility was continued by the U.S.
Congress even as it substantially amended the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. 




Although EPA is issuing this NPRM today because we are legally required to do so, EPA intends to use this opportunity
to assist renewed state and local efforts to achieve clean, healthy air for the citizens of California. Therefore,
the agency has tried to keep one central principle in mind as we fashioned our approach: EPA wants to do this in conjunction
with the ongoing efforts of the local communities, not simply impose federal plans upon them. EPA believes that if
these combined efforts are to be successful, the FIP process must both develop appropriate emissions reduction strategies,
and support the local-state-federal-public cooperation necessary to attain clean air. These proposals therefore
contain not only the specific control strategies necessary to demonstrate attainment in each of the three areas,
but also plans to coordinate, to the extent feasible, an expanded public participation process with that of each local
air board. This coordination is especially important because each local air board is currently developing its own
SIP under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. These SIPs must be adopted and submitted to EPA by November 15, 1994.
If they can be approved by EPA, then these local plans can replace proposed federal controls. In light of these ongoing
efforts, EPA strongly believes that a coordinated, inclusive process is the best way to address the regulatory, social
and economic changes which will be required to achieve clean air. 




Looked at collectively, the plans proposed here will directly affect more than 15 million people_almost half of California's
population_and virtually all businesses in the South Coast, Sacramento, and Ventura areas. In each FIP area the proposed
stationary controls will require emission reductions from small commercial sources such as bakeries and print shops
to large industrial sources such as petroleum refineries and large manufacturing operations. Most commercial and
industrial activities will be affected. Proposed area source controls may result in cost increases and reformulation
of products as diverse as hair spray, deodorant, pesticides and house paint. Mobile source emission reduction requirements
for autos, trucks, planes, trains, boats, ships, and off-road equipment may result in higher costs to some and significant
changes in the mode of transportation for others.

These reductions are made even more difficult_and costly_
because they must come on top of years of significant efforts and reductions. For example, the South Coast area has
managed a reduction in peak ozone levels of nearly 75% since its worst days of the mid-1950's. Yet it remains the center
of the worst air pollution in the country. Sacramento and Ventura, though not facing the same extreme levels of air
pollution as the South Coast, have also made significant strides in reducing ozone levels; but they, too, remain close
to the bottom of any urban area ranking of air quality levels. 

Taken together, the cost associated with the proposed pollution control strategies necessary to reach attainment
in these three areas ranges from $4 billion to $6 billion per year over the next 16 years. While these are not new, additional
costs (they were included in the analysis done prior to the passage of the CAAA of 1990), clearly part of developing
these plans is coming to terms with the fact_regardless of which governmental body assumes responsibility for the
effort_that most of the emission reductions that were easy or inexpensive were achieved in these areas some time ago.


The obvious questions at this point are, ``What are the benefits of clean air for these areas? Is it really worth the
cost?'' Ultimately, the second question will be answered by the citizens, and future citizens, who live in these communities.
In order to make this judgement, citizens will need to know the answer to the first question. While we have a firm understanding
of the many health, economic, and aesthetic benefits of clean air, quantifying these benefits has proved difficult.


What we do know is that the reactivity of ozone causes health problems because it damages lung tissue and sensitizes
the lungs to other irritants. Scientific evidence indicates that ambient levels of ozone not only affect people with
impaired respiratory systems, such as asthmatics, but healthy adults and children as well. Regular exposure to ozone
for 6-7 hours at concentrations 

below

 the levels in the South Coast, Ventura or Sacramento has been found to significantly reduce lung function in normal,
healthy people during periods of moderate exercise. Animal studies have demonstrated that repeated exposure to
ozone for months or years can produce permanent structural damage in the lungs and accelerate the rate of lung function
loss and aging of the lungs. It is also well accepted that ozone can cause significant crop yield losses, extensive
damage to forests, and deterioration of buildings as well. 

We also know that exposure to elevated carbon monoxide levels is associated with impairment of visual perception,
work capacity, manual dexterity, and learning ability, and with illness and death for those who already suffer from
cardiovascular disease, particularly angina or peripheral vascular disease. 

What we don't know enough about yet is how to assign a direct monetary value to protection from these air pollutants.
Benefits such as reduced health care costs, increased employee attendance and productivity, increased crop yields,
reduced materials damage, and a healthier ecosystem clearly have value. The quality of life values associated with
more than 15 million people finally being able to breathe air free of unhealthful levels of smog and carbon monoxide
must be added to the total as well. On balance, these values_when compared against the costs_were strong enough to
compel the U. S. Congress to mandate that all Americans be provided with this public health protection. That is what
the Clean Air Act is all about. Ultimately, these federal implementation plans, and the state and local efforts which
will coincide with them, are about finally bringing that protection to the citizens of California.

As the above discussion suggests, we seek to meet several 
goals as we engage in the development and promulgation of FIPs for 
these California areas. These goals compel EPA to go beyond normal 
boundaries of rule development and implementation. EPA views both 
the SIP and FIP processes as an opportunity to make real progress 
towards clean air on a variety of fronts. To do that, these FIPs 
must include more than rules which reduce emissions; they must also 
involve a concerted effort to make the process of bringing clean 
air to California work better. This effort will require even 
better cooperation and coordination among local, state and federal 
air pollution control agencies, better coordination with the other 
governmental agencies which must contribute to the solutions, and 
more public involvement and education. Success demands that 
everyone work together on creative and innovative solutions to the 
difficult air pollution problems these areas still face. 


1. Provide for the Emissions Reductions Needed To Meet EPA's 
Obligations


First and foremost, EPA's goal is to meet its obligations 
under the Clean Air Act and under court orders, to promulgate plans 
in Sacramento, Ventura, and the South Coast which provide for 
attainment of the health-based ozone and carbon monoxide standards. 
Due to historical failures of these three nonattainment areas to 
develop adequate plans themselves, the courts have determined that 
the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, requires EPA to provide 
plans now. Although EPA disagreed with the retention of the FIP 
obligations in the wake of the 1990 amendments, EPA takes its 
obligations, and their ultimate objective of clean air very 
seriously.
 In EPA's view, any efforts to fulfill other goals 
stated below must complement this ultimate objective of clean air. 




2. Develop the FIPs in a Manner Which Encourages and Assists the 
Implementation of Air Quality Measures by State and Local Agencies


It is most appropriate for state and local agencies to play 
the lead roles in addressing their own air pollution problems. In 
fact, that is how Congress, through the Clean Air Act, intended it 
to work. Traditionally, this approach has placed EPA in the roles 
of technical advisor, grant officer, and, as a last resort when 
local or state responsibilities are not met, as a backstop. But 
the air quality problems faced by these California areas are 
tremendous, and despite their efforts the state and local 
governments have been as yet unable to provide a plan for attaining 
the health standards. It has therefore become necessary, both 
legally and practically, for EPA to play the backstop role at this 
time. 
As EPA pursues this role, we believe that we must do so in a 
manner which both encourages and supports the efforts of the state 
and local governments to meet their continuing air quality related 
responsibilities, especially regarding the development of the 
November 15 SIP submittal. In short, this means moving beyond the 
mere fulfillment of our legal responsibilities toward the 
establishment of a full working partnership among all parties. 
Obviously, the first real test of this new partnership begins 
now. As has been previously discussed, these FIPs are being 
proposed at the same time as state and local agencies are preparing 
to meet many of the Act's most important requirements, including 
their own plans to address the very same obligation as these FIPs: 
attainment of the ozone NAAQS.
 EPA is concerned that issuance of 
comprehensive regulatory FIPs within the FIP time frame has the 
potential to disrupt the SIP planning process. State and local 
agencies will be in the process of designing air quality measures 
for legislative or board consideration at the same time the federal 
government is proposing to promulgate measures to cover the very 
same emission sources. At the very least, these parallel planning 
processes are likely to create confusion for the public and the 
regulated community. EPA's goal is to develop the FIPs in a manner 
that supports effective air quality planning by the responsible 
state and local agencies. 




3. Minimize Federal Intrusion Into State and Local Affairs 


EPA will meet its obligations to prepare federal plans for 
clean air in these three areas of California, and EPA must, and 
will if necessary, implement the measures it promulgates. However, 
EPA firmly believes that clean air is more likely to be achieved 
faster, and in greater harmony with local economic and community 
goals, if its own role is minimized by effective state and local 
actions.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940505-1-00033 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



EPA's current challenge to minimize federal intrusion is 
through the proposal and promulgation of these federal plans_
plans which EPA hopes to see replaced by state and local 
regulations. Consequently, EPA will withdraw or rescind any 
federal measure it proposes or promulgates as soon as it can 
approve acceptable SIP measures submitted by the state which 
provide for commensurate emissions reductions. In fact, EPA hopes 
these FIPs will become obsolete as a regulatory matter. The 
remaining value of these FIPs would then be the partnerships and 
solutions which both minimize federal intrusion and enable the 
state and local agencies to achieve the clean air goals as the law 
envisions. 
To put this another way, while EPA's goal is to minimize 
federal intrusion into state and local decision making and 
implementation authority, only prompt action by California 
officials_within the timetables of the CAAA and the court ordered 
deadlines_can significantly diminish the FIPs' impact on the 
state. EPA intends to assist the state and local agencies in their 
efforts to adopt and submit ozone SIPs with the requisite emissions 
reductions and ozone attainment demonstrations. As pointed out 
earlier in this discussion, successful state and local action will 
allow EPA to withdraw the regulatory pieces of the federal plan or 
reduce the scope and stringency of its imposed or impending 
measures. 


4. Minimize Adverse Socio-Economic Impacts


EPA has attempted to fashion these proposed FIPs to meet the 
attainment obligations while trying hard to avoid unnecessarily 
severe social and economic impacts, both through the choice of the 
particular regulations and by the timing of their implementation. 
Despite these mitigatory approaches, federal regulation sufficient 
to achieve the NAAQS in these heavily polluted areas has the 
potential for significant social and economic disruption. This is 
the inevitable result of the extraordinary emission reductions 
required, the advanced level of control that already exists, and 
the constraints on EPA's authority and practical ability to enact 
and implement many of the most appropriate control approaches for 
these areas.
 Current control strategies in these areas, 
especially in the South Coast, already employ state of the art 
technology and regulatory design for many pollution sources. To 
achieve attainment in these areas, in effect, we must do even 
better. To mitigate the severe impact of further near-term 
emission reduction requirements, EPA has attempted to identify 
control options which provide emission sources with flexibility and 
incentives for technological development, product reformulation and 
pollution prevention. We will look to the public comments on the 
proposals to further identify such strategies. 




We want to emphasize here again that state and local agencies 
are in a far better position to tailor plans for the areas that 
minimize adverse impacts of the attainment obligations. Through 
proximity they have a better understanding of their emission 
sources and their local communities. They can also achieve 
significant mobile source reductions from transportation and land 
use measures that are beyond EPA's resources and authority to 
implement directly. 
For example, there is a growing body of evidence supporting 
the use of market-based programs, sometimes incorporating fees, to 
encourage emissions reductions and transitions to cleaner 
technologies and processes. Such policies can be effectively 
designed and implemented at the local level where a specific 
understanding of local conditions and economies can be integrated 
into a flexible program and, regarding fee-based programs, where 
revenues can be redistributed within the community. A well 
designed program can effectively minimize the disruptive impacts of 
major emissions reductions. Conversely, federal measures for local 
implementation must be general enough to provide for enforcement 
from a distance, and have severe legal restraints relative to local 
revenue issues. The federal Miscellaneous Receipts Act, for 
example, requires revenues from any such federal fee-based programs 
to be deposited in the U.S. Treasury, thereby preventing their 
redistribution within the local community. In short then, locally 
designed and implemented plans become the best means of minimizing 
socio-economic impacts. 


5. Ensure Fairness with Respect to Impacts on the Population as a 
Whole and on Individual Air Pollution Sources


The extent of the air quality problems in these three areas, 
as well as principles of equity, demand that emission reductions 
must come from every source of pollution_from cars to refineries 
to hand-held spray paint. Fairness is an elusive goal_what seems 
fair to one may not seem fair to another_but there are a few 
facts to bear in mind as we formulate a plan for clean air: (1) 
Some emission sources have been required to reduce more than others 
in the past; (2) Some emissions can be reduced more cheaply than 
others; (3) Some individuals and sources of emissions can more 
easily afford to comply with air pollution regulations than others. 
Myriad sources comprise the pieces of the air quality problem, 
and each of these sources must be part of the solution. What part 
of the solution each will contribute, and how to fashion those 
contributions into a plan is where the challenge lies. EPA has and 
will continue to consider the issue of fairness as it develops 
these FIP strategies. We encourage the regulated community and the 
public to make sure that the clean air strategies which ultimately 
get implemented are fair by: (1) Constructively participating in 
the FIP public involvement processes; and (2) supporting the 
development of appropriate SIP measures to displace as much of each 
of the FIPs as possible. 


6. Ensure That the Federal Government Does its Part to Contribute 
to the Solution


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940505-1-00034 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



The solution to these air quality problems will require the 
participation of all sectors that can contribute. There are 
several ways that these FIP proposals embody the federal 
government's contribution to the solution. First, EPA is meeting 
its legal obligations to provide plans for attainment in the FIP 
areas. EPA has proposed plans which, building upon existing state 
emission control strategies, will meet the ultimate goal of 
attainment. EPA hopes that this federal effort will, by actually 
providing a complete plan, leverage state and local efforts to 
complete their 1994 ozone attainment SIPs. 

Second, some of the federal rules proposed today would achieve 
reductions from emission sources over which the federal government 
has sole jurisdiction. Emissions from sources such as new 
locomotives, ship engines, aircraft engines, and some farm and 
construction equipment have not been previously included in state 
and local efforts to develop comprehensive and complete attainment 
plans. While EPA believes that these sources are appropriate for 
regulation, there remain unresolved legal and policy issues 
regarding the extent to which, if at all, EPA can or should 
continue to regulate them indefinitely. In other words, should 
SIPs, such as those due in November 1994, be allowed to take credit 
for federally-mandated reductions from these types of sources? EPA 
is requesting comment on this issue. 

Third, the FIPs proposed today include reductions from federal 
facilities such as military bases. EPA intends to continue working 
with other federal agencies to reduce emissions from their 
operations in these FIP areas as well as other nonattainment areas. 

Finally, as we have stated earlier, EPA views these FIPs as an 
opportunity to contribute much more than a comprehensive set of 
regulations. The ultimate goal of clean air requires public 
support and education, development of new clean technologies, use 
of environmentally sound modes of transportation, and a fundamental 
shift to include pollution prevention into our everyday decision 
making both at home and at work. Along with these proposed FIP 
rules, EPA as an agency is pursuing a set of initiatives which will 
contribute to these pieces of the clean air solution. These 
efforts include implementation of the President's Climate Change 
Action Plan; an increasing emphasis by the agency on public 
awareness of environmental issues and solutions and implementation 
of the National Environmental Education Act; participation in the 
development and funding of a government-wide Environmental 
Technology Initiative; and a direct, agency-wide focus on pollution 
prevention in every rulemaking we undertake. Over time, these 
efforts will provide significant emissions reductions not only for 
California, but across America as well. 



C. Summary of the FIP Contents 



Under the Clean Air Act, nonattainment areas are classified 
according to the severity of their pollution problem. The 
attainment deadlines that are then assigned reflect the 
classification. The current classifications for the three FIP 
ozone nonattainment areas are set forth below. Also depicted are 
the attainment deadlines, which are as expeditious as 
practicable, but not later than the following dates: 






For a number of reasons, EPA believes that the control 
strategies available to the Agency to attain the ozone standard in 
the Sacramento area by 1999 could result in unacceptable 
socioeconomic hardship. For example, nitrogen oxides (NO

X

) 
emissions within the Sacramento area are overwhelmingly from mobile 
sources. And, while significant reductions of mobile source NO

X

 
emissions will result from the scheduled phasing in of cleaner 
engines and fuels, this changeover to cleaner engines and fuels 
will take some time (e.g. manufacturing changes, replacement costs, 
infrastructure changes). This is especially true since owners 
legitimately want to continue to receive the benefits of a full 
useful life from their present vehicles and engines. Therefore, in 
order to get the planned emissions reductions earlier, i.e., before 
1999, EPA must either restrict the use of current, dirtier vehicles 
and engines, or somehow force turnover in the current vehicle and 
engine fleet. That means considering options like no-drive days, 
and/or dramatically increasing the costs associated with operating 
vehicles and engines currently in use. 

Moreover, in order to attain by 1999, stationary sources in 
the Sacramento area would be required to reduce their volatile 
organic compounds (VOC) emissions by 20% by 1999, which because of 
the magnitude of reductions could lead to potential production 
cutbacks or shutdowns. As a result of these negative socioeconomic 
impacts, EPA is proposing, in addition to the 1999 attainment 
option, the option of reclassifying the Sacramento area to severe. 
EPA's reclassification proposal would move the attainment deadline 
to 2005, and would allow the Sacramento area, for purposes of 
attainment, to benefit from substantial emissions reductions 
without the use of more disruptive emissions reduction options. 
Even with the additional requirements associated with a severe 
designation (e.g. the Employee Commute Option program, and more 
stringent New Source Review requirements) the Agency believes that 
this 2005 deadline can result in attainment without the onerous 
consequences associated with Sacramento's current classification.

The South Coast is classified as a serious CO nonattainment area and is required to attain the CO NAAQS as expeditiously
as practicable, but not later than 2000. 


Given these attainment deadlines, the principal technical objectives of the proposed FIPs are to: (1) Determine
the pollutant emission reductions needed to attain the NAAQS in each area; (2) select the additional control strategies
best suited to achieve these reductions; and (3) develop specific measures for each strategy. 




1. Required Emission Reductions 




The first task depends on the collection and analysis of critical data relating emissions to ambient concentrations.
To the greatest extent possible, EPA's proposed FIPs use data compiled by the California Air Resources Board (CARB)
and the responsible local agencies (e.g. the local air pollution control districts and councils of governments)
regarding current and future sources and levels of emissions in each area. In order to remain consistent with state
and local planning efforts, EPA has made adjustments to these data only where absolutely necessary to correct errors,
improve the precision and currency of the data, or analyze more effectively the impact of control measures. 


Of necessity, the proposed FIPs rely on air quality measurements and meteorological input from the extensive CARB
and district monitoring networks. Finally, in order to relate emissions levels to ambient pollutant concentrations,
EPA has chosen to rely on modeling analyses developed cooperatively with the involved state and local agencies and
used in their ongoing SIP development activities. 


These technical foundations of the FIPs are discussed in section III.H., and further details may be found in the technical
support documents accompanying this proposal. The data and analyses will be revised to reflect the final FIP strategies
and to conform, to the extent possible, with new information and assumptions used by the state and local agencies in
the 1994 ozone SIPs for each area. 


The results of these complex technical assessments confirm the need for massive further reductions in emissions
of the ozone precursor pollutants in each area.
 In the most challenging case, current levels of VOC must be reduced by 90 percent and NO

X

 emissions must be reduced by 70 percent to reach attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the South Coast by the target date of
2010. In Ventura, approximately a 40 percent reduction of both VOC and NO

X

 appears to be necessary for ozone attainment by 2005. The reduction requirements for the Sacramento area are slightly
lower, but still amount to roughly 40 percent for VOC and 30 percent for NO

X

 by 1999 or 2005. Finally, approximately a 45 percent reduction in CO emissions is needed in order to attain the CO standard
in the South Coast Air Basin by 2000. 






2. Selection of Control Strategies 




EPA's selection of control strategies for the FIP areas began with a review of the existing emissions inventories
to determine which pollution source categories were present in each area and the extent to which each category contributed
ozone precursor (VOC and NO

X

) pollutant emissions. All mobile source categories are present in each FIP area with the exception of ocean-going
vessels in Sacramento, but the relative importance of individual mobile source categories varies significantly
among the three areas. While the South Coast area includes most industrial and commercial source categories, the
emissions inventory for the Sacramento area includes very few of these sources. The importance of agriculture in
Ventura County is reflected in the unusual proportion of that area's VOC inventory assigned to pesticides use. More
details on the inventory profile for each area may be found in sections II.A and III.H. 


For stationary sources, EPA next reviewed the extent to which each category was currently controlled under either
federal, state, or local regulations. In those few cases where the existing level of control failed to meet existing
national requirements for application of reasonably available control technology (RACT), EPA prepared remedial
regulations for specific industrial sources identified in section III.C.2., below. 


EPA then reviewed the potential for further reductions from each stationary source category in each area, based on
upgrading the level of control to match that required by the best existing rules, by further enhancements to existing
rules to reflect available technology, or by imposing requirements that could be met through technology transfer
from similar sources. From this exercise, EPA selected and prepared most of the industrial and commercial source
control measures discussed in section III.C.3. 


That brings us to the first decision point where the awkwardness of having the federal government undertaking air
quality planning for a particular state or locality becomes obvious. How will the remaining emission reductions
be apportioned among mobile sources, factories, and consumer products and services? The choice is best made with
both a consideration of the costs and benefits associated with particular control measures and a knowledge of the
local impacts that will occur when a specific choice is made. In addition, each locality has a different mix of industries
in different states of economic health and with differing capabilities to absorb the costs of emission control.

Lacking detailed, specific information about every emissions source in each FIP area, the choice EPA has made in this
proposal is to seek further reductions in all categories of pollution sources generally in the same proportion as
their remaining contribution to the problem. Given EPA's distant starting point in this area of regulation (i.e.
EPA is not the local air board) this approach is as fair as EPA can be. This means that the FIPs' reductions are generally
apportioned in an ``equal,'' across-the-board fashion even though individual pollution sources or source categories
may vary substantially in their starting points (the extent to which they have already reduced their emissions) and
in their ability to achieve further emission reductions. Local air boards have a greater capacity for developing
the kind of detailed, specific information about local emissions sources which can improve and replace these policies.
EPA encourages the local boards to do so wherever possible. 


As a result, significant further reductions must be achieved by industrial sources, such as petroleum refineries,
which may have already invested hundreds of millions of dollars in control equipment. EPA is proposing that these
sources reduce their VOC and NO

X

 emissions still further, not only through conventional, technology-based regulations (for example, the fugitive
emissions regulation presented in section III.C.3.j.), but also through market-based ``cap'' rules, which allow
sources the flexibility to select their reduction approach so long as overall emissions are reduced annually (see
section III.C.5.). 


Area source emissions must also be dramatically reduced through regulations that apply either to individuals or,
in some cases, the national manufacturers and distributors of materials whose application, storage, or use contribute
evaporative VOC emissions. The category of area sources proposed for new (or further) regulation in the FIPs includes
such diverse substances or activities as clean-up solvents, architectural coatings, waste burning, landfills,
pesticides, consumer products, livestock waste, and residential water heaters (see sections III.C.3. and III.C.4.).



Certain of the area sources present special challenges both to the regulated community and to the regulator. For example,
today's NPRM includes a proposal that manufacturers of pesticides not only continue to comply with existing state
and federal rules that address toxics concerns but also reformulate their products sold in California to diminish
VOC emissions (section III.C.4.d.). Regulation of other area sources, including most categories of consumer products,
involves complex considerations of the extent to which additional reductions can be achieved without negatively
affecting the products' quality or its effectiveness.

EPA began its selection process for mobile source control 
strategies with those measures that were required in all states by 
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and those measures being implemented by the State of California and local agencies.
EPA considered the impact of these measures as well as the expected benefit of national mobile source rules in process.
For example, the California Low Emissions Vehicle program (LEV) relies on advanced emission control technologies,
clean gasoline, and an on-board diagnostics system which achieve substantial reductions beyond those which will
result from federal cars. As described above, EPA then developed mobile source control strategies such that generally
equal, proportional reductions would be achieved in all stationary, area and mobile source categories. EPA developed
strategies which, if implemented, would result in cleaner vehicles and engines via further improvements in technology
or mobile source users selecting alternatives with lower polluting characteristics. EPA also developed strategies
which rely on declining emission limits for other remaining mobile source categories, both to provide sufficient
reductions for attainment and to assure that  each category of emission source was contributing to the solution.
 
In 1990, passenger cars, other highway vehicles, nonroad 
engines and equipment, and the transportation facilities used in 
interstate commerce produced from 53 to 63 percent of the total 
inventory of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and from 70 to 94 
percent of the total inventory of oxides of nitrogen (NO

X

) in the 
FIP areas covered by this proposal. In order to demonstrate 
attainment of the ozone standard in these areas, EPA is proposing 
regulations which assure significant reductions in mobile source 
emissions_beyond those already expected from the continued 
turnover to newer, cleaner vehicles and engines. The mobile source 
category covers a very broad range of sizes of equipment, types of 
fuels, uses and operating modes, and extent of current pollution 
control. Therefore, there is no one measure or even one uniform 
type of measure which is proposed across the category to achieve 
the reductions needed for the attainment plans (see section 
III.D.1.). 
The ozone attainment responsibility also falls on mobile 
sources that may operate on a national (or even an international) 
scale. Many of these mobile sources have not previously been 
controlled and must now undertake for the first time challenging 
pollution abatement assignments. For example, EPA is proposing 
that locomotives and large ships work to reduce NO

X

 and VOC 
emissions from their respective activities in the FIP areas (see 
sections III.D.4.e.(3). and (4).). Airline operators, though to 
some extent previously regulated for air quality purposes, will 
also be asked to make further emissions reductions from aircraft 
and other airport activities (see section III.D.4.e.(2).). 
In addition, high quality inspection and maintenance (I/M) 
programs for vehicles remain the single most cost effective and 
important measure for achieving mobile source emissions reductions. 
In the FIPs, EPA is proposing a program which follows closely the 
model for meeting the performance standards for all I/M programs 
nationwide, and which EPA could effectively implement. EPA and the 
State of California are continuing to hold discussions on a 
different enhanced program design which would meet the national 
enhanced I/M performance standard if implemented by the state. If 
an agreement is reached, appropriate legislation and regulations 
are adopted, and an approvable SIP revision is submitted, EPA will 
withdraw or rescind the FIP I/M program (section III.D.2.c). 
One reason that vehicle emissions continue to be such a large 
portion of total VOC and NO

X

 emissions_despite increasingly 
stringent emission standards for vehicles_is because of high 
growth in vehicle miles traveled (VMT). This VMT increase reflects 
the simple facts that more cars are on the road today than ever 
before, and more people are driving more miles than ever before. 
In order to encourage a reduction in VMT, and in the number of cars 
on the road, EPA is proposing two programs designed to decrease 
growth in VMT by targeting single occupant vehicle use. The 
proposed measures will require increases in average occupancy in 
personal vehicles in Sacramento and encourage shifts to carpooling 
and public modes of transportation in all the FIP areas (sections 
III.F.2 and III.D.2.g). Various other strategies could be used to 
achieve decreases in VMT. As discussed below and elsewhere in 
today's NPRM, EPA resources, and statutory authority have 
constrained our ability to propose these possibly more effective 
strategies. 
In designing these FIPs, EPA has attempted, wherever possible, 
to structure the proposed FIP rules so that responsible state and 
local agencies can adopt the rules as part of their SIPs or accept 
EPA delegation to implement the federal rules (section III.J.). 
For example, the proposed New Source Review (NSR) regulations for 
the Sacramento FIP area tracks the existing rule format and 
terminology shared by the 5 Sacramento area air pollution control 
districts, rather than following the design of EPA's existing 
federal NSR regulations (section III.F.4.). 
While the emission reduction targets in Sacramento and Ventura 
are formidable, the overwhelming reductions needed for ozone 
attainment in the South Coast appear to require that each 
individual pollution source within the FIP area eventually abate 
its emissions almost completely. For practically every 
controllable source category, this ultimate degree of control is 
beyond a level now foreseeable with existing technology and control 
techniques. 
Congress recognized that this unique South Coast attainment 
challenge required sustained commitment to seek and apply new 
technological solutions. EPA's proposed FIP employs the special 
provision in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, which allows for 
commitments (rather than fully adopted regulations) as part of the 
South Coast ozone attainment demonstration. The South Coast FIP 
includes these commitments and outlines some of the federal 
activities currently underway to support the development and 
commercialization of new control technologies or pollution 
prevention techniques (see section III.B.5.d.).

The state has already submitted a SIP for the South Coast 
demonstrating attainment of the CO NAAQS by the year 2000. This 
demonstration relies primarily on existing state programs for clean 
fuels and vehicles, supplemented by an enhanced motor vehicle 
inspection and maintenance (I/M) program. Since the state has not 
yet developed and submitted legislation and regulations to 
implement an enhanced I/M program, EPA is proposing to complete the 
state's attainment demonstration with a single federal measure: 
the contractor-run I/M program discussed in section III.D.2.c. As 
discussed above, EPA believes that an I/M program is a necessary 
part of the ozone FIPs as well.
 




3. Specific Control Measures 


a. 

Stationary/area source measures.

 With few exceptions, industrial and commercial sources in the 
FIP areas are already subject to air pollution controls that match 
or exceed the stringency of rules applied elsewhere in the country. 
In the Sacramento FIP area, however, EPA was able to identify four 
major industrial facilities (Michigan-California Lumber Company; 
Formica Corporation; SierraPine Limited; and Reynold's Metals) for 
which the applicable local regulations do not reflect the minimum 
level of control required nationally. The state and local air 
districts remain under an obligation to adopt and submit ``RACT'' 
regulations for these sources. Since these agencies (specifically, 
Placer County and El Dorado County Air Pollution Control Districts) 
have not yet acted, EPA is today proposing detailed provisions that 
will contribute to attainment in the Sacramento area by 
supplementing the applicable regulations to match available control 
technology. See section III.C.2, and proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(p)-(s). 
EPA selected a second set of proposed FIP controls by 
comparing existing air pollution regulations in each FIP area with 
the best existing state or local regulation, on a category-by-category basis. Where a more effective control measure
that could 
provide significant reductions already existed (either as an 
adopted or draft rule), EPA has adapted and proposed the rule for 
federal administration in the applicable FIP areas. Since existing 
South Coast controls are generally the most stringent in the 
country, many of these proposed rules were based on existing SCAQMD 
regulations and are proposed for the Sacramento and Ventura areas. 
In some cases, the proposed FIP rules newly regulate sources in the 
area (e.g., commercial bakeries and municipal landfills in the 
Sacramento FIP area). In other cases, the proposed rules 
significantly strengthen existing regulatory provisions (e.g., 
tighter coatings and solvents limits in Sacramento and Ventura). 
The costs, regulatory strategy, and technical basis of these 
measures are discussed individually in section III.C.3. The 
regulations themselves appear in proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(a)-(o) 
and (t)-(v). 
EPA is proposing to enforce on a statewide basis a group of 
four area source rules. EPA proposes that they be administered on 
a statewide basis primarily because ensuring compliance only within 
the FIP areas would be relatively ineffective. EPA's rationale for 
statewide control appears in section III.C.4.a. 
The first of these controls simply proposes CARB's existing 
consumer product regulations, which regulate products such as 
detergents, floor finishes and deodorants, and are enforced against 
manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. While the CARB 
regulations have been adopted and enforced by the state for several 
years, California has not yet submitted them to EPA for inclusion 
in the SIP. The proposed FIP measure would make the measures 
federally enforceable, and is discussed in sections II.B.1. and 
III.C.4.c. The proposed regulation is 40 CFR 52.2957. 
The second proposed statewide control is based on a draft CARB 
consumer product rule for the aerosol spray paint category, as well 
as rules developed by SCAQMD and the Bay Area Air Quality 
Management District. Proposed rule 40 CFR 52.2958 would limit the 
VOC content of spray paints that could be sold or used within the 
state. 
The third proposed statewide control deals with one of the 
largest nonmobile sources of VOC: architectural and industrial 
maintenance (AIM) coatings, including most primers, paints, 
lacquers, stains, and specialty coatings used for residential, 
commercial, and industrial purposes. The proposed rule 
progressively tightens restrictions on VOC content in three phases 
of reduction through the year 2003 in order to allow for 
development of additional VOC reduction strategies. The FIP rule 
may be amended if appropriate, in the event that EPA issues a 
national AIM coatings rule.

The fourth rule proposed for statewide application is designed 
to reduce VOC emissions from agricultural and structural pesticides 
use. Many other pesticides are subject to CARB's consumer product 
rule and EPA's proposed 40 CFR 52.2957. The proposed agricultural 
and structural pesticides rule, 40 CFR 52.2960, is necessarily 
complex and is discussed extensively in section III.C.4.d. The 
rule initially requires producers to submit VOC analyses of their 
pesticides. Following EPA review of the data, EPA will implement 
a six-step procedure for setting a VOC limit to achieve target VOC 
reductions. 
In order to achieve further necessary reductions from 
stationary and area sources, EPA proposes declining emission ``cap'' 
rules in each of the FIP areas. The cap rules apply to a large 
portion of the stationary sources of VOC and NO

X

. For these 
sources, the rules require annual reductions in emissions from 2001 
through 2005, but allow each source the flexibility to determine 
how reductions are to be made. If a 1999 attainment option is 
selected for Sacramento, the Sacramento VOC cap rule would require 
that all reductions be achieved in the attainment year (i.e., by 
January 1, 1999). EPA strongly encourages affected sources to 
identify pollution prevention approaches as the ideal response to 
this market-based initiative. 
The proposed cap rules require sources to submit compliance 
plans in the year 2000, showing how the mandated reductions will be 
achieved, using 1990 actual emissions as the baseline but 
subtracting emissions required to be reduced through any SIP or FIP 
rules in the period after 1990. EPA is proposing VOC cap rules in 
each area, with annual reductions of between 4 and 9 percent, 
depending upon public comment and EPA's final determination of the 
appropriate and necessary reduction rate. A NO

X

 cap rule with 
annual reductions of between 6 and 9 percent is proposed only in 
Ventura, since further NO

X

 reductions are not needed in Sacramento, 
and the South Coast has recently adopted a cap program (RECLAIM) 
achieving comparable reductions to the proposed FIP NO

X

 cap rule. 
EPA is inviting comment on a number of important issues 
associated with these innovative rules. The Agency particularly 
solicits comment on whether a trading component should be added to 
increase compliance options, and whether it is preferable to 
establish a manufacturers' ``bubble'' rule for industrial and 
commercial solvents and coatings, rather than regulating users (see 
III.C.5. and 40 CFR 52.2952-52.2955). 
b. 

Mobile source measures_

(1) Programs for vehicles. Because the magnitude of needed emissions reductions is so 
great, the FIPs seek to build on reductions already being achieved 
by the California Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) program. In order to 
achieve these reductions, EPA is asking for comment on the need for 
and benefits of adopting an enhanced in-use compliance program 
which would provide extra in-use emissions reductions beyond the 
substantial reductions already provided by the California LEV 
program.

Specifically, EPA is proposing to strengthen the recall 
program for cars and light and medium duty trucks. Vehicle 
manufacturer's recall responsibilities will be determined by 
testing the emissions performance of typical vehicles instead of 
only vehicles which have been properly maintained. EPA is also 
proposing to increase manufacturer's liability for repair of 
vehicle emissions control equipment. Both of these proposals are 
intended to provide incentives to manufacturers to increase the 
durability of the emissions control systems in the vehicles they 
produce (III.D.2.d., Appendix I.A., and 40 CFR 52.2962). 
EPA is also seeking comment on a program which would require 
that on-board diagnostic systems of new vehicles be capable of 
communicating, to on-road sensors, the operational status of the 
emission control system. This approach would be intended to 
particularly target high emitting vehicles, and would remain in 
effect for the life of the vehicle (III.D.2.d.). 
For the South Coast, EPA is also proposing a requirement that 
certain commercial vehicle fleets make the majority of their 
purchases from inherently low emitting vehicles (ILEVs),
 
including, for example, natural gas and electric vehicles, 40 CFR 
52.2962. 




For light-duty vehicles, EPA proposes to prohibit California 
residents from importing or registering vehicles purchased outside 
of California that are not certified to meet California's stringent 
vehicle standards. This prohibition would begin in 1999, and is 
described in section III.D.2.h. The proposed regulation is 40 CFR 
52.2964. 
Given the level of emissions reductions necessary to 
demonstrate attainment in each of the three FIP areas, EPA believes 
it is absolutely essential to propose an enhanced inspection and 
maintenance (I/M) program for vehicles which meets national 
performance standards. As previously discussed, the structure of 
the FIP proposal will follow EPA's model program. If the state 
enacts and submits approvable legislation and regulations for its 
own enhanced program which meets national performance standards, 
EPA will withdraw or rescind the FIP I/M program. This issue is 
described in more detail in sections III.D.1.b.(7).(a). and 
III.D.2.c. The proposed regulation is 40 CFR 52.2963. 
For heavy duty trucks, the FIP proposals include tighter 
hydrocarbon (HC) and NO

X

 exhaust standards for model years 1999 and 
beyond, strict evaporative HC standards to minimize shifting from 
diesel to gasoline beginning in 1999 as well, and a declining 
average NO

X

 level for fleet operators beginning in 2000. Fees for 
fleet emission averages above the declining NO

X

 targets are 
proposed to help maintain turnover to the newer, cleaner engines.
At the option of the fleet owner, interstate trucks may comply 
with limitations on the number of stops allowed within FIP areas 
beginning in 1998 rather then complying with the declining NO

X

 
levels. The heavy duty truck proposals are discussed in section 
III.D.3. and the proposed regulations are in 40 CFR 52.2966. 
Finally, for the 1999 attainment date option in Sacramento, 
EPA is proposing to include an accelerated retirement strategy for 
on-highway heavy duty engines. This accelerated retirement 
strategy is discussed in section III.B.3.. 
(2) Programs for nonroad vehicles and engines. EPA is proposing to regulate a number of categories of nonroad 
vehicles and equipment: Nonroad heavy duty engines, small nonroad 
equipment, motorcycles and recreation vehicles, and marine engines. 
See discussion in section III.D.4.(a)-(d). 
For nonroad heavy duty engines (at or above 50 horsepower, 37 
kW), a phased approach would begin with a national program targeted 
for final rulemaking in May 1994. In the next phase, EPA is 
proposing additional standards for the FIP areas and increased 
manufacturers liability for repair of emissions control systems to 
help ensure continued low emission performance. An emissions- 
based, fleet-average fee system with a declining emission levels is 
proposed for the FIP areas to maintain turnover to the cleaner 
engines. For the 1999 attainment date option in Sacramento, EPA is 
proposing a growth cap for the nonroad heavy equipment category. 
This cap is discussed in section III.B.3. 
For small nonroad equipment (spark ignited engines at or below 
25 horsepower, 19kW), EPA is proposing to employ a two-phased 
strategy of first setting national standards for implementation by 
1995, and then employing negotiated rulemaking to achieve still 
further reductions after 2000 or 2001. This strategy reflects 
discussions already underway at the national level. The standards 
EPA will propose in the first phase will be similar to the State of 
California's regulation for utility and lawn and garden equipment 
engines manufactured in 1995 and beyond. In both phases, the 
effect of this action will be to extend regulations to engines 
which California is currently pre-empted from regulating 
(III.D.4.b.2.). 
The FIP proposals include more stringent exhaust emissions 
standards for motorcycles and recreational vehicles such as mopeds, 
dirt bikes, all terrain vehicles (ATVs), and go-karts sold in 
California after January 1996. The level of stringency may require 
substitution of 4-stroke nonroad engines for some current 2-stroke 
applications (III.D.4.c.(1).). 
Finally, EPA is proposing to apply national emission 
standards, scheduled to be proposed in 1994 and finalized by 
November 1995, to spark-ignited marine propulsion engines such as 
outboard engines, personal watercraft (``jet-skis,'' etc.), and 
sterndrive and inboard engines. These national rules will apply to 
new spark ignition marine propulsion engines produced after August 
1, 1998 and are proposed to be combined with a 
registration/permitting and fee system for marine engine use in FIP 
area waters. Marine engines meeting the new national standards 
would be exempt from the fees which are proposed to begin in 2004 
(III.D.4.b.(3). and III.D.4.c.(2).). For the 1999 attainment 
option in Sacramento, EPA is proposing a fee system or boating 
restriction to reduce emissions from recreational boating by one-third.

(3) Program for National Transportation Sources and Federal Activities



The litigation which resulted in today's FIP proposals arose in part from the South Coast's concern that emission
regulation of ``federal sources'' such as those associated with interstate transportation or military bases was
not keeping pace with controls in other sectors. In order to achieve appropriate emissions reductions in these areas,
the FIP proposals include controls for locomotives, airports and aircraft, large marine vessels, and military installations.

For locomotives, EPA is relying on a national regulation that will apply to NO

X

 emissions from newly manufactured locomotive engines in two phases, first in 2000, then in 2005. Tighter standards
for remanufactured locomotive engines are also being proposed and may be implemented either statewide or nationwide.
Because the necessary reductions in NO

X

 emissions are so significant in the South Coast, EPA is proposing a supplemental program for railroads in the South
Coast FIP. This program would require that railroads reduce their average emission rate of their fleet by 2010 to a
level consistent with the reductions proposed for stationary sources. See discussion in section III.D.4.e.(3)
and proposed regulation 40 CFR 52.2971.

As described in section III.D.4.e.(2), EPA is proposing that commercial aviation operations be subject to an environmental
performance target in the FIPs, including mobile emissions sources under the direct control of the airline (aircraft,
aircraft auxiliary power units, ground service equipment, captive vehicle fleets, and any other airline-operated
mobile source). Declining emissions rate targets for these emissions, consistent with the caps proposed for stationary
sources, would be set beginning with the ozone season of 2001. This level of allowable emissions would translate into
an industry-wide environmental performance factor expressed as an allowable pounds of pollutant per passenger
equivalent unit. Airlines which exceed their allowable performance factor would pay a fee based on the amount of excess
emissions. In order to provide additional flexibility in meeting these targets, EPA is also proposing intra-airline
averaging for airlines with operations at multiple airports within the same FIP area. The Agency is also seeking comment
on the establishment of an inter- airline credit and trading program. The proposed regulation is 40 CFR 52.2970.

For general aviation in the FIP areas, EPA is proposing two fee systems in the alternative. One proposal would simply
charge a fee for each takeoff sufficient to discourage use without making general aviation prohibitively expensive.
The second approach would incorporate an exemption into the fee program for engines that are certified to ``clean''
emissions levels. EPA also requests comment on differentiation of fees based on airport proprietor's programs for
other emissions reductions such as refueling vapor recovery and other alternative control programs. See discussion
in section III.D.4.e.(2).(d). and proposed regulation at 40 CFR 52.2970.

Section III.D.4.e.(2).(c). and (5) describes EPA's proposed military installation bubble for each FIP area encompassing
all mobile emission sources under the control of the Department of Defense (DOD), with the exception of military aircraft
and vessels. This includes auxiliary power units, ground service equipment, captive vehicle fleets, privately
owned vehicles, and any other mobile source operated within the boundaries of the installation. A declining emissions
cap would apply similar to the cap imposed on stationary sources within each FIP area. Each installation would be required
to determine a baseline inventory from which the reductions will be achieved. The proposed regulation, 40 CFR 52.2972,
allows trading among active bases and credit for base closures that generate permanent emission reductions.

Marine vessels are the largest uncontrolled source of emissions of NO

X

 and sulfur oxides in California. In order to encourage emissions reductions from these vessels in a manner consistent
with existing international standards, EPA is proposing a flexible control strategy for the reduction of emissions
from ships in port. Specifically, a user fee would be based on the type emission control that a particular ship used.
Ship operators would be allowed (and encouraged) to reduce the fees which would be applied by using low emission engines,
using electrical onshore power service instead of the ship's engines while in port, and for travelling outside of
the Channel Islands. Compliance with all three operational changes would eliminate the fees altogether. Ships that
use South Coast ports more frequently would be faced with higher annual fees, and therefore would have a greater incentive
to make operational changes and install more efficient emission control devices to reduce or avoid fees.

In Ventura there are no large ports, but marine vessel emissions are still large contributors to the area's NO

X

 inventory, because of the emissions that are blown onshore from passing ships by the prevailing winds. As mentioned
above, the South Coast FIP includes a discount in the proposed fee system to encourage ships to move further out to sea
when passing the Ventura coastline. See discussion of marine vessels and ports in section III.D.4.e.(4). and proposed
regulation 40 CFR 52.2973.



(4) Programs to Reduce Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT)



As described earlier, vehicle emissions continue to be a large portion of future total VOC and NO

X

 emissions inventory, despite increasingly stringent emission standards, because of projections of continued
high growth in vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Due to current growth projections, EPA is proposing programs designed
to decrease growth in VMT by targeting single occupant vehicle use. The proposed regulations require increases in
average occupancy in personal vehicles in Sacramento (for the 1999 attainment option only) and encourage shifts
to carpooling and public modes of transportation in all the FIP areas. Various other strategies could be used to achieve
decreases in VMT, but most depend on local planning and implementation to be successful. Unfortunately, EPA resources
and statutory authority have constrained our ability to propose these possibly more effective strategies. These
constraints are discussed generally in section III.A.2.

<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 





Finally, for purposes of the 1999 attainment date option for Sacramento, EPA is proposing a restriction on the use
of on-road vehicles such that each vehicle in the Sacramento nonattainment area would be prohibited from being driven
on one day out of five weekdays. This is, of course, one of the least desirable of mobile source options available to
EPA, but, as is described in detail in III.B.3.d.(3), it appears necessary in order to meet the 1999 attainment deadline.
It is also one of the main reasons why EPA is recommending the 2005 attainment option.



D. Role of State and Local Agencies



1. SIP Responsibilities



EPA has every intention of using the FIP process to propose and promulgate real solutions to the ozone problems in Sacramento
and Ventura, as well as both the ozone and carbon monoxide problems in the South Coast. EPA will implement these solutions
as it becomes necessary. However, under the CAAA of 1990, nothing in the FIPs proposed today or to be finalized in February,
1995 releases the state and local governments from their independent legal responsibilities to meet all requirements
of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, failure to meet any of these requirements will subject applicable areas of the state
to the mandatory sanctions required by section 179 of the Act.

One of the most important responsibilities that any nonattainment area has under the Clean Air Act is to adopt and submit
to EPA in November 1994, comprehensive plans to attain the ozone standard by its applicable attainment date. Regardless
of the FIPs, the state must still implement plans sufficient to demonstrate attainment. Nothing in the FIP can relieve
them of that responsibility under the law. As discussed earlier, EPA is requesting comment on whether there should
be an exception to this requirement. Specifically, comment is requested on whether, as a legal and policy matter,
states should be allowed to take credit for emission reductions associated with FIP controls applied to sources over
which EPA has sole jurisdiction.



2. State and Local Opportunities



EPA hopes that state and local agencies will take full advantage of the opportunities provided by the FIP development
process. EPA believes that the emission reduction strategies proposed today, together with the public involvement
process described below, can be used to leverage support for state and local emission reduction strategies. EPA has
purposefully chosen to maximize the number of strategies in this proposal that could be adopted wholesale by state
and local agencies. In other cases, the necessarily blunt EPA strategies should provide support for better tailored
state and local regulation of the same emission sources. Finally, state and local agencies have the ability to adopt
innovative emissions growth management, transportation control and land use strategies that EPA cannot propose.
These types of strategies adopted at the local level could displace the more onerous strategies in the FIPs.

E. Public Involvement 


1. Public Participation in Development of the FIPs



One of the more difficult aspects of developing these FIPs has been to build in meaningful public participation. Sufficient
time is at best a luxury in meeting the court-ordered deadlines to promulgate the final FIPs. Conversely, sufficient
time is an absolute necessity for full public involvement. An inevitable conflict arises when trying to meet both
of these needs.

If community-wide support for the changes necessary to reach attainment were easy to achieve, there would be no need
for these FIPs or even the attainment deadlines in the first place. Unfortunately, any level of real public participation
in matters this controversial can easily degenerate into parochial disagreements with no real benefit to anyone
involved. Any participation process which facilitates consensus solutions must be designed to minimize these disagreements.

Finally, given the limited resources available to EPA for actually developing the strategies in these FIPs, it is
a measure of the Agency's commitment to public involvement that we have and will continue to direct them toward increasing
public involvement in this effort.

Irrespective of these difficulties, EPA has and will continue to engage in every possible effort to make the final
plans a product of local involvement and consensus. We will do so because we believe strongly that we can best fulfill
the goal of the Clean Air Act_that is, clean and healthy air for all Americans_and meet our court-ordered obligations
by preparing these plans with the state and local communities, not in spite of them. We are highly cognizant of the fact
that each area affected by our rules has its own unique qualities and concerns. We also believe that the only way in which
EPA can fully understand those concerns_and take them into account_is through direct participation by the affected
interests and communities.

Ultimately we believe that the success of 

any 

air quality plan_federal, state or local_will be dependent upon the level of understanding and support which exists
in the community regarding the need for and benefits of the plan. Without that understanding and support, we are unlikely
to meet the difficult challenges which lie ahead.



2. Public Meetings Prior to Proposal



As a result of these beliefs, we have initiated an effort to develop these plans in a manner which encourages local input.
First, our plans, and their assumptions, were built with significant input from state and local air agencies, other
local and state officials, and representatives of various affected interests. EPA has tried to use the best and most
current data that these entities could provide within our FIP proposal timeframe.

Second, our FIP development effort has included eight informal, pre-proposal public meetings (two each in Ventura
and Sacramento, and four in the South Coast). The purposes of these meetings were to: (1) Begin the process of education
and interaction among the various parties_local, state, federal, and the public; (2) solicit initial thoughts and
concerns from the affected communities as we developed the proposals; and (3) solicit suggestions about how best
to continue the interactive process through the development of the final plans due in February 1995. The results of
these meetings are found throughout these FIP proposals, both in the emission reductions strategies and in the post-proposal
process.

Finally, our FIP development process has included numerous staff-to-staff discussions among the local and state
air boards and EPA. The results of these discussions, as well, are found throughout the proposals.



3. Process for Post-Proposal Public Involvement



In order to organize and facilitate meaningful community involvement during the period between proposal and the
final plans, EPA plans to enhance the normal notice and comment period. Our primary effort in this area will consist
of working to coordinate the FIP processes with the ongoing local processes so as to minimize public confusion and
coordinate planning resources. This approach is based on comments and requests received in pre-proposal meetings,
and will rely_to the greatest extent feasible_on the processes already in place at the local level. Following proposal
of the FIPs, EPA will continue to meet with responsible state and local air agencies to coordinate the SIP and FIP public
processes, as well as with community groups, environmental and business interests.

A set of conflicts exist though, which may make it necessary for the FIP processes to also follow its own separate track.
For example, the local air boards are currently developing plans which not only meet the requirements of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990, but also must meet the requirements of the California Clean Air Act. No such California
specific requirement exists for the FIPs.

Further, EPA believes that it is necessary for the FIPs to apply many of the controls to all three areas or in some cases,
state-wide. Reliance on the various local SIP processes to engage the public on these particular FIP measures would
make it difficult for interested parties to participate fully in all aspects of the dialogue, and could lead the public
to believe that EPA has the ability to tailor these measures to the conditions of the local areas.

Finally, EPA must meet the mandates of the federal courts and the terms of settlement agreements which require it to
promulgate final FIPs by February 1995. This deadline cannot be changed by EPA and means that coordination with ongoing
local processes must be constrained to fit within EPA's timeframe.

For these reasons, EPA believes that we should take additional steps outside of the local processes in order to provide
an opportunity for productive public input on the proposed FIPs in a timeframe which is consistent with the final promulgation
deadline of February 1995. These steps will include:

(a) Following proposal of the FIPs, EPA will convene a public workshop in each FIP area in order to describe in some detail
our proposals, to help us identify appropriate issues for in-depth examination, and to encourage local participation
and support for issue-specific focus meetings.

(b) Depending on the level of support that exists, issue-specific focus meetings may be held in each FIP area, and possibly
a central forum for selected statewide issues, to help develop comments on the FIP issues of greatest concern. The
goals of each issue-specific group will be to develop a consensus position, if possible, and to submit consensus comments,
if possible, on its set of FIP issues. EPA will also encourage each group to direct its comments to the state and local
air agencies which will be developing ozone plans due in November 1994.

(c) EPA will not ``select'' specific attendees or chairpersons for these focus meetings, but will encourage participation
that is sufficiently representative and inclusive so as to make any consensus real and meaningful. To the extent possible,
EPA will provide contractor and staff support for the meetings. EPA will encourage the local air districts and the
Air Resources Board to provide staff support as well.

(d) All group meetings sponsored by EPA will be open to the public. The number of meetings for each issue area will vary
by issue.

(e) Following the workshops and group meetings, formal public hearings will be held in each FIP area, probably in early
July 1994. Notice will be given of the formal public hearings in the 

Federal Register

 thirty (30) days prior to such hearings.

(f) The public comment period will be held open from the publication of the FIP proposals until 30 days after the public
hearings.

(g) It is EPA's intention to give great weight to any comments on which local consensus has been reached through this
public involvement process. EPA, of course, remains ultimately responsible for the content of the final rule which
must meet federal legal requirements and address national policy concerns. Although EPA encourages all interested
parties to participate in focus meetings and workshops, any member of the public who has chosen not to do so has the right
to submit written comments and/or testify at the public hearings. EPA will consider all comments received during
the public comment period.

EPA realizes that the time constraints involved pose a very real obstacle to achieving consensus on issues as complex
and controversial as those raised in developing clean air strategies. The requirement to finalize these FIPs by February
1995 means that EPA, and the public, will need to make very efficient use of this period until the public comment period
closes in mid-summer. EPA is realistic about the level of consensus that can be reached in such a short period of time.
We have decided to go forward with an expanded public involvement process because we believe that the potential benefits
are great_and at a minimum, all parties will benefit from a greater understanding of the air quality problems, the
concerns of affected parties, and the range of solutions.

In summary, we see the development of the final federal implementation plans due in February of 1995 as a 

real 

opportunity for local communities, in conjunction with federal and state authorities, to build air quality plans
that can be successfully implemented. Optimally, this process will also provide state and local authorities with
workable ideas and strategies that can be incorporated into the 1994 ozone plans, thus facilitating recision of all
or significant parts of the FIPs. Through the enhanced notice and comment process each participant_state, local,
federal, and every interested member of the public_will have the opportunity to take responsibility where it should
be taken, and to work cooperatively where it can be done.



4. Solicitation of Comment



Written comments on the proposals contained in today's NPRM will be accepted throughout the public process described
above. EPA expects to hold public hearings in early July, 1994 and expects that the deadline for written comments will
be approximately 30 days after the public hearings. EPA will give notice in the 

Federal Register

 of the public hearings and public comment deadline as soon as possible, but no later than 30 days prior to the hearing
dates.

EPA encourages the public to participate both through formal hearing and written comments as well as in the informal
workshop and focus meeting forums described above. Workshops will be held in each FIP area in mid to late March 1994.
Throughout today's NPRM, EPA has encouraged the public to comment on specific issues and alternatives. We expect
that these issues will be appropriate for further examination in informal workshop and focus meeting forums.



II. Background and Proposed SIP Actions



A. Description of the Affected Areas



1. Sacramento Area



The Sacramento area includes all of Sacramento and Yolo Counties, the northeast portion of Solano County, the southern
portion of Sutter County, and all of El Dorado and Placer Counties except for the Lake Tahoe area.
 The population of this area is approximately 1.6 million, and is projected to increase to 1.9 million by 2000 and 2.2
million by 2005.
 The annual personal income of the area exceeds $30 billion. The economy is dominated by agricultural, commercial,
and service sectors, with almost no heavy industry.






Mobile sources, particularly motor vehicles, are the dominant source of VOC and NO

X

 in the Sacramento area. By 1999, mobile sources will account for approximately 50 percent of VOC emissions and over
90 percent of NO

X

 emissions. Industrial, commercial, and residential solvents and coatings are also significant sources of VOC,
contributing almost 30 percent of VOC emissions in 1999.

Violations of the ozone NAAQS occur in the Sacramento area from as early as April through mid-November, although most
violations in recent years have been confined to the warmer months of June through October. The Sacramento ozone design
value at the time of classification was 0.16 ppm (based on 1987-1989 data), substantially above the NAAQS for
ozone, which is 0.12 ppm, measured as a one-hour average. Over the period 1990-1992, the design value was still
0.16 ppm. For this 1990-1992 measurement period, only four areas had a higher design value: South Coast (.30
ppm); the Southeast Desert area, immediately to the east of the South Coast (.23 ppm); Houston/Galveston (.21 ppm);
and San Diego (.17 ppm). 

Based on this design value, the Sacramento area was classified as ``Serious'' under section 181(a) of the Clean Air
Act, with an attainment deadline of no later than November 15, 1999. See 56 FR 56728. However, according to EPA's most
recent national air quality and emissions trends data (through calendar year 1992), the area also has the eighth largest
number of average expected exceedances of the ozone standard in the country (9.0 days).
 Outside of southern and central California, only the Houston and Philadelphia areas have a greater number of expected
exceedances. 





This unusual frequency of exceedances_coupled with the absence of easy-to-control pollution sources, the immense
emissions reductions needed, the rapid population growth predicted for this area, and the possibility that some
of the ozone violations in Sacramento may be due primarily to transport of pollution from the south and southwest_suggest
the appropriateness of a bump-up to a ``Severe'' classification, in accordance with the provisions of section 181(b)(3).
See discussion below. 

Urban airshed modeling suggests that a 40 percent reduction in current levels of VOC coupled with a 30 percent reduction
in NO

X

 emissions would be needed for attainment. As displayed in a table included in the Sacramento FIP attainment demonstration
(see section III.H.3.a.), other combinations of VOC and NO

X

 reductions also could yield attainment, but in EPA's judgment the 40:30 option appears to have a greater potential
to minimize dislocation and inequities among source categories.



2. Ventura Area



The Ventura area includes all of Ventura County, which lies on the California coast between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles
Counties. The 1990 population was 660,000 and is projected to increase to 840,000 by 2005. The County ranks third in
California in petroleum production and 17th in the Country in agricultural income. Twenty-five percent of the work
force commute to jobs in Los Angeles.

Ventura's emissions inventory is less dominated by the mobile source component than is Sacramento's. For the year
2005, mobile sources account for approximately 40 percent of VOC emissions and 70 percent of NO

X

 emissions. The ozone season extends from April through November, but very few violations have been recorded before
June.

<DOCNO> FR940505-1-00045 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Ventura is classified as a ``Severe'' ozone area, with a 
November 15, 2005 attainment deadline.
 For the period 1990-1992, the design value was .15 ppm. While this design value is the 
same as Sacramento's for the 1990-1992 period, Ventura had more 
than twice the number of expected exceedance days (17.6). 





Transport of ozone and ozone precursors from Los Angeles, 
Santa Barbara, and outer continental shelf activity can be 
significant. However, emissions from Ventura itself can result in 
ozone standard exceedances independent of transport from other 
areas. In addition, mountains bordering the Ventura urban areas 
contribute to a meteorology that favors high ozone concentrations, 
particularly within the southern portions of the County. 
Based on recent urban airshed modeling analyses, EPA has 
determined that attainment requires 40 percent reductions from 
current levels of both NO

X

 and VOC. 


3. South Coast Area 


The South Coast area (South Coast Air Basin) includes all of 
Orange County and the more populated portions of Los Angeles, San 
Bernardino, and Riverside Counties.
 Ventura County lies to the 
northwest, the Southeast Desert ``Severe'' ozone nonattainment area 
(portions of San Bernardino, Riverside, Kern, and Los Angeles 
Counties) is to the north and east, and the San Diego ``Severe'' 
ozone area is to the south. 





The current population of approximately 13 million is expected 
to grow to more than 18 million by 2010. The South Coast is the 
largest industrial area in the United States, with a gross domestic 
product of $300 billion. Practically every commercial and 
industrial category is represented in the area's economy. 
In the year 2010, mobile sources will account for 46 percent 
of VOC emissions, 81 percent of NO

X

 emissions, and 97 percent of CO 
emissions in the South Coast. 
The South Coast area has by far the worst ozone levels in the 
Country and is the only area classified as ``Extreme.'' For the 
period 1990-1992, the design value was .30 ppm and the average 
number of actual exceedance days was 134.3. Ozone levels are 
particularly high during the months of July through October, but 
violations also occur under warm and stagnant conditions in April, 
May, June, and November. 
The South Coast is one of only three ``Serious'' CO areas in the 
Country. Its design value is 16.4 ppm for the period 1991-1992. 
The average yearly number of exceedances for those years was 38. 
In recent years, CO violations have occurred only in the months of 
November, December, January, and February, and at certain 
monitoring sites in Los Angeles and Orange Counties. No CO 
violations have been recorded in the Riverside and San Bernardino 
portions of the South Coast area since the 1970's. 
These uniquely high levels of pollution are the result of the 
massive emissions generated within the area, combined with 
especially adverse meteorology and topography. A number of factors_sunshine, high temperatures, ocean breezes
carrying pollutants 
into the inland valleys, mountains to the north and east trapping 
the pollutants within the basin, and prolonged thermal inversion 
layers_conspire to create ideal conditions for the generation of 
high ozone levels. Extreme wintertime inversions retard the 
dispersion of CO emissions from the 9 million motor vehicles within 
the area. This leads to a buildup of CO concentrations over time, 
particularly within west-central Los Angeles County. Attainment 
requires approximately a 45 percent reduction in CO emissions from 
the baseyear. 


B. SIP Status 


1. Introduction; Relationship of the FIP to the SIP 


At the same time EPA is proposing federal plans for these 
areas, the responsible State and local agencies have been 
developing and adopting their own plans and rules to meet the 
scheduled Clean Air Act requirements. In relation to the FIPs, the 
most important of these new SIP requirements and submittal 
deadlines are:



(1) CO plan for the South Coast demonstrating attainment and 
addressing the provisions of section 187 of the Act_due 
November 15, 1992; 
(2) Ozone 15 percent rate-of-progress plans for each area 
meeting the requirements of section 182(b)(1)_due November 
15, 1993; 
and (3) ozone plans for each area demonstrating attainment and 
satisfaction of the relevant portions of section 182_due 
November 15, 1994.



EPA has issued preliminary interpretations of the amended 
Act's provisions applicable to these SIP obligations. See, for 
example, the ``General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of 
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990,'' [see generally 57 FR 13498 
(April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)], and ``Guidance 
for Growth Factors, Projections, and Control Strategies for the 15 
Percent Rate-of-Progress Plans,'' (EPA-452/R-93-002, March 1993). 
Ultimately, EPA expects that SIP measures meeting the 
requirements of the 1990 amendments and more carefully tailored to 
the FIP areas will supplant the potentially severe measures EPA is 
compelled to propose here. EPA understands that this scenario 
presents facilities with the prospect of changing compliance 
requirements as the FIP is replaced by SIP measures. In the long 
term, however, it will better serve the area to have in place 
measures which are designed by State, regional, and local 
authorities, who are best situated to minimize any disruption of 
the local economy and communities. 
In the discussion below, the more important completed and 
pending SIP submittals for the State and each area are briefly 
described. To the extent that the submittals satisfy, or help to 
satisfy EPA's obligations under the existing court orders, EPA will 
approve the SIPs and refrain from promulgating FIP provisions 
addressing those aspects of the air quality problem.

<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



A submittal from the State and local districts of an 
approvable
 SIP demonstrating attainment by the applicable 
deadline will enable EPA to rescind the FIP in its entirety. EPA 
believes that this rescission is appropriate even if the SIP for 
the area has other deficiencies (such as deficient RACT or NSR 
rules) which trigger separate FIP actions.







EPA wishes to emphasize that all existing and future SIP 
obligations remain the responsibility of State and local agencies, 
despite provisions in the FIP that may fulfill, in whole or in 
part, these obligations. Thus, the State and the applicable areas 
of the State are subject to the sanctions provisions of section 179 
for any failure to submit a required plan or plan element, or upon 
EPA disapproval of a required plan or plan element.
 





While EPA's FIP promulgation process unfolds, the responsible 
State and local agencies in Sacramento, Ventura, and the South 
Coast are developing their own plans under the schedule provided by 
the 1990 Amendments. Depending upon the time EPA is able to 
approve SIP replacement measures submitted by these agencies, EPA 
may upon approval of such measures either refrain from 
promulgating, or withdraw the corresponding portions of the FIP. 
sections 110(c) and 302(y). 
As the relationship between the FIPs and the developing SIPs 
evolves, EPA will confront a number of issues. One question that 
has been raised is whether the State may claim credit toward 
meeting progress or attainment requirements for the emissions 
reductions from FIP measures that apply to a limited category of 
sources over which State or local control is legally preempted. 
The issue is whether the State, in its plan, may seek not to 
replace these FIP measures, but rather continue to rely upon them, 
at the same time obtaining EPA's full approval for the state plan. 
Although EPA has not previously addressed this specific 
question, a straightforward reading of the Clean Air Act's text and 
structure suggests that a state plan to be approvable must 
demonstrate attainment of the relevant standard, without reliance 
on measures that EPA has promulgated solely pursuant to its FIP 
authority. (Under this theory, a state could still rely on any 
measures that EPA has promulgated under its independent authority, 
such as Title II, as opposed to its authority under section 110(c) 
to assume California's waiver role under, for example, section 209. 
See discussion of EPA's FIP authority, section III.A.2.a. To 
decide otherwise would require the conclusion that Congress 
intended FIP measures to remain in place, perhaps permanently, 
without sanctions being imposed on the state_a view arguably at 
odds with the Act's historic emphasis on the primacy of state 
responsibility and the role of FIPs as temporary substitutes for 
state failures. 
On the other hand, it may be argued that, for a limited number 
of sources over which the federal government, when promulgating a 
FIP, demonstrably has sole legal authority, and over which the 
state is barred from exerting control, removing the FIP measures 
and hence requiring the state to compensate for the lack of control 
of these sources may force it to impose unreasonably and 
inequitably harsher controls on other sources. Thus, the argument 
goes, EPA should consider whether there is any basis in law, and 
justification in policy, for carving out a limited exception to the 
traditional view. 
EPA does not resolve this complex issue here, but intends to 
continue to analyze and explore it. In this proposal we solicit 
comment on the legal and policy implications raised by this aspect 
of the relationship between the FIP and the SIP. 


2. Sacramento 


On November 15, 1993, the State submitted Sacramento ozone 
rate-of-progress plans for the Sacramento Metropolitan Area, 
addressing the Act's 15 percent rate-of-progress plan requirements. 
The Sacramento area's 15 percent plans involved a coordinated 
effort by the Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG) and 
the five local air pollution control agencies. Each of the air 
agencies developed a plan for their portion of the area. 
The reductions in Sacramento's 15 percent plans rely on an 
enhanced I/M program, measures that the State and local governments 
have adopted or have committed to adopt, measures that the Federal 
government will have to develop and implement for the Sacramento 
area, and substitution of NO

X

 for VOC reductions. However, an 
approvable enhanced I/M program has not been authorized by the 
State legislature, EPA has decided preliminarily that it will not 
accept commitments for measures for purposes of the Act's 15 
percent rate-of-progress provision, and EPA cannot credit NO

X

 
reductions in place of the necessary VOC reductions. Therefore, 
EPA cannot take action at this time to approve this submittal with 
respect to the Clean Air Act progress demonstration.

The Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District 
(SMAQMD), the Yolo-Solano Air Pollution Control District (YSAPCD), 
the Placer County Air Pollution Control District (PCAPCD), the El 
Dorado County Air Pollution Control District (EDCAPCD), the Feather 
River Air Quality Management District (FRAQMD), SACOG and CARB plan 
to submit a comprehensive revised ozone attainment SIP on or before 
November 15, 1994. The local agencies hope to release a draft of 
this SIP in the Spring of 1994 and to modify it after EPA finalizes 
the FIP in February 1995. The air quality modeling in the SIP and 
FIP are based on similar data and should be consistent. There may, 
however, be significant differences between the regulations 
included in the two plans to attain the ozone standard. 


3. Ventura 


On November 15, 1993, the State submitted a Ventura ozone 
rate-of-progress plan addressing the Act's requirement that a plan 
be submitted by that date demonstrating creditable VOC reductions 
of at least 15 percent from 1990 to 1996. The plan describes how 
this reduction can be accomplished with an enhanced I/M program 
plus measures that the State committed to adopt and implement by 
1996 in Ventura's 1991 Air Quality Management Plan. Many of the 
promised local measures have already been adopted, but an 
approvable enhanced I/M program has not been authorized by the 
State legislature. As in the case of Sacramento, EPA cannot now 
approve this Ventura plan submittal with respect to the progress 
demonstration. 
The Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (VCAPCD), 
the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), and the 
CARB plan to submit a comprehensive revised ozone attainment SIP on 
or before November 15, 1994. VCAPCD hopes to release a draft of 
this SIP by the Spring of 1994 and to modify it after EPA finalizes 
the FIP in February 1995. The air quality modeling in the SIP and 
FIP are based on similar data and should be consistent. As in the 
case of Sacramento, however, the regulations included in the two 
plans may be different. 


4. South Coast 


On December 31, 1992, the State submitted the CO plan for the 
South Coast. This plan includes a demonstration of attainment by 
the year 2000 relying on emission reductions from previously 
adopted regulations as well as from an enhanced I/M program meeting 
the requirements of sections 182(c)(3) and 187(a)(6). Because the 
State legislature has not yet enacted legislation authorizing such 
an enhanced I/M program, EPA proposes to disapprove the CO plan 
with respect to the requirements for an attainment demonstration, 
reasonable further progress, reasonably available control measures, 
and enhanced I/M. 
On January 15, 1993, the Agency issued a finding of failure to 
submit two other mandatory elements of the CO plan: (1) 
Transportation control measures (TCMs) to offset growth, as 
required by section 182(d)(1)(A); and (2) adopted contingency 
measures to be implemented if vehicle miles traveled (VMT) 
forecasts are exceeded, in accordance with section 187(a)(3). In 
section II.C.1., below, EPA is proposing to disapprove the CO SIP 
with respect to these six elements: attainment demonstration, 
reasonable further progress, reasonably available control measures, provision for an enhanced 
I/M program, TCMs to offset growth, and 
contingency measures to be implemented if VMT forecasts are 
exceeded. EPA is also proposing a partial approval of other 
portions of the plan that represent an improvement over what is 
currently in the SIP, do not conflict with proposed FIP provisions, 
and meet some of the applicable requirements of the Act. 
On November 15, 1993, the State submitted a 15 percent rate-of-progress plan for the South Coast. The 15 percent plan
relies 
on reductions from currently adopted rules, but also depends upon 
a relatively small contribution from 10 SCAQMD measures scheduled 
for full adoption in 1994 or 1995 and an improved I/M program. As 
in the case of Sacramento and Ventura, EPA cannot at this time 
propose to approve this South Coast submittal with respect to the 
15 percent rate-of-progress demonstration. However, in section 
II.C.2., below, for entirely different purposes EPA is proposing to 
conditionally approve the SCAQMD commitments to adopt rules during 
1994 and 1995. 
On October 15, 1993, the SCAQMD adopted rules implementing the 
Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM) program for NO

X

 and 
sulfur oxides (SO

X

). This innovative program establishes a 
declining cap ``bubble'' requirement on most facilities with 
emissions greater than 4 tons per year of NO

X

 or SO

X

. The program 
includes emissions allocation and emissions trading components. 
EPA intends to propose to approve (or conditionally approve) the 
RECLAIM regulations in separate rulemaking, following SIP 
submittal. For the purposes of the FIP attainment demonstration, 
EPA proposes to assign credit to the adopted RECLAIM program, which 
went into effect on January 1, 1994. If EPA does not finally 
approve the NO

X

 RECLAIM rules, EPA would not be able to grant 
credits for associated reductions, and would need to amend the FIP 
accordingly. For more details on the RECLAIM rules, see section 
III.C.5. 
The SCAQMD, SCAG, and CARB are currently preparing a 
comprehensive revision to existing air quality plans, addressing 
all pollutants and the requirements of both the federal and State 
Clean Air Acts. SIP submittal of this comprehensive plan (or 
portions of the plan) is scheduled to occur on or before November 
15, 1994. The new plan will include revised 1990 baseyear 
emissions inventories, and projected inventories for interim years 
through the year 2020. With respect to motor vehicle emissions, 
these inventories may be significantly different from those used in 
the proposed ozone and CO FIPs, because the 1994 plan is expected 
to rely on new trip modeling input data and revised motor vehicle 
emissions factors. For ozone, the plan may analyze additional 
episodes, including a weekend episode. 


5. State of California

California's motor vehicle control program (CMVCP) predates 
the first federal statute regulating motor vehicle emissions, the 
Motor Vehicle Air Pollution Control Act of 1965. In the Air 
Quality Act of 1967 (Pub. L. 90-148), Congress allowed California 
a waiver of the Air Quality Act's preemption section on motor 
vehicle emissions control because of California's pioneering 
efforts and unique problems. The 1977 amendments to the CAA 
expanded the flexibility granted to California in order ``to afford 
California the broadest possible discretion in selecting the best 
means to protect the health of its citizens and the public 
welfare.'' H.R. Rep. No. 294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 301-2 (1977). 
So long as California demonstrates that its motor vehicle 
standards are ``in the aggregate'' at least as protective of public 
health and welfare as applicable federal standards, section 209(b) 
of the Act requires the Administrator to waive the Act's general 
prohibition on state adoption of standards relating to the control 
of emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines, 
unless the Administrator finds that California's determination was 
arbitrary and capricious, that California does not need the 
standard to meet ``compelling and extraordinary conditions,'' or that 
the California standards and accompanying enforcement procedures 
are not consistent with section 202(a) of the Act.
 Section 
211(c)(4)(B) also provides that a state that has received a section 
209 waiver (i.e., California) may prescribe controls or 
prohibitions respecting fuels or fuel additives. 




The 1990 CAAA further expanded the California waiver 
provisions to cover nonroad vehicles or engines (except for certain 
preempted engines), and also established a special California 
clean-fuel vehicle program to be implemented in California (the 
California Pilot Test Program). See sections 209, 211(c)(4), and 
249. 
California law reserves to CARB most authorities for adopting 
and enforcing motor vehicle emission controls (including 
restrictions on fuels and fuel content) and standards for nonroad 
engines and consumer products. Under this authority, particularly 
as strengthened by the California Clean Air Act of 1988 (Chapter 
1568, Statutes of 1988), CARB has adopted many new provisions with 
the potential for vast VOC and NO

X

 emission reductions. CARB 
regulations adopted through the first half of 1990 are described at 
length in EPA's 1990 proposed FIP for the South Coast. See 55 FR 
36470-36479. 
More recently adopted State measures include: Low Emissions 
Vehicles (LEV) and Clean Fuels Program; Utility and Lawn and Garden 
Equipment Engine Exhaust Emission Standards and Test Procedures; 
Standards for Consumer Products (CARB regulations adopted thus far 
cover approximately 30 consumer product categories); and Emission 
Standards for Construction and Farm Equipment. 
EPA is not generally assigning credit in the attainment 
demonstration for State (or local) regulations that have not 
already been approved as part of the SIP or are not now undergoing 
SIP approval. EPA's policy restricts State credit in either their 
attainment demonstrations or progress plans for reductions from 
measures that have not been submitted as approvable elements of the 
SIP. 
The principal reason for this policy has been to comply with 
section 110(a)(2)(A) of the Act, which requires that each SIP 
``include enforceable emission limitations and other control 
measures, means, or techniques (including economic incentives such 
as fees, marketable permits, and auctions of emissions rights), as 
well as schedules and timetables for compliance, as may be 
necessary or appropriate to meet the applicable requirements of 
this Act * * *.'' 
In general, EPA policy has been to require that reductions 
used in attainment demonstrations be submitted for incorporation in 
the SIP, to ensure that the reductions are enforceable directly by 
EPA in the event that the responsible State and local agencies fail 
to perform their implementation responsibilities. It is for this 
reason that EPA is proposing in this NPRM to promulgate consumer 
product regulations comparable to rules which CARB has previously 
adopted and already enforces, but which the State has not yet 
submitted as a SIP revision.

C. Proposed Action on the South Coast SIP Revisions 


1. CO Plan 


a. Statutory provision and general preamble requirements. The air quality planning requirements for CO nonattainment
areas are set out in sections 186-187 of the Act, which pertain to the classification of CO nonattainment areas
and to the submission requirements of the SIPs for these areas, respectively. EPA has issued a ``General Preamble''
describing the Agency's preliminary views on how EPA intends to act on SIPs submitted under Title I of the Act [see generally
57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)]. The reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more
detailed discussion of the EPA's preliminary interpretations of Title I. In this proposed rulemaking action, EPA
is applying these policies to the proposed South Coast CO SIP, taking into consideration the specific factual issues
presented. 
Those states containing CO nonattainment areas classified as ``Serious'' were required under the Act to submit by
November 15, 1992, a plan that provides enforceable measures to achieve annual emissions reductions leading to attainment
of the NAAQS by December 31, 2000. The Act mandates other specific plan elements, which are discussed below. 
In today's action, EPA is proposing to partially disapprove and partially approve the plan for the South Coast, in
accordance with the provisions of section 110(k) of the Act governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565-13566).
EPA is proposing to approve the plan with respect to procedural requirements, employee commute options (ECO) program,
and forecast of VMT. EPA is proposing to disapprove the plan with respect to the attainment demonstration, reasonable
further progress (RFP), reasonably available control measures (RACM), enhanced inspection and maintenance (I/M),
VMT contingency measures, and TCMs to offset growth in motor vehicle emissions and meet progress and attainment requirements.
The State's submission to address the requirements for the clean-fuel vehicle fleet has been conditionally approved
in a separate rulemaking. EPA will also act separately on the State's oxygenated fuel program. EPA is proposing to
take no action on the plan's emissions inventory for the reasons discussed below. 
b. 

Procedural requirements. 

Section 110(a)(2) of the Act requires states to provide reasonable notice and public hearing before plan adoption.
The SCAQMD satisfied this requirement by furnishing proper notice and adopting the plan at a public hearing held on
November 6, 1992. Following adoption by the Governing Board of the SCAQMD, the plan was forwarded to CARB, which submitted
the CO plan as a proposed revision to the California SIP on December 31, 1992. On April 29, 1993, CARB submitted a letter
correcting certain adoption and implementation dates for measures under CARB's jurisdiction. 
c. 

Emissions inventory. 

Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plans include a comprehensive, accurate, current inventory
of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The emissions inventory included
with the South Coast CO plan generally conforms to applicable EPA guidance (see, for example, Emission Inventory
Requirements for Carbon Monoxide State Implementation Plans, EPA-450/4-91-011; Procedures
for the Preparation of Emission Inventories for Carbon Monoxide and Precursors of Ozone, Volume I: General Guidance
for Stationary Sources, EPA-450/4-91-016; Procedures for Emission Inventory Preparation, Volume
IV: Mobile Sources, EPA 450/4-81-026d Revised). This guidance allows approval of California's motor
vehicle emissions factors (in this case, the EMFAC7EP update) in place of the corresponding federal emissions factors.
The methodologies used to prepare the base year and projected emissions inventories, as described in Chapter 3 of
the plan, are acceptable. EPA is not proposing to approve into the SIP the State's emission inventories, however,
because a different inventory is employed in the federal attainment demonstration for CO, and a new CO inventory has
been developed for use in a South Coast SIP revision scheduled for adoption later this year. EPA hopes to be able to approve
the revised inventory in the final SIP action and use this new inventory in the final CO FIP. 
Moreover, State and local agencies are preparing comprehensive revisions to the base year and projected inventories
for motor vehicles. EPA may use some or all of this revised and updated motor vehicle data to amend the attainment demonstration
in the final FIP. If the State submits an approvable CO SIP along with acceptable updated emissions inventories for
the South Coast, EPA will be able to approve the revised State plan and inventories and substitute them for the federal
plan and federal emissions inventories. 
d. Reasonably available control measures (RACM). Section 172(c)(1) requires the plans for all nonattainment areas
to provide for the implementation of all RACM (including Reasonably Available Control Technology, or RACT) as expeditiously
as practicable. EPA interprets this requirement to impose a duty on all nonattainment areas to consider all available
control measures and to adopt and implement such measures as are reasonably available for implementation in the area
as components of the area's attainment demonstration. 
The South Coast CO plan's control measures are presented in Chapter 4, Chapter 6, Appendix B, and Appendix C. The control
measures are also discussed below in sections II.C.1.g., h., i., and j. The State and local control measures (with
adoption/implementation dates before 2001) are as follows:

 

M-G-12, Oxygenated Fuels Program (1991/1992); 
ARB-4, Improved Certification Requirements for alternative Fuel Retrofit Systems (1992/1992); 
M-G-5, Motor Vehicle Buyback Program (1993/1993-1997); 
M-G-4, Low-Emission New Fleet Vehicles (1991/1993-2000); 
M-G-11, Inspection and Maintenance Program Enhancement (1993/1994); 
M-G-1, Zero-Emission Urban Bus Implementation (1992/1994-2000); 
ARB-5, Low Emission Vehicles and Clean Fuels Program (1990/1994-2003); 
ARB-1, Revised Emission Standards and Test Procedures for Medium-Duty Vehicles and Light Heavy-Duty Engines
(1990/1995-1996); 
ARB-7, Low Emission Vehicle Standards for Heavy-Duty Engines (1992/1998-2007); 
ARB-11, Inspections of Fleet Heavy-Duty Trucks (1992/to be determined); 
ARB-12, Control of Off-Cycle Emissions (1993/to be determined); 
ARB-16, Retrofit/Operational Requirements for Locomotives (1993/1992-1997); 
M-I-7, Eliminate Leaf Blowers (1993/1994); 
ARB-13, Emission Standards for Utility Engines (1990/1994-1999); 
ARB-15, Emission Standards for Off-Road Motorcycles (1992/1995); 
ARB-14, Emission Standards for Construction and Farm Equipment (1992/1995-2000); 
ARB-18, Emission Standards for Off-Highway Vehicles (1993/1995-2000); 
ARB-17, Emission Standards for Marine Vessels (1993/1997-1999); 
P-B-6, Control of Emissions from Petroleum Refinery Flares (1992/1996); 
FC-1/2g, Transit Improvements (to be determined/to be determined);

F-2/2f, HOV and Bus Lanes/Roads (to be determined/to be determined); 
FC-3/M-H-5(c), Employer-Based Trip Reduction (1993/1994); 
FC-4, Additional VMT/VT Reduction Strategies (1989-2000, with SCAQMD backstop 1994/1991-, with
SCAQMD backstop 1994); 
FC-5/4, Traffic Flow Improvements (1989-2000/1991-); 
FC-6/M-G-7, Control Extended Idling (1993/1994); 
FC-7/M-G-5, Encourage Removal of Pre-1980 Vehicles (1993/1993); 
FC-8, M-G-6, Reduce Cold Start Emissions from Vehicles (1994/1994); 
M-H-1, Environmental Review Program (1992/1992); 
M-H-2, Trip Reduction for Schools (1993/1993); 
M-H-4, Special Activity Centers (1993/1994).

 

EPA has reviewed the extensive list of scheduled measures and has concluded that the plan would reflect RACM but for
the omission of an enhanced I/M program. By this NPRM, EPA is proposing to disapprove the plan with respect to the RACM
requirement because of this single deficiency. EPA invites comment on whether other RACM exist for the South Coast
CO plan. 
e. 

Attainment demonstration. 

As noted, ``Serious'' CO nonattainment areas were required to submit a demonstration that the plan will provide for
attainment by December 31, 2000. The SCAQMD conducted an attainment demonstration using both areawide (Urban Airshed
Model, or UAM) and hotspot (CAL3QHC) modeling analyses. The two modeling analyses and the selection of the design
value (23.4 ppm, recorded in 1988 at the Lynwood monitoring station) are discussed in Chapter 4 and Appendix D of the
CO plan. The modeling analyses are consistent with EPA's guidance (Guideline for Modeling Carbon Monoxide from Roadway
Intersections, User's Guide to CAL3QHC: A Modeling Methodology for Predicting Pollutant Concentrations near Roadway
Intersections, and Guideline for Regulatory Application of the Urban Airshed Model for Areawide Carbon Monoxide).
The SCAQMD's modeling analyses predict attainment of the 8-hour CO NAAQS by the year 2000, based upon the control strategies
included in the plan. 
However, since attainment depends upon large CO emissions reductions (587.4 tons per day) assigned to the enhanced
I/M program, which has not yet been adopted by the State, EPA proposes to disapprove the attainment demonstration
portion of the plan. In the future, the attainment demonstration could be approved if the State submits approvable
enhanced I/M legislative authorization and regulations. 
f. 

Quantitative milestones and reasonable further progress (RFP). 

The CO plan must contain measures which demonstrate RFP toward attainment by the applicable attainment date. Reasonable
further progress is defined in section 171(1) of the Act as such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the
relevant air pollutant as are required by Part D or may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose
of ensuring attainment of the NAAQS by the applicable date. 
EPA has reviewed the attainment demonstration and control strategy for the area (see Chapter 6 and Appendix C of the
CO plan). EPA concludes that the plan would provide for RFP but for the fact that the State legislature has not yet adopted
legislation authorizing an enhanced I/M program and California has not submitted implementing regulations for
the program. Therefore, EPA proposes to disapprove the RFP provision. Again, however, this defect could be cured
by State action to authorize, adopt, and submit an approvable enhanced I/M program. 
g. 

Adoption of mandatory control measures. 

The Act mandates State adoption of four control programs for CO areas such as the South Coast. 


(1) Enhanced Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) 


Section 187(a)(6) requires implementation of an enhanced I/M program in the nonattainment area's urbanized portions
(as defined by the Bureau of Census) with a CO design value greater than 12.7 ppm. EPA's regulations respecting this
requirement were issued on November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52950). The reader should refer to section III.D.2.c. for a detailed
discussion of the purpose and components of the enhanced I/M program. As noted, the California State Legislature
has to date failed to enact legislation that would authorize such a program. While EPA is not now required to propose
a FIP enhanced I/M measure (as discussed in section III.A.1.), the Agency has chosen to do so as part of the FIP attainment
demonstrations. 


(2) Oxygenated Fuels 


Sections 211(m) and 187(b)(3) mandate SIP provisions prohibiting the sale of gasoline during winter months containing
less than 2.7 percent oxygen by weight. Increasing the oxygen content of gasoline causes motor vehicle engines to
run with leaner overall fuel/air mixture, thereby reducing the amount of CO generated during the combustion process.

California's adopted regulations (California Wintertime Oxygenates Program for the years 1992-1995, and
Phase 2 Reformulated Gasoline regulation for the years after 1995) provide for the sale of 1.8 to 2.2 percent oxygenated
fuels. On October 30, 1992, the CARB applied for a partial waiver from the 2.7 percent level specified in the Act. 
EPA intends in a separate NPRM to propose to conditionally approve the waiver under the provisions of section 211(m)(3)(A),
which authorizes the Administrator to waive, in whole or in part, this fuel requirement if the State demonstrates
that use of oxygenated gasoline would prevent or interfere with the attainment of a NAAQS or a state or local ambient
air quality standard. 
CARB's waiver petition argues that an oxygen content above an average of 2.0 percent would interfere with attainment
of the California standards for ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter, because the higher oxygenated
fuel levels have the potential to increase emissions of NO

X

, which is a precursor to ozone and (in the South Coast) nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter.

(3) Clean-Fuel Vehicle Fleet Program 



Section 246 of the Act requires that the CO SIP for the South Coast provide for a Clean-Fuel Vehicle Fleet program by
May 15, 1994. Section 182(c)(4) places a similar requirement on the South Coast ozone SIP. The Act mandates SIP provisions
requiring the purchase of clean new vehicles, beginning in 1998, for use in centrally fueled fleets of cars and light-duty
trucks. 

On November 13, 1992, CARB submitted as a SIP revision the State's regulations mandating the availability of clean
fuels. At the same time, CARB applied for conditional approval of an opt-out from this requirement based upon a showing
that the State's Low- Emission Vehicles (LEV) and Clean Fuels programs (adopted in 1990) qualify as a substitute for
the federal clean fleet program. On November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62532), EPA approved the State's clean fuels availability
regulations and conditionally approved the opt-out request.
 





(4) Employee Commute Options Program 



Section 187(b)(2) requires SIP submission by November 15, 1992, of an Employee Commute Options (ECO) regulation
to reduce commute trips to the worksites of large employers. Section 182(d)(1)(B) mandates that the ECO SIP requirement
also applies to ``Severe'' and ``Extreme'' ozone nonattainment areas, and this same section establishes minimum
program performance levels: the rules must ``require that each employer of 100 or more persons in such area increase
average passenger occupancy per vehicle in commuting trips between home and the workplace during peak travel periods
by not less than 25 percent above the average vehicle occupancy for all such trips in the area at the time the revision
is submitted.'' 

In December 1992, EPA issued Employee Commute Options Guidance to assist states in developing approvable ECO SIP
revisions. This guidance, and the ECO requirement in the 1990 Amendments, derive in part from the SCAQMD employee
trip reduction program, Regulation XV, which was adopted on December 11, 1987, as the Country's first large-scale
ECO program. 

Regulation XV has undergone several significant revisions since that date to expand the program and address implementation
issues. The SCAQMD rule was initially submitted as a SIP revision on February 7, 1989, and CARB submitted an amended
Regulation XV on two occasions: March 31, 1991 and May 31, 1993. EPA has reviewed the amended Regulation XV for consistency
with the Act and EPA's guidance. This review is available as a Technical Support Document, ``EPA Analysis of the Approvability
of South Coast Air Quality Management District Regulation XV.'' Based on this detailed analysis, EPA proposes in
this NPRM to approve Regulation XV as meeting the requirements of sections 187(b)(2) and 182(d)(1)(B) of the Act.


While the current Regulation XV meets federal approval criteria, EPA encourages the SCAQMD to continue to evaluate
and adjust the program, if necessary, to ensure that the rule is fully and successfuly implemented. Any adjustments
to the rule must not jeopardize timely achievement of average passenger occupancy targets and emissions reductions
from the rule. 

h. 

Vehicle miles traveled (VMT) forecast and contingency measures. 

Section 187(a)(2)(A) requires the South Coast CO plan to contain a forecast of VMT for each year until attainment.
The plan must also provide for annual updates of the forecasts along with annual reports regarding the extent to which
the forecasts proved to be accurate. Finally, section 187(a)(3) requires that the plan contain specific contingency
measures to be implemented if the annual estimate of actual VMT or a subsequent VMT forecast exceeds the most recent
prior forecast of VMT or if the area fails to attain the CO NAAQS by the attainment date. These contingency measures
must be adopted and enforceable in the SIP and must take effect without further action by the State or the Administrator.


The required VMT forecasts are included in Table 3-3 and Appendix A of the plan. The forecasts require significant
update, and SCAG is now preparing and adopting such an amendment for a new Regional Mobility Plan and an air quality
plan revision scheduled for adoption later in 1994. EPA therefore proposes to approve the forecasts, but intends
to amend the VMT projections in the FIP when the new VMT numbers are adopted and submitted as a SIP revision. EPA also
proposes to approve the responsible agencies' commitments to replace the VMT projections and monitor actual VMT
levels in the future. 

The State has not yet submitted, however, fully adopted and enforceable contingency measures to meet the requirements
of section 187(a)(3). The plan includes three groups of potential controls, identified as contingency measures.
The measures, in fact, are surplus rather than contingent. The committal measures achieve reductions beyond those
needed for progress and attainment, and they are scheduled for adoption and implementation by fixed dates, which
are independent of determinations that VMT levels have been exceeded or that the plan has failed to achieve progress
milestones or attainment. Although the measures are not designed to be triggered by excess VMT levels or by a failure
to achieve scheduled progress or attainment, the measures could be approved as meeting the contingency requirement
if: (1) They are submitted in fully adopted form, and (2) the RFP and attainment deficiencies are resolved by SIP submission
of approvable enhanced I/M authorization and regulations. 

The first group of ``contingency'' measures (Table 6-4 of the plan) consists of two stationary source measures:
P-B-5, Control of Emissions from OCS Exploration, Development and Production; and P-B-6,
Control of Emissions from Petroleum Refinery Flares. Emissions reductions were not estimated for these possible
measures. Moreover, neither of the controls have yet been adopted, although the plan scheduled both for adoption
in 1992. Thus, the two measures cannot be approved. 

The second group (Table 6-5) comprises five measures. One of the measures is assigned to CARB: ARB-8, Fleet
Average Standards for Post-2003 Model Years (Passenger Cars, Light-Duty Trucks, and Medium-Duty Vehicles). The
remaining four measures were scheduled for adoption by 1992, but the State has provided no evidence that the measures
have in fact been adopted. The four measures are energy conservation programs: E-D-1b, Residential Sector;
E-C-1b, Commercial Sector; E-C-2b, Industrial Sector; and E-C-3, Local Government
Sector. 

Each of the five measures is designed to serve as contingency measures after the year 2000. As such, the measures would
be appropriate for SIP submission in the context of a CO maintenance plan. In their present form, they could not serve
to meet contingency requirements for the attainment plan, since the measures are not designed to remedy plan shortfalls
in achieving reasonable further progress before, and attainment by, the year 2000. Moreover, EPA cannot either approve
or conditionally approve the measures since the scheduled full adoption date has elapsed without evidence of such
adoption. Nevertheless, the measures are important pollution prevention initiatives with multiple benefits,
and EPA strongly encourages further progress at the State, regional, and local level to implement the measures fully.


The third group of ``contingency'' measures (Table 6-6) includes 11 transportation and indirect source measures.
The plan requests conditional approval of the measures to allow time to fully develop and adopt the controls, and the
resolution of adoption commits the SCAQMD to revise the measures in 1993 to be fully quantifiable as required by the
CAA (SCAQMD Board Resolution No. 92-36, Finding 10).

These potentially significant measures are undergoing further revision at the local and regional level, in order
to improve the design and quantification of the controls and confirm implementation responsibilities. This is particularly
the case with respect to the only two measures to which substantial emissions reductions are assigned: FC-3_Employer-Based
Trip Reduction (advances beyond existing Regulation XV), and FC-4_Additional VMT/VT Reduction Strategies.
EPA hopes to receive these revised measures as a SIP submittal and will take action to approve or conditionally approve
the controls at that time. 

The CO plan therefore lacks approvable measures that fulfill the section 187(a)(3) requirements for fully adopted
contingency measures to be triggered if estimates of actual VMT exceed the plan's forecasted levels. EPA proposes
to disapprove the plan with respect to this requirement. In separate rulemaking, EPA will propose as part of the South
Coast ozone and CO FIP/SIP a substitute contingency measure to be implemented automatically in the event actual VMT
excesses are monitored. 

i. 

Transportation control measures (TCMs) to offset growth in emissions from growth in vehicle miles traveled. 

Section 187(b)(2) of the Act requires ``Serious'' CO areas to meet a TCM requirement specified in section 182(d)(1)(A)
for ``Severe'' and ``Extreme'' ozone areas. The Act provides that all such plans must include specific and enforceable
TCMs to offset any growth in emissions from growth in VMT and numbers of vehicle trips, and to achieve reductions in
mobile source emissions as necessary in conjunction with other measures to comply with the periodic emissions reduction
and attainment requirements of the Act. EPA's preliminary interpretation of this requirement appears in the General
Preamble, 57 FR 13521-13523 and 13533-13534 (April 16, 1992). 

As mentioned above, Table 6-6 of the South Coast CO plan includes 11 transportation and indirect source ``contingency''
measures. These measures and the plan's scheduled adoption dates are as follows: 


 


FC-1, Transit Improvements (to be determined by the implementing agency) 

FC-2, HOV and Bus Lanes/Roads (to be determined by the implementing agency) 

FC-3, Employer-Based Trip Reduction (1993) 

FC-4, Additional VMT/VT Reduction Strategies (1989-2000, with an SCAQMD backstop rule adoption in 1994,
if necessary) 

FC-5, Traffic Flow Improvements (1989-2000) 

FC-6, Control Extended Idling (1993) 

FC-7, Encourage Removal of Pre-1980 Vehicles (1993) 

FC-8, Reduce Cold Start Emissions from Vehicles (1994) 

M-H-1, Environmental Review Program (1992) 

M-H-2, Trip Reduction for Schools (1993) 

M-H-4, Special Activity Centers (1993) 


 



While progress has been made in local and regional adoption and implementation of certain measures (e.g., FC-1,
FC-2, FC-4, and FC-5), none of these important measures has been fully adopted and submitted at this
time. 



Table 3-3 of the CO plan projects VMT and CO emissions for each year through the attainment year. This table shows
that CO emissions will decline each year through the year 2000, despite the predicted VMT growth. As a result, the CO
plan does not need to include TCMs to offset growth in CO emissions. 

As discussed above, the CO plan would meet the attainment demonstration and progress requirements of the Act if the
State adopts and submits an approvable enhanced I/M program. Until the attainment and RFP deficiencies are cured,
it is not possible for EPA to find that the CO plan includes specific and enforceable TCMs that are sufficient, in conjunction
with other measures, to meet the progress and attainment requirements of the Act. EPA therefore proposes to disapprove
the plan with respect to the TCM requirement. Approval of an enhanced I/M program in the future would allow EPA to change
this section 187(b)(2) disapproval to an approval. 

j. 

Fully adopted and enforceable control measures. 

The attainment demonstration relies upon SCAQMD and CARB stationary, area, and mobile controls adopted before July
1, 1990, and three additional controls: (1) CARB's Low-Emission Vehicles (LEV) and Clean Fuels Program (adopted
September 1990); (2) CARB's California Wintertime Oxygenates Program and Phase 2 Gasoline Specifications (adopted
November 1991); and (3) an Enhanced I/M Program. Except for the enhanced I/M program, all of the measures included
in the attainment modeling analysis are fully adopted and enforceable. 

The plan also includes a group of 18 supplemental measures (Tables 4-1 and 4-2). Most of these measures
have not yet been adopted in enforceable form, and the attainment demonstration does not claim credit for the potential
reductions associated with the controls. If the measures are submitted by the State in approvable form, EPA will propose
to approve them and assign them credit in the attainment demonstration. 

k. 

Implications of EPA's proposed action. 

EPA is proposing to disapprove in part the SIP revision submitted by the State of California on December 31, 1992, for
the South Coast CO nonattainment area. If finalized, this disapproval would constitute a disapproval under section
179(a)(2) of the Act (see generally 57 FR 13566-13567). As provided under section 179(a) of the Act, the State
would have up to 18 months after a final SIP disapproval to correct the deficiencies that are the subject of the disapproval
before EPA is required to impose either the highway funding sanction or the requirement to provide two-to-one new
source review offsets. If the State has not corrected its deficiency within 6 months thereafter, EPA must impose the
second sanction. Any sanction EPA imposes must remain in place until EPA determines that the State has corrected the
deficiency. 



2. Ozone Rate of Progress Plan 



a. 

Statutory provisions and General Preamble requirements. 

The requirements for the 15 percent rate-of-progress plans appear in section 182(b)(1) of the Act, which describes
how ozone nonattainment areas must achieve an actual VOC reduction of at least 15 percent during the first 6 years after
enactment of the 1990 CAA Amendments (i.e., up to November 15, 1996). The General Preamble provides an overview of
EPA's preliminary policy interpretation of this statutory requirement (see 57 FR 13507-13510, April 16, 1992).
EPA has issued detailed guidance documents on the plan requirements, including: Guidance on the Adjusted Base Year
Emissions Inventory and the 1996 Target for the 15 Percent Rate-of-Progress Plans (EPA-452/R-92-005),
and Guidance for Growth Factors, Projections, and Control Strategies for the 15 Percent Rate-of-Progress Plans
(EPA-452/R-93-002). 

The CAA requires that the 15 percent rate-of-progress plan be submitted by November 15, 1993. The plan must show an
actual reduction in typical ozone season weekday VOC emissions of at least 15 percent for the period 1990-1996.
 The reduction must be calculated from the 1990 baseline of actual emissions, adjusted in accordance with section
182(b)(1)(B), and must account for any net growth in emissions. Section 182(b)(1)(D) provides that reductions from
the federal motor vehicle control program (FMVCP) as promulgated by January 1, 1990, or from the federal 9.0 Reid Vapor
Pressure (RVP) gasoline regulation may not count toward meeting the 15 percent reduction target. Also excluded from
credit are ``fix-ups'' to VOC RACT rules or I/M programs to comply with prior statutory and regulatory requirements.

 Description of plan.

 
On November 12, 1993, the SCAQMD adopted its Rate-of-Progress 
Plan, following reasonable notice and public hearing. CARB 
submitted the Rate-of-Progress plan as a proposed SIP revision on 
November 15, 1993. The submitted plan shows a 1990 base year 
emissions inventory of 1683 tons per day of reactive organic 
compounds (ROC), an adjusted 1990 inventory of 1450 tons per day 
(after subtracting FMVCP and RVP reductions of 233), resulting in 
a 1996 target emissions reductions of 217.5 tons per day. After 
credit for fully adopted State and local measures and taking into 
account growth in emissions through 1996, the plan achieves almost 
all of the reductions needed to meet the target. The plan 
addresses the small remaining shortfall by commitments to adopt 9 
SCAQMD measures in 1994, one SCAQMD measure in 1995, and one CARB 
measure: the enhanced I/M program. Even after applying an 80 
percent rule effectiveness discount (in accordance with EPA's 
policy), the proposed SCAMQD measures alone would eliminate the 
shortfall, without the need to count credits assigned to the 
enhanced I/M program. 
Under section 110(k)(4) of the Act, EPA has the authority to 
conditionally approve the South Coast plan based upon the State's 
commitment to adopt these measures. However, EPA's current policy 
does not allow approval of rate-of-progress plans if they depend 
upon commitments to adopt measures in order to meet the 15 percent 
reduction requirement. See Memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, EPA 
Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, ``Guidance on 
Issues Related to 15 Percent Rate-of-Progress Plans,'' August 23, 
1993. As a result, EPA intends not to take action to approve the 
South Coast Rate-of-Progress Plan at this time. 
c.

 Conditional approval of commitments.

 
As discussed above, EPA policy does not allow approval of 15 
Percent Rate-of-Progress Plans based on committal measures. In 
accordance with this policy, EPA does not propose to assign credit 
to the SCAQMD committal measures and approve the progress plan 
until all measures are submitted in fully enforceable form. 
However, commitments that strengthen the existing SIP can be 
approved, although without assignment of emission reduction credit. 
EPA proposes to conditionally approve the SCAQMD commitments 
to adopt the measures listed below, as strengthening the SIP. EPA 
has evaluated the commitments to adopt measures and finds that 
those commitments to adopt rules before 1996 are eligible for 
conditional approval under section 110(k)(4). EPA cannot propose 
to conditionally approve commitments to adopt measures with 1996 or 
later adoption dates because the SCAQMD's commitment may extend 
beyond one year from the date of the final conditional approval 
action (see pages 2-4 and 6-2 of the plan, and the SCAQMD 
Resolution of Adoption). 
(1) Commitments to adopt measures to contribute emission 
reductions in the period 1990-1996. 
The SCAQMD has committed to adopt fully enforceably controls 
in 1994 for the following measures: 




P-B-7, Further Control of Emissions from Bulk Terminals;
P-C-1, Further Emission Reductions from Rubber Products 
Manufacturing; 
A-B-2, Control of Emissions from Gasoline Transfer: Phase II 
Improvements; 
A-B-3, Control of Emissions from Pleasure Boat Fueling 
Operations; 
A-B-5, Further Control of Emissions from Gasoline Dispensing 
Facilities; 
A-B-6, Control of Emissions from Utility Engine Refueling 
Operations; 
A-B-9, Control of Emissions from Active Draining of Liquid 
Products; 
A-C-2, Control of Emissions from Commercial Charbroiling;
A-C-4, Control of Emissions from Deep-Fat Frying.




The SCAQMD committal measure scheduled for adoption in 1995 is A-F-1, Installation of Best Available
Retrofit Control Technology on 
Miscellaneous Sources. All of the measures are listed in Table 4-1 
of the plan, along with the identification of the date for full 
implementation, the implementing agency, and the 1996 ROC emissions 
reductions with and without the 80 percent rule effectiveness 
discount. Appendix A of the plan provides further details on each 
of the measures, including descriptions of the regulatory history, 
the proposed method of control, and the calculation of emissions 
reductions and cost effectiveness.

ARB-17, Emission Standards for Marine Vessels (1994).



In section III of this NPRM, EPA proposes to promulgate as 
part of the FIP attainment demonstration federal measures 
comparable to some of these SCAQMD and CARB committal measures. If 
any of the State or local committal measures for these categories 
are adopted and submitted as a SIP revision and achieve emission 
reductions comparable to the FIP controls, EPA will approve the SIP 
rules and modify the FIP rules accordingly. d. Implications of 
EPA's Proposed Actions.

If EPA issues final conditional approval of the SCAQMD 
commitments, the SCAQMD must fulfill the commitments to adopt the 
rules by the date specified in the plan and shown above, and the 
State must submit these rules to EPA. If the SCAQMD fails to adopt 
or CARB fails to submit any of the rules to EPA within this time 
frame, this approval will become a disapproval following EPA 
written notification to the State. 
If the rules are submitted to EPA within the applicable time 
frame, the SCAQMD commitments will remain a part of the SIP until 
EPA takes final action approving or disapproving the new submittal. 
If EPA disapproves the submittal, the measures on which the 
conditional approval was based will also be disapproved at that 
time. If EPA approves the submittal, those newly approved rules 
will become a part of the SIP and will modify or replace the 
measures on which the conditional approval is based. As discussed 
above, EPA's proposed conditional approval of the committal 
measures does not mean that the State has satisfied the initial 15 
Percent Rate-of-Progress plan requirements of section 182(b)(1). 
EPA's current policy would not allow such approval until all 
necessary measures are submitted in fully adopted and enforceable 
form. 
EPA's final conditional approval of the SCAQMD commitments to 
adopt measures to achieve minimum progress requirements for the 
1990-2000 period will establish a federally enforceably obligation 
on the part of the SCAQMD to adopt these measures in fully 
enforceable form according to the committed schedule. It is 
essential not only that SCAQMD but also CARB and all other 
responsible agencies follow through on their commitments to meet 
the Act's near-term progress requirements through expeditious 
adoption of enforceable regulations to achieve the necessary 
creditable reductions. 


III. California FIP 


A. Basis for the FIP Actions in Applicable Law and EPA Policies 


1. FIP Obligation 


a.

 Introduction.

 
In 1988, in the wake of lawsuits and ensuing court orders, EPA 
disapproved the 1982 South Coast ozone and CO plans and the 
Sacramento and Ventura ozone plans on the ground that, among other 
things, they failed to demonstrate attainment of the NAAQS by the 
December 1987 statutory attainment date, as required by Section 
172(a) of the Act. See 53 FR 1780 (January 22, 1988). In March 
1989, EPA entered into a settlement agreement with the South Coast 
plaintiffs which obligated EPA to promulgate federal plans for the 
South Coast in final form by February 1991. EPA issued a proposed 
FIP in September 1990. 
For Sacramento, EPA also negotiated settlement agreements 
containing schedules by which EPA would propose and promulgate a 
federal plan. Pursuant to these schedules, EPA published Advance 
Notices of Proposed Rulemakings (ANPRMs) on April 5, 1990 (55 FR 
12669) and May 27, 1992 (57 FR 22194). 
For Ventura, EPA similarly entered into settlements setting a 
schedule, and published an NPRM on January 17, 1991. 
But as time progressed, it became increasingly clear that the 
South Coast, Sacramento, and Ventura_all areas with difficult 
air pollution problems_could not possibly meet the ambitious 
requirements of the 1977 CAA Amendments without severe economic 
dislocation. 
(1) Passage of 1990 amendments. 
On November 15, 1990, Congress enacted the Clean Air Act 
Amendments of 1990. Pub. L. No. 101-549, 104 Stat. 2422-2423. 
Among other things, Congress completely revised the Part D 
nonattainment provisions of the Act. In so doing Congress repealed 
the provisions of Section 172 that had required SIPs for the South 
Coast, Ventura, and Sacramento to demonstrate attainment by 
December 31, 1987. Those provisions had formed the basis for EPA's 
disapprovals of the California SIP submissions for those areas, and 
thus the 1990 Amendments removed the statutory justification for 
those disapprovals. Congress replaced the provisions of section 
172 with a detailed scheme of new requirements and extended 
deadlines specifically applicable to ozone and CO nonattainment 
SIPs. Sections 171-193, 42 U.S.C. 7501-7515. 
In particular, the 1990 Amendments established a graduated 
series of requirements for different areas, depending on the 
severity of the air quality problem in each. Congress established 
five classifications of ozone nonattainment areas based on the 
level of each area's ozone problem_ranging from ``Marginal'' to 
``Extreme''_and two classifications of CO nonattainment areas. 
The Amendments also set new, extended deadlines for the attainment 
of the primary NAAQS for each classification. Sections 181(a)(1) 
and 186(a)(1). 
Consistent with the new Amendments, EPA issued a regulation 
classifying Sacramento as a ``Serious'' area for ozone nonattainment; 
under the statute, ``Serious'' areas must attain the ozone standard 
as expeditiously as practicable but no later than November 15, 
1999. 40 C.F.R. 81.305 (1992); CAA section 181(a). Ventura is 
classified as a ``Severe'' area for ozone, and must attain as 
expeditiously as practicable, but no later than November 15, 2005. 
The South Coast is classified as the only ``Extreme'' area for ozone, 
and must demonstrate attainment as expeditiously as practicable but 
no later than November 15, 2010. For carbon monoxide, the South 
Coast is classified as a ``Serious'' area, and must demonstrate 
attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than 
December 31, 2000.

In the 1990 Amendments Congress also imposed specific and 
increasingly rigorous requirements for Part D SIPs, depending on 
the area's nonattainment classification, with new deadlines, 
ranging from immediately to six years from enactment, for 
submitting various components of the plans to EPA. Sections 181, 
182, 186, and 187. In addition, the 1990 Amendments amended 
Section 110(c)(l), the principal provision governing EPA's FIP 
obligation. 
EPA concluded that these revisions, directing States to 
develop SIPs meeting new requirements and deadlines, and to submit 
SIPs to EPA on specific schedules, demonstrated that EPA's 
obligation to promulgate FIPs would arise only upon future 
disapprovals of those newly submitted SIPs. EPA appealed to the 
courts to determine whether the Amendments had relieved the Agency 
of its pre-existing FIP obligations. 
In Coalition for Clean Air, 971 F.2d 219 (9th Cir. 1992), a 
divided panel of the Ninth Circuit held that although Section 
110(c)(l) had been revised by the 1990 Amendments, the language of 
section 110(c)(l)(B), which requires EPA to promulgate a FIP within 
two years after it ``disapproves'' a SIP, applies to pre-Amendment 
disapprovals. Thus, the court ruled that new section 110(c)(l)(B) 
operates retroactively to retain EPA's preexisting FIP obligation, 
even though the statutory provisions forming the basis for that 
obligation have been repealed. In reaching this conclusion, the 
court declined to indicate whether the requirements of the old law 
or the 1990 Amendments would govern the contents of this FIP. 
The Court acknowledged that ``the proper contents of FIPs for 
the South Coast are not before us,'' and that ``we need not decide 
whether EPA would be required to meet any additional requirement 
imposed by the 1990 Amendments in promulgating FIPs for the South 
Coast,'' 971 F.2d at 225. 
EPA sought, and was denied, a writ of certiorari (113 S.Ct. 
1361 (1993)). 
(2) Applicable law. Thus, although the Ninth Circuit found that the passage of the 
Amendments did not release EPA from a FIP obligation arising from 
a pre-Amendment disapproval, it did not decide whether any 
requirement of the 1990 Amendments applies to this continuing 
obligation. In the absence of any guidance from the Court, this 
task falls to EPA. 
The threshold question, then, is what requirements govern the 
content of a FIP which will take effect after enactment of the 
Clean Air Act Amendments, but which is based on a plan failure and 
disapproval arising from pre-Amendment Clean Air Act provisions 
which have since been repealed. The greatly altered legal regime 
established by the 1990 Amendments creates a discontinuity between 
the plan contents required under the new and old acts. Thus, EPA is 
faced with a choice as to how to design the FIP. 
(3) New law applies. It is well settled that ``[c]ourts must apply new laws to 
pending cases, unless such application would result in manifest 
injustice or be contrary to statutory direction or legislative 
history.''

Ford, 

737 F.2d 1508 (9th Cir. 1984). 


See Bradley 

v. 

School Bd. of Richmond,

California 
Cartage Co. 

v. 

United States, 

802 F.2d 353, 357 (9th Cir. 1986). 
In accordance with the principle embodied in these cases, EPA 
believes that the 1990 Amendments should be applicable to the FIPs 
arising from EPA's pre-Amendment disapprovals. But an analysis of 
the new Act's provisions reveals that the new Act does not require 
this FIP to include each and every pollution control program 
required of States under the Amendments. 
The 1990 Amendments make explicit a principle that was 
implicit in the preceding Act_that a FIP corrects or fills a 
void in a deficient state plan. The amended Act defines a FIP as 
a plan to fill a gap or ``correct all or a portion of an 

inadequacy 


in a State implementation plan.'' 42 U.S.C. 7602(y) (Supp. II. 
1990) (emphasis added). The California SIPs at issue here were 
rejected by EPA in 1988 because they were ``inadequa[te]'' to 
demonstrate attainment under the pre-Amendment deadlines, and thus 
EPA's obligation under the pre-1990 Act was to promulgate a FIP in 
order to correct that ``inadequacy.'' Thus EPA's FIP obligation is 
to fulfill the requirement to demonstrate attainment. Stated 
differently, what the Ninth Circuit's ruling preserved was EPA's 
existing FIP obligation to correct the state plan's failure to 
provide for attainment. That is the inadequacy that EPA must 
address in this FIP, not any failure that might have arisen under 
any of the numerous requirements of the new law. 
Of course, if the State fails to meet any of the new Act's 
requirements, that failure would trigger a new FIP obligation in 
the future, but that would be an entirely different obligation, not 
the one on which the district court orders under the old Act were 
premised. And even as to such obligations, the Administrator is 
not required to promulgate a federal plan until two years after she 
disapproves a deficient state plan or finds that the state has 
failed to submit a required plan element. Section 110(c)(l). 
With respect to new requirements imposed by the 1990 
Amendments, there has either been no state failure, or the 24-month 
clock for EPA to promulgate a FIP has not yet run. When a state 
failure giving rise to a new FIP obligation occurs, EPA will 
address that obligation in a separate FIP NPRM. For example, FIPs 
addressing state failures to satisfy the VOC RACT catch-up 
requirement of the new Amendments may become due late in 1994 and 
in 1995. In the absence of approvable state measures correcting 
for these deficiencies, EPA will issue separate FIPs to rectify 
them. 
Given EPA's position as to the effect of the new Amendments, 
one might argue that the logical extension is that since the state 
has not yet failed to adopt an attainment demonstration under new 
section 182(c)(2)(A), no attainment demonstration is due. But 
since the Ninth Circuit conclusively decided that the obligation to 
promulgate an attainment demonstration survived, EPA must prepare 
one under the new Act.

For policy as well as legal reasons, this resolution makes 
sense, and it avoids extreme results. On the one hand, it would be 
unhelpful for EPA to design the FIP to meet the old law 
requirements that have since been repealed. And for EPA to impose 
in 1995 a regulatory regime that became extinct in 1990 would 
surely not serve Congressional intent or constitute sound 
regulatory policy. On the other hand, it would equally disserve 
Congressional intent to compel these FIPs, which are not based on 
state failures to meet any requirements of the new Act, to meet all 
those requirements and to cure failures that were not part of the 
obligation that the Court orders preserved. 
In the 

Coalition 

case, the Ninth Circuit Court itself seemed 
to imply that EPA's FIP need not address new requirements when it 
noted that the state could ``propose these new measures as revisions 
to the FIP under the timetables provided in the 1990 Amendments 
just as the state would be required to do if a FIP had been in 
effect when those Amendments were adopted''. 

Coalition for Clean 
Air, 

971 F.2d at 226. 
Indeed, if the FIP were to try to meet all the requirements of 
the new Act, it would have to anticipate and cure new failures 
before they had arisen under the new Act, and before the State has 
had an opportunity to develop and submit plans to comply with the 
new Act. This would violate the express congressional 
determination that ``air pollution prevention'' and ``air pollution 
control at its source is the primary responsibility of States and 
local governments.'' Section 101(a)(3). 
Thus, EPA has concluded that the FIPs must cure the original 
failure to demonstrate attainment. But in these FIPs the Agency 
need not assume additional obligations to meet new requirements as 
to which no state delinquency has yet been established under the 
new Act, or as to which EPA's FIP obligation has not yet matured. 
b. The FIPs Must Demonstrate Attainment_(1) What Attainment Deadline Governs? 
(a) 

Background. 

The Ninth Circuit last addressed the issue of what attainment 
deadline applied to a pre-Amendment FIP obligation in 

Delaney 

v. 


EPA, 

898 F.2d 687 (9th Cir. 1990). But at that time the attainment 
deadline in the then extant Clean Air Act_December 31, 1987_
had passed, and Congress had not yet extended it. 
In a March 1990 opinion, prior to the passage of the Clean Air 
Act Amendments, the Ninth Circuit vacated EPA's approval of two 
Arizona carbon monoxide SIPs, and ordered EPA to promulgate FIPs 
consistent with that court's opinion. Interpreting EPA's statutory 
requirement to develop a FIP in light of the elapsed statutory 
attainment date of December 31, 1987, the Court concluded that ``the 
national ambient air quality standards must be attained as soon as 
possible with every available control measure * * *.'' 898 F.2d at 
691. The Court relied upon EPA guidance, subsequently revoked, for 
the part of its formulation requiring ``all possible measures'' or 
``every available measure.'' 55 FR 36505 (September 5, 1990). 
The Court, in formulating this attainment test, made plain 
that, while it understood that a Congressional re-determination of 
the attainment deadlines was in the works, the Court was 
constrained until Congress acted. Thus, at the time the 

Delaney

 
Court and EPA last struggled to define an appropriate FIP 
attainment deadline, they confronted not only a lapsed attainment 
deadline, but Congressional silence as to an appropriate 
replacement. 
Quoting from its opinion in 

Abramowitz 

v. 

EPA, 

832 F.2d 1071, 
1079 (9th Cir. 1987), the 

Delaney

 Court stated: ``We are informed 
by counsel for both sides of their expectation that Congress will 
extend the deadline once again in the near 
future, but we must apply the law as it now stands, not as it may become. * * * Until the Clean Air Act is
further considered * * * the 
Agency must `give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent 
of Congress.' We, and the EPA, are bound by the statutory 
scheme until Congress alters that scheme.'' 898 F.2d at 691. 
(b) 

Current law. 

Now, however, Congress has indeed ``alter[ed] that scheme'', the 
new law applies, and EPA, in formulating its FIPs, has the benefit 
of Congressional determination of appropriate attainment dates. 
With the passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments, Congress has 
made specific attainment deadline determinations with respect to 
each type of area. As with other aspects of the new law, EPA 
believes that the attainment dates of the new law apply. Indeed, 
even if it were not clear that the new attainment dates apply, it 
is now impossible to design FIPs to meet the 1987 attainment date 
that governed the original state plans, and there is a clear 
expression of Congressional intent as to substitute attainment 
deadlines. 
As noted above, under the new Act, the ozone attainment date 
must be ``as expeditiously as practicable but not later than'' 
November 15, 1999 for Sacramento; November 15, 2005 for Ventura; 
and November 15, 2010 for the South Coast. Section 181(a). The 
carbon monoxide attainment date for the South Coast must be ``as 
expeditiously as practicable but not later than'' December 31, 2000. 
(2) These FIPs need not address new requirements other than the 
requirement to demonstrate attainment. As shown above, EPA's obligation to design a FIP arose from 
state failures to demonstrate attainment under the old Clean Air 
Act. The Amendments imposed for the first time additional, 
different requirements that were not in effect when EPA disapproved 
the state plans giving rise to its FIP obligation, and which took 
effect after EPA's FIP obligation matured. Thus California was 
given no opportunity to meet these requirements in its previous 
SIPs, and any failure to meet these requirements would be a new 
delinquency that was not the subject of EPA's original FIP 
obligation. EPA therefore has concluded that the FIPs need not 
address these requirements unless and until California has failed 
to satisfy them and the time for EPA to promulgate a replacement 
FIP under the new Act has elapsed.

For example, the Amendments contain new and highly specific 
targets for Reasonable Further Progress. Section 182(b)(l) in the 
Amendments requires plans under the Act to provide for VOC 
emissions reductions of at least 15 percent by 1996, and section 
182(c)(2)(B) requires an additional 9 percent emissions reduction 
every three years after 1996. Each of these sections contains 
detailed instructions for calculating the creditability of those 
reductions. Sections 182(b)(1) and 182(c)(2). 

While EPA does not believe that these progress requirements 
are applicable to its FIP obligation, EPA has concluded that it is 
wise policy to achieve some degree of progress during the time 
preceding the attainment dates. As a result, the FIPs do establish 
incremental reduction targets for the purpose of ensuring 
attainment by the applicable attainment date. 

At this time, the State of California has become delinquent in 
meeting a few requirements in the new Act, thereby giving rise to 
new EPA FIPs obligations under the new Act's deadlines. FIPs to 
address these deficiencies, which primarily involve submissions of 
RACT catch-ups and emission statements, are not yet due. EPA will 
address these FIPs in separate rulemakings as they become due. 

c. FIPs may use new provisions providing additional flexibility. 
Since EPA has concluded that the new law applies to its FIP 
obligation, EPA may avail itself of new provisions of the law that 
furnish additional flexibility in designing implementation plans. 

The Ninth Circuit in its opinion recognized that EPA could 
take advantage of increased flexibility in the new Act. For example, 
the Court noted that EPA now has authority under new section 
182(e)(5) to approve some parts of the South Coast ozone SIP that 
it had disapproved in 1988. 

Coalition for Clean Air,

 971 F. 2d at 
226. Similarly, as explained below, EPA believes it may invoke 
section 182(e)(5) in designing its FIP to obtain greater 
flexibility to anticipate new control techniques or the improvement 
of existing techniques. To the extent that EPA invokes such 
discretionary provisions of the new Act, it will satisfy any new 
prerequisites prescribed in those sections. For example, as 
explained below, in order for EPA's FIP to obtain the benefit of 
the latitude granted by section 182(e)(5) to rely on measures 
anticipating improvements in technology, the FIP must address 
progress requirements of that section which otherwise would have 
been inapplicable. 

As described in more detail below, EPA in its FIPs is also 
applying the new law's classifications for each ozone nonattainment 
area, and, for Sacramento, the provision for ``bumping'' up an area 
to a new classification. As with section 182(e)(5), where EPA 
relies on a new provision for added flexibility, it intends to 
fulfill any conditions imposed on the exercise of that authority. 

EPA recognizes that its FIPs must weave a complicated path 
between the old and new laws, and that its FIP obligation is 
necessarily a hybrid of old and new. This complexity is 
unavoidable, however, because of the anomalous nature of the task 
EPA faces: EPA must cure a failure under an old Act, since 
repealed, but administer the cure under new law.

d. 

Maintenance demonstration for the south coast. 

EPA's FIP obligations for the South Coast, Sacramento, and Ventura arose from disapprovals of their SIPs solely on
the ground of their failure to demonstrate attainment by 1987 or any fixed near-term date. See 53 FR 1280-1281
(January 22, 1988) (South Coast); 53 FR 39087-39088 (October 5, 1988) (Ventura); 53 FR 48535-48536 (Dec. 1,
1988) (Sacramento). The settlement agreements for Ventura and Sacramento describe EPA's FIP obligation solely
in 
terms of promulgating a plan for attainment. The South Coast settlement agreement refers to a plan for attainment
and maintenance. Thus, with respect to the South Coast, EPA must determine what requirements apply to maintenance.


As noted above, EPA is applying the new law to its FIP obligation. The 1990 Amendments changed the law with respect to
maintenance demonstrations. Under the pre-Amendment Clean Air Act, sections 172(a)(1) and 110(a)(2)(b) required
plans to include measures to ``insure attainment and

 maintenance

''. (emphasis added) But the 1990 Amendments revised both the general planning and ozone and CO specific planning
provisions to delete the requirement for 
a maintenance demonstration to be submitted simultaneously with an 
attainment demonstration. 

The Amendments revised section 110(a)(2) to delete any reference to a maintenance demonstration. When we look to
Part D for requirements applicable to areas classified ``Serious'' and above for ozone, and ``Moderate'' (with a
design value greater than 12.7ppm) and above for CO, we find that section 172(c)(1), the closest analog to old section
172(a)(1), also drops any mention of planning for maintenance. Sections 182(c)(2)(A) and 187(a)(7) of 
the new Amendments, which set forth the specific requirements for 
ozone and CO nonattainment areas, respectively, to provide for 
attainment, similarly makes no mention of any maintenance 
requirement.






Rather, the requirement for nonattainment areas to provide for 
maintenance in the amended Act is now found in new section 
107(d)(3)(E)(iv) and section 175A. These sections provide that 
maintenance plans must be submitted when an area requests 
redesignation to attainment. The combination of the amendments to 
section 172 and the addition of these new maintenance plan 
provisions indicates that the requirement for a maintenance plan 
arises only much later, when it must accompany a request for 
redesignation. 

This reflects a Congressional determination to focus on 
attainment, and to compel maintenance plans only when an area has 
progressed to the point when it has already attained and is ready 
to demonstrate attainment. This legal regime and policy has thus 
superseded any obligation arising out of old section 172(a). 
EPA's existing regulation, promulgated under the 
aforementioned pre-Amendment maintenance provisions, requires SIPs 
to provide for maintenance for 20 years, or for 10 years upon the 
making of an appropriate finding. Section 193 of the 1990 
Amendments, the ``General Savings Clause'', provides in pertinent 
part that each regulation shall remain in effect except to the 
extent ``otherwise provided under this Act, or inconsistent with any 
provision in effect. * * *'' 

As demonstrated above, the changes to section 172 and the new 
requirements of section 175A and related provisions deleted from 
the Act any requirement to provide for maintenance prior to a 
request for redesignation. The new Act thus establishes a whole 
new regime for demonstrating attainment and maintenance, the timing 
and requirements of which are inconsistent with the old law. Under 
the Amendments, attainment plans no longer must provide ``up front'' 
a plan for maintenance. And when the Act does require submission of 
maintenance plans (at the time of a redesignation request), such 
plan need demonstrate maintenance for only ten years instead of 
twenty. 

Although EPA has not yet accomplished the formal rescission of 
its pre-1990 regulations on maintenance, we consider the rules 
nullified by operation of Section 193, and therefore no longer 
applicable. EPA will propose in separate rulemaking to rescind 
these national regulations, which appear at 40 CFR part 51 subpart 
D_Maintenance of National Standards. EPA may or may not 
promulgate a replacement for the regulations. 



2. Other Issues Relating to EPA's Authority in Issuing a FIP 



a. 

Comprehensive FIP authorities under the clean air act.

 When forced by a state planning delinquency to promulgate a FIP, EPA has wide-ranging authority under section 110(c)
to fill the gaps left by the state failure. EPA's authority to prescribe FIP measures is of three types. First, EPA may
promulgate any measure which it is expressly permitted to issue under any 
circumstances pursuant to pre-existing independent statutory authority_for example, explicit provisions of
Title II. That is, EPA may promulgate any measure which it has authority to issue in a non-FIP context, without reliance
on section 110(c). Second, EPA may invoke Section 110(c)'s general FIP authority, and act to cure a planning inadequacy
in any way not clearly prohibited by statute. Third, under section 110(c), the Courts have held that EPA may exercise
all authority that the State may exercise under the Act. 

The second type of authority, EPA's general authority under 
section 110(c), is essentially remedial, and EPA has broad power 
under that section to cure a defective state plan. Thus, in 
promulgating a FIP, EPA may exercise its own, independent 
regulatory authority under the Act in any way not clearly 
prohibited by an explicit provision of the Act. When EPA 
promulgates a FIP, courts have not required explicit authority for 
specific measures: ``We are inclined to construe Congress' broad 
grant of power to the EPA as including all enforcement devices 
reasonably necessary to the achievement and maintenance of the 
goals established by the legislation.''

to 
regulate pollution carries with it the power to do so in a manner 
reasonably calculated to reach that end.'' 

Id.

 at 155. 

In addition, when a State's failure to discharge the primary 
responsibility to protect its air quality compels EPA to assume 
this task, the powers of the defaulting State accrue to EPA. As 
the Ninth Circuit recently held, when EPA acts in place of the 
State pursuant to a FIP under section 110(c), EPA ```stands in the 
shoes of the defaulting State, and all of the rights and duties 
that would otherwise fall to the State accrue instead to EPA.''' 


Central Arizona Water Conservation District 

v. 

EPA, 

990 F.2d 1531, 
at 1541 9th Cir. 1993). The First Circuit, in an early FIP case, 
agreed: 




The Administrator must promulgate promptly regulations setting 
forth `an implementation plan for a State should the State 
itself fail to propose a satisfactory one.' The statutory 
scheme would be unworkable were it read as giving to EPA when 
promulgating an implementation plan for a State, less than 
those necessary measures allowed by Congress to a State to 
accomplish federal clean air goals. We do not adopt any such 
crippling interpretation. 






South Terminal Corp. 

v. 

EPA, supra 

at 668. 



b. 

EPA authority to charge fees. 

State Implementation Plans for nonattainment areas are clearly authorized to include emission fees as economic
incentives to reduce pollutants. Sections 110(a)(2)(A) (relating to SIPs generally) and 172(c)(6) broadly authorize
SIPs to meet the Act's 
requirements through any ``control measures, means, or 
techniques * * * necessary or appropriate'', including ``economic 
incentives such as fees * * *'' 

EPA interprets the FIP provisions to authorize fees as well, 
by virtue of both the case law that grants FIPs much the same scope 
as SIPs, and by the provisions of section 302(y), which defines a 
FIP to include_




Enforceable emission limitations or other control 
measures, means or techniques (including economic 
incentives, such as marketable permits or auctions of 
emissions allowances). 




EPA interprets this phrase, including the parenthetical reference 
to economic incentives, as providing authority to impose a broad 
range of economic incentives, including fees, even if not 
specifically listed in the provision. Thus, EPA takes the position 
that a FIP includes authority to impose fees concerning ozone 
generating emissions or other activities. 



c. 

Restrictions on EPA's authority regarding fees.

 As a legal matter, EPA's authority under section 110(c) and 302(y) to impose fees is limited only to the extent that
the fees must be enforceable, and must provide an incentive that may result in a reduction in ozone generating emissions
or other activities. As a practical matter, because only quantifiable emissions 
reductions may be credited in the attainment demonstration, EPA may limit the types or amounts of fees imposed to those
that assure quantifiable emissions reductions.

<TEXT>
 

The Clean Air Act includes no provision directing that FIP fees collected by EPA remain at EPA's disposal; as a result,
in general, EPA must deposit any FIP fees it collects in the Treasury, under 31 U.S.C. 3302(b) (the Miscellaneous Receipts
Act). The prohibition against retaining fees applies as well against directing how those fees are spent. For example,
EPA could (by itself or through a contractor, described below) establish an I/M program and charge fees for conducting
the inspection, but the Miscellaneous Receipts Act precludes EPA from rebating those fees to car owners who failed
the inspection and elected to scrap their vehicles. 
Under certain circumstances, fees relating to services or products provided by a contractor may be retained by that
contractor to defray its costs. 

See

 61 Comp. Gen. 285 (1982) (contractor may charge and retain fees to offset costs of providing public microfilm copies
of Federal Election Commission reports). 
d. 

Land use. 

Section 131 of the Act states: ``Nothing in this Act constitutes an infringement on the existing authority of counties
and cities to plan or control land use, and nothing in this Act provides or transfers authority over such land use.''
This language merely preserves in general terms the existing authority of counties and cities to plan or control land
use. However, this language could be interpreted as a constraint on EPA's authority under section 110(c). This could
happen if, for example, the FIP proposes to regulate certain air emissions, which indirectly has the effect of narrowing
or restricting a district's or locality's zoning or land use planning choices. However, any FIP actions taken by EPA
would be for the purpose of regulating air emissions, not local land use or zoning requirements that are unrelated
to air quality. As such, they would not infringe on the authority of local governments to control land use; rather they,
at best, would restrain the ability of certain entities to engage in activities that cause certain air quality problems.
This interpretation is confirmed by the House Conference Committee Report which states: 



Depending on the nature of the air pollution problem in a State and the control options available to the State, the measures
required [to attain the NAAQS] may or may not include measures involving land use requirements. New section [131]
clarifies that if land use requirements are necessary to meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act, nothing in the
Act should be construed to affect State laws regarding the appropriate entities to adopt and implement such land use
requirements * * * [nor to authorize] air pollution control agencies to override individual project-specific
land use decisions made by a city or county.



See H.R. Re. No. 490, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 401 (1990) (analyzing section 706 of H.R. 3030, which added section 131 [mistakenly
identified as section 130]). 


e. 

Parking management. 

FIP fees imposed with respect to parking management are subject to additional limitations under section 110(c)(2)(B)
and (D)_such a fee is not permissible if it constitutes a ``parking surcharge''. A parking surcharge is defined to
include_



Any tax, surcharge, fee, or other charge on parking spaces, or any other area used for the temporary storage of motor
vehicles. 



This provision effectively eliminates a variety of parking management fees, such as surcharges designed to increase
parking costs. Several such measures were included in the 1973 FIP setting forth transportation control plans for
several areas in California, 38 FR 31232, 31236-31237, 31247-31248 (Nov. 12, 1973), but the parking measures
were withdrawn when a provision to preclude them was included in the Energy Emergency Act of 1973, 39 FR 1848 (Jan. 15,
1974). (Although the Energy Emergency Act of 1973 ultimately was not enacted, 110(c)(2) was enacted as part of the
Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act, June 22, 1974, Pub.L. 93-310, S 4, 88 Stat. 256.) 
f. 

Authority to order the state to implement specific measures requiring the state to legislate or expend money. 

EPA's authority to promulgate measures in a FIP which require the State to enact legislation or expend state funds
may be somewhat limited under prior case law. In general, EPA may require the State to implement FIP measures, including
requirements for legislation and expenditure of funds, if the measures affect the pollution-creating activities
of the State. However, in 

Brown 

v. 

EPA, 

521 F.2d 827 (9th Cir. 1975), 

vacated on other grounds, 

431 U.S. 99 (1977) (

Brown I

''), the court held that Section 113 of the Clean Air Act did not provide statutory authority for EPA to bring an enforcement
action against the state (or other municipal authority) for failing to implement a motor vehicle inspection and maintenance
program. The court reasoned that the Act authorized federal enforcement if the State did not implement regulations
to control its own pollution creating activities, ``but not against a state that chooses not to govern polluters as
the Administrator directs.'' 

Id.

 at 832. In a subsequent decision, the court rejected EPA's argument that ownership of the roads and highways made the
State responsible for the pollution created from their use. 

Brown 

v. 

EPA, 

566 F.2d 665 (9th Cir. 1977), 

vacated on other grounds,

 431 U.S. 99 (1977). 
The same court, however, held in 

City of Santa Rosa 

v. 

EPA,

 534 F.2d 150 (9th Cir. 1976), that the EPA may require gas rationing under its FIP authority. The court found that the
Administrator of EPA has authority to limit gas delivery to retail outlets and may require the citizens of the State
to curtail their gas usage. The FIP measure in 

City of Santa Rosa 

did not require the State to implement the gas rationing scheme, and the court distinguished 

Brown 

because the petitioners had challenged the effect of gas rationing, not EPA's authority to order rationing. 

Id. 

at 155. 
The 

Brown 

holding was similarly distinguished and limited by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in 

United States 

v. 

Ohio Department of Highway Safety, 

635 F.2d 1195 (6th Cir. 1980). The court upheld EPA's enforcement against the State under Section 113 of the Act for
registering motor vehicles which did not pass an inspection and maintenance program promulgated by EPA. The court
held that the State was interfering with EPA's implementation of a measure that had been promulgated under its federal
authority. See also 

Pennsylvania 

v. 

EPA, 

500 F.2d 246 (3d Cir. 1974). 
The court in 

Brown 

did not reach constitutional issues raised under the commerce clause. It is unclear, but unlikely, that requiring
the State to implement FIP measures which mandate legislation and expenditure of funds would be struck down under
the commerce clause. See 

Garcia 

v. 

San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 

469 U.S. 528 (1985) (holding that the federal government may require states to pay minimum wages and overtime pursuant
to the Fair Labor Standards Act). However, even assuming that the commerce clause poses no such obstacle, nothing
in the enactment of the 1990 Amendments casts doubt on the continued vitality of the 

Brown

 holdings with respect to the statutory limits on EPA's FIP authority. Thus, the constraints discussed above still
apply. In short, EPA may require the state to legislate or expend funds that affect the state's own pollution creating
activities. Although EPA may not require the state to legislate or spend money to govern the pollution creating activities
of others, EPA may promulgate and implement such measures directly in a FIP and the State may not interfere with EPA's
enforcement of those measures. 


B. Overview of Components of Each FIP 


1. FIP Control Strategy 


a. 

Introduction.

 This NPRM addresses EPA's FIP obligations to prepare attainment demonstrations for ozone in Sacramento and Ventura,
and for both ozone and carbon monoxide in the South Coast. EPA's task requires the Agency to complete four fundamental
air quality planning activities: (1) Preparation of information on current and projected emissions of each precursor
pollutant; (2) modeling assessment of the levels of these pollutants that must be reached for each area to attain the
relevant NAAQS; (3) identification of control options sufficient to achieve the necessary reductions in emissions;
and (4) drafting of federally enforceable regulations adequate to secure the reductions. 
In this section of the NPRM, EPA summarizes information used in establishing the technical foundations of the attainment
demonstration: the sources of data on existing and future emissions, EPA adjustments to that data, and modeling analyses
used to simulate the ambient consequences of emissions changes and to set the overall reduction targets for each precursor
pollutant. 
The bulk of this section, however, presents the complete set of federal regulations for each area. The regulations
themselves appear at the end of the NPRM, and they are further explained, in many cases, by technical support documents
which are available as part of the docket for this NPRM. 
For each set of regulations, EPA has attempted to: (1) Specify clearly which sources are subject to the rule's requirements,
and which are exempt; (2) describe in simple terms the most important source obligations, whether procedural or emissions
related; (3) identify possible compliance options and estimated costs per unit of pollution reduced; and (4) characterize
the emissions reduction benefits associated with the rule in each applicable FIP area.

<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Because many of the FIP rules are unprecedented in their regulatory targets or approach, EPA has reserved portions
of the rules for later development, and seeks full input from affected sources on the best ways to fill in these implementation
details before the compliance deadlines of each rule approach. 
In other cases, EPA must complete ongoing technical projects, including further emissions sampling and analysis,
to finalize important rule implementation elements, such as protocols for use in the stationary and area source cap
rules. Ideally, EPA would undertake these projects in coordination with affected industry and State and local air
pollution control agencies in the FIP areas. These additions to the FIP rules may be proposed as actual regulations
or they may be issued as supplementary guidance materials that expand on practical compliance issues. 
EPA encourages readers to provide information and regulatory suggestions to allow EPA to improve the proposed rules'
clarity and compliance certainty, provide for least-cost compliance approaches, and tailor the rules more precisely
to fit local circumstances and foster program transfer to the State or local level. 
In many cases, affected sources are already subject to existing State and local emission reduction requirements,
and the responsible State and local agencies may be developing further regulatory initiatives, as part of their ongoing
SIP efforts. EPA has attempted to craft FIP rules which, to the extent possible, match the format of State or local regulations
and minimize conflict between the federal regulatory regime and current or proposed State and local requirements.
To reduce compliance costs and duplication of effort by sources and the enforcing agencies, EPA will consider future
FIP rule amendments for the purpose of harmonizing federal and State controls and eliminating any jeopardy of the
regulated community for inadvertent violations of similar but not identical federal and State rules. 
b. 

Enforcement. 

As described in section III.A.2.a of this NPRM, the FIP requirements contained in sections 52.2950-52.3002
are proposed pursuant to section 110(c) and other sections of the Clean Air Act. If finalized, these requirements
will be subject to Federal enforcement under section 113(a)(3) of the Act. Pursuant to section 113(a)(3), EPA may
pursue the following actions against any person who violates a requirement of the final FIP rules: 
(1) Administrative penalty order. EPA may issue an administrative order assessing a civil administrative penalty
of up to $25,000 per day per violation. 
(2) Compliance order. EPA may issue an order to comply with any requirement of the FIP. 
(3) Civil action. EPA may commence a civil action for permanent or temporary injunction and/or assess a civil penalty
of up to $25,000 per day per violation. 
(4) Criminal action. EPA may request that the Attorney General commence a criminal action against any person who knowingly
violates any requirement of the FIP. 
Owners and operators of sources subject to the FIP rules should be aware that compliance with the FIP requirements
does not generally relieve them of the obligation to comply with other applicable federal requirements or with their
obligations under State law and regulations, or local air pollution control rules. 
c. 

Application of FIP Requirements to OCS Sources. 

Section 328 of the 1990 CAA Amendments required EPA to establish requirements to control air pollution from Outer
Continental Shelf (OCS) sources to attain and maintain federal and state ambient air quality standards and to comply
with part C of title I of the CAA. EPA promulgated the new OCS air regulations at 40 CFR part 55 (``Part 55'') on September
4, 1992 (57 FR 40792). 
As required by section 328 of the Act, OCS sources located within 25 miles of states' seaward boundaries,
 must meet requirements that are the same as the requirements that would be applicable if the OCS source were located
in the corresponding onshore area (``COA'').
 These include, but are not limited to, all applicable federal, state, and local requirements for control technology,
permitting, monitoring, reporting, compliance and fees. New OCS sources must comply with the requirements of Part
55 immediately and existing sources must comply by September 4, 1994. 





Both VCAPCD and SCAQMD are designated as the COA for several OCS facilities located within 25 miles of the State seaward
boundary. These OCS sources will be required to meet all the applicable requirements of the FIP when the FIP requirements
are incorporated into part 55. The OCS rule establishes a ``consistency update'' procedure at 40 CFR 55.12 to amend
part 55 to include new federal, state, and local regulations when they are adopted. 
The OCS rule also establishes procedures for EPA to delegate implementation and enforcement of the requirements
of part 55 to state and local agencies. Thus, any FIP requirements applicable to the affected OCS sources can be implemented
by VCAPCD and SCAQMD when they are delegated authority for part 55. The reader is referred to the preamble of the OCS
regulation for further background and information on part 55. 
d. 

Application of FIP Requirements to Sources Located in Indian Country. 

As described below, the CAA empowers EPA to apply the FIP requirements to affected air pollution sources in Indian
country.
 Thus, EPA is also proposing to apply the FIP requirements to all affected air pollution sources located on Tribal lands.
This means that the proposed FIP rules will apply with equal force to State and Tribal lands. 




Congress has authorized EPA to make Indian Tribes partners in Clean Air Act implementation in the same manner as States.
See section 301(d)(2) of the Act. As a prerequisite, EPA must identify provisions of the CAA for which it is appropriate
to treat Tribes in the same manner as States. EPA may provide by regulation other means by which it will directly administer
any other provisions of the CAA not identified, to achieve the appropriate purpose. See section 301(d)(4). 
The overarching purpose of the Clean Air Act is, among other things, ``to protect and enhance the quality of the Nation's
air resources so as to promote the public health and welfare and the productive capacity of its population.'' See section
101(b)(1) of the CAA (emphasis added). The NAAQS are one of the fundamental CAA benchmarks by which public health and
welfare protection is measured. 
EPA has not yet issued rules under section 301(d)(2) authorizing Tribes to submit NAAQS-related CAA programs for
EPA approval in the same manner as States. Sections 110(c)(1) and 301(d)(4) of the Act nevertheless evince Congressional
intent to authorize EPA to directly protect public health and welfare where States or Tribes fail to submit such CAA
programs or lack authority to do so. Federal implementation on Indian lands is especially appropriate in these particular
exigencies where federal action will prevent voids in public health and welfare protection. See 

Phillips Petroleum Co. 

v. 

EPA, 

803 F.2d 545, 555-56 (10th Cir. 1986) (affirming EPA's authority to directly implement Safe Drinking Water
Act Underground Injection Control program on Indian lands in Oklahoma where concluding otherwise would contradict
the meaning and purpose of the Act by creating ``a vacuum of authority over underground injections on Indian lands,
leaving vast areas of the nation devoid of protection from groundwater contamination).

It is not necessary for EPA to determine to what extent at 
the local level the State or certain Indian Tribes would have 
authority over specific geographic areas within the scope of the 
FIPs. The State has failed to make required SIP submittals to 
protect the NAAQS and any affected Tribes lack authority to make 
such submittals at this time. In these circumstances the CAA 
empowers EPA to protect air quality 

throughout 

the affected 
areas.

the SDWA apply throughout the country, border to border, ocean to

2. Common Elements 



a. 

Mobile source regulations.

 The mobile source control measures which are discussed in section III.D. of this NPRM range in scope from national
application to restricted application in one or more of the three 
FIP areas depending on the category. Technology improvements are generally required in phases, with new national
emission standards applicable in the early years, and California, or FIP area requirements scheduled for implementation
later. In some cases, the mobile source measures are applied only locally because they are adopted to fill a lack in
a particular area's 
plan, such as enhanced I/M or the employee commute options program. Local strategies are also proposed to deal with
the emissions from transportation and military facilities that contain more than one type of mobile emission source.
Following is a brief classification of the measures according to the 
breadth of their application: 

(1) Nationwide. New emission standards have recently been proposed or are 
shortly scheduled for proposal for several mobile source emission 
categories. Both on-highway and off-road heavy duty engines will 
meet tighter NO

X

 standards, as will locomotives. Lawn and 
garden, recreational marine, and other small nonroad equipment 
are the subject of new exhaust and evaporative hydrocarbon 
standards. 

(2) Statewide. In California, it is also possible to adopt standards more 
stringent than those applied at the national level, if it is necessary to do so for attainment purposes. The market
for vehicles and equipment in California is large enough to encourage manufacturers to supply a full range of product
in the state, even though it may be different than similar product in the rest of the country. Today's NPRM proposes
special standards for 
medium duty vehicles, heavy duty highway engines, and onroad and off-road motorcycles sold and used in California
and gives notice that such standards may become necessary for lawn and garden equipment and other small engines. 

(3) FIP areas. In the nonroad heavy duty engine category, the FIP proposal 
contains special NO

X

 and evaporative HC requirements for engines 
used in the FIP areas. The standards represent a significant 
challenge for heavy duty engine manufacturers and are not 
considered to be necessary for attainment in other areas of the 
United States. Engines used in highway applications are 
regulated in the FIP at the statewide level, but the approach to 
the special NO

X

 and evaporative HC standards for the nonroad 
engines will involve an engine registration and sticker 
enforcement system. For that reason, the standards are applied 
to engines actually used in each individual FIP area, and not to 
all engines sold in California. 

In several categories, the FIP proposes emission bubbles to 
allow facilities or entities with many mobile sources as much 
flexibility as possible to find reductions across different 
mobile emission sources. These bubbles are proposed for 
commercial airlines, marine vessels, railroads (South Coast 
only), and military installations in the FIP areas. In some 
cases, fees are proposed to encourage the purchase and use of the 
cleanest engines, to encourage activity reductions, or to promote 
the use of lower emitting operational procedures. These fees 
would apply to heavy-duty nonroad fleets, recreational marine 
engines, commercial and general aviation, and ships in the FIP 
areas only. 

Finally, the FIP proposes two light duty vehicle measures in 
only the FIP areas of California, namely motor vehicle inspection and maintenance 
(I/M), and parking cash out (a transportation 
control measure). 

b. 

Stationary and area source regulations.

 As discussed in section III.C of this NPRM, the proposed stationary source control package includes five general
strategies: 

 Regulations for specific sources; 

 Regulations for specific source categories in the FIP 
areas; 

 Regulations imposed statewide; 

 Cap regulations; and 

 New technology measures for the South Coast pursuant to 
section 182(e)(5) of the Act. 

Regulations for specific sources are, by definition, 
particular to individual sources and thus not common to the three 
FIP areas. In fact, all the source-specific regulations proposed 
in this NPRM apply only in the Sacramento area. Similarly, new 
technology measures proposed for the South Coast apply only in 
the South Coast as specified in section 182(e)(5) of the Act. 
Some or all regulations from the other three categories, however, 
are proposed for implementation in all three FIP areas. These 
are summarized briefly below. 

(1) Regulations for specific source categories. 
Sections III.C.3.b-p of this NPRM describe eighteen rules 
proposed for specific source categories in one or more FIP areas. 
Categories were selected for regulation generally because a State 
or local agency had already published a regulation that could be 
adapted for implementation in the FIP, or a previously 
unregulated category contributed substantial VOC or NO

X

 
emissions. Because the FIP areas have different emission 
inventories and local rules, the projected impact of new federal 
rules varies from area to area. Therefore, EPA is proposing to 
implement these FIP rules only in the areas where they may have a 
significant impact. As a result, only a few of the rules are 
common to all three FIP areas. 

(2) Regulations imposed statewide. 
As discussed in section III.C.4, EPA is proposing several 
stationary source rules for implementation statewide: 
Architectural coating, pesticides, aerosol paints and other 
consumer products. EPA believes that statewide implementation of 
these rules is necessary to assure compliance in the FIP areas. 

(3) Cap regulations. As discussed in section III.C.5, EPA is proposing cap 
regulations for both VOC and NO

X

 in this NPRM. These rules cap 
emissions at 1989-1990 levels and require sources to reduce 
emissions below this level by a fixed annual percent, beginning 
in the year 2001.
 The VOC regulations are common to all three 
areas. The NO

X

 cap rules apply only to Ventura, since stationary 
sources contribute only a small part of the NO

X

 inventory in 
Sacramento and NO

X

 sources in the South Coast are now controlled 
under the recently adopted SCAQMD NO

X

 RECLAIM rules.

a. 

Reduction requirements for 1999 and 2005. 

Anthropogenic emissions in the Sacramento area in 1990 
totaled approximately 236 tons per day of VOC and 185 tons per 
day of NO

X

. There are many existing State and local regulatory 
requirements in the Sacramento area. These requirements include 
numerous State and local stationary source regulations and the 
existing CARB standards on new engines and equipment which will 
deliver increasing reductions each year as a result of 
replacement of old engines and equipment with newer cleaner 
engines and equipment. Sections II.B.2., II.B.5., and III.H. of 
today's NPRM discuss the adopted CARB and local districts' rules 
and EPA's assignment of credit to the rules as part of the 
FIP/SIP attainment demonstration. 

Unfortunately, projected emissions reductions from the State 
and local requirements must compete with projected growth in the 
area's population, automobile traffic and industrial activity.

As a result, without further SIP or FIP measures, the total 
amount of emissions in the Sacramento area is not expected to 
change significantly by 1999 or 2005. 

CARB and EPA have performed extensive meteorologic analysis 
and urban airshed modeling (UAM) of ozone formation for the 
Sacramento area. This modeling suggests that several 
combinations of VOC and NO

X

 reduction can achieve attainment of 
the ozone standard. As discussed in Section III.H.3.a., EPA is 
using reduction targets of 40 percent VOC and 30 percent NO

X

 from 
1990 baseyear emission levels for the Sacramento area FIP 
attainment demonstration. In order to achieve the 40:30 target, 
SIP and FIP controls must reduce the future inventories for 1999 
and 2005 to approximately 140 tons per day of VOC and 130 tons 
per day of NO

X

. (These targets are often referred to as 
``carrying capacities.'') 

b. 

SIP rules.

 Irrespective of EPA's FIP obligation, California and the Sacramento nonattainment area are required to submit an
ozone 
attainment SIP in November 1994. As part of this and previous 
SIP efforts, CARB and the local air agencies in the Sacramento 
area are continually adopting and modifying regulations to reduce 
NO

X

 and VOC emissions. EPA is not proposing to act on any SIP 
improvements as part of this NPRM, but will do so on a case-by-case basis in separate actions. 

For purposes of the attainment demonstration in this NPRM, 
EPA is not generally assigning emission reduction credit for 
those measures that are not fully adopted in enforceable form. 
EPA urges the responsible State and local agencies to complete 
rule development and submit rules for SIP approval as soon as 
they are fully adopted. This will allow EPA to approve the 
regulations and substitute the locally developed measures for FIP 
rules. 

c. 

FIP rules for 1999 and 2005. 

Sacramento is classified as a ``Serious'' ozone nonattainment 
area and is, therefore, initially required by the Clean Air Act 
Amendments of 1990 to demonstrate attainment by 1999. There are 
several reasons why a 1999 attainment target for a FIP, however, 
would result in an unreasonable plan with undesirable impacts on 
the local economy. The following discussion outlines these 
reasons and explains EPA's proposed solution (i.e., bumping up 
the classification to ``Severe'' and extending the attainment 
deadline). EPA is soliciting comment on whether its solution is 
appropriate or whether the advantages of attainment by an earlier 
date justify the imposition of the kinds of measures which would 
be necessary. 

The FIP rules proposed for implementation in the Sacramento 
area for the 1999 and 2005 attainment options are discussed in 
sections III.B.2 and III.B.3. Mobile source measures which yield 
emission reductions for both the 1999 and 2005 options include an 
enhanced I/M program, credit for national standards for nonroad 
vehicles and engines, offroad recreational vehicle standards, 
motorcycle standards, and a parking cash out requirement. Other 
mobile source measures needed for attainment, discussed above and 
below, depend on the attainment year, 1999 or 2005. For 1999, 
the additional measures include accelerating turnover for heavy 
duty truck engines, capping emissions for nonroad fleets, 
restricting driving for highway vehicles and a strategy for 
recreational boats. For 2005, the additional measures includes 
strategies for motor vehicles, locomotives, recreational boats, 
airports, military installations, and an employee commute options 
(ECO) program. 

For stationary sources in Sacramento, both the 1999 and 2005 
proposals include the source specific reasonably available 
control technology (RACT) regulations discussed in III.C.2, all 
of the regulations for specific source categories discussed in 
III.C.3 and the statewide regulations discussed in III.C.4. Many 
sources will also be subject to the cap regulations discussed in 
III.C.5. which will require approximately a 20-45 percent 
reduction in VOCs by 1999 (for the 1999 attainment option) or a 
gradual 4-9 percent per year reduction in VOCs from 2001 through 
2005 (for the 2005 attainment option). 

d. 

1999 attainment option. 

By 1999, the existing State and proposed FIP measures common to both the 1999 and 2005 proposals for both stationary
 and mobile sources will have reduced the Sacramento VOC inventory from 236 tons per day in 1990 to 155 tons per day in
1999, and 
the NO

X

 inventory from 185 to 153 tons per day. Much of the 
progress on VOC and NO

X

 comes from the stationary source 
measures, continued benefits of the current motor vehicle control 
programs, and a substantial improvement in in-use emissions of 
light duty vehicles due to an enhanced I/M program. New initial 
emissions standards affecting nonroad diesels and locomotives are 
just barely beginning to be felt in new engine purchases. New 
standards for medium duty vehicles, heavy duty vehicles, and 
heavy duty nonroad engines in California are just taking effect 
in the 1999 model year. 





In 1999, the shortfall in emission reductions is about 15 
tons per day for VOC and 23 tons per day for NO

X

. NO

X

 is almost 
entirely contributed by mobile sources in Sacramento. Twenty-three tons per day represent about 16 percent of the
remaining 
mobile source emissions of NO

X

 in 1999, or 43 percent of the 
remaining light duty motor vehicle emissions (i.e., passenger 
cars, light duty trucks and motorcycles). If the FIP must reduce 
the additional 23 tons of NO

X

 without the benefit of new 
standards and normal turnover, then it must contain measures to 
require accelerated turnover and to reduce the activity of mobile 
sources. Under the option of retaining Sacramento's ``Serious'' 
area classification, EPA's strategy for making up the shortfall 
focused on mobile sources because of the absence of significant 
stationary NO

X

 sources and aimed first at technology measures 
that are able to yield NO

X

 reductions by 1999. EPA then 
considered whether similar opportunities existed for VOC 
reductions. The remainder of the reductions came necessarily 
from measures to reduce activity. 

(1) 

Onroad heavy duty trucks.

 
On-highway heavy duty trucks are a category for which EPA 
believes an accelerated retirement/replacement program can be 
adopted and implemented because the regulatory development for 
tighter emission standards, certification protocols and product 
design work was updated in 1993. For the 2005 option, the FIP 
proposes significant changes to the emission standards and 
certification protocols which will be applied to on-highway heavy 
duty trucks beginning with the 1999 model year. However, the NO

X

 
standard for this category was also recently made more stringent. 
Since the 1991 model year, engine manufacturers have been 
certifying engines meeting a 5 gram per brake horsepower-hour 
standard. The federal NO

X

 standard reduces further to 4 grams 
per brake horsepower-hour in 1998. Engines currently in use may 
range in design standard as high as 10.7 grams per brake 
horsepower-hour. Thus, there is an opportunity to require 
accelerated turnover in this category to effect reductions from 
the current fleet in order to contribute to a 1999 attainment 
strategy. 

In order for EPA to implement and enforce an engine 
replacement requirement, it will be necessary for California 
fleets to show compliance with a fleet average NO

X

 standard prior 
to registration. The details of such a registration system and 
other requirements are described in section III.D.3., Programs 
for Onroad Heavy Duty Vehicles and Engines. For the 2005 option, 
a fleet averaging program begins in 2001. If the 1999 attainment 
option is ultimately selected, fleets registered in California 
would be required, after 1997, to have an average gram per brake 
horsepower-hour level of no more than 5 grams.

Some 1999 truck travel in the Sacramento area would be by 
fleets not subject to any fleet standard. The emissions 
reductions available depend on the contribution to vehicle miles 
traveled made by fleets which are subject to the rule. For the 
purpose of this proposal, it is assumed that 80 percent of the 
onroad heavy duty miles come from California fleets, yielding an 
estimated reduction of approximately 6 tons of NO

X

 per day. 
(2) Nonroad growth cap. The remaining NO

X

 shortfall is approximately 17 tons per 
day, 13 percent of total mobile source inventory or 33 percent of 
the light duty motor vehicle NO

X

 inventory in 1999. Before 
turning to activity reductions in the light duty motor vehicle 
category, it is reasonable to consider whether any reductions are 
available in this time frame from nonroad heavy-duty equipment. 
The difficulties of implementing a retrofit rule are discussed in 
I.D. However, there are emission reduction strategies which 
could be implemented by equipment fleet operators in the 
Sacramento area. For example, nonroad engines meeting higher 
national standards should be available from manufacturers as 
early as 1996. There are also applications which have on-road 
configurations as well as nonroad configurations, and fleet 
operators can purchase replacements meeting the tighter 
standards. 
One of the reasons that the overall nonroad category is 
estimated to contribute significantly to a 1999 inventory is that 
it has been unregulated up to this time. The other reason is 
that substantial growth is projected for the category: 8.8 tons 
per day NO

X

 increase from 1990 to 1999. If growth in emissions 
from the largest NO

X

-emitting nonroad sources could be avoided, 
the task of attaining the standards by 1999 or any later date 
would be made easier. EPA is proposing as part of the 1999 
attainment FIP that growth in the nonroad heavy-duty category be 
capped such that NO

X

 emissions not exceed 1995 projected levels. 
The cap would be implemented via a fleet averaging concept like 
that described in section III.D.4 which contains the nonroad 
proposal for the 2005 attainment strategy. Section III.D.4 
proposes a declining fleet average emissions level to assure that 
the historical rate of engine turnover is maintained; the 1999 
attainment cap would require that fleet operators acquire and 
utilize low emission engines as necessary to maintain NO

X

 
emissions at projected 1995 levels. The estimated benefit of 
this cap is the reduction of approximately 4 tons per day of NO

X

 
which would have resulted from further growth in the heavy-duty 
equipment category. 
(3) No drive days. The remaining NO

X

 shortfall is approximately 13 tons per day which amounts to approximately 10 percent of the total mobile 
source inventory, 16 percent of the on-road mobile source 
inventory, or 25 percent of the light duty motor vehicle 
inventory in 1999. This represents a substantial reduction from 
sources that can not be significantly controlled by further 
technological solutions or forced turnover to cleaner 
alternatives. Therefore, the shortfall would have to be achieved 
with even more difficult measures that focus on reducing the use 
of mobile sources. 
Activity restrictions could be obtained from various mobile 
source categories using a variety of regulatory approaches. For 
example, broad-based reductions from essentially all categories 
could be obtained with such blunt measures as fuel surcharges or 
gas rationing. More focused reductions could be made by 
targeting motor vehicle activity through fees on vehicle-miles-
traveled (VMT) or no-drive days. 
EPA believes such potentially severe measures should only be 
selected after substantial public participation and debate. 
However, the Agency is compelled to make a selection for the 
proposed 1999 attainment date option. When faced with a similar 
dilemma in the 1990 proposed FIP for the South Coast Basin (55 FR 
36458), EPA chose to limit mobile source activity with a no-drive 
day program for on-road motor vehicles. Today's proposal also 
contains that control measure in order to achieve the sizeable, 
remaining NO

X

 shortfall for the 1999 attainment option. More 
specifically, in order to achieve the 13 tons of NO

X

 reductions 
needed, EPA is proposing that each highway vehicle registered in 
the Sacramento nonattainment area be prohibited from being driven 
one day out of five weekdays. 
(4) Recreational boat fees or prohibitions. A no-drive day, which is imposed on all highway vehicles one 
out of five weekdays, would produce approximately a 20 percent 
decrease in the emissions of the remaining NO

X

 and VOC from 
highway vehicles. This would be sufficient to reduce NO

X

 in the 
Sacramento area to the area's carrying capacity. However, the 
VOC reductions from the above no-drive day proposal provides only 
eleven out of the required fifteen tons per day. The accelerated 
retirement strategy and growth cap proposed for heavy duty 
engines do not significantly affect VOC emissions. There is a 
nonroad mobile source category, recreational boating, which does 
contribute significantly to the VOC inventory in Sacramento and 
which will eventually be reduced through the adoption of national 
standards for new engines and subsequent fleet turnover. It is 
possible to achieve an accelerated turnover similar to that 
required for heavy equipment either by restricting the operation 
of boats which use engines which do not meet new national 
standards, or by imposing a fee on the excess emissions from such 
boats. As a final measure in a 1999 attainment option for VOC 
reductions, EPA is proposing a fee system or boating restriction 
which will reduce emissions from recreational boating by one-
third in 1999. A similar fee system is explained in the 2005 
attainment proposal.

As an alternative to the fees or restrictions on 
recreational boating, EPA requests comment on obtaining the 
additional VOC reductions from stationary sources. This 
alternative would consist of either increasing the cap reduction 
requirement or achieving further VOC reductions from sources 
which are not covered by the cap regulations (e.g., architectural 
coatings, consumer products). 
e. 

EPA's preferred option_

(1) EPA authority to initiate bump-up. Under section 181(b)(3) of the Act, EPA must grant the 
request of a state to reclassify a nonattainment area to a higher 
classification. Once the area has been bumped-up pursuant to 
such a request, it becomes subject to the more stringent control 
requirements associated with the higher classification. While a 
state need not make any particular showing for the bump-up 
request to be granted, legislative history indicates that the 
voluntary bump-up ``is provided for areas that wish to impose the 
more stringent control measures associated with a higher 
classification or that, for reasons such as extremely rapid 
population growth, conclude that they will not be able to attain 
by their otherwise applicable date [sic].'' H.R. Rep. No. 101-490, Part 1, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., 232 (1990).

In the case of the Sacramento nonattainment area, the State 
could mitigate the difficulties in achieving attainment by 1999 
by requesting a voluntary reclassification from ``Serious'' to 
``Severe,'' which would allow up to an additional six years to 
attain the ozone NAAQS. To date, the State has not opted to do 
so for the purposes of its attainment SIP, which must be 
submitted to EPA in November 1994. See section 182(c)(2) and 
(d). EPA, however, must confront these same difficulties now in 
designing its FIP proposal and, in the absence of a State 
request, must determine whether the Agency may avail itself of 
the voluntary bump-up option. 
While the Act specifically provides for an EPA-initiated 
reclassification only upon failure of an area to attain the ozone 
NAAQS by the applicable attainment date, the Agency believes that 
a recent Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals case offers a persuasive 
basis for interpreting the Act as authority for a unilateral 
bump-up in the FIP context. 


Central Arizona Water Conservation District et al. 

v. 

EPA, 


990 F.2d 1531 (9th Cir. 1993), involved EPA promulgation of a 
visibility FIP to remedy visibility impairment in the Grand 
Canyon National Park. In that case, the court upheld EPA's 
action under regulations that on their face applied only to state 
action in adopting a SIP. The court stated that when ``[a]cting 
in the place of the state * * *  pursuant to a FIP under 42 U.S.C. 
 7410(c), EPA `stands in the shoes of the defaulting State, and 
all of the rights and duties that would otherwise fall to the 
State accrue instead to EPA.''' 990 F.2d at 1541. Based on this 
decision, EPA has concluded that when the Agency promulgates a 
FIP, it can stand in the shoes of the state in order to bump up 
an ozone nonattainment area under section 181(b)(3) on its own 
initiative. 
(2) Rationale for bump-up to ``Severe.'' Although the design value assigned to Sacramento for the 
period 1988 through 1990 resulted in its classification as 
``Serious,'' a review of the most recent design values and yearly 
exceedances for several ozone areas including Sacramento 
(summarized in the following table) show that it is comparable to 
other ``Severe'' nonattainment areas with the 4th highest design 
value in the group and the 7th highest number of yearly 
exceedances. 






The urban airshed modeling which calculates the reductions needed 
to attain the standards also produces results comparable to the 
percent reduction needed for attainment in Ventura (an area 
classified as ``Severe'' under the Act). The VOC reduction target 
is identical at 40 percent; the NO

X

 target is somewhat lower at 
30 percent (compared to 40 percent). 



However, the main reason EPA believes a bump-up to 2005 for 
the Sacramento area is appropriate is the difficulty in achieving 
significant emissions reductions from a mobile source dominated 
emissions inventory where less than 10 percent of the NO

X

 
emissions are from stationary sources. A 1999 attainment date 
does not allow sufficient time for the emissions reductions of 
many of the mobile source strategies discussed in section III.D 
to occur. This includes strategies which rely on the normal 
replacement of older, dirtier engines and vehicles with cleaner 
engines and vehicles. It also would include strategies that rely 
on longer lead times to develop and implement lower emitting 
operational improvements or control hardware. Thus, EPA must 
turn to measures which require retrofits or replacements for in-use engines and vehicles, and restrictions on mobile
source 
activity to achieve the necessary emissions reductions. A bump-up would allow the Sacramento area to take advantage
of the new 
engine standards and other requirements proposed in section 
III.D, and avoid accelerating turnover for heavy duty truck 
engines, capping nonroad engine emissions growth and restricting 
driving_measures EPA is proposing to satisfy the 1999 attainment 
demonstration.

<TEXT>
 



A bump-up is also important for stationary sources which 
will be required to meet EPA's Cap Regulations (section III.C.5). 
Under the 1999 attainment date, these stationary sources would be 
required to submit compliance plans by 1998 which will 
demonstrate an additional 20-45 percent reduction in VOC 
emissions by 1999. With the additional time allowed by a 
``Severe'' area classification, these sources would instead be 
subject to a declining cap requiring gradual 4-9 percent per year 
emissions reductions, which will not be required to begin until 
2001. The additional years for compliance would allow a company 
to investigate control options and take greater advantage of 
technological developments, and thus avoid production cutbacks or 
shutdowns to meet emissions reductions levels. EPA believes it 
is reasonable to anticipate that substantially improved emission 
reduction alternatives and control technologies will develop for 
stationary and area sources during the additional time that a 
higher classification for Sacramento would provide. 
(3) 2005 attainment option. The FIP measures common to both the 1999 and 2005 proposals for both stationary
 and mobile sources will have reduced the Sacramento VOC inventory from 236 tons per day in 1990 to 157 
tons per day in 1999, and the NO

x

 inventory from 185 to 149 tons 
per day. Like the 1999 proposal discussed above, these 
reductions come from the stationary source measures, continued 
benefits of the current motor vehicle control programs, and a 
substantial improvement in in-use emissions of light duty 
vehicles due to an enhanced I/M program. However, by 2005 
additional reductions are realized from the new emissions 
standards affecting medium duty vehicles, heavy duty vehicles, 
nonroad diesels and locomotives due to engine turnover, and from 
the enhanced in-use compliance program. 





With the benefits from the recreational boat measure and ECO 
program discussed above and in section III.D, total emissions 
reductions by 2005 will be large enough to provide for 
attainment. 
It is important to note that a bump-up of the Sacramento 
area to ``Severe'' also leads to the following additional Clean Air 
Act requirements associated with a ``Severe'' area classification, 
which include: (1) A more stringent major source definition (25 
tons per year, down from 50 tons per year); (2) a more stringent 
offset requirement for new major sources (1.3:1 instead of 
1.2:1); (3) TCMs to offset VMT growth; (4) and an employer-based 
trip reduction rule. The responsibility for meeting these 
requirements is discussed below. 
If EPA grants the request of a state to reclassify a 
nonattainment area to a higher classification under section 
181(b)(3), that area must meet all deadline and control 
requirements applicable to the higher classification, and is not 
eligible for any adjustment of those deadlines. H.R. Rep. No. 
101-490, Part 1, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., 233 (1990). If 
reclassification is promulgated by EPA unilaterally in the FIP, 
the area likewise becomes responsible for meeting all such 
deadlines and requirements for SIP purposes. 
The substance of these additional requirements is set forth 
in section 182(d) of the Act.
 Because the statutory deadlines 
for compliance with or submission to EPA of these requirements 
have already passed, if EPA finalizes in February 1995 its bump-up
 option for the Sacramento area, the State will be responsible 
for submitting the actual regulations to comply with the ``Severe'' 
area requirements at that time. If the State fails to do so, the 
Sacramento area will be subject to a finding of failure to submit 
these requirements upon final promulgation of the FIP in 1995. 





As discussed previously in this NPRM, EPA's current 
obligation is to design a FIP for the Sacramento area that 
attains the ozone NAAQS by 1999 or 2005. EPA is not legally 
required to meet all SIP submittal requirements that appeared for 
the first time in the 1990 Amendments and for which there are no 
state failures which EPA must cure. Nevertheless, as a policy 
matter, and because it has invoked the provisions of the 
Amendments in initiating a bump-up, EPA is proposing in today's 
NPRM the ``Severe'' area provisions (section III.F.) in regulatory 
form. 
The measures proposed in III.F. were developed to help the 
State and local agencies meet the additional ``Severe'' area 
requirements if the Sacramento area is bumped up. For example, 
the proposed new source review rule discussed in section III.F.4. 
is based on the actual language of existing rules in the 
Sacramento area in order to provide a rule that is easy for the 
local APCDs to adopt and implement. The employee commute options 
(ECO) rule discussed in section III.F.2. is also adoptable by the 
local APCDs; alternatively, it may provide an incentive for the 
local APCDs to develop, adopt and submit ECO programs that are 
currently being considered. Thus, if bump-up is promulgated, EPA 
believes that the measures proposed in III.F. will help the State 
and local agencies meet their mandate in a timely fashion and 
avoid sanctions. 
If EPA ultimately chooses its preferred option of bumping up 
Sacramento, EPA plans, if necessary, to implement the ``Severe'' 
area measures proposed in section III.F. on their respective 
effective dates following final promulgation of the FIP in 
February 1995. Until a submittal of replacement measures is made 
by the State and approved by EPA, the ``Severe'' area requirements 
proposed in section III.F. will remain in effect. If EPA finds 
that there will be a significant time period before the submittal 
is made and approved, EPA will try to delegate portions or all of 
the federal program to the State and local agencies.

Summary of 1999 and 2005 attainment options.

solution or whether the advantages of attainment by an earlier

attainment.

Attainment demonstrations. 

As discussed in Section III.H.5.a, EPA believes that the set 
of measures proposed in this NPRM, in conjunction with adopted 
State and local measures, will bring the Sacramento area into 
attainment with the ozone standard by 1999 or 2005. This 
projection is based on extensive computer simulations of ozone 
formation performed using the Urban Airshed Model. 



4. Ventura Ozone 



a. 

Reduction requirements. 

Anthropogenic emissions in Ventura in 1990 totaled approximately 105 tons per day of VOC and 86 tons per day of NO

X

. The existing air pollution regulations controlling these 
emissions are among the most stringent in the country. In 
addition, many of the CARB and VCACPD regulations prescribe 
future compliance requirements that are still more stringent, and 
the existing CARB standards on new engines and equipment will 
deliver increasing reductions each year as a result of fleet 
turnover. Sections II.B and III.H of this NPRM discuss the 
adopted CARB and VCAPCD rules and EPA's assignment of credit to 
the rules as part of the FIP/SIP attainment demonstration. 

Unfortunately, projected emission reductions from many of 
these State and local measures are offset by continued growth in 
the area's population and activity levels. Consequently, in the 
absence of further SIP or FIP measures, emissions in Ventura are 
projected to be 98 tons per day VOC and 75 tons per day NO

X

 by 
the year 2005. 

EPA, CARB, and VCAPCD have performed extensive meteorologic 
analysis and airshed modeling of ozone formation in the area. 
This modeling suggests that various combinations of VOC and NO

X

 
reductions can achieve attainment with the ozone standard. As 
discussed in Section III.H.3, EPA is using reduction targets of 
40 percent VOC and 40 percent NO

X

 from the 1990 base-year 
emissions levels. Therefore, the SIP and FIP controls must 
achieve, by 2005, emission levels of 57 tons per day VOC and 46 
tons per day NO

X

. 

b. 

SIP rules. 

Irrespective of EPA's FIP obligation, California and Ventura 
County are required to submit an ozone attainment SIP in November 
1994. As part of this and previous SIP efforts, CARB and VCAPCD 
are continually adopting and modifying regulations to reduce NO

X

 
and VOC emissions. EPA is not proposing to act on any SIP 
improvements as part of this NPRM, but will do so on a case-by-case basis in separate actions. 

For purposes of the attainment demonstration in this NPRM, 
EPA is generally not assigning emission reduction credit to 
measures until they are fully adopted in enforceable form. EPA 
urges the responsible State and local agencies to complete rule 
development and submit rules for SIP approval as soon as they are 
fully adopted. This will allow EPA to approve the regulations 
and substitute the locally developed measures for FIP rules. 

c. 

FIP rules. 

The set of FIP measures proposed for implementation in 
Ventura relies largely on those regulations discussed in Section 
III.B as elements common to all three FIP areas. For mobile 
sources, this includes regulations for motor vehicles and I/M, 
nonroad vehicle and engine controls, forthcoming national 
regulations for locomotives, and strategies to reduce the ambient 
impact of ship traffic along the coast. For stationary sources, 
it includes regulations for solvent cleaning operations, wood 
products coatings, service stations, waste burning, and fugitive 
emissions, as well as the statewide measures and the emission cap 
programs. 

One FIP measure peculiar to Ventura affects emissions from 
ocean-going ships transitting up and down the Ventura coastline. 
In Section III.D.5.e.(4) of this NPRM, EPA discusses rerouting 
the Santa Barbara shipping channel farther from the coast, and a 
fee system designed to encourage ships to travel outside of the 
Channel Islands. 

d. 

Attainment demonstration. 

As discussed in Section III.H., EPA believes that the set of 
measures proposed in this NPRM, along with adopted State and 
local measures, will bring Ventura County into attainment with 
the ozone standard by 2005. This projection is based on 
extensive computer simulations of ozone formation performed using 
the Urban Airshed Model. 

e. 

Alternative attainment date discussion. 

Section 181(a)(1) of the Act requires that ozone SIPs 
demonstrate attainment as expeditiously as practicable but not 
later than, in the case of Ventura, 2005. As a result, EPA has 
attempted to identify practicable measures that could achieve 
attainment by an earlier date. For illustrative purposes, EPA 
focused this investigation on a target attainment date of 2000. 
EPA is not, however, proposing this attainment date or the 
following strategies in this NPRM. 

In today's NPRM, EPA is proposing two attainment options for 
the Sacramento area. 1999 is proposed because Sacramento is 
currently classified as a ``Serious'' ozone area, and 2005 is 
proposed because EPA is recommending reclassifying Sacramento to 
a ``Severe'' area. As discussed in paragraph III.B.3.e of this 
NPRM, EPA believes that attainment in Sacramento by 1999 would 
require unacceptably harsh control measures, and therefore 
prefers the 2005 option. Since Ventura's ozone problem is worse 
than Sacramento's (e.g., EPA is projecting that a 30% reduction 
of NO

X

 emissions is needed for attainment in Sacramento while a 
40% reduction is needed in Ventura), it is not surprising that 
attainment in Ventura by 2000 would also prove to be 
impracticable. 

Many of the mobile source FIP controls for the 2005 
attainment demonstration are proposed for near-term 
implementation in Ventura, and will achieve substantial emission 
reductions by 2000. These include an enhanced inspection and 
maintenance program, national standards for nonroad vehicles and 
engines, offroad recreational vehicle standards, motorcycle 
standards, and a parking cash-out program. The difficulty in 
achieving full attainment by that date, however, is that many of 
the proposed mobile source strategies rely on engine and vehicle 
turn-over to reduce emissions. Tight emission standards for new 
onroad vehicles, for example, are not effective while people are 
still driving older cars. By 2000, new emission standards 
affecting heavy duty onroad and nonroad engines and locomotives 
will just barely begin to be felt in new engine purchases. 

In trying to identify practical measures for attainment in 
Ventura by 2000, EPA has considered control strategies similar to 
those proposed to bring Sacramento into attainment by 1999. 
These include the following: 



Onroad heavy duty trucks. 

EPA could accelerate replacement 
of old high-emitting onroad heavy duty truck engines by requiring 
local truck fleet owners to register and sticker their equipment 
to assure compliance with tight emission standards. 



Nonroad growth cap. 

EPA could propose that growth in the 
nonroad heavy duty category be capped such that emissions not 
exceed 1995 projected levels. 



Accelerate shipping fee system. 

EPA could accelerate the 
fee system designed to encourage shipping companies to reroute 
their shipping activities beyond the Channel Islands.

<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Accelerate airport and aircraft programs. EPA could 
accelerate programs designed to reduce emissions from commercial, 
general, and military aircraft and associated activity. 



Accelerate turnover of recreational boat engines.

 Emissions 
from recreational boat engines will eventually be reduced through 
the adoption of national standards for new engines and subsequent 
fleet turnover. It is possible to achieve an accelerated 
turnover similar to that required for heavy equipment either by 
restricting operation of boats which use engines that do not meet 
new national standards, or by imposing a fee on the excess 
emissions from such boats. 

Most of the requirements for stationary source categories 
described in section III.C.3 and the statewide area sources 
described in section III.C.4 are scheduled for implementation in 
1996. EPA expects, in fact, that all stationary source emission 
reductions projected under the 2005 attainment demonstration will 
be achieved by 2000 except for those required by the cap rules 
discussed in section III.C.5. 

The proposed cap programs require most stationary sources in 
Ventura to reduce VOC and NO

X

 emissions by at least 4% and 6% per 
year respectively for each year from 2001 through 2005. 
Theoretically, EPA could require 20% or greater VOC reductions 
(and 30% or greater NO

X

 reductions) by 2000. While this might 
accelerate attainment, EPA cannot conclude that accelerating such 
reductions would be practicable, and believes it could well be 
counterproductive in practice. Specifically, such a dramatic 
near-term reduction requirement might result in massive non-
compliance that would overwhelm EPA's enforcement abilities and 
fail to achieve real air quality improvement. 

EPA has estimated the effects of an onroad heavy duty truck 
measure, nonroad growth cap, accelerated shipping fee system, 
accelerated airport and aircraft programs, accelerated turnover 
of recreational boat engines, and accelerated stationary source 
cap on the overall Ventura emission inventory. After accounting 
for these controls, EPA projects an emission reduction shortfall 
of approximately 10 tons/day of VOC and 5 tons/day of NO

X

. Note 
that the NO

X

 contribution by stationary sources in Ventura is 
substantially greater than in the Sacramento area. Therefore, 
the mobile source measures do not produce the same effect as they 
did in Sacramento. 

In order to address the remaining emission reduction 
shortfall, EPA could impose activity restrictions using a variety 
of regulatory approaches. For example, broad-based reductions 
from many stationary and almost all mobile source categories 
could be obtained with such blunt measures as fuel surcharges or 
gas rationing. More focused reductions could be made by 
targeting motor vehicle activity through fees on vehicle-miles-
traveled (VMT) or no-drive days. 

EPA believes such potentially severe measures should only be 
selected after substantial public participation and debate. When 
faced with an attainment shortfall in the 1990 proposed FIP for 
the South Coast Basin (55 FR 36458), EPA did propose to limit 
mobile source activity with a no-drive day program for onroad 
motor vehicles. In the 1990 South Coast case, however, EPA was 
struggling to find enough reductions to attain by the latest 
legally acceptable date. In Ventura, the issue is whether there 
are practical measures to attain prior to the statutory deadline. 
In order to achieve the remaining emission reductions necessary 
for Ventura to attain by 2000, EPA estimates that two no-drive 
days or equivalent alternative activity reductions would be 
needed. That is, each highway vehicle registered in Ventura 
would be prohibited from being driven on two of the five workdays 
in each week. 

Obviously, this and other measures needed to accelerate 
attainment in Ventura would have dramatic negative socioeconomic 
impacts in the area. EPA does not consider them legally required 
as practical measures or good policy. For that reason, EPA 
cannot conclude that such measures would be practicable and EPA 
is not, therefore, proposing to attain the standard before 2005. 



5. South Coast Ozone 



a. 

Reduction requirements.

 Anthropogenic emissions in the South Coast in 1990 totaled 
approximately 1913 tons per day of VOC and 1273 tons per day of 
NO

X

 for an average summer weekday. The air pollution control 
regulations now in effect in the South Coast are, with few 
exceptions, the most stringent in the Country. In addition, many 
of the CARB or SCAQMD adopted regulations prescribe future 
compliance requirements that are still more stringent, and the 
existing CARB standards on new engines and equipment will deliver 
increasing reductions each year as a result of fleet turnover. 
Sections II.B and III.H. of this NPRM discuss the adopted CARB 
and SCAQMD rules which are assigned credit as part of the FIP 
attainment demonstration. 

Even after allowing credit for reductions from these State 
and local measures, continued growth in the area's population and 
activity levels will erode much of the future benefits of 
currently adopted controls. Consequently, in the absence of 
further SIP or FIP measures, emissions in the South Coast will 
not decline appreciably. The 2010 emissions levels are projected 
to be 1390 tons/day VOC and 1142 tons/day NO

X

 for an average 
summer weekday. 

Extensive urban airshed modeling of three episodes in 1985 
and 1987 provided the basis for the SCAQMD's 1991 Air Quality 
Management Plan, which concluded that ozone attainment could be 
achieved if basin-wide emissions were reduced to approximately 
187 tons per day of VOC and 399 tons per day of NO

X

 (episode-
specific emissions). Based on the current baseline emissions 
inventory, and prior to the completion of extensive new modeling 
analyses that are underway, EPA is using reduction targets of 90 
percent for VOC and 69 percent for NO

X

 from the 1990 base-year 
emissions levels.
 Assuming these reduction targets, the 
combination of SIP and FIP controls must achieve, by 2010, total 
reductions of 1726 tons per day of VOC and 874 tons per day of 
NO

X

 from 1990 emissions, or 1203 tons per day of VOC and 743 tons 
per day of NO

X

 from 2010 baseline emissions. 





As with Sacramento and Ventura, EPA's control strategy 
analysis for the South Coast began with a comparison of the 
applicable existing South Coast rules to the rules currently in 
effect in other areas. Although the SCAQMD generally has among 
the most advanced regulations in the Country, EPA was able to 
identify stationary and area source categories for which new or 
enhanced technology-based rules could be promulgated immediately 
to yield additional emission reductions. Section III.C.3. 
discusses those new or improved category-specific stationary and 
area source rules which EPA is able to propose at this time. 

After credit for emissions reductions from this initial set 
of FIP measures, a massive shortfall in necessary emission 
reductions still remains. The FIP mobile source core measures 
are identified in section III.B.2. and III.D.1.b. These measures 
contribute substantial further reductions (approximately 205 tons 
per day VOC and 181 tons per day NO

X

), leaving roughly 1000 tons 
per day VOC and 562 tons per day NO

X

 to be achieved by added 
stationary and area source controls. 

EPA proposes to achieve the remaining target reductions 
through a combination of the emission cap rules set forth in 
section III.C.5., additional mobile source controls discussed in 
section III.D, and the ``new technology'' commitments discussed in 
section III.B.5.d. below and in section III.G.

b. 

SIP rules.

 In section II.C.2., EPA proposes to conditionally approve 
commitments by the SCAQMD and CARB to continue their development 
of a number of new or strengthened regulations and to adopt them 
within the next two years to accomplish the first rate-of-
progress installments required under the Act. These committal 
measures have the potential to deliver approximately 83 tons per 
day of VOC. Scheduled SCAQMD rule development could also 
contribute substantial additional NO

X

 reductions. 

In preparing the November 1994 ozone attainment plan, CARB, 
SCAQMD, and SCAG are now reassessing strategies for adopting 
measures to reduce NO

X

 and VOC emissions. The SCAQMD is also 
developing a VOC RECLAIM program for near-term adoption and 
implementation. 

For purposes of this attainment demonstration, however, EPA 
is not assigning emission reduction credit to measures until they 
are fully adopted in enforceable form. EPA urges the responsible 
State and local agencies to complete rule development and submit 
rules for SIP approval as soon as they are fully adopted. This 
will allow EPA to approve the regulations and substitute the 
locally developed measures for FIP rules. 

c. 

FIP Rules.

 The set of FIP measures proposed for implementation in the 
South Coast relies largely on those regulations discussed in 
Section III.B as elements common to all three FIP areas. This 
includes the controls for onroad and nonroad mobile sources, 
supplemented by such elements as I/M and sticker programs. In 
addition, the proposed FIP for the South Coast includes the 
mobile source controls discussed in the Ventura FIP summary, and 
two measures peculiar to the South Coast FIP: A fee-based 
program to reduce emissions from ports and a locomotive cap rule. 
For stationary and area sources, it includes regulations for 
service stations, livestock waste, fugitive emission controls for 
petroleum and chemical facilities, and waste burning, as well as 
the statewide measures and the emission cap program. Finally, 
the South Coast FIP relies on the new technology commitments 
discussed immediately below. 

d. 

Section 182(e)(5) provisions.

 (1) Statutory provision and General Preamble requirements 
Section 182(e)(5) of the Clean Air Act applies exclusively 
to ``Extreme'' ozone areas (i.e., only the South Coast area). This 
provision authorizes the State (or EPA, standing in the shoes of 
the State
) to rely for its ozone attainment demonstration on 
conceptual, as yet unadopted measures that anticipate new or 
improved technology. The South Coast's 1991 Air Quality 
Management Plan employs a similar approach in its ``Tier II'' and 
``Tier III'' new technology measures, which consist of brief 
discussions of control targets (percentage and emission 
reductions) for specific or general source categories, to be 
achieved in future years through technological advances. 





For EPA to credit such measures toward the ozone attainment 
demonstration (either by SIP approval or FIP promulgation), EPA 
must find that the measures are not needed to meet the Act's 
progress requirements for the first 10 years (see section 
182(e)(5)(A)), and EPA must approve State commitments or make its 
own commitments to submit contingency measures no later than 
three years before proposed implementation of the measures, 
sufficient to ensure the required rate of progress and attainment 
(section 182(e)(5)(B)). 

EPA's General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I 
provides the Agency's preliminary articulation of how it will 
exercise its considerable discretion under section 182(e)(5). At 
this time, EPA, in approving or promulgating measures under this 
section, will look to see that the plan shows that the measures 
cannot be fully developed and adopted by the submittal date for 
the attainment demonstration; that the plan contains a schedule 
outlining the steps leading to final development and adoption of 
the measures; and that the plan contains commitments from those 
agencies that would be involved in developing and implementing 
the schedule for each measure (57 FR 13524, April 16, 1992). 

With respect to the Act's requirement that the technology 
advancement measures not be needed to achieve progress required 
during the first 10 years, EPA believes that the Administrator 
should satisfy herself with respect to three separate progress 
requirements applicable during the 10-year period following 
enactment of the 1990 Amendments to the Act: (1) 15 percent 
reduction of VOC emissions for the 6-year period from 1990 to 
1996, as required by section 182(b)(1); (2) 9 percent reduction 
of VOC and/or NO

X

 emissions for the 3-year period from 1997 to 
1999, as required by section 182(c)(2)(B); and (3) a further 3 
percent reduction of VOC and/or NO

X

 emissions during the year 
2000, as the initial installment of the 9 percent reductions 
required for the period 2000 to 2002.
 In section 
III.B.5.d.(4) of this NPRM, EPA demonstrates that each of these 
three progress requirements is satisfied (with regard to section 
182(e)(5)) by the combination of State and local measures and the 
FIP regulations proposed in this NPRM. 





(2) Need for additional time to develop new technologies in enacting special provisions for ozone attainment in the

South Coast, Congress recognized that attainment in this area may 
require 20 years, even on an expeditious schedule of progress. 
The difficulty of the ozone attainment project derives primarily 
from the topography and climate of the South Coast basin, which 
combine to produce ideal conditions for the formation and 
persistence of tropospheric ozone. In this setting exists one of 
the world's largest industrial and commercial centers, with a 
population projected to approach 18 million by the attainment 
year. 

The technological challenge of attainment is evident in the 
extraordinary remaining ozone precursor reduction requirements_
approximately 90% for VOC and 70% for NO

X

_which are 
superimposed on an already very strict level of existing control. 
Complete elimination of all emissions from motor vehicles would 
not accomplish even half of the needed reductions. In fact, the 
South Coast could not reach attainment even if there were no 
mobile source and industrial emissions in the basin. The area's 
unique reduction responsibilities therefore necessitate 
breakthroughs in air pollution control technologies for 
practically every pollution source, coupled with the most 
advanced techniques and initiatives for preventing pollution. 

EPA believes that the pace of air pollution control 
technology development in the past provides a reasonable basis 
for confidence that the South Coast can meet the Clean Air Act's 
2010 ozone attainment goal using section 182(e)(5). Lacking 
sufficiently detailed data to predict and mandate specific 
controls for each particular source category, however, EPA 
proposes to employ section 182(e)(5) commitments to extend the 
rate of progress beyond the levels now foreseeable and reflected 
in the declining cap rules discussed above. EPA also proposes to 
commit to achieving additional reductions from smaller stationary 
source categories than are covered under the proposed cap rules, 
as well as from area and mobile sources. The commitments would 
allow EPA, the State, and the affected sources sufficient time to 
cooperate in the further development and commercialization of 
control approaches to deliver the remaining reductions needed for 
attainment. EPA strongly encourages CARB and SCAQMD to devote 
their substantial resources to expediting development and 
adoption of State and local controls in advance of the section 
182(e)(5) commitment dates for rule adoption and implementation. 



(3) Federal Role in Support of Technological Development Activities 



(a) 

Scope of EPA's Responsibilities.

 From its inception, EPA has been charged with a leadership 
role in coordinating, assisting, and independently advancing 
national research efforts to develop methods and technologies for 
air pollution control. This continuous program has taken many 
forms: 

 EPA laboratories to conduct research, testing, and 
development; 

 EPA surveys, reports, networks, and clearinghouses to 
disseminate the most current information on technology 
development and transfer; 

 EPA programs and EPA-lead task forces to coordinate 
technology development and application studies and projects 
with other Federal departments and agencies; with State, 
local, and international air pollution control agencies; 
with private agencies, institutions, and organizations; and 
with involved industries;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940505-1-00069 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



 EPA study and assessment (in accordance with section 405 
of the Act and in conjunction with the Council of Economic 
Advisors) of economic incentive measures and approaches for 
stimulating additional air pollution control progress, 
concentrating on air pollution problems for which no 
existing methods of control exist; 
 EPA research contracts with public and private agencies, 
institutions, and individuals to carry out specific projects 
relating to new air pollution reduction technologies; 
 EPA grants under section 105 of the Act to State and local 
air pollution control agencies and to other nonprofit 
organizations to conduct research or demonstration projects; 
and 
 EPA research fellowships both at EPA and at research 
organizations or universities. 

In the 1990 Amendments to the CAA, Congress assigned EPA 
additional responsibilities for several specific new air 
pollution control technology projects, ranging from hydrogen fuel 
cell vehicle test programs to studies of renewable energy and 
energy conservation incentives. Congress also broadened the 
scope of EPA's mission: ``the [EPA] Administrator shall conduct a 
basic engineering research and technology program to develop, 
evaluate, and demonstrate nonregulatory strategies and 
technologies for air pollution prevention. Such strategies and 
technologies shall be developed with priority on those pollutants 
which pose a significant risk to human health and the 
environment, and with opportunities for participation by 
industry, public interest groups, scientists, and other 
interested persons in the development of such strategies and 
technologies.'' Section 103(g). 

(b) 

Recent National Initiatives. 

The Federal commitment to a leadership role in development 
of clean technologies and control approaches is reflected in 
several new comprehensive initiatives. 
(

1

) Climate Change Action Plan. The Climate Change Action Plan was announced by President 
Clinton and Vice President Gore on October 19, 1993. The plan 
consists of 50 new or expanded programs and innovative public-private partnerships. The unifying goal of the plan
is reduction 
in greenhouse gases, which include one of the two principal ozone 
precursors: oxides of nitrogen. In addition, the majority of 
the plan's initiatives_whether in the area of energy demand 
actions, transportation actions, or energy supply actions_will 
directly advance progress toward ozone attainment in the South 
Coast, either through projects to reduce energy consumption or 
programs to spur increased reliance on clean energy sources. 

Many provisions of the Action Plan are intended to produce 
almost immediate progress, and some of these actions, like the 
parking cash-out program, are already incorporated as core 
measures in this FIP. Successful implementation of this group of 
initiatives will reduce the growth in emissions in the South 
Coast associated with the area's projected population increases, 
economic development, rising energy use, and expanded 
transportation requirements. 

Other provisions of the Climate Change plan involve a 
continuing effort to advance long term strategies and stimulate 
programs and technologies that will yield their greatest 
reductions in the first decade of the next century. As a means 
of ensuring overall coordination, the President has instructed 
the White House National Economic Council, the Office on 
Environmental Policy, and the Office of Science and Technology 
Policy to co-chair interagency working groups to examine all 
budget, technology, research and development, regulatory and 
economic policies that could impact greenhouse gas emission 
levels beyond the year 2000. From this effort will come 
cooperative federal pilot projects and technical assistance 
programs designed to establish an empirical basis for the 
technological advances that will provide the foundation for 
sustainable development in future decades. 

An example of this coordinated long-term commitment is the 
pesticide use reduction project of EPA, the Department of 
Agriculture, and the Food and Drug Administration. The specific 
strategies under this initiative include establishing incentives 
for the development, registration, and use of biological 
pesticides and the promotion of the high-technology bio-engineering industry; initiation of demonstration projects
for 
reductions in overall pesticide use; and support for integrated 
pest management programs. The success of this program should 
eventually, through regulatory and nonregulatory incentives, 
accomplish further VOC reductions beyond the air pollution 
achievements of the pesticide control measure proposed in this 
FIP (see section III.C.4.d.). Besides impressive reductions in 
greenhouse gas emissions, this program is anticipated to result 
in energy savings worth $1.9 billion through 2000, and savings of 
$9 billion of the period of 2001-2010. 

(

2

) Technology Innovation Strategy. 
EPA's newly announced Technology Innovation Strategy was 
released in draft form on November 23, 1993. This inter-agency 
initiative is under the direction of the Innovative Technology 
Council. It has as its goal to foster the development, 
commercialization, and widespread use of innovative technologies 
that can efficiently close the gap tween our Nation's ambitious 
environmental goals and its ability to meet them, and provide the 
base for sustainable development as economic activity, 
population, and threats to the environment grow worldwide. 

The Strategy includes four focus areas. The first plan 
area, Environmental and Restoration Technologies, begins with an 
allocation of $10.8 million for projects in FY-94. The program's 
goal is to support the development, testing, and 
commercialization of technological breakthroughs needed for 
critical environmental progress. Projects currently funded 
include: 



Cleaner Processes in Plating and Metal Finishing

_developmental research for cleaner technologies in 
electroplating and metal finishing operations; 



Pollution Prevention-Based Materials 
Cleaning/Decontamination

_development and demonstration of 
pollution-prevention based surface cleaning technologies for 
use in advanced manufacturing operations and service 
industries; 



Supercritical CO

2

_production of a solvent-free 
alternative technology for metal degreasing operations; 



Enhancing Market Penetration of Water-Borne and Other Low-Solvent Consumer/Commercial Adhesives

_identification of 
the key technical and institutional barriers to the use of 
new adhesive technologies by EPA's Air and Energy 
Engineering Research Laboratory, pinpointing research and 
development needs, directing key product and applications 
research and development, and demonstrating successfully 
developed processes and products; and 



NO

X



 Control by Hybrid Technologies

_development of cost-effective hybrid NO

X

 control technologies for combustion 
sources, including advanced fuel reburning (AFR)/selective 
non-catalytic reduction (SCNR). 

The second plan area, Clean Technology for Small Business, 
is initially funded at a $12 million level. It includes many 
projects directed toward development, commercialization, and 
diffusion of new cleaner technologies. Among the projects is the 
Merit program in Southern California, facilitating the use of 
pollution prevention technologies in the South Coast.

Clean Technology Use projects involve cooperative testing 
and development programs for less polluting technologies 
applicable to many other types of small businesses: 



Dry cleaning

_EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention 
Technology projects to test and develop emerging 
technologies for cleaner solvents and alternative cleaning 
methods; 


Printing

_cooperative projects with industry to reduce 
emissions from the flexography, lithography, and screen 
printing sectors of the printing industry; 


Printed wiring boards

_projects with the Department of 
Energy (DOE) and industry to develop and disseminate 
information on environmentally improved manufacturing 
options; 


Metal degreasing

_projects with DOE and industry to expand 
use of cleaner, safer degreasing operations; 


Solvents

_updates to EPA's Office of Research and 
Development Solvents Alternative Guide l(SAGE) software 
system to identifying viable alternative solvent 
substitution options for industrial users; projects to 
demonstrate innovative manufacturing projects for reducing 
VOC emissions; and 


Coatings

_two projects, in conjunction with Southern 
California Edison's Customer Technology Application Center, 
to accelerate development and market penetration of very low 
or zero VOC wood furniture coatings; project to promote 
technology transfer of Department of Defense powder coating 
technology; Applied Innovative Coatings Research Center 
projects to complete field trials of reformulated low- or 
zero-VOC coatings. 

The third plan element_Gaps, Barriers, and Incentives_
will concentrate on identifying gaps in environmental technology 
development in order to stimulate technology innovation and 
create a national climate supportive of such innovation. Typical 
projects will work on institutional, legislative, and tax changes 
that can stimulate support for development and use of improved 
environmental technologies. The U.S. Department of Commerce is a 
key participant in several of these efforts, along with industry 
and other regulatory agencies. 

The fourth plan component_Improving Competitiveness of 
U.S. Environmental Technologies may also contribute to the 
development and commercialization of technologies relevant to 
further progress in the South Coast, but the primary focus of 
this activity is to promote use of U.S. technologies and 
expertise to solve international environmental problems. Initial 
funding for this plan area is $12 million. 

(

) Clean Car Initiative. On September 29, 1993, President Clinton and Vice President 
Gore announced the ``Clean Car Initiative,'' an historic 
cooperative effort between the U.S. automakers, the Department of 
Energy, the Department of Defense, and EPA. The primary goal of 
this initiative is to develop an ultra fuel efficient, safe, and 
clean vehicle by the year 2000. 

To implement this goal, industry and government engineering 
teams will undertake research projects in three categories: 



Technologies that can lead to near-term improvements in 
automobile efficiency, safety, and emissions

_research in 
this area will include efforts to develop lightweight, 
recyclable materials and catalysts for reducing exhaust 
pollution. 


Research that could lead to production prototypes of 
vehicles capable of up to three times greater fuel

In support of the Clean Car Initiative, both the U.S. 
automakers and the major utility companies throughout the country 
are striving to develop inexpensive high energy battery 
technology_a technology that will be applicable to virtually all 
types of mobile sources. Various projects are underway to 
develop and perfect engines that operate on alternative cleaner 
burning fuels or utilize fuel cells. The application of 
regenerative breaking technology to motor vehicles is being 
studied for light duty vehicles and is even being implemented in 
a limited number of heavy duty vehicles. Hybrid electric 
vehicles utilizing both electric and clean burning combustion 
technology are being developed and tested to demonstrate their 
potential in-use capabilities. 

EPA is also engaged in several other motor vehicle-related 
technological advancement initiatives. For example, EPA is 
undertaking a regulatory process to introduce improved vapor 
recovery technologies to automobiles for use during the refueling 
process. Finally, expected improvements in remote sensing 
technology may enable inspection programs to more clearly 
identify in-use high-emitters. 

(c) 

SCAQMD Technology Advancement Office. 


In addition to these federally managed programs and 
projects, EPA has provided assistance to the SCAQMD's critically 
important Technology Advancement Office (TAO). Since its 
inception in 1987, the TAO has supported research, development, 
demonstration, and commercialization of advanced emissions 
control technologies and clean fuels.
 EPA intends to 
contribute continued support for the TAO and anticipates that 
many of the new stationary and mobile source control technologies 
needed for eventual attainment will derive from the TAO's 
research efforts. EPA expects to incorporate the results of the 
SCAQMD's projects in the design of new technology measures issued 
in the future under the section 182(e)(5) provision. 





(4) Demonstration That Progress Requirements for 1990-2000 Are 
Met Without the Need for Section 182(e)(5) Measure Reductions 



As discussed above, section 182(e)(5) provides that an 
attainment demonstration can rely on new technology commitments 
if the measures are shown not to be needed to achieve the 
incremental emission reductions required during the first 10 
years after the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments 
of 1990. Section 182(e)(5) contains no requirement that this 
demonstration be based exclusively on adopted and submitted 
measures. Section 182(e)(5) explicitly states that the showing 
need be only ``to the satisfaction of the Administrator.'' EPA 
must be able to conclude, however, that the State has the ability 
to meet the progress requirements without relying on the new 
technology measures. 

Elsewhere in this NPRM (see section II.C.2.), EPA describes 
the recently submitted South Coast Rate-of-Progress Plan, which 
demonstrates achievement of the progress requirements for the 
first 6 years primarily through fully adopted State and local 
measures. To the extent that the demonstration rests on measures 
not yet fully adopted, EPA cannot now propose to accept the plan 
for purposes of satisfying the 15 percent reduction requirement 
of section 182(b)(1), in conformance with the referenced EPA 
policy memorandum, ``Guidance on Issues Related to 15 Percent 
Rate-of-Progress Plans'' (August 23, 1993).

In this NPRM, however, EPA proposes to conditionally approve these measures as strengthening the SIP and for the purpose
of finding under section 182(e)(5) that later-enacted measures are not needed to meet this progress requirement.
Although section 182(e)(5) does not require conditional approval for the purpose of such a finding, EPA has decided
to conditionally approve, under the authority of section 110(k)(4) of the Act, the SCAQMD's enforceable commitments
to adopt in fully enforceable form by 1996 specific measures to deliver the small, remaining shortfall in necessary
reductions. This conditional approval, combined with the South Coast plan, assures to the satisfaction of the Administrator
that the State will ultimately be able to meet the 15 percent progress requirements for the period 1990-1996
by means of recently adopted creditable control measures, along with a small number of new measures scheduled for
full adoption and implementation in 1994, 1995, and 1996. 
As discussed in section III.B.5.d.(1) above, the Act also establishes two other progress requirements applicable
within the first 10 years following enactment of the 1990 Amendments. A further 9 percent of creditable reductions
must be achieved by 1999, followed by an additional 3 percent for the year 2000, as part of the 9 percent due by 2002.
 




While the Act specifies that progress for the period 1990-1996 is in terms of VOC reductions, section 182(c)(2)(C)
allows the substitution of NO

X

 reductions for VOC in meeting the post- 1996 progress requirements. EPA has recently issued the Agency's policy and
procedures for substituting NO

X

 reductions, NO

X

 Substitution Guidance (OAQPS, December 1993.) For purposes of the progress plans, this guidance authorizes any
combination of VOC and NO

X

 emission reductions which total 3 percent per year, so long as the proposed level of NO

X

 substitution is consistent with the emission reductions in the modeled ozone attainment demonstration. In the case
of the South Coast, UAM analyses support a one-for-one substitution of NO

X

 for VOC, inasmuch as peak ozone concentrations in the South Coast Air Basin are sensitive to both VOC and NO

X

 controls (see discussion below in section III.H.). 
EPA has concluded that the Act allows NO

X

 emissions reductions occurring since 1990 to be applied to the post-1996 emissions reductions requirements.
 57 FR 13517, April 16, 1992. SCAQMD's aggressive rule adoption schedule for NO

X

 has resulted in recent adoption of rules that contribute creditable NO

X

 reductions during the period 1990-2000. Particularly important new or revised rules include: Rule 1109_Refinery
Heaters & Boilers; Rule 1110.2_Internal Combustion Engines; Rule 1134_Gas Turbines; Rule 1135_Electric Power
Generators and Boilers; Rule 1146_Crude Oil Pipeline Heaters and Oil Field Steam Generators, and Industrial Boilers,
Heaters, & Generators; Rule 1146.1_Small Boilers and Heaters; and the NO

X

/SO

X

 RECLAIM program. Creditable reductions in VOC and NO

X

 for 1997-2000 also derive from CARB measures, including reductions from the California Low Emission Vehicles/Clean
Fuels Program and California's regulation of certain nonroad engine categories. Finally, the FIP contributes significant
creditable NO

X

 and VOC reductions in the period 1997-1999 and in 2000, primarily through the enhanced I/M program and initial
benefits from the other mobile source controls. 




A technical support document entitled ``Calculation of Creditable SIP/FIP Rate-of-Progress Reductions for the
Period 1997-1999 and for the Year 2000'' identifies individual FIP and SIP measures and associated creditable
reductions for both progress periods. EPA's analysis determined that cumulative creditable VOC and NO

X

 emissions reductions for 1997-1999 exceed the Act's 9 percent rate-of-progress requirement for 1997-1999
and 3 percent requirement for 2000, without the need for any emission reductions from the FIP's new technology measures.



e. Attainment demonstration_

As discussed in section III.H., EPA believes that the set of measures proposed in this NPRM will bring the South Coast
into attainment with the ozone standard by 2010. This projection is based on photochemical grid modeling performed
by the South Coast Air Quality Management District. Six episodes representative of conditions conducive to high
concentrations of ozone were selected for the modeling exercise. Four of the episodes chosen were from the period
for which an intensive air quality and meteorological data base from the Southern California Air Quality Study was
available. 
The emissions for the basin were projected for the year 2010, as discussed in section III.H.2.b, and the emission reductions
resulting from the implementation of the set of proposed measures were quantified (section III H.4.). The resulting
emissions were used as input for each of the six episodes. The projected ozone concentrations for the modeled episodes
were below the NAAQS for ozone for all portions of the domain, hence demonstrating attainment of the ozone standard.



f. Alternative attainment date discussion_

As in the case of the Sacramento and Ventura attainment analyses, EPA considered for the South Coast ozone FIP a number
of mechanisms to achieve attainment before 2010, the Act's deadline for the South Coast. For a discussion of possible
controls, the reader should refer to sections III.B.3.d. on the Sacramento 1999 attainment option and section III.B.4.e.
on an alternative attainment date in Ventura. Expedited attainment using these approaches is even less practicable
in the South Coast than in the other two California FIP areas. The enormous emission reductions required for ozone
attainment in the South Coast mean that the restrictions would have to be so severe as to interfere profoundly with
the economic and social organization of the area, commerce generally, the provision of public services, and the effective
operation of local governments. EPA believes this strategy would not be in the public's interest, despite the benefits
of any acceleration in the attainment date. 


6. South Coast Carbon Monoxide 




a. Reduction Requirements_

EPA's attainment analysis uses a 1990 South Coast CO emissions level of 7084 tons per day. Motor vehicles are responsible
for 93 percent of these emissions. Without adoption of further controls, CO emissions are expected to decline to 4349
tons per day in the year 2000. This reduction is due primarily to turnover in the motor vehicle fleet (including the
benefits of California's LEV program) and to reductions from the California wintertime oxygenated gasoline requirement
(see section II.C.1.). 


b. Attainment Demonstration_

In order to maximize consistency between the FIP and local SIP efforts, EPA has elected to employ the SCAQMD modeling
analyses for purposes of the CO attainment demonstration. As discussed above, the SCAQMD's 1992 CO SIP revision based
the attainment demonstration on both areawide (Urban Airshed Model, or UAM) and hotspot (CAL3QHC) modeling analyses,
and used an appropriate design value of 23.4 ppm, recorded in 1988 at the Lynwood monitoring station. 
The modeling analyses predict attainment of the 8-hour CO NAAQS by reductions in areawide emissions of tons per day,
based upon the control strategies included in the plan and the transportation modeling assumptions for the year 2000.
As noted in section II.C.1, however, the SIP's attainment demonstration relies upon large CO emissions reductions
(587.4 tons per day) assigned to an enhanced I/M program, which has not yet been adopted by the State. EPA proposes to
disapprove the attainment demonstration portion of the SIP and fill the gap in necessary emissions reductions through
the promulgation of the federal enhanced I/M program described in section III.D.2.c.
 In the future, the SIP attainment demonstration could be approved if the State submits approvable enhanced I/M legislative
authorization and regulations. 






c. Alternative Attainment Date Discussion_

As in the case of the California ozone FIPs, advancement of the CO attainment date could be achieved through activity
restrictions more severe than those proposed in this FIP. For example, EPA could prohibit registration of cars emitting
more than 3.4 grams of CO per mile, the national federal motor vehicle standard for 1994 and later model years. Alternatively,
the FIP could mandate no-drive days or restrict sale of gasoline during winter months. EPA believes that these approaches
are simply not practicable because of their widespread adverse consequences and enforceability issues. Therefore,
EPA proposes not to include such additional measures in the CO FIP.

C. Stationary and Area Source Rules 


1. Introduction 




a. Source Category Description and Significance_

Stationary sources of air pollution are traditionally divided into ``point'' and ``area'' categories. Point sources
include refineries, electric utilities, manufacturing plants, and other large industrial facilities, and have
received considerable regulatory attention under the Act. Most, for example, are visited annually by District inspectors
and are restricted to activities described in District air permits. As a result, belching smokestacks have largely
disappeared as industrial facilities have installed scrubbers, incinerators, carbon adsorbers, and other expensive
equipment to reduce air pollution. Nevertheless, EPA believes these sources can reduce NO

X

 and VOC emissions even further. 
Area sources consist of widely dispersed commercial and residential equipment and activities. While some are not
currently subject to air pollution regulations (e.g., pesticide application and some consumer products), most
have been controlled in California for many years (e.g., gasoline pumps, dry cleaners, architectural coatings,
degreasers, etc.). Despite regulation, these small sources are so numerous that they now emit more in the FIP areas
than do point sources. Among the largest contributors are livestock waste in Sacramento, pesticides in Sacramento
and Ventura, and coatings, solvents, consumer products, and petroleum extraction in all three areas. As discussed
in sections II.A, III.G.2 and elsewhere in this NPRM, overall stationary source contributions to the total anthropogenic
emission inventories range from roughly 5 percent NO

X

 and 45 percent VOC in Sacramento to 35 percent NO

X

 and 65 percent VOC in Ventura. Even with the relatively favorable emission reduction targets and stationary source
contributions to NO

X

 in Sacramento, EPA has aggressively sought stationary source emission reductions to help achieve attainment. For
VOC in Sacramento and both pollutants in Ventura and South Coast, dramatic emission reductions from stationary sources
are essential for attainment. 


b. Selection of Control Strategies_

EPA faces several large obstacles to obtaining the needed emission reductions from stationary sources. First, primary
control of these sources has historically fallen to State and local agencies. Particularly in California, these
agencies have developed an excellent understanding of the control technologies available to the specific sources
in their jurisdiction, and have cooperated together to determine the best available retrofit control technology
(BARCT) standards for major point sources, as required under the California Clean Air Act. 
Second, there are literally hundreds of different stationary activities that emit NO

X

 and VOCs in the FIP areas. Even if EPA had the expertise, it would not have the time nor resources to scrutinize each source
and determine the costs and technical details of control strategies to achieve the tremendous emission reductions
needed for the South Coast, or even the lesser reductions needed for Sacramento and Ventura. 
Within these and other constraints, EPA has attempted to propose a set of stationary source control strategies which
best fulfill the goals described in section I.B of this NPRM. A brief summary and explanation of the strategies is presented
below. 
(1) Source-Specific RACT Rules. As a first step, EPA developed source-specific RACT rules for major point sources
in the FIP areas not already subject to a RACT rule. These are described in section III.C.2 of this NPRM. In addition
to contributing emission reductions towards the overall attainment targets, these rules are an appropriate first
stage of the stationary source rule package because (1) RACT is already required for these sources under sections
181 and 182 of the Act, and (2) promulgation of RACT for these sources establishes greater equity with regard to other
major sources. 
(2) Traditional Stationary Source Category Rules. As discussed in section III.C.1 of this NPRM, EPA cannot evaluate
every source category in the FIP areas for availability and cost of emission reductions needed to meet the tremendous
FIP reduction targets. Nevertheless, this type of source-by-source evaluation and rulemaking is exactly how State
and local agencies have traditionally regulated VOC and NO

X

. Therefore, in order to create a State/federal partnership, minimize federal intrusion into State affairs, and
achieve the other goals described in section I, EPA believes it is important to propose traditional stationary source
rules by source category wherever possible. 
Sections III.C.3 and III.C.4 of this NPRM describe the regulations that EPA is proposing under this effort. Categories
were generally selected because: (1) A State or local agency had already published a regulation that could be adapted
for implementation in the FIP, or (2) a currently unregulated category contributed substantial emissions. While
many of these rules will not achieve all the needed reductions, all provide reductions in the near-term and contribute
progress towards attainment. In addition, many of these regulations were recommended by State or local agencies.
EPA believes these agencies should and will follow the FIP proposal by promulgating equivalent rules, further supporting
the FIP goals. 
(3) Cap Regulations. Section III.C.4 of this NPRM describes a set of emission cap regulations designed to achieve
additional stationary source reductions. These rules impose substantial requirements on a wide range of sources,
but they leave the sources a great deal of flexibility in how the reduction requirements are to be met. 
The requirements in the cap rules are designed to achieve the stationary sources' share of the emission reductions
needed for attainment in Sacramento and Ventura. While these reductions are substantial and challenging to the regulated
community, EPA believes that the reductions are achievable on the schedule reflected in the cap rules. EPA believes
that this level of reduction is achievable by sources in the South Coast, in the same time frame. EPA does not know, however,
whether current technologies and control techniques are adequate to achieve the additional reductions necessary
in the South Coast. As a result, EPA is proposing that the South Coast reduction requirements under the cap rules be
similar to those proposed for Ventura. 
(4) New Technology Measures under section 182(e)(5). The additional stationary source reductions needed for attainment
in the South Coast are discussed in Section III.G. Section 182(e)(5) of the Clean Air Act allows States and EPA, acting
in place of the State, to postpone promulgation of regulations in the South Coast (the only ``Extreme'' ozone nonattainment
area) in order to provide for technology advancements. EPA is proposing to include in this category all stationary,
area, and mobile source emission reductions needed in the South Coast beyond those proposed for Ventura. As discussed
above, EPA lacks evidence at this time that either accelerating the reduction schedule or increasing the reduction
requirements of the proposed cap rules would be achievable, in light of feasible existing control options. 
EPA solicits information from industry and the public on demonstrated and commercially available technologies
that could reliably achieve a greater level of reduction than required in the cap rules. As soon as new or improved technologies
and control techniques are foreseeable, EPA will consider amendments to the FIP to mandate further reduction requirements,
even in advance of the schedule for rule development set forth in the proposed section 182(e)(5) commitments. EPA
also urges the State and SCAQMD to pursue aggressively the development and application of low-emission technologies,
clean fuels, and pollution prevention approaches capable of advancing and sustaining the pace of air quality progress
in the South Coast. 


c. Future Evolution of Rules_

EPA intends to reevaluate these stationary source requirements as air pollution control technology continues to
improve. All four of the general strategies discussed in paragraph III.C.1.b are subject to ongoing efforts to develop
cost-effective emission reductions. This includes industry- sponsored environmental audits, CARB's RACT/BARCT
development, EPA's continuing research and development initiatives and CTG and MACT efforts, and SCAQMD's RECLAIM
and Tier 1, 2, and 3 programs, including projects of the SCAQMD's Technology Advancement Office. 
Where appropriate, the final promulgated FIP rules will reflect modifications to the proposed regulations based
on information received from these and other efforts during the public comment period. However, EPA fully intends
to continue modifying the FIP rules through subsequent separate actions, even after final promulgation. As discussed
elsewhere in this NPRM, EPA hopes that the final modification to most FIP rules will be delegation to a State or local
agency or recision of the FIP rules in deference to an approvable State or local program.

2. Regulations for Specific Sources in Sacramento 



(a) Introduction and rationale for selection of sources. In developing the attainment demonstration, EPA evaluated
the possibility of achieving emissions reductions from stationary point sources in the Sacramento area. EPA has
identified several major stationary sources of VOC in the Sacramento area which are not subject to reasonably available
control technology (RACT) requirements. Under section 182(a)(2)(A) and 182(b)(2) of the Clean Air Act, local air
pollution control agencies are responsible for the submittal of RACT rules for all major sources to EPA. Formica Corporation
(Placer County), Sierra Pine Limited (Placer County), Michigan California Lumber Company (El Dorado County), and
Reynolds Metal's tab lubricant operation (Placer County) are four major VOC sources which are not currently subject
to RACT requirements. In order to achieve VOC emissions reductions for the FIP and to provide rule models that will
help the local air agencies meet their Clean Air Act requirements, EPA is proposing the following source specific
RACT rules for the Sacramento area.







(b) Formica Corporation (Placer County) Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(p) sets VOC emission limits for resins used at Formica
Corporation's Sierra Plant (``Formica'') which manufactures plastic laminate products. Emissions are generated
from the lamination process which involves the application of melamine and phenolic resins to several types of paper,
followed by oven curing. VOC emissions reductions have been achieved by Formica due to past changes in resin formulations.
Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(p) represents Formica's current resin formulations and EPA's proposal of a RACT rule for
Formica. 

Formica has made several changes in resin formulation which have reduced their VOC emissions. In 1987, Formica switched
from a phenolic resin with a VOC content of 2.88 lb/gal to one at 1.85 lb/gal. In 1991, Formica reduced their phenolic
resin VOC content again from 1.85 lb/gal to 1.13 lb/gal. Also in 1991, the melamine resin was switched so that the VOC
content was reduced from 0.2 lb/gal to 0.002 lb/gal. EPA is proposing that 1.13 lbs of VOC per gallon of phenolic resin
applied and 0.002 lbs of VOC per gallon of melamine resin applied represent RACT for Formica. Proposed RACT rule 52.289(p)
will also allow control equipment with an overall efficiency of 85 percent as an alternative to meeting the above VOC
limits. 
Based on the 1990 CARB point source inventory, Formica emitted 211.8 tons per year (tpy) of reactive organic gases
(ROG). However, more recent and accurate emissions data indicate that Formica's emissions in 1990 were actually
601.6 tpy of VOC and that with the change in resin formulations in 1991, Formica's emissions were reduced to 461.3 tpy
of VOC. Thus, with the resin changes made by Formica since 1990, approximately 140 tpy or 0.38 tons per day (tpd) of VOC
emissions reductions have been achieved by Formica. 

Since the resin changes required by the proposed RACT rule have already been implemented, there should be no additional
costs for Formica to meet the rule's requirements. However, it appears that the past reformulations were cost effective.


EPA is aware that Formica is currently in the process of obtaining an Authority to Construct permit from Placer County
APCD to install a thermal oxidizer in order to bank emissions reductions credits. EPA also understands that Formica
has plans to bank the emissions reductions from the second phenolic reformulation discussed above. In order for Formica
to bank the emissions from the second phenolic reformulation, EPA would have to propose a rule which set the phenolic
limit at 1.85 lbs/gal., rather than 1.13 lb/gal. The emissions reductions achieved by the second reformulation would
then have to be achieved elsewhere by the FIP. Given the stringency of some of the other FIP measures, EPA believes that
proposed rule 52.2961(p) should represent RACT. 

(c) SierraPine Limited (Placer). Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(q) controls the emissions from SierraPine Limited, a medium
density fiberboard plant in Placer County. Estimated uncontrolled emissions at the facility total approximately
306 tons of VOC per year, with the primary emissions points at three fiber dryers (178 tpy), two press vents (117 tpy),
and wood-waste fired boiler (11 tpy). The three wood fiber dryers use steam heat to dry the wood fibers but in the process
drive off VOCs in the wood. After the fibers are dried and formed into the desired shape, a resin is applied. A steam heated
press is then used to form the fiberboard. As the fiberboard is heated, VOCs (mostly formaldehyde) are driven off.
Currently all VOCs are emitted directly to the atmosphere. 

Based on a review of currently available controls, emissions from the dryers and vents could be reduced significantly
through the addition of a control device (e.g., wet electrostatic precipitator/carbon adsorption system or regenerative
thermal oxidation). Emissions at the wood-fired boiler could also be reduced by maintaining optimum combustion
practices. 

The proposed rule for this facility would require the reduction of dryer and press vent emissions by 90 percent, which
would be achievable through currently available technology at an estimated cost of $2,200 to $3,400 per ton of VOC
reduced. The cost per ton may be partially offset by the additional PM10 reductions expected as the result of controls.
 The rule is expected to reduce VOC emissions at the facility by approximately 280 to 290 tpy. 





(d) Michigan-California Lumber Company (El Dorado) Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(r) controls the VOC emissions from Michigan-California
Lumber (``Michigan-California'') which is a lumber processing and timber manufacturing facility located in El
Dorado County. Various coniferous tree species, including Sugar Pine, Douglas Fir, Ponderosa Pine, and White Fir,
are harvested, transported to the facility, and processed for commercial sale. The main source of VOC emissions from
Michigan-California is a spreader-stoker boiler which uses waste bark and wood as fuel. Due to several operational
changes to increase the efficiency of the boiler, VOC emissions reductions have also been realized. Proposed 40 C.F.R.
52.2961(r) represents Michigan-California's current operating conditions and EPA's proposal of a RACT rule for
Michigan-California. 

EPA's proposed RACT rule will require Michigan-California to meet an emission limit of 150 parts per million by volume
(ppmv) of VOCs in the stack exhaust stream from the spreader-stoker furnace. Since 1988, Michigan-California has
made improvements in the combustion process and regulated moisture concentration of the wood fuel for the spreader-stoker
furnace which resulted in an average VOC emission rate of approximately 218 ppmv during a 1992 source test. Further
changes and improvements made since 1992 have resulted in a VOC emission rate of approximately 127 ppmv during a 1993
source test. Therefore, a maximum VOC limit of 150 ppmv is reasonable for Michigan-California's spreader- stoker
furnace. 

The 1990 CARB point source inventory reports Michigan-California emitting 251.7 tpy of VOC which was based on 1988
emissions test estimates. With the changes since 1988, current VOC emissions should be approximately 48.8 tpy. Thus,
Michigan-California has achieved approximately 200 tpy or 0.56 tpd of VOC reductions since 1990.

Since the requirements of the proposed RACT rule are currently being met, there should be no additional costs for Michigan-California
to meet the rule's requirements. 
(e) Reynolds Metals (Placer). Reynolds manufactures aluminum ``Stay On Tab'' can ends in Rocklin, California and
uses several VOC containing compounds which include end sealing compound, equipment cleaner and tab lubricants.
Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(s) controls the VOC emissions from the tab lubricating process at Reynolds Metals Company
(``Reynolds'') in Placer County. The end sealing compound is currently regulated by Placer County APCD and the equipment
cleaner is covered by the Solvent Cleaning Operations rule discussed below. VOC emissions reductions from the tab
lubrication process have been achieved by reducing the VOC content and application rate of the lubricant. Proposed
40 CFR 52.2961(s) requires Reynolds' to meet limits that are based on the lower VOC and application rate of the tab lubricant.


In 1992, Reynolds switched from a tab lubricant with a VOC content of 6.38 lbs of VOC per gallon, which was applied at
a rate of 50 milliliters per minute (ml/min) to make 3240 tabs/min (or 2.60  x  10

^5

 lbs VOC/tab) to a tab lubricant with a VOC content of 5.73 lb/gal which is applied at a rate of 25 ml/min to make 3240 tabs/min
(or 1.17  x  10

^5

 lbs VOC/tab). EPA is proposing a limit of 5.73 lb/gal for the tab lubricant and total tab lubricant VOC emissions of
not more than 1.2  x  10

^5

 lbs of VOC per tab produced in a given press. Proposed RACT rule 52.2961(s) will also allow control equipment with an
overall efficiency of 85 percent as an alternative to meeting the above VOC limits. 

In 1990, Reynolds emitted a total of 247.5 tons of VOC from which 77.5 tons was generated by the tab lubricant process.
The changes made in 1992 achieve an estimated 55 percent reduction in VOC (or 42.3 tpy, 0.12 tpd). Since the tab lubricant
changes required by the proposed RACT rule have already been implemented, there should be no additional costs for
Reynolds to meet the rule's requirements, and apparently the past reformulations were cost effective.

3. Regulations for Specific Source Categories in the FIP Areas 



a. Introduction_(1) Rationale for Selection of Categories and Requirements. 
As discussed in section III.C.1 of this NPRM, EPA believes 
the FIP should include traditional category-specific stationary 
source rules where possible. Such rules improve the 
State/federal partnership, minimize federal intrusion into State 
affairs, and contribute to other goals described in section I.B 
of this NPRM. While EPA is unable to develop rules for all 
stationary source categories, the proposed FIP includes 15 rules 
for specific categories as described in sections III.C.3.b-p and 
3 statewide area source regulations presented in section III.C.4 
below. 

Many of these rules have been adapted from regulations 
already existing or proposed in parts of California. In such 
cases, EPA has generally selected the most stringent requirements 
available and relied on the technical work performed by CARB and 
local Districts to estimate associated costs and emission 
reductions. While there may be additional rules that EPA could 
have adapted for the FIP under this effort, EPA used the amount 
of potential emission reductions as a primary screening device 
for evaluating which rules were appropriate for the FIP proposal. 
Thus, rules projected to reduce emissions by more than 0.1 
percent of the uncontrolled attainment year inventory were 
considered good candidates. EPA also considered cost-effectiveness and District recommendations in selecting

categories and specific requirements under this effort. Examples 
of proposed FIP elements adapted from existing District rules are 
those affecting solvent cleaning operations, wood products 
coatings, and auto refinishing. Many of these category-specific 
rules are based on regulations adopted by the SCAQMD or CARB. 
EPA's application of these rules to Sacramento and Ventura should 
not discourage the SCAQMD and CARB from pursuing further emission 
reductions from these source categories in order to meet the 
progress and attainment requirements of federal and State law. 

EPA also developed rules for source categories which have 
not yet been regulated under the Clean Air Act but which 
contribute substantial emissions in the FIP areas. For these 
categories, EPA worked with the State and Districts to evaluate 
various mechanisms for reducing emissions. Among the FIP rules 
developed under this effort are those affecting pesticides, 
aerosol coatings, and livestock waste management. 

(2) Relationship to existing and pending SIP provisions 
Some stationary sources proposed for control through 
category-specific FIP rules are already regulated by existing 
State or District SIP rules. Architectural coating, for example, 
has been regulated in the South Coast by versions of South Coast 
Rule 1113 since 1977. EPA's proposed FIP rule (section 52.2959), 
however, would reduce architectural coating emissions even 
further. Where a State or local rule has been approved by EPA 
into the SIP (as, for example, Rule 1113 was approved in 57 FR 
8104, August 11, 1992), affected sources would have to meet the 
tighter of each element in the two rules.
 Sources will, 
however, need to continue to comply with applicable State and 
local rules. 





As discussed in section III.J. and elsewhere in this NPRM, 
EPA intends to delegate the FIP rules and/or remove them whenever 
the State submits an approvable, equivalent SIP provision.
 
If, for example, SCAQMD submits a proposed SIP amendment that 
makes Rule 1113 an approvable substitute for the FIP rule, upon 
EPA approval, EPA would amend section 52.2959 to rescind its 
applicability within the South Coast. In many cases, CARB and 
affected Districts are already developing rules similar to those 
proposed in this NPRM. If these are submitted to EPA before 
February 1995, EPA may, upon SIP approval, simply amend or remove 
the analogous component from the final promulgated FIP. 
Alternatively, EPA may remove FIP elements under separate action. 





If, however, EPA determines that a new or modified State 
rule does not achieve emission reductions equivalent to the FIP 
rule, and no other State rule compensates for the differences, 
EPA will maintain implementation of the FIP measure.
 In such 
cases, sources could again be subject to overlapping State and 
federal requirements. Therefore, EPA encourages the State to 
adopt approvable regulations as soon as possible to avoid 
duplicative effort for both regulators and affected sources. 





(3) Relationship to other applicable FIP provisions. 
Many of the sources subject to the proposed category-specific rules described here will also be affected by the cap

regulations described in section III.C.5 of this NPRM. As 
proposed, the cap regulations require almost all significant 
stationary sources to reduce emissions by a specified percentage. 
The reduction rates are currently the same for sources which are 
affected by category-specific rules and for sources which are 
not. As discussed in section III.C.5 of this NPRM, EPA 
specifically requests comments on whether fairness and other 
concerns justify adjusting the reduction requirements to give 
sources credit for emission reductions required in the proposed 
FIP rules described in sections III.C.2-4 of this NPRM. 

(4) Rule structure. These proposed rules generally follow the structure of New 
Source Performance Standards (NSPS) in 40 CFR part 60. They 
contain sections on applicability, definitions, specific 
requirements, exemptions, reporting, recordkeeping, test methods, 
and additional components as necessary. Where immediate or near-term compliance is feasible, the effective dates
of the 
substantive requirements are generally January 1, 1996, roughly 
one year after final FIP promulgation is due. Issues specific to 
individual rules are discussed in sections III.C.3.b-p and 
III.C.4 below. 

(b) Solvent Cleaning Operations (Sacramento, Ventura). 
Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(a) controls VOC emissions resulting 
from certain solvent cleaning operations in the Sacramento and 
Ventura nonattainment areas. Emission reductions are achieved 
by: (1) Limiting the VOC content and vapor pressure of solvents 
used in solvent cleaning operations; (2) allowing the use of add-on control equipment in lieu of meeting the VOC content
and vapor 
pressure limits; and (3) prescribing procedures and requirements 
for solvent cleaning operations. 

The proposed rule applies to facilities that use VOC-containing materials in the production, repair, maintenance,
or 
servicing of parts, products, tools, machinery, equipment, or 
general work areas, or that store and dispose of VOC-containing 
materials used in solvent cleaning operations. Affected 
facilities include manufacturing plants, printing presses, 
shipyards, and repair and refinishing facilities such as auto 
garages, auto body shops and workshops for buses, aircraft, 
trains and trucks. This proposed rule also applies to repair, 
service, and production operations at institutional facilities 
such as government buildings, schools, hospitals, sanitariums, 
prisons, restaurants, health clubs, and theaters.

This proposed rule is based largely on SCAQMD Rule 1171 
(Solvent Cleaning Operations) as adopted on August 2, 1991. 
Evaluation of the environmental, economic, socioeconomic, and 
other impacts of the proposed FIP rule's requirements can be 
found in SCAQMD's final staff report for Rule 1171, dated July 
1991. This proposed FIP rule also incorporates changes from the 
draft amended Rule 1171 released by SCAQMD on October 6, 1993 and 
components of the VCAPCD Rule 74.19 (Graphic Arts) as adopted on 
August 11, 1992. 

EPA is in the process of developing an Alternative Control 
Technology (ACT) Document for solvent cleaning operations. The 
ACT will primarily address recordkeeping and will not establish 
national guidelines for solvent content and work practices. The 
proposed FIP rule requirements on VOC content and work practices 
do not conflict with the draft ACT. 

As described in the technical support document, uncontrolled 
VOC emissions from affected facilities are projected to total 
10.44 tpd in Sacramento in 1999, 11.82 tpd in Sacramento in 2005, 
and 3.55 tpd in Ventura in 2005. Implementation of this proposed 
rule is projected to reduce those emissions by 6.75, 7.66, and 
2.66 tpd respectively at an overall cost savings of $991 per ton 
VOC removed (1990 dollars). A cost savings is projected because 
CARB and the Districts have identified compliant solvents which 
are less expensive than high-VOC solvents currently in use. 

(c) Wood Products Coatings (Sacramento, Ventura) 
Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(b) controls VOC emissions resulting 
from commercial and industrial application in the Sacramento and 
Ventura nonattainment areas of coatings while manufacturing wood 
products. Emission reductions are achieved by: (1) limiting the 
VOC content of various wood coating products; (2) allowing the 
use of add-on control equipment that reduces VOC emissions by 85 
percent in lieu of meeting the VOC limits on coatings; and (3) 
restricting application of wood coatings to application methods 
and equipment with high transfer efficiencies. 

The proposed rule applies to all persons applying coating, 
inks, stains, and/or strippers in wood product coating operations 
for the purpose of manufacturing wood products, including 
furniture and other coated objects made of solid wood and/or wood 
composition and/or simulated wood material. The proposed rule 
does not apply to residential noncommercial operations. The 
majority of the affected wood products coating operators are 
expected to comply with the proposed rule through the use of 
reformulated coatings rather than add-on emission control 
devices. 

The proposed rule is based largely on SCAQMD Rule 1136 
entitled ``Wood Products Coatings,'' as amended on August 2, 1991. 
In addition, EPA has incorporated some of SCAQMD's proposed 
amendments to Rule 1136, dated July 23, 1993. Evaluation of the 
environmental, economic, socioeconomic, and other impacts of Rule 
1136 can be found in SCAQMD Staff Report ``Proposed Amended Rule 
1136_Wood Products Coatings,'' dated April 19, 1988, and SCAQMD 
Supplemental Staff Report ``Proposed Amended Rule 1136_Wood 
Products Coatings,'' dated July 5, 1988. 

EPA has prepared a draft Control Techniques Guideline (CTG) 
document on wood products coatings that is entitled ``Control of 
Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from Wood Furniture Coating 
Operations.'' Upon publication of the CTG, revisions to this FIP 
rule may be appropriate for consistency. EPA expects, however, 
that the proposed FIP rule may be more stringent than the CTG in 
some regards to reflect the unusually difficult air pollution 
problems in the FIP areas. 

As described in the technical support document, uncontrolled 
VOC emissions from affected facilities are projected to total 
0.49 tpd in Sacramento in 1999, 0.55 tpd in Sacramento in 2005, 
and 0.65 tpd in Ventura in 2005. Implementation of this proposed 
rule is projected to reduce those emissions by 0.45, 0.51, and 
0.61 tpd respectively at a cost of $18 per ton VOC removed (1988 
dollars). 

(d) Automotive Refinishing Operations (Sacramento). 
Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(c) controls VOC emissions from 
automobile refinishing operations in the Sacramento nonattainment 
area. Emission reductions are achieved by: (1) limiting the VOC 
content of various automobile refinishing coatings; (2) allowing 
the use of add-on control equipment that reduces VOC emissions by 
85 percent in lieu of meeting the VOC limits on coatings; and (3) 
restricting application of automotive refinishing coatings to 
application methods and equipment with high transfer 
efficiencies. 

The proposed rule applies to facilities that apply coatings 
to motor vehicles and mobile equipment or their existing parts 
and components for the purpose of on-site refinishing and 
modification. The proposed rule does not apply to application of 
original equipment manufacturing coatings applied at 
manufacturing plants. Affected facilities include autobody 
repair/paint shops, production autobody paint shops, new car 
dealer repair/paint shops, fleet operator repair/paint shops, 
custom-made car fabrication facilities, and truck body builders. 

Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(c) is based largely on SCAQMD's Rule 
1151, Motor Vehicle and Mobile Equipment Non-Assembly Line 
Coating Operations (September 6, 1991). Portions of the proposed 
FIP rule are based on CARB's Determination of Reasonably 
Available Control Technology and Best Available Retrofit Control 
Technology (RACT/BARCT) for Automotive Refinishing Operations 
(January 8, 1991). An evaluation of the environmental, economic, 
socioeconomic, and other impacts of Rule 1151 requirements can be 
found in SCAQMD's staff report for the proposed amended Rule 1151 
(August, 1991); this evaluation is also applicable to this 
proposed FIP rule. 

As described in the technical support document, uncontrolled 
VOC emissions from affected facilities are projected to total 
4.23 tpd in 1999 and 4.71 tpd in 2005. Implementation of this 
proposed rule is projected to reduce those emissions by 3.77 tpd 
and 4.19 tpd respectively at a cost of $7,200 per ton of VOC 
removed (1990 dollars). 

Under section 183(e)(3) of the Act, EPA may in the future 
issue either national regulations or a CTG for this source 
category, as well as for other categories discussed in this 
section. If EPA does so and the FIP rule is less stringent than 
the national guidance or rule, EPA will amend the FIP rule 
appropriately. 

(e) Adhesives and Sealants (Sacramento) Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(d) controls VOC emissions resulting 
from industrial and commercial use of adhesives and sealants in 
the Sacramento nonattainment area. Emission reductions are 
achieved by: (1) limiting the VOC content of various adhesives 
and sealants; and (2) allowing the use of add-on control 
equipment that reduces VOC emissions by 85 percent in lieu of 
meeting the VOC limits on coatings. 

This proposed rule applies to certain facilities that 
supply, sell, or use adhesives, sealants, or adhesive primers. 
Affected facilities include (but are not limited to) 
manufacturing plants, architectural and construction companies, 
and welding operations. Various activities are exempt from all 
or part or the proposed rule, including tire repair, undersea-based weapon systems manufacturing, research and
development, and 
small quantity users.

Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(d) is based largely on draft guidance and model rules developed by members of the CARB/California
Air Pollution Control Officers Association's (CAPCOA) Technical Review Group included in ``Reasonably Available
Control Technology and Best Available Retrofit Control Technology (RACT/BARCT) for Adhesives and Sealants,''
as presented in a workshop on September 30, 1993. In addition, portions of the proposed FIP rule are based on Bay Area
Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) Regulation 8, Rule 51, Adhesive and Sealant Products; VCAPCD Rule 74.20,
Adhesives and Sealants; and SCAQMD Rule 1168, Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from Adhesive Application.
Evaluation of the environmental, economic, socioeconomic, and other impacts of the proposed FIP rule's requirements
was partially based on the information provided in the BAAQMD and VCAPCD staff reports for their respective rules.

As described in the technical support document, uncontrolled VOC emissions from affected facilities are projected
to total 2.64 tpd in 1999 and 2.99 tpd in 2005. Implementation of this proposed rule is projected to reduce those emissions
by 1.29 tpd and 1.47 tpd respectively at a cost of $890 per ton of VOC removed (1989 dollars).

(f) Can and Coil Coating (Sacramento). Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(e) controls VOC emissions from certain metal container,
metal closure, and metal coil coating operations in the Sacramento nonattainment area. Emission reductions are
achieved by: (1) limiting the VOC content of various can and coil coatings; (2) allowing the use of add-on control equipment
that achieves a 90 percent capture efficiency and 95 percent destruction or removal efficiency in lieu of meeting
the VOC limits on coatings; and (3) restricting application of can and coil coatings to application methods and equipment
with high transfer efficiencies.

The proposed rule applies to facilities that apply coatings to metal containers, metal closures, and/or metal coils.
Facilities that apply 1 gallon per day or less of spray coating, however, are exempt from the requirements of the proposed
rule. Sacramento and Placer counties have implemented can and coil rules (SMAQMD Rule 452 and PCAPCD Rule 223) similar
to this proposed FIP rule, although not as stringent. Currently, no sources exist in El Dorado and Sutter counties.
Therefore, while the rule is proposed for implementation in the entire Sacramento ozone nonattainment area (as described
in 40 CFR 81.305), most of the near-term emission reductions are projected to occur in Yolo and Solano counties.

Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(e) is based largely on SCAQMD's Rule 1125, Metal Container, Closure, and Coil Coating Operations.
Portions of the proposed FIP rule are based on the following: CARB's ``Determination of Reasonably Available Control
Technology and Best Available Retrofit Control Technology (RACT/BARCT) for Metal Container, Closure and Coil Coating
Operations'' (July 21, 1992); San Diego County Air Pollution Control District (SDAPCD) Rule 67.4, Metal Container,
Closure, and Coil Coating Operations (1990); and SMAQMD Rule 452, Can Coating (August 21, 1990).

An evaluation of the environmental, economic, socioeconomic, and other impacts of Rule 1125 requirements can be
found in the SCAQMD staff reports for Rule 1125 (February 2, 1979 and October 13, 1989). Evaluations of these impacts
are also presented in CARB's RACT/BARCT Determination for Metal Containers, Metal Closures, and/or Metal Coils.
Both of these evaluations are applicable to this proposed FIP rule.

As described in the technical support document, uncontrolled VOC emissions from affected facilities are projected
to total 2.09 tpd in 1999 and 2.34 tpd in 2005. Implementation of this proposed rule is projected to reduce those emissions
by 0.26 tpd and 0.30 tpd respectively at a cost savings of $540 per ton of VOC removed (1990 dollars). A cost savings is
projected in part because CARB and the Districts have identified compliant coatings which are less expensive than
high-VOC coatings currently in use.

(g) Commercial Bakeries (Sacramento). Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(f) controls VOC emissions from commercial bakery
ovens in the Sacramento nonattainment area that emit VOCs while baking yeast-leavened products. The proposed rule
requires that certain bakeries install and operate a VOC pollution control system to reduce VOC emissions by at least
95 percent by weight. The following four yeast-leavened dough processes are affected: sponge dough, straight dough,
liquid ferments, and no-time dough.

Facilities with a combined rated heat input capacity of all ovens less than 2 million British Thermal Units (Btus)
per hour and facilities with ovens used exclusively for baking products leavened chemically (without yeast) are
exempt from all of the proposed rule requirements, including recordkeeping and test method provisions. Facilities
which emit less than 6.5 tons of VOC per year are exempt from the standards and compliance schedule requirements, but
still must observe the recordkeeping and test method requirements.

The proposed rule is based largely on SDCAPCD proposed Rule 67.24 (Bakery Ovens), as presented in Workshop Draft form
on September 17, 1992. Portions of the proposed rule are based on SCAQMD Rule 1153 (Commercial Bakery Ovens) as adopted
on January 4, 1991 and BAAQMD Regulation 8, Rule 42 (Large Commercial Bread Bakeries) as adopted on September 20, 1989.
Evaluations of environmental, economic, socioeconomic, and other impacts of the proposed rule can be found in EPA's
ACT Document for Bakery Oven Emissions (EPA-453/R-92-017, December 1992).

As described in the technical support document, uncontrolled VOC emissions from affected facilities are projected
to total 1.28 tpd in 1999 and 1.40 tpd in 2005. Implementation of this proposed rule is projected to reduce those emissions
by 1.22 tpd and 1.33 tpd respectively at a cost of $1,200 per ton VOC removed or 0.2 cents per pound of bread (1990 dollars).

(h) Municipal Waste Landfills (Sacramento). Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(g) controls emissions of non-methane organic
compounds (NMOC) from certain municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills in the Sacramento nonattainment area by collecting
and processing the landfill gases evolved from decomposition of organic material in MSW landfills. Emission reductions
are achieved by requiring collection of 90 percent of the landfill gases produced, and destruction of 98 percent of
the NMOCs collected. By controlling NMOCs, VOCs are also controlled because NMOCs include, but are not limited to,
VOCs.

The substantive requirements of the proposed rule apply to MSW landfills that have received more than 500,000 tons
of decomposable solid waste during their operational lifetime. The following types of landfills are exempt from
some or all requirements of this proposed rule: facilities that have accepted only hazardous waste; facilities issued
an Authority to Construct permit from the applicable air quality management district or air pollution control district
prior to April 1, 1995 and that have an NMOC control device in place with at least 90 percent efficiency; and facilities
that demonstrate a low concentration of landfill gas (i.e., less than 500 ppm by volume total organic compounds measured
as methane) at all points near the surface of the landfill.

Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(g) is based largely on VCAPCD Rule 74.17 (Solid Waste Disposal Sites), as adopted on September
17, 1991. Evaluation of the environmental, economic, socioeconomic, and other impacts of that rule can be found in
VCAPCD's ``Final Staff Report for Rule 74.17,'' dated September 17, 1991.

EPA is in the process of developing ``Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources and Guidelines for Control
of Existing Sources: Municipal Solid Waste Landfills'' (``MSW Guidelines''). This proposed FIP rule is also based
on work performed in development of the ``MSW Guidelines.'' Upon publication of the ``MSW Guidelines'' in the 

Federal Register

, it may be appropriate to revise the FIP rule for consistency.

As described in the technical support document, uncontrolled VOC emissions from affected facilities are projected
to total 0.94 tpd in 1999 and 1.08 tpd in 2005. Implementation of this proposed rule is projected to reduce those emissions
by 0.60 tpd and 0.69 tpd respectively at a cost of $18,000 per ton of VOC removed.

(i) Livestock Waste (Sacramento, South Coast, and Ventura). Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(h) controls VOC emissions from
livestock waste operations. Livestock waste emission sources include cattle, hogs, sheep, and poultry operations.
VOC emissions are created during the anaerobic decomposition of livestock wastes. Although methane emissions are
estimated to make up 70 to 80 percent of the total organic gases (TOG) created, VOC emissions account for approximately
10 percent of the TOG. Livestock waste operations account for approximately 7.7 tpd of VOC emissions in the Sacramento
area, 34.4 tpd in the South Coast,
 and 3.8 tpd in Ventura. Although livestock waste operations have traditionally not been the subject of VOC regulation,
they are now under consideration because of the magnitude of livestock waste emissions and the need to achieve reductions
from all FIP area emission VOC sources, most of which have previously reduced or will soon be required to reduce their
VOC emissions.





As proposed, the rule would only apply to dairy cattle operations of 400 head or greater. These operations are estimated
to represent approximately 1.8 tpd of VOC emissions in the Sacramento area and 10.8 tpd in the South Coast. Ventura
County currently does not have any dairy operations of greater than 200 head of cattle and, as a result, dairy operations
would not be affected in Ventura. Although other livestock waste operations (e.g., chicken, hogs, sheep facilities)
are not being proposed for regulation at this time, EPA will continue to investigate potential options for reducing
emissions from other livestock waste operations as appropriate.

Emissions from livestock waste are determined by the quantity of manure produced, how it is handled, and the temperature
at which it is handled. The manure management system employed is very important. Wet management systems, such as liquid
or slurry based systems (e.g., lagoons), convert large portions of the carbon to methane and other gases. Dry management
systems, which rely on placing the manure in storage piles, also result in methane and other volatile organic compound
emissions created by the anaerobic conditions within the storage piles. The primary emission reduction strategies
available to reduce VOC emissions include utilizing methane recovery systems and/or promoting enhanced aerobic
conditions in manure storage areas.

<TEXT>
 



Methods recommended for promoting aerobic decomposition of 
livestock waste include: aerating manure storage piles every 
three to seven days; scraping feedlots at least three times per 
year; and spreading oxidizing agents on feedlots. For waste 
management practices using a dry method, the proposed FIP measure 
will require the periodic aeration and removal of manure storage 
piles. This measure is estimated to reduce VOC emissions by 25 
percent. 
Methane recovery and utilization systems are considered a 
potential control method for reducing VOC and methane emissions. 
Methane is considered an important greenhouse gas and also a 
potential energy source. Depending on the size of the livestock 
waste operation, methane recovery systems can pay for themselves 
over time and result in cost savings for large-scale dairy 
operations. Methane recovery systems are currently operating at 
23 sites in the U.S., including at a swine facility near Tulare, 
CA and a dairy near Modesto, CA. Near Chino, CA, a recovery 
system is under development which would process an estimated 
2,500 tpd of cattle waste and 600 tpd of chicken waste. 
Technologies for methane recovery include covered lagoons, plug 
flow digesters, and complete mix digesters. Although these 
recovery systems represent a viable, demonstrated technology, 
some systems have not been as successful as expected because of 
improper design or other factors. For these reasons, EPA requests 
comment and information on any examples, circumstances, and/or 
reasons why a previously installed recovery system may not have 
achieved its full expectations. 
The proposed FIP rule will require that at least 55 percent 
of the manure generated be collected and managed through a 
methane recovery system. These systems are estimated to reduce 
emissions by 80 percent. 
The technical and economic feasibility of this technology 
depends on farm size, climate, and energy process. The off-gas 
(i.e., methane) collected can be utilized in the dairy operation 
for processes such as: electricity production (e.g., to fuel an 
engine generator); heating (e.g., to fire boilers and/or space 
heaters); and cooling (e.g., to fire chillers or other 
refrigeration equipment). This in turn can create farm profits 
from avoided energy costs or sales of excess electricity to the 
local utility. Although methane recovery systems would require a 
large initial investment, estimated annual costs range from $100 
to $1,300 per year (for a 400 head dairy) to a cost savings of 
$10,000 per year (for a 1,400 head dairy). The initial 
investment could be recovered within six to fourteen years, 
depending on dairy size. 
The overall emission reductions from livestock waste 
operations will depend on the percentage of waste which is 
managed via the dry method (e.g., placed in storage piles) 
compared to the handled through a wet method (e.g., sent to the 
covered lagoon or digester). For purposes of the FIP reduction 
estimates, it is assumed that a minimum of 55 percent of the 
livestock waste would be sent to a lagoon or digester. Assuming 
that a hypothetical dairy farm would install a recovery system 
for liquid management and use the dry method for the remaining 
fraction of the wastes not sent to the recovery system, overall 
expected cost per ton of VOC reduced is estimated to range from 
about $2,100 per ton for a 400 head dairy to a $400 (cost) to 
$100 (savings) per ton for a 1,450 head dairy. 
Preliminary evaluation of the environmental, economic, and 
other impacts of the proposed rule are discussed in EPA's 
technical support document. VOC Emission reductions expected 
from this proposed regulation are estimated at 1.0 tpd in the 
Sacramento area and 6.0 tpd in the South Coast. No reductions 
are expected in Ventura County because all livestock waste 
operations are believed to be less than 200 head. Additional 
reductions could be achieved if the requirements were extended to 
smaller livestock waste operations, such as 250 head or greater.
EPA is requesting comments and information on a number of 
issues related to this proposed measure. Comments are requested 
on the proposed FIP requirements and/or other potential emission 
reduction strategies not addressed in the proposal. Because each 
dairy operation is unique and can vary in its waste management 
practices, comments are specifically requested on alternative 
emission reduction methods and/or more cost effective strategies 
which might achieve equivalent results to those proposed. 
EPA also requests comments and information on the number of 
dairy farms in the FIP areas which contain at least 400 head and 
the percentage of dairy farms which manage at least 55 percent of 
the livestock waste through a wet method. Because the emission 
factors used to estimate VOC emissions from these sources should 
be updated, EPA intends to explore options for additional testing 
to verify that VOC emission factors accurately reflect emissions 
expected from both wet and dry waste management methods. 
(j)(1) Fugitive Emissions from Oil and Gas Production Facilities 
and Conveying Stations (Sacramento, South Coast, Ventura).
Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(t) controls VOC fugitive leak 
emissions from valves, flanges, fittings, pumps, compressors, 
open ended lines and/or other components at oil and gas 
production facilities and conveying stations.
 1990 VOC 
emissions from these fugitive sources were estimated at 
approximately 0.9 tons per day (tpd) in the Sacramento area, 4.4 
tpd in the South Coast, and 3.8 tpd in Ventura. 





The proposed rule builds upon current regulations and 
strengthens and improves existing rules through retrofits on gas-operated control valves, lower allowable leak
thresholds, 
correction of rule deficiencies, and improved inspection and 
repair programs. The proposed regulation is based on: CARB RACT 
guidance for the control of fugitive emissions of VOCs from oil 
and gas production and processing facilities, refineries, 
chemical plants, and pipeline transfer stations; Santa Barbara 
APCD Rule 331; SCAQMD Rule 1173; and new information regarding 
gas-operated control valves. 
Currently, gas-operated control valves are not regulated in 
the FIP areas. These valves are designed to bleed upon 
actuation, resulting in the release of uncontrolled VOC 
emissions. The proposed FIP rule would require that these valves 
be retrofitted using a control valve which would reduce gas bleed 
emissions by an estimated 95 percent. EPA has estimated a 
California population of 10,000 gas-operated control valves and 
assumed that these valves are evenly distributed throughout the 
state. EPA has also assumed that the control valves are only 
used in natural gas conveyance and petroleum production. 
Comments are specifically requested on the number of gas-operated 
control valves in the FIP areas and whether these valves are used 
in other operations besides those described above. 
The proposed FIP rule will establish a fugitives regulation 
for oil and gas production and conveying stations within the 
Sacramento FIP area. Previously, these fugitive sources were 
unregulated. The majority of expected reductions will be from 
the Yolo-Solano portion of the FIP area. In the Ventura FIP 
area, the rule builds upon requirements in VCAPCD Rule 74.10 and 
lower the number of allowable leaking components and leak 
definition to requirements consistent with existing rules and 
CARB's RACT guidance.

In the South Coast FIP area, the proposed FIP rule will 
correct the gas leak definition in SCAQMD Rule 1173. The 
proposed correction defines a gas leak as total gaseous 
hydrocarbon in excess of the applicable parts per million limit 
measured as methane. 
In the Sacramento FIP area, the proposed FIP rule will 
establish an inspection and repair program. In the Ventura FIP 
area, the proposed FIP rule will further strengthen the existing 
program to make it consistent with those adopted in other 
districts and CARB's RACT guidance. 
Evaluation of the environmental, economic, and other impacts 
of the proposed rule are discussed in EPA's technical support 
document. Emission reductions expected from this proposed rule 
are estimated at 0.8 tpd in the Sacramento area, 2.8 tpd in the 
South Coast, and 2.1 tpd in Ventura. 
(j)(2) Fugitive Emissions from Gas Processing Plants, 
Refineries, Bulk Plants, Bulk Terminals, and Chemical Plants 
(Sacramento, South Coast, Ventura). Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(i) controls VOC emissions from 
fugitive leaks resulting from valves, flanges, fittings, pumps, 
compressors, open ended lines and/or other components at gas 
processing plants, refineries, bulk plants, bulk terminals, and 
chemical plants. 1990 VOC emissions from these fugitive sources 
were estimated to be less than 0.9 tons per day (tpd) in the 
Sacramento area, approximately 17.5 tpd in the South Coast, and 
0.8 tpd in Ventura. 
The proposed rule builds upon current or proposed 
regulations and strengthens and improves existing rules through: 
regulation of additional fugitive sources; lower allowable leak 
thresholds; correction of rule deficiencies; and improved 
inspection and repair programs. The proposed FIP regulation is 
based on: CARB RACT guidance for the control of fugitive 
emissions of VOCs from oil and gas production and processing 
facilities, refineries, chemical plants, and pipeline transfer 
stations; Bay Area AQMD (BAAQMD) Regulation 9_Rules 18, 22, and 
25; SCAQMD Rule 1173; and EPA's proposed National Emission 
Standards for Organic Hazardous Air Pollutants (HON) from the 
synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry and equipment 
leaks from seven other processes (FR 52 62685).
 




The proposed rule will establish and/or lower allowable leak 
levels for affected components. Allowable leak levels for valves 
and connectors are proposed at 500 parts per million based on 
BAAQMD regulations
 and EPA's proposed HON. Allowable leak 
levels for other components are proposed at levels based on 
CARB's RACT guidance and SCAQMD Rule 1173. 





In all three FIP areas, the proposed measure will regulate 
fugitives from bulk plants and bulk terminals. Because only a 
portion of these sources have traditionally been regulated for 
their fugitive emissions (i.e., loading and storage of petroleum 
liquids), fugitive emissions may have been underestimated in 
previous inventory projections. Because emission factors were 
not readily available for these sources, emission estimates were 
made using fugitive emission factors for refineries. Preliminary 
analyses have determined that bulk plant and bulk terminal 
emissions may account for as much as an additional 2.9 tpd in the 
Sacramento area, 9.3 tpd in the South Coast, and 1.7 tpd in 
Ventura. Potential reductions from these sources alone would be 
2.2 tpd in the Sacramento area, 4.1 tpd in the South Coast, and 
1.4 tpd in Ventura. EPA requests comments and information 
regarding appropriate emission factors to use for fugitive 
emissions from bulk plants and bulk terminals. 
The proposed FIP rule will correct the gas leak definition 
in South Coast AQMD Rule 1173. The proposed correction defines a 
gas leak as total gaseous hydrocarbon in excess of the applicable 
parts per million limit measured as methane. 
Evaluation of the environmental, economic, and other impacts 
of the proposed rule are discussed in EPA's technical support 
document. Emission reductions expected from this proposed rule 
are estimated to be 0.7 tpd in the Sacramento area, 3.1 tpd in 
the South Coast, and 0.7 tpd in Ventura. Fugitive emission 
reductions from bulk plants and bulk terminals are not included 
in the above estimates. 
(k) Service Stations (Sacramento, Ventura, South Coast). Proposed rule 40 CFR 52.2961(j) reduces VOC emissions
from 
gasoline dispensing facilities. Gasoline service stations are a 
source of VOC emissions created during vehicle refueling and 
storage tank working/breathing losses. Service station VOC 
emissions are estimated at approximately 3.2 tpd in the 
Sacramento area, 25.3 tpd in the South Coast, and 1.2 tpd in 
Ventura. Although service stations in the FIP areas currently 
have vapor recovery systems, the proposed FIP rule builds upon 
current Phase I and Phase II regulations and strengthens and 
improves existing rules by requiring pressure/vacuum relief 
valves on open vent pipes and the phasing out of inefficient 
vapor recovery system components. 
Pressure-vacuum relief valves are expected to virtually 
eliminate breathing and working losses from the storage tank vent 
pipe. Pressure-vacuum relief valves cost less than fifty 
dollars, are easily installed without underground construction, 
and improve efficiency of existing vapor recovery systems by one 
to three percent. The pressure/vacuum relief valves typically 
pay for themselves within less than one year and result in a cost 
savings. Additional emission reductions will be achieved through 
elimination of exemptions and the replacement of remote check 
valves in Phase II control systems. The Phase I efficiency is 
expected to be increased through the combined impact of the 
requirements for poppetted drybreaks in the Phase I vapor control 
systems, the installation of the pressure-vacuum valve on the 
vent pipes, and the installation of CARB certified spill boxes. 
Phase II efficiency is expected to be increased through the 
combined impact of using proper tubing between the riser and 
dispenser cabinet, requiring a certified insertion interlock 
mechanism on all bellows-equipped nozzles, and replacing non- 
coaxial hose with coaxial hose. Many of the proposed revisions 
are based on recent amendments to BAAQMD Regulation 8, Rule 7_
Gasoline Dispensing Facilities. 
Emission reductions expected from this proposed rule are 
estimated at 1.3 tpd in the Sacramento area, 8.9 tpd in the South 
Coast, and 0.3 tpd in Ventura. Because fuel savings result from 
installation of the pressure/vacuum relief valves and because 
inefficient vapor recovery components wear out and can be 
replaced by more efficient components during regularly scheduled 
maintenance, the cost impacts of the proposed measure will be 
minimized. The overall cost effectiveness is estimated at $1,600 
per ton of VOC reduced. 
(l) Waste Burning (Sacramento, South Coast, and Ventura). 
Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(k) controls VOC emissions from waste 
burning. Waste burning activities are defined as agricultural 
burning, range management burning, forest management burning, and 
open burning. 1990 waste burning emissions
 were estimated at 
3.8 tpd in the Sacramento FIP area, 0.7 tpd in the South Coast 
FIP area, and less than 0.1 in the Ventura FIP area. 




Most waste burning activities are currently restricted by a 
permissive burn/no-burn day program as specified in the 
California Health and Safety Code Regulations. This program 
allows the local air district office to declare a permissive burn 
day or a no-burn day, requires that subject sources obtain a burn 
permit from the local designated county or state agency, and 
limits burning to permissive burn days. Waste burning is 
restricted to days with acceptable air quality based largely on 
current and forecasted visibility and particulate levels. 
The proposed FIP rule would complement and expand the 
current permissive burn/no-burn day program to incorporate 
ambient ozone air quality considerations. The purpose of this 
proposal is not to ban waste burning but to restrict waste 
burning to days when ambient ozone concentrations are within 
acceptable levels. On days predicted to exceed the California 
ambient air quality standard for ozone (0.09 ppm), all forms of 
waste burning would be prohibited. EPA is currently 
investigating the methodologies used to predict ozone exceedances 
and no-burn days. These methodologies could be used to predict 
air quality conditions using current and forecasted weather, 
meteorology, ozone levels, and other relevant criteria. A 
similar forecasting strategy would be used as part of the 
proposed FIP waste burning rule. SMAQMD has a voluntary 
permissive burn/no-burn program which takes into account 
predicted high ambient ozone levels. VCAPCD restricts burning 
when the California ozone standard of 0.09 ppm is expected to be 
exceeded. 
Although not contained within the proposed FIP rule, EPA 
expects to establish a notification system compatible with and 
similar to those already in place for current permissive burn 
day/no-burn day programs. 
Because poor visibility or high particulate levels can also 
result during conditions conducive to high ambient ozone levels, 
there is expected to be some overlap between current no-burn days 
and any additional no-burn days resulting from the proposed FIP 
program. During 1990 no-burn days were declared on 16 days in 
the Sacramento FIP area, 68 days in the South Coast FIP area, and 
311 days in the Ventura FIP area. Using 1990 air quality data, 
the proposed rule is expected to restrict burning on an estimated 
additional 45 days per year (dpy) in the Sacramento FIP area, 121 
dpy in the South Coast FIP area, 3 dpy in the Ventura FIP area. 
In the Sacramento area, the largest impact would occur on days 
during July through September when ozone levels typically reach 
their highest levels. In the South Coast, the largest impact 
would occur on high ozone days during March through October. 
Because of Ventura's current policy on waste burning, the 
proposal would have minimal impact.

Open burning operations at single and two-family dwellings 
are currently exempt from most permissive burn/no-burn day 
programs. Although EPA is not proposing that these sources be 
required to obtain a burn permit, the proposed FIP regulation 
would also require that this type of burning activity be 
restricted to permissive burn days. Comments are requested on 
the impacts and issues resulting from including these sources in 
the proposed FIP regulation. 

The cost resulting from the lost opportunity to burn waste 
on the additional no-burn days would be minimized by allowing 
sources to burn on days when exceedances are not predicted. In 
the case of Sacramento, the proposed rule is expected to allow 
waste burning during over 80 percent of the calendar days each 
year. However, in the South Coast, where the state ozone 
standard is exceeded roughly 50 percent of the calendar days each 
year, the proposed rule would restrict burning to approximately 
50 percent of the calendar days per year. The impact of the 
proposed FIP measure in Ventura is expected to be minimal since 
the district has already instituted a policy of restricting 
burning when the state standard is predicted to be exceeded. 

Comments are requested on the feasibility of this strategy 
for the FIP areas, especially for the South Coast FIP area. EPA 
also requests information on potential costs resulting from the 
proposed FIP measure. Comments are also requested on alternative 
strategies (e.g., soil incorporation, residue removal, after 
market disposal alternatives) which will reduce waste burning 
impacts on ambient ozone air quality. EPA seeks comments on ways 
to avoid any increased costs and increased pesticide use that may 
be associated with the rule. Comments are requested on potential 
VOC reductions resulting from implementation of the Connelly-Areias-Chandler Rice Straw Burning Reduction Act
of 1991 
(California Health & Safety Code, Part 4, Chapter 3, Article 3, 
Section 41865). 

Comments are requested on the necessity of exemptions in the 
proposed FIP measure. For example, California district offices 
may exempt a source from no burn day prohibitions during 
circumstances of imminent and substantial economic loss. 
However, these terms are undefined. Comments are requested on an 
appropriate definition for the aforementioned terms. 

EPA is also requesting comment on an alternative to the 
aforementioned strategy. As an alternative, a waste burning 
measure could be designed to only allow waste burning during the 
period of the year when ozone levels are within the state ozone 
standard, typically November through February depending on the 
area. This alternative would supplement the current no-burn day 
program and prohibit burning during the ozone season. This 
approach would provide greater certainty to affected parties so 
they could adequately plan their burn schedules; however, it 
would also provide less flexibility by prohibiting burning on 
days expected to be within ozone standard. 

While EPA is continuing to evaluate the emissions inventory 
and potential reductions from the proposed FIP measure, 
preliminary emission reduction estimates from the 1990 baseline 
are 1.8 to 3.6 tpd in the Sacramento area, 0.3 to 0.5 tpd in the 
South Coast FIP area, and less than 0.1 tpd in the Ventura FIP 
area. Actual reductions will depend on the overall effectiveness 
of the FIP measure. 

(m) Residential Water Heaters (Sacramento). Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(l) controls NO

X

 emissions resulting from residential water heaters. Emission reductions are achieved 
by: (1) replacement of conventional gas-fired water heaters with 
low-NO

X

 units; (2) replacement of conventional gas-fired water 
heaters with electric water heaters; or (3) installation of solar 
panels to decrease natural gas consumption associated with the 
use of gas-fired water heaters. 

The proposed rule applies to any natural gas-fired water 
heater installed in the Sacramento FIP area after August 15, 
1995, which emits in excess of 40 nanograms of NO

X

 (calculated as 
weight equivalent NO

X

 per joule) and with a heat input rating 
less than 75,000 British thermal units per hour (Btu/hr). The 
rule does not apply to water heaters with a rated heat input of 
75,000 Btu/hr or greater, used for recreational vehicles, or used 
exclusively to heat swimming pools and hot tubs. 

The proposed rule is based largely on SCAQMD Rule 1121, 
BAAQMD Regulation 9_Rule 6, and VCAPCD Rule 74.11. 

Evaluation of the environmental, economic, and other impacts 
of the proposed rule are discussed in detail in EPA's technical 
support document. The proposed rule is expected to result in a 
cost savings created by the more energy efficient units and lower 
cost of the low-NO

X

 units (compared to currently sold units). 
Considering the long-term fuel costs for residential water 
heating, solar water heaters can also be a cost-effective option. 

As described in the technical support document, uncontrolled 
1990 NO

X

 emissions from residential water heaters were 1.8 tpd in 
the Sacramento FIP area. Emissions are projected to continue to 
grow to 2.3 tpd in 1999 and to 2.7 tpd in 2005. Implementation 
of this proposed rule is projected to reduce those emissions by 
0.2 and 0.6 tpd respectively at a retail cost savings of $3.00 to 
$19.00 per heater (1992 dollars) if replaced with a low-NO

X

 
heater. Additional reductions will continue to occur until 
approximately 2008 when it is expected that all existing units 
will have been replaced
 by the low-NO

X

 units. Energy savings 
and costs would also accrue if currently available low-NO

X

, 
higher efficiency units or solar powered water heaters were used. 
While electric water heaters are also an option, electricity 
currently costs approximately three times the cost of natural gas 
in the Sacramento area. 





Additional reductions could be achieved in all three FIP 
areas by requiring that a percentage of new housing starts in the 
areas install solar water heater systems. While it is not 
feasible for EPA to require this approach through a FIP 
regulation, it is very feasible for local communities to adopt 
ordinances that require a percentage of solar water heaters in 
new construction. Examples of such communities include the Gold 
River Area Housing Development in Sacramento, the City of La 
Verne in Los Angeles County, and the cities of Thousand Oaks and 
Del Mar. 

Comments are requested on additional methods or options, 
such as market incentives and methods encouraging solar 
technologies, which might further reduce NO

X

 emissions from 
residential water heaters. 

(n) Stationary Internal Combustion Engines (Sacramento). Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(m) controls NO

X

 emissions resulting 
from stationary internal combustion (IC) engines. These engines 
are used for a variety of applications including electric power 
generation for both base and standby service, oil and gas 
pipeline pumping/transport, oil and gas exploration and 
production, irrigation, hoisting, and nuclear power plant 
emergency cooling water pump operation. Engines are generally 
classified by fuel type, method of ignition, combustion cycle, 
and charging method. 1990 NO

X

 emissions from IC engines in the 
Sacramento FIP area were estimated at 2.6 tons per day. 

Several control techniques are available for controlling NO

X

 
emissions from IC engines. Combustion controls include exhaust 
gas recirculation, prestratified charge, injection timing retard, 
pre-ignition chamber combustion, control of the air-to-fuel 
ratio, and wet injection. Post combustion add-on controls 
include selective noncatalytic reduction selective catalytic 
reduction. Other control techniques include conversion of fuel-fired engines to electric motors or the use of alternative
fuels 
such as methanol in place of diesel fuel. 

The proposed rule applies to any owner or operator of an IC 
engine rated at 50 or more brake horsepower in the Sacramento 
area. After May 15, 1997, all IC engines shall meet a parts per 
million NO

X

 standard based on engine and fuel type as follows: 
rich-burn engines, 25 ppm; lean-burn engines, 45 ppm; diesel 80, 
ppm; rich-burn (waste gas), 50 ppm; lean-burn (waste gas), 125 
ppm. VOC and CO limits are also included within the standards. 
Engines rated at less than 50 brake horsepower or operated less 
than 200 hours per calendar year are exempt from the requirements 
of the proposed rule. Additional exemptions are provided for 
very low or specialized uses. 

The proposed rule limits are based largely on SCAQMD Rule 
1110.2, VCAPCD Rule 74.9, and EPA's ACT guidance for IC engines.

Evaluation of the environmental, economic, and other impacts 
are discussed in detail in EPA's technical support document. The 
rule is expected to affect approximately 100 IC engines in the 
Sacramento FIP area. Although there are additional IC engines in 
the FIP area, these sources are already meeting the proposed FIP 
limits or would be exempt from the proposed measure. As 
described in the technical support document, 1990 uncontrolled 
NO

X

 emissions from subject sources were estimated at 2.6 tons/day 
(tpd). Implementation of this rule is expected to reduce those 
emissions by 2.3 tpd at an average estimated cost of $7,200 per 
ton of NO

X

 reduced. 

It is important to note that this proposed rule will be 
amended in the final promulgation to further clarify which 
engines are subject to the rule's provisions. The effect of such 
amendment may be to exempt from the requirements of this rule any 
new IC engines which will be subject to proposed FIP nonroad 
engine rules or national nonroad engine regulations issued under 
EPA's authority for regulating mobile sources in accordance with 
Title II of the Act. These mobile IC engines are proposed to be 
governed by specific emission standards and other requirements 
discussed below in section III.D.4. 

The emission reduction estimates presented above are 
associated with reductions only from existing IC engines 
reflected in the 1990 emissions inventory. In the final FIP, EPA 
will attempt to adjust this calculation of credit to clarify the 
relationship between reductions from this proposed rule and 
reductions from the nonroad engine rule proposed in III.D.5., 
which applies to newly manufactured nonroad IC engines. The 
adjustment would amend NO

X

 reduction credits attributed to 
proposed rule 40 CFR 52.2961(m), by a factor relating to the 
expected turnover of existing IC engines through the year of 
attainment. 

(o) Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional Boilers, Steam 
Generators, and Process Heaters (Sacramento). 
(1) Biomass Boilers. 
Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(n) controls NO

X

 emissions resulting 
from biomass boilers. Biomass boilers typically burn wood, wood 
waste, and/or bark as a fuel source. Almond shells, landfill 
gas, or natural gas have also been used as a supplemental fuel 
source. Emission reductions are achieved through application of 
selective noncatalytic reduction or selective catalytic 
reduction. Both systems are post-combustion NO

X

 control 
techniques in which ammonia (or urea) is injected into the flue 
gas to reduce NO

X

 to nitrogen and water. 

The proposed rule applies to any owner or operator of a 
biomass boiler or steam generator with a rated heat input 
capacity equal to or greater than 5 million British thermal units 
per hour (mmBtu/hr) and an annual heat input greater than or 
equal to 9 billion Btu/yr. After May 15, 1997, biomass boilers 
shall either meet a 70 ppm NO

X

 standard or reduce uncontrolled 
NO

X

 emissions by 50 percent. 

The proposed rule limits are based largely on demonstrated 
controls at approximately 30 different biomass boilers located in 
the U.S. Although a SIP rule written solely for biomass boilers 
does not exist in any other California districts, the FIP rule is 
modeled after currently adopted NO

X

 boiler rules in California. 

Evaluation of the environmental, economic, and other impacts 
are discussed in detail in EPA's technical support document. The 
rule is expected to affect biomass boilers at five sources 
(Michigan California Lumber, SierraPine Limited, Lausmann Lumber 
and Moulding, Formica Corporation, and Blue Diamond) in the 
Sacramento FIP area. Three of these sources (Michigan California 
Lumber, SierraPine Limited, and Formica Corporation) are also 
subject to RACT rules in this FIP proposal (see section III.C.2). 
Although additional biomass boilers are located in the FIP area, 
these boilers are already meeting the proposed FIP limits. 

As described in the technical support document, 1990 
uncontrolled NO

X

 emissions from these five sources were 0.8 tpd. 
Implementation of this proposed rule is projected to reduce those 
emissions by 0.34 tpd at an average estimated cost of $2,500 per 
ton of NO

X

 reduced. 

Additional reductions could be achieved by requiring 
replacement of the biomass boilers with new boilers which burn 
cleaner fuels (e.g., natural gas), although this may not be a 
cost effective option for some sources. 

(2) Gaseous/Liquid Fuel Fired Boilers with a Rated Heat Input 
Capacity of Equal to or Greater than 5 mmBtu/hr. 
Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(u) controls NO

X

 emissions resulting 
from boilers, steam generators, and process heaters which have a 
rated heat input capacity of greater than 5 mmBtu/hr. A boiler 
or steam generator is used to produce steam which is then used to 
produce mechanical power, thermal energy, or electricity. A 
process heater is combustion equipment used to transfer heat 
indirectly to water or process streams. These units can be fired 
with natural gas, propane, distillate or residual oil, or 
landfill or sewage gas. 

Emission reductions are achieved through: (1) Retrofitting 
units with low-NO

X

 burners; (2) retrofitting units with flue gas 
recirculation systems; (3) application of selective noncatalytic 
reduction (e.g., installing an ammonia injection system); or (4) 
application of selective catalytic reduction (e.g., installing an 
ammonia injection system with a catalyst). 

The proposed rule applies to any owner or operator of a 
boiler, steam generator, and process heater which has a rated 
heat input capacity of equal to or greater than 5 mmBtu/hr. 
After May 15, 1997, all units with an annual heat input rate 
greater or equal to 9 billion Btu per year (10

9

 Btu/yr) and using 
gaseous fuels shall meet a 30 ppm NO

X

 standard; units using 
liquid fuels shall meet a 40 ppm NO

X

 standard. Units that 
operate with an annual heat input rate less than 9 x 10

9

 Btu/yr 
shall be tuned once every six months or after 750 hours of 
operation. 

The proposed rule limits and requirements are based largely 
on SCAQMD Rule 1146, VCAPCD Rule 74.15, Yolo-Solano AQMD Rule 
2.27, CARB's RACT/BARCT guidance, and EPA's ACT document for 
process heaters. 

Evaluation of the environmental, economic, and other impacts 
are discussed in detail in EPA's technical support document. The 
rule is expected to affect approximately 60 units in the 
Sacramento FIP area. Approximately nine of these units are 
already scheduled for replacement with cleaner burning 
cogeneration gas turbines. As described in the technical support 
document, 1990 uncontrolled NO

X

 emissions from these sources were 
1.2 tpd. Implementation of this proposed rule is projected to 
reduce those emissions by 0.78 tpd at an average estimated cost 
of $6,900 per ton of NO

X

 reduced. 

(3) Gaseous/Liquid Fuel-Fired Boilers with a Rated Heat Input 
Capacity of less than 5 mmBtu/hr but greater than 1 mmBtu/hr. 
Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(v) controls NO

X

 emissions resulting 
from boilers, steam generators, and process heaters which have a 
rated heat input capacity of less than 5 mmBtu/hr but greater 
than 1 mmBtu/hr. A boiler or steam generator is used to produce 
steam which is then used to produce mechanical power, thermal 
energy, or electricity. A process heater is combustion equipment 
used to transfer heat indirectly to water or process streams. 
These units are typically fired with natural gas or propane. 
Emission reductions are achieved through retrofitting units with 
low-NO

X

 burners. 

The proposed rule applies to any owner or operator of a 
boiler, steam generator, and process heater which has a rated 
heat input capacity of less than 5 mmBtu/hr but greater than 1 
mmBtu/hr. After May 15, 1997, all units with an annual heat 
input rate greater than or equal to 1.8 x 10

9

 Btu/yr shall meet a 
30 ppm NO

X

 standard. Units that operate with an annual heat 
input rate less than 1.8 x 109 Btu/yr but greater than 0.3 x 10

9

 
Btu/yr shall be tuned once every six months or after 750 hours of 
operation. 

The proposed rule limits and requirements are based largely 
on SCAQMD Rule 1146.1 and VCAPCD Rule 74.15.1. Evaluation of the 
environmental, economic, and other impacts are discussed in 
detail in EPA's technical support document.

The proposed rule is expected to affect approximately 25 
units in the Sacramento FIP area. As described in the technical 
support document, 1990 uncontrolled NO

X

 emissions from these 
sources were 0.05 tpd or 19.2 tpy. 

Implementation of this proposed rule is projected to reduce 
those emissions by 9.2 tpy at an average estimated annual savings 
of $4,600 per ton of NO

X

 reduced. The savings accrue from an 
estimated 10 percent reduction in fuel resulting from the 
installation of low-NO

X

 burners. 

(p) Gas Turbines (Sacramento). 
Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(o) controls NO

X

 emissions resulting 
from gas turbines. A gas turbine is an internal combustion 
engine that operates with a rotary rather than a reciprocating 
motion. Compressed air and fuel are introduced to the combustor 
section were the fuel is burned. Hot combustion gases then enter 
the turbine section, where the gases rotate one or more shafts 
which power the compressor and electric generator. Electric 
utilities and cogenerators use gas turbines to produce 
electricity and useful thermal energy. Gas turbines can burn a 
variety of fuels including natural gas, waste process gases, or 
liquid fuels such as distillate oils. 

There are three generic control techniques available for 
controlling NO

X

 emissions from gas turbines: (1) Injection of 
water or steam into the combustor; (2) add-on post combustion 
controls (e.g., selective catalytic reduction); and (3) 
modification to combustor designs. 

The proposed rule applies to any owner or operator of a 
stationary gas turbine with a rated heat output capacity equal to 
or greater than 0.3 megawatt (MW). After May 15, 1997, all 
stationary gas turbines rated equal to or greater than 0.3 but 
less than 2.9 MW shall meet a compliance limit based on 25 ppm 
NO

X

 times a demonstrated percent efficiency. Stationary gas 
turbines rated equal to or greater than 2.9 MW shall meet a 
compliance limit based on 9 ppm NO

X

 times a demonstrated percent 
efficiency. Peaking units and emergency standby units operated 
less than 200 hours per calendar year are exempt from the 
reduction requirements but must keep records to verify hour of 
operation. Additional exemptions are provided for very 
specialized uses. 

The proposed rule limits are based largely on SCAQMD Rule 
1134, CARB RACT/BARCT guidance, and EPA's ACT guidelines. 

Evaluation of the environmental, economic, and other impacts 
are discussed in detail in EPA's technical support document. The 
proposed rule is expected to affect gas turbines at only one 
source (i.e., Proctor and Gamble) in the Sacramento FIP area. 
However, the Procter and Gamble unit is currently scheduled for 
replacement with a newer gas turbine which will operate at 5 ppm 
NO

area, these units are already meeting the proposed FIP limits or

4. Regulations Imposed Statewide 



a. Introduction_Rationale for Statewide Control._Section 110(a)(2)(A) of the Act directs states to include in

a SIP those enforceable control measures necessary to demonstrate 
attainment. This requirement extends to development of federal 
plans. Paragraphs III.C.4.b-e of this NPRM describe a set of 
area source rules that EPA is proposing to implement on a 
statewide basis in order to assure compliance and emission 
reductions. In addition, an option for a statewide manufacturers 
rule is discussed for the solvents and coatings categories 
regulated under the proposed VOC cap rules (see section III.C.5). 

EPA is proposing statewide requirements for area source 
categories that consist of portable VOC-containing materials 
including architectural coatings, pesticides, aerosol paints and 
other consumer products. These categories differ from 
traditional point source categories for which emissions 
principally occur at a few stable locations where products are 
manufactured. In contrast, area sources are distributed widely 
and emit pollutants where products are used. EPA believes that 
regulations for these categories will be most effective if 
applied uniformly throughout the State. 

Most notably, EPA cannot assure compliance for these area 
source categories at the point of emissions as achieved with 
point sources. This would require routine inspection and 
enforcement against individual consumers for using, for example, 
high VOC house paints and bathroom cleansers. EPA has neither 
the resources for such a program, nor the expectation that 
individual consumers should be responsible for monitoring the VOC 
contents of their paints and cleansers. Instead, EPA must rely 
on compliance at point of sale or manufacture such as, in this 
example, paint and cleanser distributors. 

Unfortunately, because there is little threat of enforcement 
against actual product users, EPA believes that regulations 
affecting these categories would be routinely circumvented if 
standards varied in neighboring areas. If, for example, the 
architectural coating rule applied only in the narrow FIP areas, 
house painters in southern Sutter County (part of the 
nonattainment area) might drive to northern Sutter (outside the 
nonattainment area) to purchase cheaper paints, or lemon growers 
in Ventura might cross into Santa Barbara for a pesticide 
formulation they had used the year before. 

While EPA has not attempted to quantify the erosion in 
projected emission reductions that would occur if these FIP rules 
were implemented on an area rather than statewide basis, there is 
much anecdotal evidence to confirm that considerable 
circumvention of the rules would occur. California air pollution 
agencies, for example, believe such circumvention routinely 
erodes the effectiveness of existing architectural coating, 
automobile refinishing, and other local regulations. Such 
circumvention is an important force behind the ongoing national 
regulatory negotiation designed to establish consistent 
architectural coating standards. It is also a primary rationale 
for existing California legislation requiring statewide 
regulation of consumer products. 

One could extend this discussion to argue that these area 
source rules should be implemented on a national basis. 
Particularly along the northern and eastern State borders, EPA 
expects some circumvention of rules affective only in California. 
These borders are relatively scarcely populated, however, and 
fairly far from the FIP areas. EPA expects, therefore, minimal 
impact in the FIP areas and believe that the State of California 
is the most appropriate area in which to implement these rules. 

While the need for enforceability is the primary and 
independently legally sufficient justification for implementing 
these rules on a statewide basis, several additional benefits to 
this approach are discussed below: 

(i) 

Consistency. 

With the exception of architectural 
coatings, all the categories proposed as statewide measures in 
this NPRM are currently addressed in California on a statewide 
basis.
 Statewide FIP measures maintain consistency with these 
regulations, minimizing unnecessary complexity for all concerned 
parties.

<TEXT>
 


(ii) 

Fairness. 

Statewide rules would provide a more level playing field than do area-specific requirements. Area-specific pesticide
controls, for example, might place parsley growers in Ventura at a competitive disadvantage compared to parsley
growers in San Joaquin. Statewide rules minimize the potential for such inequities, helping fulfill one of the FIP
goals discussed in section I.B of this NPRM. In addition, many parts of California besides the FIP areas have significant
ambient ozone problems, including San Diego, the San Joaquin Valley, and the Southeast Desert. These areas may also
need the statewide controls described in this NPRM in order to attain the health-based ozone standard.
(iii) 

Reduce costs to industry. 

From an industry perspective, it is important for certain types of rules to be consistent throughout the state. In
this instance, EPA believes that most manufacturers support statewide regulations for the suggested source categories.
Coating manufacturers complain, for example, of the current expense and complexity of complying with different
standards in California's many districts. These expenses accrue not only from research resources needed to develop
multiple coatings, but from subsequent complexities in marketing, distributing, and tracking compliance. All
these tasks would be simplified, however, by establishing one standard for the entire State as proposed in this NPRM.


b. Architectural Coatings_

Architectural and industrial maintenance (AIM) coatings are coatings or paints generally used by consumers and
contractors. These coatings are formulated and recommended for field application to structures (e.g., residences,
commercial buildings, and bridges) and their appurtenances (e.g., doors, cabinets, fences, railings, and gutters).
AIM coatings primarily provide a decorative and/or general protective function. Although there are a myriad of types
and grades, AIM coatings are generally classified as exterior and interior paints, industrial maintenance coatings,
roof coatings, primers, lacquers, stains, traffic paints, and specialty coatings.
These coatings are formulated with a variety of components including pigments, resins, solvents, and additives.
Solvents, which are typically VOCs, often contribute to the formation of ozone as they volatilize after application.
AIM coatings have been regulated in California since the late 1970s and all major metropolitan areas in the State have
an architectural coating rule. AIM coating emissions for California were estimated at 197 tpd (in 1989), with approximately
50 percent of the emissions within the three FIP areas. 1990 FIP area emissions were estimated at 92 tpd in the South
Coast, 5 tpd in Ventura, and 12 tpd in the Sacramento area. Because of the magnitude of emissions resulting from this
group of coatings, EPA is proposing a FIP measure which will provide reductions to help demonstrate attainment in
the FIP areas.

The proposed AIM coatings FIP rule (see 40 CFR 52.2959) builds upon the California Air Resources Board_California
Air Pollution Control Officers Association 1989 Suggested Control Measure (SCM) for Architectural Coatings and
upon current district rules. In addition, and parallel to the FIP effort, EPA is involved in a Regulatory Negotiation
 (Reg Neg) for the development of a national AIM coating regulation. The relationship between a potential national
rule and the proposed FIP rule is discussed later in this section. Where possible, EPA has attempted to take into account
the potential outcome of the Reg Neg and its possible impact on a FIP regulation.




The proposal is modeled after the 1989 SCM and currently adopted California regulations, and it incorporates recent
information regarding low VOC AIM coatings. The proposed regulation phases in lower coating limits from 1996 to 2003.
In January 1996, initial limits for approximately 40 coating categories will go into effect. This will be followed
by a second reduction phase in 2000 with lower limits for select categories such as: all clear wood finishes [350 grams
of VOC per liter (g/l)]; concrete curing compounds (250 g/l); and traffic paints (125 g/l). A third reduction phase
in 2003 will lower limits for select categories such as: varnishes (250 g/l); flats (50-150 g/l); many industrial
maintenance coatings (275 g/l); non-flats (150 g/l); roof coatings (250 g/l); and traffic paints (50 g/l). In addition,
the small container (less than one liter) exemption will be phased out as of 2003.
The environmental, economic, and other impacts of the proposed rule are discussed in EPA's technical support document.
The rule is expected to affect approximately 150 paint manufacturers who market their AIM coatings in the State. Implementation
of this rule is expected to reduce emissions by an estimated 25-30 percent, depending on the stringency of the
current SIP regulation for a given district. FIP area reductions are expected to be 2.0 tpd (1999) and 2.3 tpd (2005)
for Sacramento, 1.7 tpd (2005) in Ventura, and 21 tpd (2010) in South Coast.
The proposed FIP AIM coating rule establishes future effective limits which allow industry time to transition, where
necessary, to lower VOC coatings. For the most part, low VOC coatings are being sold today which can meet the limits
proposed for 2000 and 2003. While EPA acknowledges that the proposed limits may in some cases phase out certain high
VOC technologies (e.g., nitrocellulose lacquers), the proposal assumes that available alternative resin technologies
can adequately replace high VOC coatings. The proposal will also encourage the further development of new and improved
low VOC technologies.
As described earlier, AIM coatings are formulated with pigments, resins, solvents, and additives. Changes and improvements
in coating technologies begin in the research laboratories of the resin manufacturers/suppliers and paint manufacturers
capable of researching new resin technologies. The cost of phasing in lower VOC AIM coatings will depend in part on
the ability of resin manufacturers/suppliers and paint manufacturers to develop and market low VOC coatings. For
those already manufacturing low VOC products, the proposed regulation would initially impose no additional costs
and might, in fact, lead to increased profits. For AIM coating manufacturers who manufacture high VOC coatings affected
by the proposed rule, the cost may approach several thousand $/ton for conversion to low VOC product lines. These costs
can be partially reduced through the assistance of resin manufacturers/suppliers and/or large paint manufacturers,
who are primarily responsible for researching and developing new coating formulations. Upon request, most resin
manufacturers/suppliers are willing to share information and sample low VOC coating formulations with interested
paint manufacturers, both large and small, to assist in the development of low VOC coatings.
While low VOC coatings are available today which meet the proposed coating limits, there continues to be debate over
the performance characteristics and perceived limitations of certain low VOC AIM coatings. EPA requests comment
and technical information on: available or soon to be available low VOC coatings which meet the proposed limits; previous
or potential reformulation costs; performance or application limitations (if any) of low VOC coatings; and any AIM
coatings or promising technologies where low VOC technology is expected to advance beyond the proposed AIM FIP limits.
(1) Relationship to National Rule Development. In early 1992, EPA began to explore a Reg Neg (57 FR 1443; January 14,
1992) to assist in fulfilling its obligation for a national AIM regulation or CTG as described under section 183(e)
of the Act. Although today's proposed FIP action is independent of the ongoing Reg Neg process and is not an attempt
by the Agency to meet the requirements of section 183(e), EPA will fully consider the potential Reg Neg outcome and
may modify the proposed FIP rule as appropriate.
Either a FIP AIM coating rule or a national AIM coating rule/CTG will ultimately provide the basis for the regulation
which reduces emissions from AIM coatings sold into and used in California. While the Reg Neg process is nearing completion,
unresolved issues remain and EPA does not anticipate that the proposed action under section 183(e) will be published
prior to the court-ordered FIP proposal deadline. In addition, there is not a statutory deadline for an AIM rule per
se under section 183(e),
 so there is currently no assurance as to when the AIM regulation will be finalized. Because of the need to demonstrate
through actual regulations the emission reductions necessary to achieve attainment in the FIP areas, EPA could not
rely on the speculative outcome of the Reg Neg for its FIP rule and is therefore proposing a FIP AIM rule. While EPA is
hopeful that the Reg Neg will result in a rule/CTG which could benefit the FIP areas, the court ordered deadline for
the FIP proposal does not allow EPA the opportunity to wait for the potential national rule/CTG. Upon completion of
the Reg Neg process and EPA's proposed national AIM rule/CTG, EPA will reevaluate its FIP strategy for AIM coatings.




(2) Relationship to Local Rules. While all of the major metropolitan areas in California already have an architectural
coatings rule, coating limits may vary between districts for certain AIM categories. Because the proposed FIP regulation
will be more stringent than all current district regulations, the proposed FIP rule will effectively bring all of
the areas under a common standard to provide equity within the industry and greatly enhance the enforceability the
rule.





(3) Alternative Reduction Approaches. The following additional approaches for reducing emissions from AIM coatings
were also considered.

(a) Fees. Because of large diversity within and among AIM coating categories and because of the multitude of uses for
these coatings, it may be preferable to establish a fee-based strategy for providing additional emission reductions
rather than to establish limits for specific categories. For example, a fee-based strategy could be established
using a combination of gallons sold and VOC in each gallon (e.g., an annual fee equaling total grams or pounds of VOC
sold by each manufacturer). Because fees provide uncertainty as to actual emission reductions, the fees would need
to be periodically adjusted to achieve their intended reduction and market response. Currently, EPA has limited
FIP authority (see III.A.2.b. and c.) to collect and redistribute fees. Because fees have previously not been used
as an emission reduction strategy, limited data is available to predict and establish the level of fee necessary to
achieve the intended reductions. With these constraints in mind, EPA is asking for comment on the potential use of
fee-based approaches for within the FIP. This concept is also discussed in III.C.5.i.(3). 

(b) Corporate Average VOC Emission (CAVE) Limit. Within the Reg Neg discussions, the concept of a CAVE limit has been
suggested. The CAVE limit would allow each manufacturer to average all coatings sold nationally to meet a single,
overall grams of VOC per liter CAVE limit. The CAVE limit would be based on a table of standards (e.g., VOC limits for
each category) and the previous sales for each manufacturer. In theory, the CAVE approach could be applied in the FIP
on a statewide basis. Because the limit is based on averaging, it could provide uncertainty as to the expected reductions
(e.g., increased use of both a high and low VOC coating may not decrease actual emissions to the predicted amount).
Therefore, a backstop measure (e.g., a cap on overall emissions per manufacturer) may be needed to guarantee expected
reductions. Although the details of this concept have not been worked out, EPA is asking for comment on the potential
use of a CAVE approach for AIM coatings regulated within the FIP. 

(c) Manufacturers Bubble. In EPA's 1990 FIP proposal, the concept of a manufacturers bubble was proposed as a backstop
measure. This approach would establish a single gram or pound of VOC per year limit for each manufacturer selling coatings
within California. Each manufacturer's limit could be established using a table of standards and historical annual
sales. This approach aggressively encourages the use of low-VOC coatings, provides greater assurance of actual
reductions, and could potentially be expanded to incorporate additional flexibility, such as a banking/trading
component. Although the details of this concept have not been worked out, EPA is asking for comment on the potential
use of a manufacturers bubble for coatings regulated within the FIP. This concept is further discussed in III.C.5.i.

c. Consumer Products.
 
(1) FIP Promulgation of Existing CARB Rules. 
Proposed 40 CFR 52.2957(a) and (b) control VOC emissions 
from consumer products and antiperspirants and deodorants. These 
proposed FIP measures reflect previously adopted CARB limits. 
Because CARB has not submitted the measures as SIP revisions, EPA 
is promulgating these measures, which are needed for progress and 
attainment in the three FIP areas. These measures would also 
provide the framework for additional future FIP reduction 
strategies as needed. 





(a) Consumer Products. 
Proposed 40 CFR 52.2957(a) controls VOC emissions from 
consumer products, with the exception of antiperspirants, 
deodorants, aerosol paints, and a few other consumer product 
categories.
 Consumer products are chemical formulations used 
in households and institutions and includes products such as 
detergents, cleaning compounds, polishes, floor finishes, 
personal care products, disinfectants, and automotive specialty 
products. The proposed regulation limits the VOC content in 
products sold, supplied, offered for sale, or manufactured for 
use within California. The rule establishes VOC limits 
consistent with limits previously adopted by CARB. 1990 
Statewide emissions from consumer products are estimated at 250 
tpd, 14.2 tpd in Sacramento, 108 tpd in South Coast, and 6 tpd in 
Ventura. 





The CARB and proposed FIP regulations for consumer products, 
including antiperspirants and deodorants, cover just over half of 
the consumer products in the inventory or approximately 130 tpd 
statewide. The CARB and proposed FIP consumer product rules are 
estimated to achieve a VOC emission reduction of over 25 percent. 
However, these reductions will be partially offset by growth in 
consumer product sales. The FIP area reductions after growth 
were estimated at 1.3 tpd (1999) and -1.6 tpd (increase in 2005) 
in Sacramento, 1.6 tpd in South Coast, 0.2 tpd in Ventura. 
Because the FIP consumer product requirements are almost 
identical to the CARB rules, the cost of the consumer products 
FIP measure is expected to be zero. 

Although the proposed FIP measure is very similar to that 
previously adopted by CARB, minor differences exist between the 
proposed FIP regulation and CARB's regulation. Differences are 
intended to simplify or reduce the administrative burden on the 
affected manufacturers or to correct rule deficiencies. The 
proposed FIP consumer products rule differs from the CARB rule in 
that it deletes: requirements for certification of charcoal 
lighter materials; a variance section; and a federal 
enforceability section. Otherwise the rules are virtually 
identical. 

(b) Antiperspirants and Deodorants. 
Proposed 40 CFR 52.2957(b) controls VOC emissions from 
antiperspirants and deodorants. The regulation limits the VOC 
content of products sold, supplied, offered for sale, or 
manufactured for use within California. The rule establishes VOC 
limits based on those previously adopted by CARB. The rule 
establishes a percent VOC by weight limit for both aerosol and 
non-aerosol products (e.g., sticks and roll-ons). Although 
aerosols make up approximately 25 percent of the market, they 
account for approximately 90 percent of the emissions from this 
category. Statewide emissions and expected reductions are 
incorporated in the consumer product totals described under 
III.C.4.c.(1).(a). 

Although the proposed FIP measure is very similar to that 
previously adopted by CARB, minor differences exist between the 
proposed FIP regulation and CARB's regulation. Differences 
between the proposed FIP antiperspirant and deodorant rule and 
the CARB rule include: the compliance date
 for aerosol 
products has been extended to January 1, 1999; deletion of the 
administrative requirements that aerosol product manufacturers 
apply to CARB by January, 1994 for a compliance date extension to 
1999; deletion of the section restricting toxic air contaminants; 
deletion of certain reporting requirements; deletion of the 
variance section; and deletion of the federal enforceability 
section. Otherwise the rules are virtually identical. 





(2) Aerosol Paints. 
Proposed 40 CFR 52.2958 reduces VOC emissions from aerosol 
coatings. Aerosol coatings are self dispensing, pressurized 
products containing coating solids (i.e., pigments, resins, and 
binders) and solvent designed to dispense product ingredients by 
means of a propellant. The solvent and propellant are typically 
VOCs which make up from 70-95 percent of the product by weight. 
The VOCs are emitted into the atmosphere during the coating 
delivery and curing process. 

Aerosol spray paints account for approximately 25 tpd of VOC 
emissions in California. FIP area 1990 emissions were estimated 
at 1.3 tpd in the Sacramento area, 11.6 tpd in the South Coast, 
and 0.6 tpd in Ventura. The use of aerosol paints has grown 
steadily since the 1950s. Growth peaked in 1977, but in 1978, 
the federal government restricted the use of chlorofluorocarbons 
as aerosol coating propellants and hydrocarbons were introduced 
as a replacement for the CFC propellants. Since the mid 1980s, 
use of aerosol paints has continued to steadily grow, with annual 
sales reaching historical highs during the early 1990s. 

Aerosol coatings have previously been regulated by the 
BAAQMD (Regulation 8, Rule 49) and the SCAQMD (Rule 1129). CARB 
recently assumed authority to regulate the VOC content of aerosol 
paints. The FIP aerosol paint rule is based on a draft 
regulation workshopped by CARB on November 10, 1993. The draft 
regulation is not scheduled for adoption until after EPA's court 
ordered deadline for the FIP proposal. In addition, current 
State law giving CARB the authority to regulate aerosol coatings 
also limits CARB's ability to submit some future-effective limits 
and reductions to EPA as SIP submittals. 

Because of the need to demonstrate attainment in each of the 
FIP areas, EPA is proposing an aerosol coating rule which is 
generally consistent with the regulation expected to be adopted 
by CARB in 1994. Minor differences exist between the FIP 
proposal and the CARB draft, however. The proposed FIP aerosol 
paint rule does not include sections for a special recognition 
label, variances, and federal enforceability. Also, the proposed 
FIP measure does not include a provision for a five year 
compliance date extension as found in CARB's draft rule. 
Instead, EPA intends to monitor industries progress and CARB's 
1999 determination regarding the coating limits. If necessary, 
EPA will consider amendments to the FIP aerosol coating rule 
where appropriate. By adopting the FIP aerosol coating 
regulation, EPA hopes to avoid having to impose more stringent 
requirements on other VOC sources which would need to compensate 
for the reduction shortfall pending SIP submittal of the adopted 
CARB regulation. While this proposed FIP aerosol coating 
regulation will be published prior to CARB's adoption of its 
regulation, EPA expects to modify the FIP regulation, if 
appropriate, to be consistent with the final CARB regulation. 

The proposed FIP regulation will build upon the previous 
work by the BAAQMD and the SCAQMD and closely parallel CARB's 
regulation. The proposed FIP regulation would apply to any 
person who sells, supplies, offers for sale, applies, or 
manufactures for use in California any aerosol coating products 
as described in the proposed regulation. Because of the 
diversity of uses and coating types, the proposed regulation 
establishes VOC limits for a variety of product coating types. 
The initial 1996 limits are based on limits in the BAAQMD 
regulation. A second phase of lower limits goes into effect in 
1999.

Aerosol coating manufacturers are expected to develop 
compliant products through propellant replacement, product 
reformulation, and improvements in packaging and delivery 
systems. Two promising propellent alternatives, 
hydrofluorocarbon (HCFC) 152a and dimethyl ether, are potential 
replacements for current hydrocarbon propellants. Reformulation 
to a lower VOC content could be achieved through increased 
solids, lower VOC solvents and propellants, or a combination of 
both. A further opportunity to reduce emissions lies in the 
redesign of the packaging and delivery system such that a 
nonhydrocarbon gas or mechanical device acts to displace the 
container's contents. Improvements in the transfer efficiency of 
the delivery systems would result in reduced overspray, higher 
surface coating percentage per container, and cost savings to the 
consumer. 

The proposed FIP aerosol coating regulation is to reduce VOC 
emission by approximately 60 percent from 1990 levels. The 
reductions from 1990 levels equate to approximately 15 tpd in 
California. FIP area attainment year reductions are estimated at 
0.9 tpd in 1999 and 1.1 tpd in 2005 in the Sacramento area, 8.9 
tpd in 2010 for the South Coast, and 0.4 tpd in 2005 for Ventura. 
Only limited data is available to estimate the cost of developing 
compliant products. The first phase of the regulation is 
expected to have a minimal cost because compliant products are 
already available to meet the BAAQMD rule. Costs of meeting the 
1999 limits will depend in part on the availability of HCFC 152a. 
Although a promising propellant substitute, HCFC 152a is 
estimated to cost five to ten times more than current hydrocarbon 
propellants. However, with increased demand for HCFC 152a, its 
cost is expected to decrease. 

(3) Alternative Reduction Approaches. 
CARB is currently developing an alternative compliance plan 
(ACP) approach which would allow additional flexibility for 
affected consumer product manufacturers. The ACP would allow 
manufacturers to average a limited number of products when 
determining compliance. The ACP concept is under development and 
EPA is working with CARB to assure its consistency with EPA's 
Economic Incentive Program guidance. After the ACP program is 
adopted by CARB, EPA will consider it for adoption as part of the 
FIP. Additional alternative reduction approaches as described in 
III.C.4. for architectural coatings could also be applied to 
consumer products. Comments are requested on the use of these 
approaches to achieve additional emission reductions from 
consumer products. 

(4) Need for Additional Reductions. 
Because additional reductions from consumer products will be 
needed to attain the ozone standard in the South Coast, EPA will 
continue to investigate strategies such as setting VOC limits, 
fees, a manufacturers bubble, or a corporate average to further 
encourage reductions from these products. Because a fraction of 
the consumer products inventory (e.g., laundry detergents, hand 
washing detergents, lubricants) are not regulated by current CARB 
regulations or the FIP proposal, EPA will investigate strategies 
for reducing emission resulting from these unregulated products. 
EPA intends to use section 182(e)(5) commitments for these 
additional reductions and to develop appropriate control 
strategies based on continuing evaluation of new technologies and 
compliance options. 

d. 

Pesticides

. 
(1) Summary and Applicability. 
Proposed 40 CFR 52.2960 is designed to reduce VOC emissions 
from agricultural and structural pesticide application.

Producers of such pesticides must determine the VOC content
 of their products as defined by an analytical method. All agricultural and structural pesticides registered in California
must be tested, regardless of whether the producer is located inside or outside of the State. Distribution, application,
and storage of pesticides with high VOC contents will be restricted in California.





9,500 pesticide formulations may be subject to the analysis requirement, and sale and use of several thousand may
be subsequently restricted. EPA cannot determine how industry will respond to restrictions on each specific formulation.
Generally, however, EPA expects that low-VOC reformulations will provide feasible alternatives for many restricted
pesticides.

The proposed rule is not intended to apply to consumer-oriented pesticides that are subject to consumer products
regulations in this NPRM (40 CFR 52.2957) or in the California Code of Regulations (Title 17, Division 3, Subchapter
8.5_Consumer Products,   94507-94517). The proposed rule is also not intended to apply to production
or distribution of pesticides intended for use outside of California.

(2) Specific provisions. 

Required submission of data.

 By June 1, 1996 or 120 days after the effective date of the rule, whichever is later, producers must submit analyses
identifying the VOC content of all affected pesticides. EPA believes that 120 days is ample time to perform this analysis,
and notes that the requirement is being proposed over two years before the analysis will come due. Concern has been
raised that independent laboratory capacity may be insufficient to analyze all regulated pesticides within 120
days. EPA believes, however, that most large pesticide manufacturers will perform the required analysis in-house,
and that independent laboratory capacity will be sufficient to handle the remaining analytic demand.

Analysis is required of all California-registered pesticides including those not currently in use. This information
is needed to determine an accurate base-year VOC emission inventory to compare against future emission reductions.
It is also important to identify all available low-VOC pesticides regardless of whether they are currently in use
in order to maximize the available pest-control options.



Establish VOC limit.

 The proposed rule describes a six-step procedure for establishing a VOC limit for pesticides.

(i) EPA will establish a base-year pesticide use inventory for each pesticide registered in California. This inventory
may consist simply of the amount of each pesticide applied in the State according to the 1990 pesticide use report (PUR)
combined with the inerts data-base, both of which are maintained by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation
(DPR). The proposed rule is drafted, however, to provide the Agency discretion to establish the base-year inventory
using other information. EPA could, for example, use an average of the 1990 to 1993 PUR data for just the three FIP areas
if that was determined to be more appropriate. In any case, EPA intends to discuss the base-year inventory actually
used when promulgating the VOC limit pursuant to  52.288(c)(2)(vi).

(ii) EPA will rank the pesticides according to their VOC content. The pesticide with the largest VOC content (i.e.,
a gas or highly volatile liquid) will be ranked 

#

1. If EPA determines that adequate data for a particular pesticide is not submitted by the deadline, EPA may assign
the pesticide a VOC content equal to the largest VOC content reported for any pesticide (i.e., also ranking it 

#

1). This would effectively prohibit distribution and application of this pesticide in the affected area pursuant
to  52.2960(c)(5). EPA's intention is to provide an incentive for manufacturers to submit the required data
while simultaneously enabling the Agency to implement the regulation in the absence of some data. Nevertheless,
the regulation is drafted to provide the Agency some discretion in assigning VOC contents for pesticides in the absence
of adequate data. EPA might, for example, determine it more appropriate to assign VOC contents for such a pesticide
based on the largest VOC content reported for its formulation type (e.g., oil, emulsifiable concentrate, pressurized
liquid, etc.) Or, if analysis of a pesticide failed to demonstrate a specific VOC content but did demonstrate that
the VOC content fell within a discrete range, EPA might assign the pesticide the largest VOC content within that range.
In any case, EPA intends to discuss the VOC contents actually assigned when promulgating the VOC limit pursuant to
 52.288(c)(2)(vi).

(iii) EPA will multiply the VOC contents (weight percent basis) by the base-year inventory (kilogram-per-year basis)
to establish the individual base-year VOC emissions (kilogram-per-year basis). A pesticide not used in the affected
area in the base-year(s) would have a base-year inventory and a VOC emission of zero.

(iv) EPA will add the base-year VOC emissions of all affected pesticides to determine the total base-year VOC emissions
in the affected area.

(v) Starting with the highest-ranking pesticides (i.e., those with the largest VOC content and those without adequate
data), EPA will add the individual base-year VOC emissions until the sum equals 40 to 65 percent of the total base-year
VOC emissions. The VOC content of the last pesticide needed to achieve 40 to 65 percent is the VOC limit. EPA has assumed
that restricted pesticides will be replaced on a one to one mass basis with pesticides at the VOC limit.
 Based on an analysis described in the technical support document (TSD) for the proposed rule, EPA has calculated that
a 40 to 65 percent threshold value will achieve emission reductions of 20 to 45 percent off the base-year inventory.
The target reduction of 20 to 45 percent was chosen for consistency with the range of target reductions of the stationary
source cap rules described in section III.C.5 of this NPRM. Based on planned modeling and inventory analysis and comments
received during the comment period, EPA hopes to select a specific reduction target from within this range for use
in the final rule promulgation. The relationship between the 20-45 percent reduction target and the 40-65
percent threshold value is discussed further in the TSD.





(vi) EPA will publish the VOC limit. EPA intends to publish this limit in the 

Federal Register

 with a discussion of the data and assumptions used to generate the limit. If the limit is generated by a straightforward
execution of the procedure described in this NPRM, EPA may publish the limit directly in final form. If, however, EPA
exercises significant discretion (as provided for in the proposed rule) in generating the limit, EPA intends to take
public comment on a proposed limit before publishing the final limit.



Restrictions on pesticides.

 One year after EPA publishes the VOC limit, all persons are prohibited from distributing in the affected area pesticides
with VOC contents greater than the VOC limit. After that time, distributors with remaining inventory of high-VOC
pesticides could still sell them to persons outside the affected area.

<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 





Two years after EPA publishes the VOC limit, all persons are prohibited from applying or storing in the affected area
pesticides with VOC contents greater than the VOC limit. EPA believes this is sufficient time for affected applicators
to apply existing inventory of high-VOC pesticides or to sell them to persons outside the affected area.



Revisions to the VOC limit.

 EPA may require a producer to reanalyze its pesticides at any time. Based on this or other information, EPA may recalculate
the VOC limit at any time. EPA does not anticipate recalculating the VOC limit frequently, as recalculation has significant
resource implications for both the Agency and the regulated community. Recalculation may be appropriate, however,
if EPA determines that the existing VOC limit is not equitably achieving the targeted emission reductions of 20 to
45 percent. Developments that might justify a recalculation include changes in pesticide use patterns and improved
understanding of VOC emissions from pesticides.



Alternative ranking scheme.

 Rather than ranking pesticides simply by VOC content, representatives of DPR and CARB have suggested ranking by VOC
emissions. Under the former scheme, as incorporated in this NPRM, application of a high-VOC low-use pesticide (e.g.,
a pheromone) would be regulated even if it contributed much fewer VOC emissions than unregulated application of a
medium-VOC high-use product. Under the latter scheme, pesticides would be ranked and regulated in order of their
overall emissions, as determined by VOC content times quantity applied in the base-year(s).

While the two ranking systems could provide equivalent emission reductions, EPA believes the simplicity of the former
makes it easier to implement and enforce. Once the VOC limit is established, Agency inspectors can simply determine
whether pesticides sold and used in the affected area comply with the limit. Under the latter scheme, however, rather
than publishing a single limit, EPA would need to publish and regulate a list of all the specific restricted pesticides,
which would need to be revised regularly to account for new and reformulated products and for changing use patterns.
If, for example, a high-VOC pesticide had low use and low emissions in the base-year but high use and high emissions
thereafter, it would need to be added to the list of restricted pesticides. Conversely, pesticides with unusually
high use in the base-year might need to be removed from the list of restricted pesticides, adding to the likelihood
of inequities and compliance problems.

Nevertheless, EPA understands that alternatives to the regulatory structure contained in the proposed FIP rule
offer different trade-offs between the various FIP goals (described in section I.B of this NPRM) of reducing emissions,
encouraging State action, minimizing federal interference, etc. EPA has attempted to address some of these alternatives
in paragraph III.C.4.d(4) of this NPRM.

(3) Reporting, recordkeeping and test methods. Proposed  52.2960(f) describes the test methods required
for determining the VOC content of pesticides. Pesticide producers may use one of two test methods:

(i) 

Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA).

 This is one of the two test methods described in EPA's alternative control technology document (ACT) for pesticides
(``Alternative Control Technology Document; Control of VOC Emissions from the Application of Agricultural Pesticides,''
EPA-453/R-92-011, March 1993, Appendix C). The method is based on the ``American Standard Test
Method (ASTM) for Compositional Analysis by Thermogravimetry'' (ASTM E-1131-86).

(ii) 

Volatile organics in pesticides (VOP) method.

 This is the second test method described in EPA's ACT for pesticides. It includes a purge and trap procedure conducted
at constant temperature that allows for direct measurement of water content.

DPR has investigated various modifications to ASTM E-1131-86 for analyzing a wide variety of pesticide
formulations. Some of DPR's work is reflected in modifications to the method included in the ACT and in  52.2960(f)(1)(i)
by reference. DPR's work is ongoing, however, and EPA expects that additional modifications to the method may be determined
appropriate. Depending on the timing and scope of such modifications, EPA may address them through the discretion
allowed in the proposed rule, by incorporating them into the final FIP rule, or by formally proposing and promulgating
subsequent rule modifications. Modifications may include the following:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940505-1-00091 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



(i) Modifications to the method for estimating water 
content. DPR is currently investigating several analytical 
methods for estimating water content including both Karl Fischer 
titration and spectroscopic analysis of the vapor-phase effluent 
from the TGA analysis. Until adequate validation of these 
methods is available, DPR may calculate water content based on 
the ``percentage water added'' component of the statement of 
formulation required pursuant to FIFRA (7 U.S.C. 136a(c)(1)(E)). 
Because this generally does not account for water present as 
impurity, water produced in reaction, or water present as a 
component of other raw materials, it should provide a 
conservative (i.e., low) estimate of true water content. 
Reliance on formulation data is consistent with EPA's historic 
policy regarding analogous coating regulations before reliable 
test methods (e.g., ASTM D-4017 and D-3792) were available.
 





(ii) Modifications to the method for estimating exempt 
compounds. Again, until adequate validation of a specific test 
method(s) is available, DPR may rely on the statement of 
formulation for estimating the amount of exempt compounds present 
in specific pesticides. This is also analogous to coating 
regulations which generally relied on formulation data until ASTM 
D-4457 was available.
 





(iii) Modifications to address solid pesticide 
formulations. 

As described in  52.2960 (d) and (e), producers of affected 
pesticides must submit copies of all raw data and a summary of 
the results of the VOC content analyses. Distributors must 
submit a distributor notification and an annual report 
summarizing the pesticides distributed in the affected area 
during the preceding year. Applicators must submit a copy of the 
PUR for all pesticide applications within the affected area. 

Pesticide producers, distributors, and applicators are 
required to maintain all information necessary to demonstrate 
compliance with the regulation for a period of five years. At a 
minimum, this information must include copies of all reports 
specifically required in paragraph 52.2960(d), and any technical 
support to these reports. 

(4) Relationship to State rules. As discussed in sections I.D., III.J., and elsewhere in this NPRM, EPA believes that
State and local agencies can adopt and implement regulations that are better tailored to the specific 
characteristics and needs of the affected areas. Therefore, EPA 
strongly encourages the State to continue ongoing efforts to 
adopt approvable rules to replace all or part of the FIP. 

Pursuant to  110(l) of the Act, State rules are not 
approvable if they, ``* * * interfere with any applicable 
requirement concerning attainment and reasonable further 
progress * * * or any other applicable requirement.'' For purposes 
of the pesticide rule, EPA intends to determine approvability 
based largely on emissions. Modifications to the pesticide rule 
which EPA may consider approvable, if shown to result in no 
significant emission increases, include the following: 

(i) Provisions for exempting de minimis use of high-VOC 
pesticides. 

(ii) Provisions for allowing use of high-VOC pesticides to 
prevent overwhelming economic dislocation. 

(iii) Provisions for allowing use of high VOC pesticides to 
prevent harm to human health or the environment. 

(iv) Provisions for allowing use of high-VOC pesticides 
during times of the year when low ambient ozone concentrations 
are projected. 

(v) Modifications of the test method discussed in section 
III.C.3.d(3) of this NPRM. 

(vi) Modifications to 40 CFR 52.2960(c)(2) of the proposed 
rule, such as ranking pesticides based on emissions instead of 
VOC content as discussed in section III.C.3.d(2) of this NPRM. 

(vii) Consideration of the relative reactivity of different 
VOCs. 

Or, of course, the State could adopt rules based on 
completely different regulatory strategies that still achieve 
equivalent emission reductions.

The State is likely to propose substitution for the FIP 
rule's ``Required submission of data'' provision in 40 CFR 
52.2960(c)(1) of the proposed rule. DPR is currently planning to 
issue a data call-in during early 1994 which would require 
submittal of much of the same information. If these data are 
timely and approvable, EPA may remove 40 CFR 52.2960(c)(1) from 
the final FIP rule. 

 

(5) Relationship to FIFRA.

 EPA acknowledges the unique situation in which the proposed FIP rule places the pesticide and agriculture industries,
which are already subject to considerable regulation under FIFRA.

However, because pesticide use is estimated to represent a 
significant component of the VOC emissions inventory in the 
Sacramento, South Coast and Ventura areas, EPA considers emission 
reductions from pesticides an important part of the overall FIP 
attainment strategy.






Under the proposed rule, EPA will establish a VOC limit that 
all pesticides must meet to be distributed or applied in the 
affected area. Specific pesticides are not regulated, and the 
proposed rule does not conflict with FIFRA's registration 
cancellation or suspension procedures (7 U.S.C. 136d). 
Nonetheless, EPA expects that many pesticides will need to be 
reformulated in order to meet the VOC limit and be useable in the 
affected area. EPA has accounted for the costs of reformulation 
in the technical support to this proposed rule. EPA specifically 
requests comment on how to minimize the costs of this regulation 
in light of existing FIFRA regulations while still achieving the 
necessary emission reductions. 



5. Cap Regulations 





a. Introduction

_EPA is today proposing to promulgate Federal control measure rules to reduce emissions of VOC from sources located
in all 
three FIP areas, and NO

X

 from sources in the Ventura FIP area.
 The proposed measures impose an annual rate of reduction on 
affected sources for as many controllable VOC and NO

X

 categories 
as possible. The purpose of these proposed rules is to ensure 
that the FIP areas achieve attainment of the ozone NAAQS by the 
statutory attainment dates for each area. These proposed rules 
are designed to supplement reductions achieved by other proposed 
FIP and SIP measures as necessary to make up for any emission 
reduction shortfalls in the affected FIP areas.





The FIP cap measures proposed today differ in several ways 
from those proposed in the 1990 South Coast FIP (55 FR 36458). 
Most importantly, the current FIP proposal adds complete 
regulations for most categories of industrial sources of NO

X

 
emissions, whereas the 1990 proposal dealt only with VOC sources. 
The NO

X

 cap regulations proposed today for Ventura (and discussed 
as an alternative for the South Coast) contain comprehensive 
control requirements, including specific detailed provisions for 
source monitoring. 

EPA's cap regulations proposed today also make significant 
changes from the 1990 rules in terms of the cap compliance 
period, penalties for noncompliance with emission limits, and 
establishment of emissions baselines. In addition, this NPRM 
significantly revises the discussion of two potential amendments 
to the cap program: the development of an emissions trading 
element and the replacement of the industrial solvents/coatings 
rules with a manufacturers bubble. 

Many of these changes from the 1990 proposal derive from 
extensive EPA involvement in the evolution of SCAQMD's RECLAIM 
program. However, EPA's proposed cap rules deviate from the 
RECLAIM program in several areas. For example, in RECLAIM, which 
is currently a NO

X

 and SO

X

 market, the term of each emission cap is one year. In the proposed FIP measures, the term of each 
emission cap is one month. EPA selected the shorter compliance 
term as providing more certainty that the one-hour ozone NAAQS 
would not be exceeded. EPA will continue to evaluate the 
compliance period as more information becomes available. For 
each FIP area, data may allow EPA to determine that different 
compliance periods would provide sufficient security against 
short-term emission increases that jeopardize air quality 
progress. 

The 1990 proposal did not include regulations specifying the 
noncompliance penalty structure. This NPRM proposes penalty 
provisions for emissions cap exceedances based on EPA's 
conclusion (expressed repeatedly in the context of the RECLAIM 
development process) that exceedance-based systems of 
establishing penalties are the most appropriate for the use of 
mass emission caps. Exceedance-based penalty systems establish 
violations based on the amount of excess emissions above the 
facility cap. This penalty structure is most protective of the 
NAAQS and comports best with the Act and with EPA's established 
enforcement policies. 

EPA has included in this FIP a much more detailed method for 
setting baselines for the facilities subject to the cap program. 
The method requires sources to examine the following data to 
calculate their year 2001 cap emissions: 

 1990 annual emissions, and 
 Reductions to be made as a result of compliance with SIP 
and/or FIP control measures between the years 1990 and 2001. 

This methodology will inherently rely on emission inventory data 
and planning projections to set year 2001 emissions caps. 
However, the methodology has the advantage that it will not 
unfairly penalize facilities which have made reductions ahead of 
schedule. This baseline proposal provides flexibility beyond the 
1990 proposal for facilities which have made early reductions of 
NO

X

 and VOC emissions. 

EPA is not now proposing to incorporate a trading system 
into the program in regulatory form. EPA will observe the 
functioning of the RECLAIM market system, the Acid Rain (CAA 
Title IV) market system, and other markets to determine the 
design which is most successful for reducing emissions in the FIP 
areas while achieving other program goals, including the 
avoidance of air toxics hotspots. In the 1990 FIP proposal, EPA 
indicated that a trading scheme would be proposed in the future; 
in this round, given that there will be more experience with 
trading markets by the time this FIP is finalized, EPA chose to 
observe the developing markets in parallel with its own research 
effort prior to selecting a market structure. 

Finally, the 1990 proposal discussed the use of a 
manufacturers bubble as an alternative to emissions caps for 
users of industrial and commercial solvents and coatings. The 
current FIP proposal describes this concept in greater detail and 
discusses EPA's various reasons for preferring this approach, if 
EPA is able to successfully resolve certain issues involved in 
regulating manufacturers at the national level. 

(1) Rationale for Approach. All of the California FIP areas suffer from emission 
reduction shortfalls when the FIP attainment analysis is 
performed. The shortfalls, or reductions beyond the other 
proposed FIP and SIP measures, which must be accounted for in 
order to bring the FIP areas into attainment, range from at least 
20 percent additional reductions for VOC to at least 30 percent 
additional reductions for NO

X

.
 In consideration of the 
limitations of available technology-based regulations, and to 
provide the regulated community with maximum flexibility when 
trying to achieve the shortfall reductions, EPA is proposing a 
facility-wide declining emission cap program. 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940505-1-00094 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 





The declining facility-wide emission caps will have a monthly compliance period (i.e., a single monthly emissions
limit for the entire facility that declines annually as opposed to emission limits on single emission points), an
annual reduction rate (4 to 9 percent for VOC, 6 to 9 percent for NO

X

), and initial baseline emission caps (caps for the first 12 months of the program) established using anticipated
implementation-year inventories (year 2001 projected inventories) for the universe of facilities included in
the FIP cap program. The facilities subject to the FIP cap program will be those facilities that generate emissions
of NO

X

 or VOC greater than or equal to 4 tpy in the FIP areas. The universe of facilities included in the FIP cap program is based
on process lists or emission categories that make up a significant portion of the emissions necessary to be reduced
to ensure attainment in the FIP areas. 

In developing its proposal, EPA has drawn on its experience and involvement in other emission cap programs such as
the CAA Title IV program (Acid Rain), the South Coast Air Quality Management District's Regional Clean Air Incentives
Market (RECLAIM), and the general guidance provided by the proposed Economic Incentive Program (EIP) rules and guidance
(58 FR 11110, February 23, 1993). 

Discussed below are the source categories for which rules have been developed. These measures would be promulgated
as complete regulations in the FIP but would not require emissions reductions until 2001 in order to allow the FIP areas
time to develop measures which obtain the necessary reductions and to allow EPA adequate time to implement these measures
to ensure attainment and progress towards attainment by the statutory attainment dates. The measures for stationary
and areas sources would mandate a linear annual reduction of emissions from individual facilities with emissions
greater than or equal to 4 tpy in order to accomplish necessary reductions not achieved through other FIP measures
and federally approved SIP rules (facilities with emissions greater than or equal to 2 tons per year will be subject
to exemption verification reporting requirements). Because EPA has chosen not to develop conventional control
measures at this time for a portion of the VOC and NO

X

 inventory, the level of control for the FIP cap measures must be sufficient to make up for at least a 20 percent VOC and
at least a 30 percent NO

X

 emission reduction shortfall. 

(2) Reduction Rate. Assuming that the creditable State rules and FIP rules will meet minimum progress requirements
(particularly in the South Coast FIP area) for the period up to 2000, the proposed FIP cap rules are designed to go into
effect beginning in 2001 and to achieve reductions from each category of between 4 and 9 percent per year for VOC and
between 6 and 9 percent per year for NO

X

 until the year 2005.
 This design, for example, means that in 2001 a VOC-emitting facility would reduce its emissions at least 4 percent
from its baseline emissions; in 2002 the same facility would reduce its emissions by at least 8 percent of its baseline
emissions. By 2005, the facility's emissions would be reduced by at least 20 percent of its baseline (or year 2000)
emissions. 





(3) Withdrawal of Rules Based on SIP Progress. These proposed FIP cap measures serve as a strong incentive for State
efforts, since they could be rescinded before their scheduled implementation dates if areawide emissions are reduced
to the prescribed levels through the adoption and implementation of future SIP rules. In addition, any of these measures
could be rescinded upon EPA approval of State or local measures that obtain the necessary reductions and which would
not interfere with any applicable requirement concerning attainment and reasonable further progress, or any other
applicable requirement of the CAA. EPA strongly encourages the State to adopt measures quickly and in a manner that
will minimize adverse economic impacts. 

(4) Relationship to Other Applicable FIP Provisions. Given the overlap between the source categories in the proposed
FIP cap program (see section III.C.5.b.(2)) and those source categories regulated by traditional means, EPA is proposing
to include the reductions achieved by the other regulations (i.e., the other FIP and/or SIP measures which are effective
at the time of the FIP cap program's implementation) in the FIP cap program baseline setting procedures. This design
means that EPA is assuming that all reductions required by other portions of the regulatory framework are achieved
by the year 2001. EPA believes this design to be a necessity given the emission reduction shortfalls and attainment
dates faced in the FIP areas. However, EPA seeks comment on this design and potential alternatives that will ensure
attainment and progress prior to a given FIP area's attainment date. This design also assumes that facilities after
2001 would not be operating under two regulatory frameworks; rather, the traditional regulations are assumed to
have achieved their associated reductions and the FIP cap regulations would make up for shortfalls necessary in the
FIP areas. This issue will be examined periodically to determine the impacts of the interface and the ultimate reduction
rate for the FIP cap program in the FIP areas. 

In the proposed FIP cap regulations EPA assumed no participation of new sources in the program. EPA's design assumes
that new sources will be subject to federally approved new source review rules and emission limits. However, EPA seeks
comment on means for including new sources in the FIP cap program and alternatives to the current design. 

(5) Implementation and Enforcement Issues. The emission reduction requirements derive from the areawide emission
reduction requirements of the FIP, rather than from the normal Agency assessments of available technologies. As
such, they may be costly and disruptive, and the prospect of their federal implementation, in the case of inadequate
State progress, should inspire successful adoption of the SIP. 

Over time, the State and local agencies can develop carefully tailored economic incentive programs or traditional
rules based upon the most recent technologies and regulatory approaches. For example, the SCAQMD has recently adopted
the RECLAIM program and also has a multi-million dollar technology development program to assist industry to identify
and successfully apply the latest scientific approaches that can be employed to reduce pollutant emissions. With
these types of resources and, most importantly, with additional time to develop the most feasible control approaches,
the State and local agencies are in a superior position to construct regulations that avoid social and economic dislocation.


(a) Compliance mechanisms. As designed, the FIP cap program requires affected sources to submit facility compliance
plans to the Agency for review by 1999. These plans must outline the facility's means to achieve the specific annual
reductions from 2001 to 2005. The options for meeting the annual reductions include, but are not limited to, product
reformulation, product substitution, control equipment, and, if necessary, production curtailments.

<DOCNO> FR940505-1-00095 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



EPA will review and approve or disapprove these plans depending on 
whether they achieve the required emission reduction 
requirements. Given that these plans will encompass multiple 
emission sources with different emission measurement methods, EPA 
believes that the compliance plan review effort will be resource 
intensive. For those sources subject to Title V operating permit 
regulations, the provisions of the compliance plans would be 
federally enforceable permit conditions. For such sources, 
procedures used in reviewing and approving the compliance plans 
would not supersede public participation and other requirements 
found in the Part 70 Title V regulations. 
Compliance with the monthly caps established in the FIP cap 
program will be determined by two means. Routine inspections to 
determine whether or not monthly caps are met will be conducted. 
In addition, facilities subject to the FIP cap program will be 
required to certify that they met their monthly caps on an annual 
basis by submitting annual reports within 60 days of the close of 
each calendar year. Prior to the implementation of the FIP cap 
program, EPA will prepare a statistical showing that the 
aggregate effect of the specified averaging time is consistent 
with attaining the ozone NAAQS and satisfying applicable progress 
requirements on a typical summer day basis in accordance with the 
proposed economic incentive program rules and guidance (see 58 FR 
11110, February 23, 1993). EPA seeks comment on the term of the 
emission caps (i.e., monthly as opposed to a shorter or longer 
timeframe) and the means by which to determine compliance at 
facilities subject to the FIP cap program. 
(b) EPA Resources. EPA believes that the compliance mechanisms outlined above require a significant resource investment
by the Agency. These 
resources include staff to review the compliance plan submissions 
and evaluate the subject facilities' compliance status. EPA 
seeks comment on alternative designs to those outlined in the FIP 
cap regulations that may reduce this resource burden (including 
the delegation of these responsibilities to the State or local 
agencies discussed elsewhere in this NPRM). 
(c) Emission Quantification Mechanisms. EPA recognizes that in order to quantify mass emissions, the suggested
emissions quantification mechanisms may need further development. EPA will be evaluating the methods outlined
and 
alternatives for adequacy prior to implementation of the FIP cap 
program.
 EPA may develop and propose additional methods to 
obtain the appropriate mass emission results required of the FIP 
cap program prior to its implementation. EPA seeks comment on 
the methods outlined in the proposed regulations and any 
alternative means for determining emissions from the affected 
source categories. 






b. Control Approach_

 (1) Rule Structure. This overview explains the format used in the proposed FIP cap program rules. 
All of the proposed rules contain sections discussing 
definitions, applicability, specific provisions, reporting, 
recordkeeping, testing, and monitoring requirements. The 
definitions section of each rule contains the definitions which 
apply only to that rule. The applicability section specifies the 
area to which the rule applies, who is subject to the rule, and 
references the sections and/or paragraphs of the rule to which 
subject persons must comply. 
The specific provisions section of the rules specifies 
applicable VOC or NO

X

 limitations and requires subject persons to 
submit baseline VOC or NO

X

 emissions data to the EPA. Once 
implemented, the rules would require affected facilities to 
annually reduce VOC emissions by 4 to 9 percent and NO

X

 emissions 
by 6 to 9 percent beginning in 2001 and ending in 2005 to achieve 
at least a 20 percent VOC reduction and at least a 30 percent NO

X

 
reduction overall. It is expected that subject facilities would 
continue to maintain VOC and NO

X

 levels at 2005 levels after 
2005.
 EPA may reduce the annual percent reduction requirement 
during one or more years if rules adopted by the local, State, 
and EPA (through the promulgation of additional FIP or national 
measures) achieve the VOC and NO

X

 reductions necessary to 
demonstrate progress toward attainment of the ozone standard. 




The purpose of the reporting, recordkeeping, testing, and 
monitoring requirements of the proposed rules is to complement 
the compliance plan and to ensure their enforceability. The 
reporting section specifies annual reporting requirements 
(subject to certification requirements) to demonstrate compliance 
with the monthly caps and the recordkeeping section requires 
subject persons to maintain, for at least three years, all 
information necessary to verify compliance with the VOC and NO

X

 
limitations. The testing and monitoring section of the rules 
require persons to test and/or install monitoring equipment to 
demonstrate compliance with the VOC and NO

X

 limitations as 
requested by EPA. The VOC and NO

X

 cap regulations incorporate 
the specific methods for reporting, recordkeeping, testing, and 
monitoring. EPA intends that facilities which use the 
incorporated test methods will have satisfied the requirements 
discussed in the proposed enhanced monitoring program
 
regarding the source-specific analysis otherwise required by the 
proposed enhanced monitoring program. 




In addition to the proposed source category specific rules, 
EPA is proposing a general provisions section which will be 
applicable to all sources covered in each pollutant's cap program 
(i.e., one section for VOC sources and one for NO

X

 sources). The 
general provisions section includes definitions applicable to all 
of the rules and test methods and procedures referenced in the 
testing and monitoring sections of most of the rules. 
(2) Applicability and Exemptions. The proposed rules are designed to regulate and limit VOC and NO

X

 emissions at subject facilities (process sources and other sources). Examples of process sources include extraction,
manufacturing, fabrication, and combustion operations. Other 
sources include the use of solvent and paints (not directly used 
in extraction, manufacturing, and fabrication processes), VOC 
waste disposal and storage sites, and smaller combustion 
processes (for example, smaller internal combustion engines). 
The FIP cap rules are proposed for the following source 
categories:

 Any NO

X

 source for which NO

X

 emissions reported to 
the State or local agency were equal to or greater than 
2 tons per year for the calendar year 1990. 
Only those sources which emit greater than 4 tons per 
year of NO

X

 or VOC are subject to the emission cap requirements 
found in the rules. Those sources which emit 2 tons per year 
but less than 4 tons per year in the above categories are exempt 
from the cap requirements provided that they maintain emissions 
below the 4 tons per year inclusion level.
 However, EPA notes 
that the South Coast RECLAIM program could subject sources 
which emit less than 4 tons per year to the cap requirements to 
get additional necessary reductions. EPA encourages the South 
Coast to reduce its RECLAIM emissions threshold in order to 
achieve necessary reductions for attainment. 




Rules for most of the source categories contain exemption 
levels to minimize potential impacts on small businesses. The 
proposed rules require owners or operators of exempt facilities 
to certify to the EPA by January 1, 2000, that they are exempt 
from the VOC and NO

X

 limitations of the rules and to submit 
calculations which demonstrate the VOC and NO

X

 emissions from 
their facility will not exceed the exemption level. If a 
facility exceeds the level on and after January 1, 2000, the 
source must notify EPA within thirty days that the exemption 
level was exceeded. The source would then comply with the VOC 
and NO

X

 limitations of the rule beginning on January of the 
calendar year following the exemption level exceedance. Once an 
exempt facility exceeds the exemption level, it would always be 
subject to the VOC and NO

X

 limitations of the rule.

(3) Determination of Baseline Emissions. The proposed FIP cap rules require baseline emissions and emission reductions
to be calculated on a monthly basis. The rules require baseline emissions to be determined based on emission inventory
records, production, throughput, or usage level. If daily emissions records are available for the period 1989-1990
and are consistent with the State or local agency's November 15, 1992 inventory submittal, then this data would be
used. If daily emissions records are not available for the 1989-1990 period, then the baseline would be established
based on the average daily emissions value calculated by dividing the average emissions over the 1989-1990
period by 730 days. These baseline emissions are annualized and reduced by the projected reductions from 1990 through
the year 2000 (using anticipated control factors from control measure implementation). Finally the reduced baseline
is prorated to establish monthly emissions caps by dividing annual emissions by twelve. The purpose for using the
median or average value for calculating baseline emissions is to determine the representative emissions of the affected
facility. 

(4) Compliance Plans. This proposed regulatory format requires owners and operators of subject facilities to calculate
total VOC and NO

X

 emissions from all process and area emissions sources at the facility for the base year 1990, adjust these emissions
by the projected reductions to be achieved by 2000 and then reduce the year 2000 emissions by 4 to 9 percent for VOC and
6 to 9 percent for NO

X

 per year from 2001 through 2005. Owners or operators could use a variety of methods to reduce VOC and NO

X

 emissions by installing new control equipment and/or increasing control efficiency of existing equipment, process
modifications or substitutions, or reducing operating schedules. 

The specific provisions sections of the rules require each owner or operator of a subject facility to prepare a VOC
and/or NO

X

 emission reduction compliance plan for the years 2001 through 2005 and submit the plan to EPA by January 1, 1999. EPA
could comment on any plan and request additional information if needed to adequately evaluate the requirements of
the plan. Each owner or operator would submit a revised plan to EPA within 30 calendar days of the receipt of EPA comments.
The source would then comply with the provisions of the most recent plan approved by EPA. The owner or operator would
include the following information in the plan: 

 Name, title, address, and telephone number of the owner or operator of the facility, and the person responsible
for preparing the plan; 

 An estimate of baseline (year 2000) VOC and/or NO

X

 emissions from all emissions sources at the facility; 

 Methods to be employed to achieve the annual percent emissions reduction; 

 Test or demonstration methods used to demonstrate achievement of the VOC and/or NO

X

 emissions reductions; 

 Projections of annual VOC and/or NO

X

 emissions for each source through the year 2005 after application of the VOC and/or NO

X

 reduction methods described in the plan; and 

 For all sources, all information required as part of the facility's Title V operating permit. If a source is
not subject to Title V, then the source would submit information similar to that provided by sources subject to Title
V. 

EPA is proposing to require submittal of the plans two years prior to the effective date of the limitations of the rules
(i.e., January 1, 1999) to obtain a more accurate estimate of baseline VOC and NO

X

 emissions, to identify subject facilities, and to encourage subject facilities to develop a comprehensive, long-range
control strategy for reducing VOC and NO

X

 emissions. 

The submittal of baseline VOC and NO

X

 emissions data in 1999 will provide the EPA with more accurate, facility-specific data for evaluating progress toward
attainment of the ozone NAAQS and will allow EPA to evaluate whether the cap rules should require higher or lower VOC
and NO

X

 reductions than the proposed annual rates. In addition, this information is important to EPA because it will provide
a current estimate of emissions for the affected sources. Hundreds of small, uninventoried facilities are located
in the FIP control areas account, in the aggregate, for a significant source of the VOC and NO

X

 emissions. Although the databases contain area source emissions estimates to account for uninventoried sources
classified under some source categories, the area source emissions estimates are based on inexact data (i.e., the
amount of coating or solvent used in the county, etc.) rather than emissions associated with individual facilities
in the control area. 

EPA will also use the emission reduction plans submitted to identify the number and location of subject facilities.
This determination is needed to estimate resource requirements for conducting facility inspections for enforcement
of the rules. Enforcement personnel will also use the plans to prepare for facility inspections. 

(5) Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Compliance Requirements. Owners or operators of facilities which would be subject
to the VOC and NO

X

 limitations of the rules would also be subject to annual reporting requirements. 

Owners or operators would certify to the EPA by March 1 of each calendar year, beginning in 2002, that they have complied
with all of the requirements of the rule for the previous calendar year on a monthly basis. Owners or operators would
also submit documentation of the methods used to achieve the VOC and NO

X

 reductions. 

(6) Penalties. In the FIP cap rules, EPA proposes an exceedance-based approach to establishing statutory maximum
penalties for monthly emission cap exceedances. EPA favors the use of an exceedance-based approach to establishing
penalties for emissions limit violations in cap programs and as such, is proposing such an approach for the FIP cap
program. The FIP cap rules specify that each 50 pound increment or fraction thereof above a monthly emissions cap would
be considered a violation for federal enforcement purposes. For example if a facility was subject to a 2000 pound per
month emissions cap and in one month exceeded its emissions cap by 500 pounds, then that facility would have been liable
for 10 violations when establishing the statutory maximum penalty for federal enforcement purposes. EPA is seeking
public comment on the specific increment (50 pounds per violation_also referred to as a violation-increment) found
in the proposed regulations. EPA will consider whether values in a range up to 200 pounds per violation are necessary
or adequate. However, the ranges discussed in the FIP should not be construed as what would necessarily be required
for all types of cap programs or economic incentive programs including those developed at the State or local level
either as a supplement to the FIP cap program or as a replacement for the FIP cap program. For example, State/local agencies
may design programs which incorporate enforcement authorities that are unavailable to EPA (e.g., mandatory minimum
civil penalties for violations) and which may compensate for somewhat higher violation-increments. In addition
to the emissions limit violation penalties, all of EPA's enforcement authorities under section 113 of the CAA apply
in the FIP cap program. 

Following is a detailed description of each source category for which EPA has proposed emission cap rules.

c. Industrial and Commercial Solvents and Coatings_

 (1) Source category description. The industrial and commercial solvents and coatings source category includes
emissions from dry cleaners; degreasing operations; and all types of coating and/or solvent clean-up operations.
Examples of coating operations include, but are not limited to: aerospace component coating; automobile and light-duty
truck assembly-line coating; can and coil coating; paper, film, and fabric coating; flatwood products coating;
large appliance coating; magnet wire coating; marine vessel coating; metal and wood furniture coating; miscellaneous
metal parts and products coating; motor vehicle and mobile equipment refinishing; plastic parts coating; and graphic
arts (printing) operations. 

While EPA has proposed an exemption level similar to that found in the traditional regulations for this source category,
EPA seeks public comment on the exemption level found in the rules and will review this exemption level prior to program
implementation. 

(2) Issues. The major issue on which EPA seeks comment is whether these emissions should be covered by the cap rule as
proposed or by a manufacturers bubble approach (see section (i) for discussion). The FIP cap rule approach would provide
the owners or operators of facilities using industrial and commercial coatings and solvents the most compliance
flexibility. Owners or operators could use a variety of methods to comply with the rule. Such methods include installing
new emission control systems or increasing the efficiency of existing control devices, process modifications or
substitutions, or limiting the amount of solvent used at the facility. Process modifications including installing
new, more efficient processes, increasing the efficiency of existing processes, or limiting process operating
time. Substitutions include the replacement of solvent-based coatings with low-VOC coatings. 



d. VOC Emissions Associated with the Manufacturing of Products_

 (1) Source category description. The rule for this source category will regulate VOC emissions from manufacturing
and fabrication processes used to produce organic chemicals, gases, rubber and miscellaneous plastic products.
Examples of products manufactured or fabricated by processes that would potentially be covered by this rule are:


 Industrial organic chemicals and gases. Industrial organic chemicals include, but are not limited to, gum
and wood chemicals, cyclic organic crudes and intermediates, organic dyes and pigments, and 280 organic chemicals
(listed in the TSD). 

 Drugs which include, but are not limited to, medicinal chemicals and botanical products, pharmaceutical
preparations, in vitro and in vivo diagnostic substances, and biological products. 

 Soaps; detergents; cleaning, polishing, and sanitizing preparations; surface active agents, finishing
agents, sulfonated oils, and assistants; and perfumes and cosmetics. 

 Food additives and sweeteners. 

 Paints, varnishes, lacquers, enamels, inks, primers, paint removers, thinners, stains, shellacs, cleaners,
putty, coatings, adhesives, fillers, sealants, explosives, and carbon black. 

 Fabricated rubber and miscellaneous plastics products including, but not limited to, tires and inner tubes;
rubber and plastic footwear, hose, belting, gasket, packing, and sealing devices; and molded, extruded, and lathe-cut
mechanical rubber goods. 

The proposed rule for this source category contains an exemption level of 10 pounds per day of VOC emissions. While
EPA has proposed an exemption level similar to that found in the traditional regulations for this source category,
EPA seeks public comment on the exemption level found in the rules and will review this exemption level prior to program
implementation. 

e. Disposal of Materials Containing VOCs 

(1) Source category description. The proposed rule for this source category would regulate VOC emissions at organic
waste disposal facilities. Organic waste disposal facilities include any facility which is operated as a business
or owned by a state or municipality and is used to treat, store, or dispose of organic wastes that contain VOCs or to reclaim
or recycle organic compounds or gases from organic wastes that contain VOCs. Examples of organic waste disposal facility
include: landfills; publicly owned treatment works (POTWs); hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal
facilities; and sewage sludge, solid waste, and hazardous waste incinerators. Waste solvents, coatings, and other
products which contain VOCs are the major source of VOC emissions at these facilities. The VOCs contained in consumer
products which are flushed to POTWs after use may be a major source of VOCs at POTWs. Given the limited data available
on emissions from these facilities, no exemption level is included in the proposed rule. Upon receipt of baseline
data in 1999, EPA will evaluate an exemption level for this source category. 

(2) Issues. EPA is requesting any information which can be used to characterize the number, size, and location of,
and VOC emissions from organic waste disposal facilities located in the FIP areas. EPA is also requesting public comment
on the need for this rule because the reductions associated with the industrial and commercial solvent use and the
consumer and pesticide products rules may result in a reduction in VOC emissions at organic waste disposal facilities.




f. Commercial Food Preparation and/or Baking_

(1) Source category description. The proposed rule for this source category will regulate VOC emissions from commercial
food preparation facilities. Commercial food preparation facilities include commercial bakeries and commercial
charbroiling, fruit and vegetable preservation, grain mill production, malt beverage production, vegetable oil
production, and wine- or brandy-making facilities, and restaurants involved in any of the aforementioned activities.
The rule for this source category includes an exemption level of 10 pounds per day of VOC emissions. While EPA has proposed
an exemption level similar to that found in the traditional regulations for this source category, EPA seeks public
comment on the exemption level found in the rules and will review this exemption level prior to program implementation.


(2) Issues. EPA is requesting public comment on methods for adjusting requirements for sources which barely exceed
the exemption levels. For these small sources, it will become increasingly onerous to reduce emission levels. EPA
is considering implementing the initial emission reduction requirements at a later date (though within a timeframe
consistent with the attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the FIP areas) for these sources. 



g. Petroleum and Natural Gas Extraction, Processing, and Storage_

(1)  Source category description. The proposed rule for this source category would regulate VOC emissions from all
VOC sources at oil and natural gas drilling wells (both on-shore wells and wells located offshore that, by virtue of
the rule for onshore wells, would then be regulated by EPA's Outer Continental Shelf regulations in 40 CFR part 55);
oil refineries; and petroleum, gasoline, and natural gas storage facilities. Storage facilities include extraction
and refinery facilities, bulk gasoline plants and terminals, or any other facility which distributes petroleum,
gasoline, or natural gas to retail outlet and wholesale purchaser-consumer facilities. 

The intent of this proposed rule is to reduce VOC emissions associated with petroleum and natural gas production,
processing, and storage without limiting gasoline supplies. Retail gasoline service stations are exempted from
this rule because these facilities already are complying with existing regulations.






(2) Issues. EPA is undecided on whether wholesale purchasers/consumers should be subject to the VOC limitations
of this rule. A wholesale purchaser/consumer includes any business which is the ultimate consumer of natural gas,
gasoline, or other petroleum-based fuel. Examples of wholesale purchaser/consumers include airports and fleet
vehicle operations. Public comment is requested on potential control methods for wholesale purchasers/consumers
(other than restricting the amount of petroleum, natural gas, or gasoline purchased) which could be applied under
the rule.

h. NO

X

 emissions sources_

 (1) Source category description. The proposed rule for this source category will regulate NO

X

 emissions in Ventura County from the following processes: 

 Any boiler, furnace, oven, dryer, heater, incinerator, test cell and any solid, liquid or gaseous fueled equipment
with a maximum rated capacity greater than or equal to 2 million Btu per hour; 

 Any internal combustion engine with rated brake horsepower (bhp) greater than or equal to 50 bhp, regardless
of operating time; 

 Any gas turbine rated greater than or equal to 0.2 megawatts excluding any emergency standby equipment or peaking
unit; 

 Any petroleum refinery fluid catalytic cracking unit; 

 Any petroleum refinery tail gas unit; 

 Any kiln or calciner; 

 Any equipment burning or incinerating solid fuels or materials; 

 Any sulfuric acid production unit; 

 Any portable combustion and process equipment; 

 Any emergency standby equipment or peaking unit; 

 Any NO

X

 source for which NO

X

 emissions reported to the state or local agency were equal to or greater than 2 tons per year for the calendar year 1990.


The proposed reporting exemption level of 2 tons per year of NO

X

 emissions is based on work done by the SCAQMD in their development of the RECLAIM program. 

(2) Issues. EPA is requesting comment on alternative exemption levels particularly for the FIP areas for these sources.
For instance, the participation level could be as low as 2 tons per year, with an exemption level of 1 ton per year in the
control areas. With respect to the South Coast FIP area, EPA is intending to use the RECLAIM NO

X

 program's reductions for use toward attainment in lieu of implementing the FIP cap NO

X

 program (this strategy may also be used in the case of a VOC RECLAIM program if the South Coast should develop such a program).
If EPA is unable to approve the NO

X

 RECLAIM program, EPA would promulgate the NO

X

 cap program in the South Coast to achieve comparable reductions. 




i. Alternatives to the FIP cap program_

At present, EPA has identified several alternatives to the design of EPA's proposed FIP cap program. For example,
the FIP cap program does not include a trading component (i.e., the current proposal does not provide for trading of
emission credits to achieve reductions). In addition, the industrial and commercial coatings and solvents source
category could be regulated at the manufacturer level as opposed to the user level. Finally, the use of other economic
instruments such as fees is also an alternative to the cap program proposed today. EPA seeks public comment on any of
the following issues as well as any other issues or designs that may be available to achieve equivalent emissions reductions.

<TEXT>
 


(1) Trading of emissions. Although EPA's thinking on how to incorporate trading into a facility-wide emissions cap
program has advanced in the last several months, EPA believes that the trading of emissions in the three FIP areas to
meet facility emissions caps requires further study prior to implementation. To this end, EPA will be examining many
of the issues that arise as a result of the use of emissions trading to meet emissions cap requirements. Some of the issues
that will be examined are:
 The impacts of emissions trading on the FIP areas' ability to meet ozone attainment requirements;
 How enforcement of applicable requirements will be carried out with a trading system;
 Whether VOC trading would pose an increased exposure to toxic emissions (or hazardous air pollutants, many
of which are also VOCs) and whether toxics trading would be allowed given EPA's work on Title III regulations and EPA's
commitment to environmental justice;
 Whether differences in accuracy of emissions quantification methods would necessarily limit trading to
source emissions that could be quantified within some minimum level of accuracy, or to limit trading to sources which
are in the same source category;
 Whether there would be an economic impact on the three FIP areas because of emissions trading;
 The interface between trading and new source review requirements in the FIP areas;
 Market structure issues, such as the length of the compliance period, the type of market established, market
administration, implementation of trades, and general data tracking involved with trading; and
 Resource issues involved with the implementation of a trading system (i.e., can EPA provide the additional
resources needed to administer a trading program?).
(2) Manufacturers Bubble for Industrial and Commercial Solvents and Coatings. (a) Introduction. All of the California
FIP areas suffer from emission reduction shortfalls after application of the proposed conventional FIP stationary,
area, and mobile source controls. These shortfalls must be accounted for in order to bring the FIP areas into attainment.
In this NPRM, EPA is discussing and taking comment on the use of a statewide manufacturers ``bubble'' rule as an alternative
to the cap program to obtain required reductions in the FIP areas. Given that manufacturers sell products throughout
California, EPA believes, based on its experience with other designs,
 that statewide regulation is the only effective means of controlling these emissions at the manufacturer level.
The intent of EPA's extensive discussion is to provide sufficient detailed discussion of the manufacturers bubble
concept so that between the proposal of the FIP and its final promulgation, EPA can develop and include in the final
FIP promulgation a measure in final regulatory form that will incorporate the concepts discussed (EPA will avoid
the task of a supplemental proposal by discussing the manufacturers bubble in detailed form). The purpose of this
rule would be to reduce VOC emissions from industrial and commercial solvents and coatings. This reduction would
be realized by limiting the VOC content of these products at the point of manufacture. This type of regulation is consistent
with EPA's new commitment to preventing pollution at the source, rather than at the end of a process or processes.




This manufacturers bubble rule would serve as a method to regulate the emissions of VOCs from industrial and commercial
solvents and coatings. This proposed regulatory program would establish a VOC content limit that companies who manufacture
solvents and coatings would have to meet, on average, for all of their products sold in the State of California. EPA
is proposing this alternative in preliminary form only at this time and solicits the public's comments on the concept
and technical merit of this program. If this approach is ultimately selected, actual rule language will follow, and
will incorporate the concepts proposed in this NPRM, as well as ideas and concerns expressed in comments received.
While EPA realizes that the most straightforward means of regulation would be to put a firm limit on the maximum allowable
VOC content on every coating and solvent, EPA has determined that this regulatory strategy may become, at some point,
excessively onerous on the manufacturers and users of industrial and commercial solvents and coatings, and would
limit the availability of commercially useful solvents. Imposing content limits stringent enough to obtain the
necessary reductions in VOC emissions needed to bring the FIP areas into attainment may be technology forcing. In
addition, EPA does not have the resources to effectively research the solvent and coating industries to determine
feasible content limits for every coating and solvent, especially considering the court-ordered deadline for promulgation
of this FIP.
EPA intends that the manufacturers bubble rule discussed here would achieve the VOC reductions necessary to bring
the FIP areas, along with other control measures discussed elsewhere in this action, into attainment while minimizing
any technology-forcing aspects of the rule. EPA believes that, within the FIP context, promulgating a rule that allows
manufacturers to comply by averaging VOC content may provide necessary emission reductions with a minimum of adverse
regulatory impact. Such a rule would allow manufacturers the flexibility necessary to comply at minimum cost.
(b) Withdrawal of rules based on SIP progress. As noted elsewhere in this NPRM, the manufacturers bubble program rule
may be affected (i.e., rescinded or modified) by State or local measures which are adopted and implemented prior to
implementation of the manufacturers bubble program and which represent the necessary emission reductions from
industrial and commercial solvents and coatings.
(c) Relationship with other FIP provisions. EPA intends that the manufacturers bubble rule discussed in this subsection
will work simultaneously with the FIP cap program proposed elsewhere in this NPRM to obtain a significant portion
of the reductions needed to reach attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the FIP areas. However, EPA is considering additional
options for the interaction of these two programs (the FIP cap program for these emission sources and the manufacturers
bubble for these same sources) and requests public comment on the merit of these options. EPA is considering using
the manufacturers bubble program to preempt portions of the cap program (particularly the FIP cap program covering
industrial and commercial coatings and solvents). The manufacturers bubble program may be used to relieve portions
of the cap program requirements either for a particular source category (such as industrial and commercial solvents
and coatings), or to reduce the total VOC emission reductions expected from the cap program. The following sections
provide a detailed discussion of the proposed manufacturers bubble program.
(d) Implementation date. EPA is proposing that the manufacturers bubble rule would be implemented January 1, 2001
to be consistent with the implementation date of the FIP cap program discussed earlier while achieving the necessary
reductions for attainment, unless it is withdrawn prior to that date on the basis of State or federal progress in reducing
emissions of VOCs.

(e) Applicability. This proposed rule would affect U.S. manufacturers and importers who offer for sale in the State
of California industrial and commercial solvents and coatings. These solvents and coatings include, but are not
limited to, the categories listed in section iii.c.5.c.(1) of this NPRM.
EPA requests comment on the inclusion or exclusion of these and other categories from the definition of industrial
solvents and coatings.
(f) Exemption limit. EPA proposes and requests comment on two options for determining the minimum size of a manufacturer
that would be subject to this rule. It is EPA's intention to include in this rule only those sources whose products have
a potential to emit a nontrivial amount of VOC to the atmosphere. Therefore, EPA proposes that only those manufacturers
whose products have a potential to emit at least 0.5 ton of VOC in California in a calendar year be subject to this manufacturers
bubble rule. This potential would be measured by multiplying the manufacturer's total annual sales in the State of
California by the VOC content of those products.
As an alternative to using potential VOC emissions as a measure of the minimum manufacturer size that would be subject
to this rule, EPA requests comment on using a manufacturer's pretax gross revenues to determine their relative potential
to emit VOCs. With this method of exemption measurement, manufacturers of industrial and commercial solvents and
coatings with annual pretax gross revenue below $500,000 would be exempt from this rule. Another alternative to determining
this exemption level is to base it on annual unit sales of VOC-containing compounds. Under this option, a manufacturer
who sold less than 100,000 units of VOC-containing materials in the State of California in one calendar year would
be exempt from the rule.
(g) Conceptual design. This rule would establish VOC content limits for a variety of solvent and coating categories
(see the applicability section of this discussion for details). These content limits would be derived from EPA's
published Control Technique Guidelines,
 as well as the reasonably available control technology/best available retrofit control technology (RACT/BARCT)
determinations established by CARB or current District rules. Manufacturers would be in compliance with this rule
if the average VOC content of their products was less than the average content limits set for those categories that
the manufacturer produced. This average would not be a simple arithmetic average. Instead, it would be a weighed average,
where the weights on VOC content would be derived from the demonstrated number of units sold by that manufacturer during
the compliance period in the State of California. This averaging is expressed mathematically in the following formulas:










Where:
N=Number of Products;
i=Product Index;
VOCC

i

=VOC content of product i;
SW

i

=sales weight of product i
S

i

=sales of product i
VOC

i

=Content Standard for the ith product;



A manufacturer will be in compliance if:


Average Emissions > Average Content Standard


That is, if average emissions are less than or equal to the average content standard, the manufacturer is in compliance.

<DOCNO> FR940505-1-00102 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 





EPA currently is proposing that the compliance period be quarterly. Prior to the implementation of the manufacturers
bubble program, EPA will prepare a statistical showing that the aggregate effect of the specified averaging time
is consistent with attaining the ozone NAAQS and satisfying applicable progress requirements on a typical summer
day basis in accordance with the proposed economic incentive program rules and guidance (see 58 FR 11110, February
23, 1993). However, EPA is also considering annual, monthly, and flexible compliance periods, and is soliciting
comment on the appropriateness of the duration of these compliance periods. 

EPA is also soliciting comments on establishing a single VOC content limit for all industrial and commercial solvents
and coatings, which would be the level that a manufacturer's sales weighted average must be less than or equal to in
order to be in compliance. This option differs from the averaging scheme discussed above in that instead of having
several VOC content limits for each source subcategory that would be used to determine if a manufacturer was in compliance,
a single VOC content limit for all industrial and commercial coatings and solvents would be established. Manufacturers
products would have to be less than or equal to this content limit, on average, in order to comply with the rule. This
option is exhibited mathematically in following formulas: 










Where: 


N=Number of Products;


i=Product Index;


VOCC

i

=VOC content of product i;


SW

i

=sales weight of product i


S

i

=sales of product i


VOC

i

=Content Standard for the ith product;





A manufacturer will be in compliance if: 

Average Emissions>Average Content Standard


That is, if average emissions are less than or equal to the content standard, the manufacturer is in compliance. 

While the proposed manufacturers bubble rule provides compliance flexibility for manufacturers with several products,
requiring manufactures that produce only one solvent or coating to meet content limits could put them at a disadvantage.
Because of this, EPA is soliciting comments on options to ease the regulatory burden on manufacturers with one product.
Specifically, EPA is considering the following options: 

 Including these manufacturers despite the competitive disadvantage 

 Excluding these manufacturers from the rule 

 Raising the minimum size manufacturer that would be subject to the rule for these manufacturers 

(h) Recordkeeping and reporting. To demonstrate compliance, EPA will require manufacturers subject to this proposed
manufacturers bubble rule to submit documentation to EPA. This documentation will be submitted in two parts. The
first part will be a plan describing what products the manufacturer intends to market during that compliance period,
the VOC content of each product, an estimate of their sales during the compliance period, and how the manufacturer
intends to conclusively show what the sales of those products during the compliance period actually were. EPA will
review this plan for completeness and the viability of the proposed sales reporting method. EPA will approve or disapprove
this submission within the 90 days of the compliance period. In the case of an incomplete submittal or disapproval,
EPA will notify the submitting manufacturer of the deficiencies, and will require another submittal before the end
of the second quarter of the compliance period.

The second part of this compliance demonstration will be submitted to EPA at the end of the compliance period. This
document will contain the sales demonstration for each of the manufacturer's products that are subject to this manufacturers
bubble and their VOC contents. This demonstration will follow the methodologies approved by EPA in part one of the
compliance demonstration. Manufacturers will be required to retain all documents pertaining to this compliance
demonstration for a period of five years. EPA solicits comments on these proposed recordkeeping provisions. 

(i) Implementation and enforcement issues. Because of EPA's limited resources, the agency intends to require manufacturers
subject to this proposed rule to structure their compliance demonstrations in such a way so that the agency can minimize
its review and enforcement costs. EPA invites comment on ways to accomplish this goal. The agency invites comments
from other entities with experience in designing and implementing these types of manufacturers bubble programs.
EPA especially seeks comment on ways to reduce the cost of enforcement against manufacturers with a potential for
multiple inspection locations. 

(3) The use of other economic instruments to incentivize emission reductions. EPA is also examining the use of other
economic instruments to achieve emission reductions equivalent to the proposed FIP cap program. The primary instrument
that EPA is considering is the use of emission fees to accomplish the necessary reductions in the FIP areas. The use
of fees will involve examining at least the following issues: 

 Fee structures: how much should be charged for a given quantity of pollution and how will the fee structure affect
the FIP areas' ability to attain the ozone NAAQS? Should fees be constant up to an allowable emissions limit and increase
as excess emissions increase? 

 Permitting issues: how will NSR and other permitting issues be addressed? 

 Enforcement issues: how will EPA or the FIP areas enforce a fee program? 

 Economic impacts: how will the use of fees affect the FIP areas' economies? 

EPA seeks public comment on the above fee-related issues as well as comment with respect to the use of other economic
incentive strategies not discussed in this proposal. 



D. Mobile Sources 



1. Overview of Mobile Source Issues and Measures_


a. Emissions Credit for the California Motor Vehicle Control Program. 


The California LEV program relies on advanced emission control technologies, clean gasoline, and an on-board diagnostic
(OBD) system, which together with enhanced I/M, or its equivalent, are designed to assure that in-use vehicles emit
at levels close to their respective emission standards. EPA is confident that the LEV program will achieve substantial
emission reductions beyond those which will result from federal cars. Emission reductions for the LEV program used
in the FIP reflect a substantial reduction in the rate of emission deterioration compared to current vehicles. 

EPA believes that the California LEV program has addressed the problem of excessive in-use emission deterioration
with its on-board diagnostics program, which requires the identification of individual vehicles whose emissions
exceed the certification standards by more than 50 percent. Furthermore, ARB's assessment of the new technology
which will be used to comply with LEV standards has identified many new components and control techniques which will
improve emission durability. These features of the LEV program will help assure that in-use vehicle emission deterioration
will be substantially reduced from current levels and that the low emission attributed to the program by ARB will be
realized in-use. 

b. Summary of Mobile Source FIP Measures_
In 1990, passenger cars, other highway vehicles, nonroad engines and equipment, and the transportation facilities
used in interstate commerce produced from 53 to 63 percent of the total inventory of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
and from 70 to 94 percent of the total inventory of oxides of nitrogen (NO

X

) in the FIP areas covered by this proposal. In order to demonstrate attainment of the ozone standard in these areas,
it will be necessary to propose regulations which assure significant reductions in mobile source emissions_beyond
those already expected from the continued turnover to newer, cleaner vehicles and engines. The mobile source category
covers a very broad range of sizes of equipment, types of fuels, uses and operating modes, and extent of current pollution
control. Therefore, there is no one measure or even one uniform type of measure which is proposed across the category
to achieve the reductions needed for the attainment plans. 

In addition to those measures that are required in all States by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and those measures
being implemented by the State of California and local agencies, EPA considered measures requiring cleaner vehicles
and engines via further improvements in technology or through incentives for users to select alternatives with lower
polluting characteristics. EPA also developed measures which will achieve emission reductions from other remaining
mobile source categories, both to provide sufficient reductions for attainment and to ensure that each category
of emission source was contributing to the solution. The following specific measures were developed. 

(1) Programs for Light Duty Vehicles. EPA expects the California Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) program will substantially
reduce emissions from cars and light duty trucks, compared to federal standards. However, despite the use of advanced
technologies and the OBD requirements, ARB projects LEVs will exceed their certification standards in-use. Emissions
above the certification standards will occur because some models may experience more in-use deterioration than
expected, or because individual vehicles experience component failure or improper maintenance which is not immediately
corrected by the various existing in-use compliance programs, including enhanced I/M. 

Because the magnitude of the emission reductions needed for attainment is so great, the adoption of further measures
to reduce these in-use emissions will help reach attainment of the ozone standard. EPA is therefore seeking comments
on the need for and benefits of adopting an enhanced in-use compliance program which would provide extra emission
reductions above and beyond the substantial reduction provided by the California LEV program. 

Specifically EPA is considering three approaches. The first would modify the current federal recall program to initiate
recalls based on the emission results of vehicles tested in their as-received condition, but from vehicles which
are subject to the new enhanced I/M program and thus should be well maintained. Obviously tampered or abused vehicles
would also be excluded from that sample. This differs from current practice and would result in a shift in responsibility
for ensuring low in-use emissions from the consumer to the manufacturer.

The second approach would make manufacturers responsible for vehicle repairs in those cases where vehicle failure
rates for a particular model in an enhanced I/M program exceed a threshold level (e.g., greater than 5 percent within
the first 5 years). This approach (i.e., an I/M-based, selective recall program) also provides an incentive for vehicle
manufacturers to increase the durability and reliability of their designs.

The third possible program involves adoption of a requirement that the on-board diagnostic system of new vehicles
be capable of communicating, to on-road sensors, the operational status of the emission control system (i.e., whether
a fault has been detected). This approach would allow for the immediate detection of high emitting vehicles so that
they may be submitted for repair.

(2) Programs for Medium Duty Vehicles. California's medium duty standards for 1995 and later model years apply to
all vehicles between 6000 and 14,000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR). Manufacturers have previously been
able to certify medium duty vehicles over 8500 pounds under the less stringent heavy duty standards and procedures.
California rules require further reductions to be phased in between the 1998 and 2003 model years, through a California
medium duty LEV program. EPA proposes to accelerate the medium duty LEV program phase in and to require additional
emission reductions. EPA is also requesting comment on including all 1999 and later model vehicles certified under
California's medium duty LEV program (as modified by the FIP) in an enhanced in-use compliance program similar to
that described for light duty vehicles. An option to certify engines used in these vehicles under the stringent heavy
duty engine program described below is also available.

(3) Programs for Heavy Duty Vehicles. Currently, heavy duty engines for highway vehicles are certified to national
emission standards; no waiver is in place for the State of California to enforce different standards for engines sold
in the state. EPA proposes that, beginning with the 1999 model year, more stringent standards would apply for NO

X

 and HC exhaust from heavy duty engines sold in California, and strict evaporative hydrocarbon requirements would
also be applied to prevent a shift from diesel to gasoline fuel which could make reductions in NO

X

 easier but would result in higher HC emissions. As with light duty vehicles, the FIP proposes additional measures
to enhance in-use compliance for the engines' full operational life, including as-received recall requirements.
The FIP also proposes to include some pre-1999 model year heavy duty vehicles in the I/M program.

Since the emission reductions from the heavy duty engines are very important to the attainment demonstration, it
is also necessary to ensure that the fleet operated in California continues to experience normal turnover. The introduction
of tighter standards can work against turnover, however, if heavy duty vehicle owners perceive that costs will rise
or that new technology is risky. To ensure a normal turnover in heavy duty engines, the FIP proposes a declining average
NO

X

 level for operating fleets starting in the year 2000. The decline in average NO

X

 will reflect the historical level of new engine purchases and old engine retirements..

Many trucks operating in California are also engaged in interstate commerce. California Air Resources Board (CARB)
data show that about 20 percent of the mileage accumulated for heavy-duty vehicles in California is from trucks registered
in other States. If new emission standards are adopted for California trucks, the interstate trucks would likely
remain certified only to the less stringent federal standards, and their use in California could increase, preventing
the new California standards from achieving their full potential for emission reduction. Tighter emission standards
only on California registered trucks could impose a cost burden on California shipping firms that would not exist
for shippers based outside of the state. EPA wants to avoid such a competitive disadvantage for trucking firms based
in California since it could result in even more operation by out-of-state trucks, and is requesting comment on two
options for a policy to deal with federally certified interstate trucks driving in California. These programs could
be implemented together or separately.

First, starting in 1999, EPA proposes that any time a federally certified truck (i.e., not meeting the FIP standards
and not included in a California fleet averaging program) with multiple-state registrations operates in the state,
it could make no more than one stop in either the South Coast, Ventura, or Sacramento FIP areas. Any pickup or delivery
would be considered a stop. Also interstate trucks making a stop in one of the FIP areas would not be permitted to make
more than two stops statewide.

Second, starting in 2005, EPA is proposing to require all trucks which do not meet FIP standards operating in the state
to be certified to the federal emission standards for 1998 and later model engines. Preventing earlier models from
operating in California would greatly reduce the emission contribution from the interstate portion of the heavy
duty fleet. 

(4) Programs for Nonroad Vehicles and Engines. EPA has begun the process of setting national emission standards for
a wide variety of nonroad sources including, but not limited to, small spark ignition engines used in lawn and garden
and other utility equipment, recreational vehicle and marine engines, and heavy duty farm and construction equipment.
In addition to these national standards, special California-only standards are proposed in the FIP for certain subcategories
of engines and equipment:

(a) Nonroad Heavy Duty Engines (engines at or above 50 horsepower, 37kW). Phase 1 of the FIP proposal incorporates
the national program for control of NO

X

 from new nonroad heavy-duty engines which will be published in final rulemaking by May 1994. The FIP also proposes
standards for HC, CO, particulates, and smoke. These standards are consistent with the nonroad equipment standards
which have been adopted in California. The effect of Phase 1 is to extend the application of the California standards
to farm and construction equipment which California is currently pre-empted from regulating.

New engine standards would be phased in on a national basis by engine size over four years beginning January 1996. The
national standards apply to all compression ignition engines at or above 50 horsepower (37kW) except engines used
in underground mining activity, aircraft, marine vessels, or to propel locomotives.

Phase 2 of the FIP proposal for this equipment category contains a program to ensure that nonroad engines over 50 horsepower
used in the FIP areas meet stringent NO

X

 and HC standards over their full useful lives. The program includes a combination of low NO

X

 and HC standards, very stringent ILEV evaporative requirements, and other elements of an enhanced in-use compliance
program. Requirements are also proposed for engine rebuilds.

For Ventura and the South Coast, the FIP proposes the same numerical NO

X

 standard for nonroad engines as is proposed for on-highway heavy duty engines. It proposes a less stringent standard
for nonroad equipment used in the Sacramento area, because less NO

X

 reduction is needed for attainment.

Nonroad engines and equipment are generally not registered or licensed by a state, with the exception of recreational
boats. This fact makes it difficult to administer and enforce a rule for equipment that is different in California
(or even in some areas of California) than it is in the rest of the country. But if these subcategories are to contribute
their share to the attainment plan (and their share can be quite large as all other types of mobile sources are tightly
controlled), then EPA must consider going beyond national standards, fashioning a plan which assures that equipment
used in the FIP areas meets tighter standards, and that equipment purchased outside the control area cannot be used
to avoid the cost of control. That is what the FIP proposal attempts to do for nonroad heavy duty engines. 

A fleet-average standard with a declining emission level which reflects the historical number of new engine purchases
and old engine retirements, similar in concept to that for on-highway heavy duty engines, is proposed. Operation
of heavy equipment in the FIP areas will be prohibited if the equipment is not part of a registered fleet. Nonroad equipment
owners may pool their fleets to facilitate compliance, just as with highway fleets. An equipment labeling system
is proposed to allow enforcement by EPA. 

(b) Small Nonroad Equipment (spark ignited engines at or below 25 horsepower, 19kW). Since March 1992, EPA has held
several public workshops and meetings to solicit information on technical characteristics, emissions, potential
regulatory strategies, and other issues related to small spark ignition engines. The Agency believes that the best
approach for setting emission standards in this category will be a consultative approach of negotiated rulemaking
often called ``reg neg.'' But there is also a sense of urgency about the need for areas to benefit from the reductions
in emissions that will result from standards in this category. The result is that EPA will be pursuing a two phased approach
to regulation of small spark ignition engines. 

In the first phase, EPA will propose regulations through the normal regulatory process. These regulations will be
similar to California's regulation for 1995 and later utility and lawn and garden equipment engines. EPA's proposal
will extend the regulations in California to engines which California is currently pre-empted from regulating.
The second phase of regulation will utilize the reg neg process to develop consensus on important issues, such as useful
life, in-use emissions, evaporative emissions, test procedures, and market based incentive programs. EPA believes
that Phase 1 standards will result in a 40 percent reduction in the HC inventory from small engines. Phase 2 will achieve
a 90 percent reduction in HC inventory from this category. The agency expects that achieving a 90 percent reduction
would not depend solely on more stringent exhaust emission standards, but rather on a combination of strategies (e.g.,
scrappage or other programs to accelerate turnover, fuel requirements , and/or evaporative controls). 

EPA's Phase 2 rulemaking is intended to apply nationally in approximately 2000 to 2001. If the Agency's phase 2 program
does not come out of the reg neg process providing for a 90 percent reduction in HC, then EPA has committed to propose
those more-stringent measures applicable to California, either statewide or in the FIP areas, which are necessary
to the overall attainment strategy. The federal rules are expected to explicitly exclude spark ignition marine engines,
engines used in underground mining, motorcycle engines, aircraft engines, and those used in recreational vehicles
which will be covered elsewhere. 

(c) Motorcycles and Recreational Vehicles. EPA believes that by using existing on-highway motorcycle technology,
it is possible to reduce the contribution of nonroad motorcycles and recreational vehicles to the HC and NO

X

 emission levels in the FIP areas. Therefore, it is proposing to treat on-highway and nonroad motorcycles in California
equally and to apply a more stringent set of exhaust emission standards to all new on-highway and nonroad motorcycles
sold in California after January 1996. This proposal encompasses engines used in such vehicles as mopeds, dirt bikes,
all terrain vehicles (ATVs), and go-karts. The standards are being proposed statewide, because EPA believes that
that is necessary to assure that the equipment used in the FIP areas meets standards. The level of stringency may require
the substitution of 4-stroke nonroad engines for the 2-stroke engines currently used in some nonroad applications,
but there is also the prospect that catalyst technology may be viable. 

(d) Spark-Ignition Marine Propulsion Engines. Reductions from this subcategory of nonroad equipment will come
from a national program of emission standards and from a registering/permitting fee system for operation in FIP-area
waters. The national regulation, scheduled to be final by November 1995, will reduce emissions from outboard engines,
personal watercraft (jet-skis, etc.), sterndrive engines, and inboard engines through application of new engine
emission standards. The standards themselves are not being proposed in the FIP, but will be proposed in September
1994. Reductions in per-engine emissions are expected to be on the order of 70-80 percent from current two-stroke
outboard and personal watercraft engines, and up to 30-50 percent from current 4-stroke carbureted sterndrive
and inboard engines. 

The standards will apply to new spark ignition marine propulsion engines produced after August 1, 1998. Certification
procedures will be similar to on-highway procedures, with some modifications appropriate for the ways these engines
are used. The program may also include features such as assembly-line testing and recall. 

Although these national standards will result in substantial emission reductions per new engine, overall reductions
in emissions from this category will depend on how much boating activity uses the newer, cleaner engines, and how much
activity uses older engines. EPA expects that approximately one half of the total fleet of marine pleasure craft owned
by FIP-area residents will meet the standard by the year 2005. However, equal use of old and new engines, in combination
with other available measures to reduce VOCs, does not appear to be enough to meet the goals of the FIP. Therefore, EPA
is also proposing a permit based fee system for marine engines produced before the new standards take effect, to strongly
discourage use of these very high emitting engines in the FIP areas. The fees for emission permits would be based on
the average excess emissions of pre-control engines compared to engines meeting the new emission standards. This
fee system would take effect in 2004, and would apply to only operators of marine pleasure craft who wished to operate
a boat in the FIP areas. Owners who live in the FIP areas but only use their boats elsewhere would not be affected. Owners
of boats meeting the new emission standards would be eligible for emission permits free of charge. 

(5) Programs for National Transportation Sources and Federal Activities. The litigation which resulted in today's
FIP proposal arose at least in part from a feeling in California that the emission regulation of certain sources was
not keeping pace with the attainment needs of California areas or with the stringency of control imposed on other sectors
of the California economy. For today's FIP proposal, EPA is proposing controls for these sources which include the
following provisions:

<TEXT>
 



(a) Locomotives. Today's proposal has three parts: a program for freshly 
manufactured locomotives which will be implemented nationwide; a 
program for remanufactured locomotives which could be implemented 
nationwide or in California only; and a South Coast program. 
Reductions from new and remanufactured locomotives should be 
achievable without causing economic damage to the railroad 
industry or causing a shift of the freight carrying business to 
truck-based forms of transportation. At the same time, it will 
extend the burden of clean air attainment in California to the 
locomotive sector. 
EPA will propose a national regulation that will apply to 
freshly manufactured locomotive engines beginning in 2000, and 
may also apply to the remanufacture of engines which were made 
since approximately 1973. Locomotives may operate for many 
decades and be remanufactured many times before they are retired. 
Extending the application of standards to remanufactured engines 
will accelerate and extend the overall emission reductions in the 
category. 


EPA estimates that a national program for freshly manufactured and remanufactured engines would reduce locomotive
emissions in the South Coast by approximately 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2010. As the total NO

X

 reduction from all sources required in the South Coast is approximately 70 percent, EPA would like to achieve comparable
reductions in this category. The FIP proposes that average engine NO

X

 emissions from locomotives and sources directly associated with locomotives be lowered to the new engine levels
through use of clean engines, electric power, and other means. California would retain the right to regulate operational
changes in railroads, including time spent idling, rail lubrication, operating times, etc. The overall average
would allow companies the maximum flexibility in 
meeting the additional emission reduction target. 


(b) Commercial Aviation. Commercial airports become increasingly important in the attainment effort as time goes
by. In the South Coast Air Basin, there are five commercial airports which will contribute nearly 9 percent of a 2010
allowable attainment inventory of NO

X

 and 6 percent of VOC if left uncontrolled. The emissions contributions in Sacramento and Ventura are smaller than
in the South Coast. Airport mobile sources include aircraft; ground service equipment such as baggage carts; and
ground access vehicles such as passenger cars, taxis, shuttle buses, etc. Aircraft are the 
dominant source. The percentage contribution and absolute amount of emissions from ground access vehicles in the
future decrease substantially as other FIP measures take effect; ground service equipment emits a smaller fraction
of the airport total. 



The FIP proposes an airline emissions bubble comprising mobile emission sources under the control of the airlines.
These include aircraft, aircraft auxiliary power units, ground service equipment, captive vehicle fleets, and
any other airline-operated mobile source. The FIP proposes declining targets for emissions for all commercial airline
operations in the Sacramento area, 
Ventura, and the South Coast Air Basin during the ozone season beginning in 2001. The emission reduction requirements
are consistent with those proposed for stationary sources under the emission cap program. This level of allowable
emissions would translate into an environmental performance factor, applicable to each airline, expressed as an
allowable pounds of pollutant per passenger equivalent unit. Airlines which exceed the limit would pay a fee based
on the amount of excess emissions generated. 



There are a number of ways that an airline could reduce emissions under its control to avoid compliance fees. Higher
plane load factors (fewer empty seats), electrifying ground service equipment, towing airplanes to the runway,
increased use of single engine taxiing, and bringing the cleanest planes to the California airports all contribute
to emission reductions under 
the FIP concept. The Agency is proposing that each airline be allowed to average the emissions from its operations
at all airports within a FIP area. Such intra-airline averaging could provide airlines with additional flexibility
in demonstrating compliance with the emissions target. EPA is also requesting comments on establishing an inter-airline
credit and trading 
program to further enhance compliance opportunities. 


(c) General Aviation. General aviation is comprised of a wide variety of aircraft types with significantly different
engines: piston, turboprop, 
and turbine. Much of the general aviation fleet is old, and there appear to be few, if any, significant technological
improvements in emission performance which could be obtained without a large investment in research and development.
Currently the general aviation manufacturing industry is also in 
a precarious economic state. 


EPA proposes to achieve emission reduction targets for general aviation which are consistent with the emission cap

requirements for many stationary sources in the FIP areas. EPA is proposing two fee system options in the alternative
for achieving the reductions in general aviation. In the first option, aircraft owners/operators would be charged
a fee for each takeoff from an airport in the FIP areas. The fee would be set high enough to discourage use without making
general aviation 
flying prohibitively expensive. 


The second option is identical to the first, but incorporates an exemption for engines that are certified to ``clean''
emission levels. It is possible that an engine manufacturer may find a differential fee system sufficient incentive
to begin producing cleaner aircraft for certification and use in California. The proposal also requests comment
on differentiating fees for specific airports based on the implementation of other emission reduction measures
by the airport proprietors such as refueling vapor recovery where 
applicable. 


(d) Military Installations. Military installations can include a significant amount of mobile source activity.
The FIP proposes, with certain 
exemptions, a military installation bubble in each FIP area encompassing mobile emission sources under the control
of the Department of Defense (DOD). This includes auxiliary power units, ground service equipment, captive vehicle
fleets, privately owned vehicles, and any other mobile source operated within the boundaries of the installation.
A declining cap will be applied which corresponds to the cap imposed on stationary sources within each FIP area. 


(e) Ships and Ports. Marine vessels are the largest uncontrolled source of 
emissions of NO

X

 and sulfur oxides (SO

X

) in California. According to a study prepared for CARB, marine vessels account for approximately 40 percent of all
SO

X

 and 12 percent of all NO

X

 
emissions from both mobile and stationary sources statewide. While most emissions associated with marine vessels
occur at sea, a great deal is emitted while the vessel is in port, during maneuvering and hotelling activities. Both
are of concern in the South Coast area, since emissions from vessels at sea are transported onshore by the prevailing
winds and can affect air quality, and because there are large ports and significant shipping activity in the area.




EPA does not believe that it is practical to pursue a conventional regulatory strategy for marine vessels in the FIP
for a number of reasons. Not all ships are equally high emitting, and not all ships spend a lot of time in California ports.
An expensive retrofit requirement may serve only to drive 
shipping traffic to competing port facilities where this special technology would not be required. Also, regulation
of ocean-going vessels, especially foreign-registered vessels, is traditionally undertaken by international
organizations like the International Maritime Organization (IMO). A unilateral action by EPA to require such technology
on all ocean-going ships that enter California's ports may be considered inappropriate by the international organizations
that oversee such vessels.

EPA is proposing a flexible control strategy for the reduction of emissions from ships. This strategy would rely on
economic incentives to encourage operators of ships that frequently use Southern California ports to take the necessary
steps to reduce their emissions. Specifically, an emissions fee would be based on the type of emission control that
a particular ship used. Ship operators would be allowed (and encouraged) to reduce the fees which would be applied
by using electrical onshore power service instead of the ship's engines while in port. Ships that use South Coast ports
more frequently would be faced with higher annual fees, and therefore would have a greater incentive to install more
efficient emission control devices to 
reduce or eliminate those fees. 



In Ventura, there are no large ports, but marine vessel emissions are still large contributors to the area's NO

X

 inventory, because of the emissions that are blown onshore from passing ships by the prevailing winds. The FIP includes
in its fee system provisions for encouraging ships to move further out to sea when passing the Ventura coastline. 


(6) Programs to Reduce Vehicle Miles Traveled. Passenger cars, light and heavy trucks, buses, and motorcycles have
met increasingly stringent new vehicle standards for years, and industrial sources of pollution have installed
increasingly sophisticated controls to reduce emissions. But the 
trends in the total emissions of VOCs and NO

X

 barely show any reduction over time. One reason for this is the growth in economic activity which causes increases
in emissions from stationary and area sources; another reason is the fact that the number of vehicle miles traveled
(VMT) has grown, significantly undercutting the impact of improved vehicle emission controls. 



VMT is increasing for several reasons: more Americans are working; travel by automobile is cheap and convenient;
alternatives to automobile travel are not convenient or do not exist at all in many situations; workers commute suburb
to suburb; and workers commute many miles each way in order to be able to afford a single family home. But there are things
that local communities can do to change some of the factors that cause the reliance on the automobile. Land use and zoning
policies can support mass transportation and car pooling as they now support single occupant vehicle travel. Investments
can be made in providing travel alternatives for work and leisure. Communities 
can begin to make the real cost of driving be reflected in fee systems for parking or use of congested roadways during
peak hours. EPA does not have the authority to make the land use planning policies that would be effective in reducing
VMT growth in the FIP areas. The Agency could impose fees on passenger vehicles in the FIP, but it could not return the
revenue that 
would be collected to the local area to support transportation alternatives. Therefore, the FIP focuses primarily
on additional requirements for improvements in vehicle technology which will contribute to a decrease in per vehicle
emissions. But, EPA has also considered whether there are controls which can be imposed via a federal implementation
plan which can lead to reductions in vehicle miles traveled. Two measures are proposed in today's NPRM: 


(a) Employee Commute Options Program. EPA is proposing two alternative attainment dates for the Sacramento area.
The first is the 1999 attainment date which is required by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, for areas 
classified as serious nonattainment for ozone. EPA is also proposing to bump the Sacramento area up to the severe classification
with a 2005 attainment date. Under the Clean Air Act, severe ozone nonattainment areas must implement employee commute
options (ECO) programs designed to reduce work-related 
trips and vehicle miles traveled during peak commuting periods. Specifically, employers with 100 or more employees
must develop and implement a plan to encourage employees to use alternatives to the single occupant vehicle commute.
Both the South Coast and the Ventura areas have implemented ECO programs, but the Sacramento area has not yet enacted
the necessary legal authority, although an ECO program is required under California law. Elsewhere in this NPRM,
EPA is proposing to approve the South Coast ECO program. Although EPA is not at this time prepared to approve the Ventura
ECO program, EPA need not do so as part of this FIP. Even though EPA is similarly not required to promulgate an ECO program
for Sacramento at this time, EPA is proposing to do so because the obligation of Sacramento to do an ECO program under
federal law would be a direct result of EPA's proposed bump-up. EPA is therefore proposing an ECO program for the Sacramento
area to be implemented if the area's classification is changed to severe. Affected employers must 
within two years develop programs which are designed to increase the vehicle occupancy of their employees to a target
which is 25 percent above the current average vehicle occupancy for all commute trips in the area. 


(b) Parking Cash Out. Even in downtown areas, most employees in California receive free or subsidized parking spaces.
Current tax codes allow 
employers to offer this benefit without the employer or the employee having to pay taxes on the value of the space. Since
parking costs represent the bulk of the daily cost of driving to work, these ``free'' spaces are a strong incentive
for employees to drive to work alone. 


As part of his Climate Change Action Plan, President Bill Clinton has called for transforming much of the existing
tax subsidy for employer-paid parking into a powerful reward for commuters to ride transit, carpool, or find other
ways to get to work. The Administration will shortly propose changes in the tax law necessary to bring about parking
subsidy reform. This same 
proposal is included in the FIP, in a form which is consistent with EPA's authority. The proposal does not modify the
tax code or require payments by an employer. Rather it applies certain restrictions.

Employers of 25 or more employees who lease parking spaces 
for their employees may not offer free parking unless they offer 
employees the option of retaining the parking or accepting a cash 
allowance equal to the market cost of the parking space. The 
cash allowance will be considered taxable income, but under 
current law, up to $60 per month of the cash may be taken in the 
form of a transit pass, which would be tax-exempt. Those who opt 
for the parking space will be unaffected by the change. Whether 
the employee decides to take the free parking or the cash 
allowance, the company can still deduct the cost from corporate 
income tax. Research indicates that such a program may reduce 
single occupant commuting by 20 percent in densely developed 
areas where most employer-provided parking is through leased 
spaces. The improvement which is achieved will also assist 
employers in complying with the ECO programs in each of the FIP 
areas. 

(7) Special Issues for Mobile Sources. (a) Inspection and Maintenance. 

While stricter standards act to ensure that new vehicles are 
cleaner than were their predecessors, there has been no guarantee 
that these vehicles would ``stay clean'' in actual use. 
Historically, tampering, lack of proper maintenance, 
maladjustment, and control equipment failures have meant that 
cars on the road would emit on average 3 to 4 times more 
pollutants than the levels for which their control systems were 
certified. The evolution of vehicles to fuel injection and 
closed-loop computer control along with the reduction in 
availability of leaded fuel have significantly reduced the amount 
that owners tamper with or maladjust their vehicle emission 
control systems. Simply, the cost advantage of using leaded fuel 
has disappeared, and vehicle performance has become so closely 
tied with having all systems operating as designed that it is no 
longer widely perceived to be beneficial to remove or render 
inoperative any of the various vehicle systems. Malfunctions of 
the engine and emission control systems can still occur, however. 
Periodic vehicle emissions inspection and maintenance (I/M) 
programs are designed to identify and repair these malfunctions. 

For this reason, I/M plays an important role in the FIP 
proposal. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 require areas 
such as the FIP areas which are classified as serious or worse 
ozone nonattainment to implement enhanced I/M programs. Up to 
this time, the State of California has not enacted an enhanced 
I/M program which meets the requirements of the national I/M rule 
which was published in 1992. A recently signed law in California 
retains the current Smog Check network of licensed inspection 
garages in slightly altered form. The national enhanced 
I/M 
regulations require that inspection and repair functions be 
conducted separately to avoid conflict of interest and improper 
testing unless there are other features which provide sufficient 
reductions to meet the enhanced I/M performance standard. EPA 
and the State are currently discussing a program design which 
would meet the enhanced I/M performance standard, but which would 
also preserve as much business as possible for the currently 
licensed inspection stations. This program has not yet achieved 
consensus among all parties and is not represented by specific 
legislation or as a SIP revision. 

The FIP I/M design must also deal with the further 
constraints that are imposed on EPA, namely that it cannot order 
the State to implement any of the FIP's required programs, nor 
can it add to its own appropriation in order to staff the various 
programs. That means that EPA must design programs which require 
the minimum level of oversight and administration. 

EPA is proposing an enhanced I/M program which follows 
closely the model program which sets the performance standard for 
all I/M programs nationwide. EPA would implement the program in 
the FIP areas through legal agreements between EPA and a private 
firm or firms which would provide testing services to California 
motorists. The firm(s) would be authorized to charge a specific 
fee for the test; EPA's oversight costs would have to be absorbed 
by the Agency.

EPA believes that an I/M network run by one or a few private firms will, in fact, be the most cost-effective, convenient
option for the State in providing I/M testing. It may not, however, meet other economic and social objectives held
by State and local authorities, special interest groups, or the public. Some in California have indicated a desire
to continue to involve as many individual businesses as possible in the program; some are also interested in exploring
alternative test procedures. The fact that these features do not appear in the FIP proposal does not mean that they
necessarily could not be pieces of the I/M program which California ultimately adopts in the SIP. However, if a SIP
I/M program with a licensed test-and-repair station element is less effective than the I/M program proposed in the
FIP, substitution of the former for the latter would require the addition of compensating increases in the stringency
of other measures or the addition of measures not proposed for the FIP at all. 

Because of the reasons outlined above, EPA is proposing an enhanced 
I/M program in the FIP. However, EPA and the State are continuing to hold discussions on a program design which would
meet the enhanced I/M performance standard. EPA would not finalize the FIP I/M program, should an agreement be reached,
if appropriate legislation were adopted and an approvable SIP revision submitted. 

(b) Retrofit Programs for Mobile Sources. There has been a considerable amount of interest expressed by California
air pollution control officials in retrofit/replacement options for highway diesel vehicles, heavy duty nonroad
equipment, and locomotives. These are the categories (in addition to light duty vehicles) which contribute the bulk
of the NO

X

 emissions in the FIP areas. And, a retrofit requirement could accelerate the emission reductions that would normally
result from equipment turnover. In order for a retrofit/replacement strategy to work, however, there are a number
of tasks which must be completed. 

The general knowledge about how and where different types of engines are used must be increased significantly. For
each category, there will be different typical lifetimes and rebuild or repower practices as well as differences
in current technology and the feasibility of lowering NO

X

 through in-field engine modifications. To estimate the impact of any measure, it is necessary to know the market share
for the engines for which low emission models are available and much more about the usage patterns, for example, how
much of the VMT in the inventory is due to local operations versus out-county or even interstate operations. It is also
important to consider fleet fueling practices and whether or not there might be difficulties in gaining reasonable
access to alternative fuels. Some technological modifications may not be appropriate for engines used on nonroad
applications if they accelerate engine wear or reduce reliability in the rugged working conditions which are common
to the category. Finally, the economic impact to individual industrial segments as well as on the overall economy
in the FIP areas is a critical component in the regulatory decision. Nonroad engines are very specialized to their
applications, and the costs of re-engineering engines and fuel systems cannot be spread over large numbers of sales
as is the case with on-road vehicles. 

If, after consideration of many factors, a decision were made to require retrofit or engine replacement for NO

X

, it would be necessary to set emission performance standards for the retrofit/replacement and to promulgate the
appropriate test protocols. The fact that there are specialized applications with a very wide range of vehicle duty
cycles and engine types and sizes makes it extremely difficult for EPA to develop appropriate test cycles. EPA would
also need to devise a process for identifying the individual pieces of equipment to which the requirements would apply,
to implement a program in which a fleet operator would certify the efficacy and durability of a retrofit/replacement,
and to establish an enforcement system which assured that the emission reductions which were predicted would actually
occur. 

EPA believes that it has neither the knowledge nor the time which would be necessary to develop an effective retrofit
strategy for on-highway or nonroad heavy duty engines in the FIP areas. For the locomotive category, EPA is proposing
to develop national or state regulations which will address the rebuilds for locomotive engines. These regulations
will contain the test protocols, emission standards and enforcement mechanisms to assure that the reductions occur.
Although it is not proposing a retrofit program for existing trucks in any of the FIP areas, EPA is proposing a fleet
average standard strategy for on-highway heavy duty engines and a growth cap for the nonroad heavy equipment category
as part of a 1999 attainment option for the Sacramento area. The necessary standards, certification protocols, and
enforcement mechanism either already exist or are being developed for other FIP areas. The specific details of these
requirements are discussed elsewhere in this NPRM. 

(c) Adjustments Based on Local Control of VMT Growth. As discussed earlier, the expected growth in vehicle miles of
travel (VMT) by on-highway vehicles in the FIP areas contributes to the stringency and wide applicability of the many
emission reduction measures in the proposed FIP. For practical reasons, EPA is proposing only a limited set of measures
that can be expected to affect VMT growth, specifically the parking cash out requirement and the employee commute
options program in Sacramento. Consequently, there remains considerable opportunity for state and local governments
to do more to influence VMT growth, and EPA urges them to do so. 

EPA invites public comment on what measures in particular could be designed by the state and local agencies which would
be less expensive, less dislocating, and more equitable than the FIP's controls. Those measures which make more expansive
use of market incentive approaches and those which address land use planning are the most likely candidates.

<TEXT>
 





If the state and local agencies are able to identify and 
adopt measures which effectively lower the rate of VMT growth from what is currently projected, then EPA could entertain
the removal of certain FIP measures which impose the most stringent controls. EPA invites public comment on which
of the FIP measures might be a candidate for earlier removal. State and local action now on measures to reduce growth
will also make it easier in the long term to replace the bulk of the FIP with a State Implementation Plan, since there
will be more flexibility for the state to choose an optimum set of measures. 

Although the FIP contains an attainment strategy for the South Coast area, it does not contain the fully adopted regulations
that will ultimately be needed. In fact, attainment there will clearly require at least all the elements proposed
today or their equivalents. EPA does not envision an adjustment process for that area although the flexibility that
lower growth provides would still hold true. Also, because of the limited time before 1999, EPA does not think it would
be possible to revisit VMT growth in the Sacramento area soon enough to affect the strategy for the 1999 attainment
option. 

It is a requirement of the Clean Air Act that every SIP and FIP attain as expeditiously as practicable but no later than
the date specified by statute. In any VMT revisitation and strategy adjustment process, EPA could not and would not
remove reasonably available measures from the FIPs. EPA believes, however, that some of the measures proposed today
and likely to be finalized go beyond the test of reasonable availability. These are candidates for later removal as
described here. 

2. Programs for Onroad Light Duty Vehicles and Engines. a. Overview_Despite requiring vehicles to meet increasingly
rigorous certification standards, California's air quality is among the poorest in the country. High emission levels
have persisted even though emission standards for light-duty vehicle (i.e., passenger cars) (LDV) and light duty
truck (LDT) exhaust hydrocarbon emissions have dropped more than 90 percent since 1970. The continuing high emissions
derive from considerable increases in the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMT), the increased expected life of
vehicles in the temperate California climate and the failure of many in-use vehicles to meet the standards to which
they are certified when new. 

In order to reduce the emissions from onroad light duty mobile sources, EPA has developed two distinct control strategies.
The first strategy, described in detail in section III.D.2.c, is the implementation of a centralized test only enhanced
I/M program. In the second strategy, described in section III.D.2.d, EPA is proposing to complement the California
LEV program with enforceable requirements providing lower in-use emission levels. EPA believes that both of these
strategies are necessary in order to bring all of the California FIP areas into compliance.

b. Air Quality Significance

_Light duty onroad mobile sources (cars, light duty trucks and motorcycles) are significant contributors to the
emissions inventories in all three of the FIP areas. The table below (``1990 Base Year Inventory for Light Duty Vehicles'')
details the level of emissions from onroad light duty mobile sources in each of the FIP inventories for the 1990 base
year. The information contained in this table illustrates the large portion of the FIP inventories that is attributable
to emissions from onroad light duty mobile sources. No control strategy could achieve attainment in the California
FIP areas without affecting these engines which are central to the California economy. 





c. Enhanced Inspection and Maintenance_(1) Introduction. In its studies of in-use vehicle emission performance,
EPA has found that vehicles typically emit at 2-3 times their certification standards in actual use. Factors
such as lack of durability, tampering with emission control equipment, design defects, and poor maintenance all
contribute to making cars and other mobile sources much dirtier in use than they should be. 

EPA has found that an efficiently designed and managed vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program is one of
the most effective and cost effective ways of cleaning the air. I/M programs are able to produce significant emission
reductions after only a single inspection cycle, and the effort the consumer must expend to comply with I/M can be offset
with improved fuel economy and performance. 

(2) Enhanced I/M. I/M programs achieve their objectives by identifying vehicles that have high emissions as a result
of one or more malfunctions and requiring them to be repaired. An ``enhanced'' I/M program covers more of the vehicles
in operation, employs inspection methods which are better at finding high emitting vehicles, and has additional
features to better assure that all vehicles are properly tested and adequately repaired. 
Given the severity of the air quality problem in the FIP areas covered by this proposed action, EPA is proposing to implement
an enhanced I/M program in all FIP areas as one of the most significant and productive of its FIP measures. 
(3) Background. The first mandatory 
I/M programs were required by the 1977 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, which called for I/M programs in areas with long
term air quality problems. The 1990 Amendments to the Act expanded the role of I/M, directing EPA to develop guidelines
and performance standards for two levels of I/M program_basic 
I/M for areas with moderately dirty air, and enhanced I/M for areas (like those addressed by this proposed FIP) with
more serious and chronic nonattainment problems. On November 5, 1992, EPA published a final regulation (40 CFR part
51 subpart S) establishing certain minimum requirements and performance standards for both basic and enhanced I/M
programs. It is this regulation and its supporting documentation that will form the basis for much of what will be proposed
in this action. Readers are encouraged to consult the preamble to the final I/M rule for a more thorough explanation
of the costs and benefits of I/M programs and the specific regulations.






A state-administered I/M program known as Smog Check has been in existence in California since March 1984, and is currently
operating in all three of the FIP areas. The Smog Check program includes a biennial tailpipe and antitampering inspection
of 1966 and newer model passenger cars, as well as light- and heavy-duty trucks. The inspections are conducted in a
decentralized network of private garages and service stations which are licensed by the State and which may perform
both the emissions inspection and emissions-related repairs. The tailpipe test consists of a simple idle test for
VOCs and carbon monoxide (CO) for vehicles up to the 1979 model year and a two-speed idle test for model year 1980 and
newer vehicles. The program also includes antitampering inspections for all significant emission control components.
Owners of subject vehicles must present proof that the vehicle has either been tested and passed or been waived from
the program requirement prior to registering their vehicle(s) in even numbered years for even numbered license plates
and odd numbered years for odd numbered license plates. 
Since the beginning of the program in California, a review committee of State and local air quality professionals
has been conducting a continuing evaluation of the Smog Check network in order to recommend improvements to the Legislature
and to address problems in program operation as they are identified. The ``California I/M Review Committee's Fourth
Report to the Legislature'' details the results of comprehensive station audits and vehicle emission tests and concludes
that the current program is yielding less than one-half the potential emission reduction benefits of the program
if properly implemented due to improper testing and inadequate repair in the garages. 
Based upon its own audits, as well as those conducted by California and other states, EPA has concluded that I/M programs
throughout the country which combine the functions of testing and repair in a single facility are only roughly half
as effective as programs which separate the two functions. The I/M rule which applies to enhanced areas requires the
separation of test and repair unless a State can demonstrate that its current test-and- repair program is equal in
effectiveness to a test-only network. In making this demonstration states will receive only one half the emission
credit for the tailpipe test than that allowed for test-only facilities unless the state can demonstrate higher reductions
from its program.

During the 1993 legislative session, the California 
legislature considered but did not pass legislation which would 
have authorized the upgrade of the Smog Check network. Citing 
concerns over jobs and consumer convenience, state legislators 
advanced a bill designed to improve the State's failing Smog 
Check system without fundamentally changing its test-and-repair 
structure. Although the bill contained some important measures, 
EPA had to inform the legislature that the bill fell short of 
meeting the Clean Air Act's standards for an enhanced 
I/M 
program. EPA officials are continuing to work with the 
California legislative leadership in the hopes of achieving 
consensus on a program design which would meet both the Clean Air 
Act requirements and California's unique needs. EPA is proposing an enhanced 
I/M program design which incorporates the most 
sophisticated testing techniques with features to maximize 
consumer convenience and to mimimize the cost of inspection. If 
the State should develop and adopt an alternative program design 
which meets the Act's performance standard for enhanced I/M 
programs prior to finalization of the FIP, then the alternative 
program will be proposed for approval as a State plan revision 
and its reductions will be substituted for those which would be 
expected from a federally imposed I/M program. EPA would propose 
additional measures if necessary to provide equivalent emission 
reductions as part of the FIP attainment demonstration. Once the 
FIP I/M program is finalized, however, the State will need to 
meet not only the requirements of the I/M rule, but will have to 
produce a plan that fills any shortfall between the State I/M 
program and the FIP I/M program, so as not to jeopardize the 
FIP's required attainment demonstration. This could be done 
through the State I/M program or other emission reductions. 

(4) Summary of Proposed Federal Enhanced I/M Program.  The proposed program would cover all model year 1966 and newer
onroad, gasoline-fueled vehicles_including heavy-duty trucks but excluding motorcycles_and would be conducted
on a biennial basis to optimize the measure's emission reduction 
potential and cost effectiveness, as well as to minimize the disruption created by any transition from the current,
state-run Smog Check program. 

The proposed program would be conducted in a network of 
test-only stations (i.e., stations in which both owners and 
operators are legally barred from profiting either directly or 
indirectly from the sale and servicing of motor vehicles and 
motor vehicle parts). The tests performed would include a 
transient, mass-emissions tailpipe test known as the IM240 which 
would measure hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of 
nitrogen; purge and pressure tests to assure that the evaporative 
control system is working properly; and a visual antitampering 
inspection for the presence and proper connection of the positive 
crankcase ventilation (PCV) and air systems. 

EPA intends to enter into a legal agreement with one or more 
entities for the performance of all possible program activities, 
other than enforcement of the motorist registration requirement, 
and oversight requirements which would constitute a conflict of 
interest. This entity shall hereafter be referred to as the 
``test provider.'' 

The biennnial test is estimated to cost between $20 and $25, 
and the average wait time at the high volume inspection stations 
should average less than ten minutes. 

A more detailed discussion of the FIP's proposed I/M program 
and its various program elements follows: 

(a) Applicability.  The enhanced I/M requirement will apply to all vehicles registered, or required to be registered,
in the counties listed 
in Table IM-1 and to vehicles in commercial fleets which are primarily operated within these same counties.
Vehicles which are operated on Federal installations located within the I/M program area must also comply with the
I/M requirements regardless of their registration status. 






Note: 

The portions of Riverside, San Bernardino, Placer, and El 
Dorado counties to be covered by the FIP I/M program would be the 
same as are currently covered by the State's Smog Check program.




The current Smog Check program covers more than the required 
areas, and therefore carrying this coverage over into the FIP I/M 
program is sufficient to satisfy the Act's enhanced I/M 
requirements. EPA is requesting comment, however, on whether the 
geographic coverage is sufficient to include all significant 
contributors to FIP area emissions and whether there is any 
reason that it should be expanded beyond the scope of the 
existing I/M areas. 

(b) Enforcement. Under this proposal, the Secretary of State of California, the California Department of Motor Vehicles,
its employees, any 
any other persons representing the State of California are 
prohibited from registering any subject vehicle which does not 
present a valid certificate of compliance with or a valid waiver 
from the FIP's I/M program requirements. At Federal 
installations, where vehicles may not have California 
registration, the vehicles may not be issued a base sticker or 
other operating permit without evidence of compliance with 
enhanced I/M program requirements. EPA or the test provider(s) 
will issue these certificates.

(c) Network Type. Two basic types of inspection networks have existed since the start of I/M programs_centralized,
test-only networks and 
decentralized, test-and-repair networks. A centralized, test-
only network consists of inspection and retest at high-volume, 
multi-lane, usually highly automated stations, run by either a 
government agency or a single, state-hired contractor within a 
defined area. A decentralized, test-and-repair network consists 
of inspection and retest of vehicles at privately owned, licensed 
facilities, such as gas stations and other shops which may also 
do repair work. California's current I/M program is of this 
latter variety. 

While the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 called for EPA to 
develop performance standards for both basic and enhanced I/M 
programs, they also established minimum requirements for certain 
program parameters. In the case of enhanced I/M programs, 
network type was one of these prescribed parameters. 
Specifically, section 182(c)(3)(C) of the Act states that 
enhanced programs must include, at a minimum, ``operation of the 
program on a centralized basis, unless the State demonstrates to 
the satisfaction of the Administrator that a decentralized 
program will be equally effective.'' Based upon its evaluation of 
current decentralized, test-and-repair programs, as well as upon 
data gathered by individual states on their own I/M programs' 
effectiveness, EPA provided for the approval of a decentralized 
test-only network as an equally effective alternative, because 
the inherent conflict of interest found in test-and-repair 
programs had been removed. It may be that the State of 
California will ultimately choose to design a decentralized 
test-only system in order to guarantee that there are many 
independent businesses which participate in providing inspection 
services. But it is not a practical choice for a federally 
implemented I/M program. Given the significantly lower 
implementation burden of a centralized system, EPA has determined 
that it is appropriate to propose a centralized program for the 
FIP. 

Although EPA has the authority to forbid the State of 
California to register vehicles which do not have a certificate 
of compliance with the prescribed enhanced I/M program, it does 
not have the authority to order the State to write the program 
rules, oversee the construction or licensing of test-only 
stations or carry out any of the tasks involved in program 
implementation and oversight. Therefore, it is necessary for EPA 
to design a program which will divert as few as possible 
resources from the national environmental effort to the day to 
day operation of what would ordinarily be a state-run emission 
control program.

EPA is proposing that the California FIP I/M program would be a centralized, test-only network operated by a private
entity or entities (if each FIP area is to be treated separately) that have entered into a legal agreement with the federal
government. This entity or entities will be known generically as the test provider(s). Program oversight would be
facilitated through the award of a contract to provide for the collection of data in the form of overt and covert auditing
of the testing contractor's sites and performance. The test provider(s) would be reimbursed through the collection
of a fee paid directly to the test provider(s) by motorists at the time of testing. Once EPA has entered into an agreement
with the test provider(s), it will be the State's obligation to enter into its own agreement with the test provider(s)
when the State wants to replace the FIP program with its own. EPA does not intend to place itself in the position of assuming
any legal penalty through termination of a contract with a test provider as a result of California starting its own
program; comments are requested on how this result may be achieved. 
The test provider(s) would perform many program activities, with the exception of enforcement of the registration
requirement (which shall remain a State responsibility) and any oversight requirements which would constitute
a conflict of interest, such as covert and overt auditing of the test sites and testing personnel. In addition to establishing
the test sites and conducting the testing, therefore, the testing provider would provide for both mechanic and inspector
training, tracking and reporting of effectiveness data, performing other program data collection and reporting
requirements, conducting a campaign of public information, establishing and maintaining a repair technician hotline,
performing motorist compliance surveys, designing and issuing program documentation such as certificates of compliance
and waivers, and designing and managing a program of onroad vehicle testing via remote sensing technology. Separately,
EPA would award a contract to a different entity or entities to collect the information needed to oversee the performance
of the test provider(s) and to evaluate the effectiveness of the I/M program. Duties under this oversight contract
would include purchasing vehicle records or otherwise entering into a cooperative agreement with the California
Department of Motor Vehicles to facilitate testing and database comparisons for program effectiveness and enforcement
analyses, procuring vehicles for covert testing, conducting covert station audits, and performing periodic overt
audits to confirm that the testing equipment is accurate within the quality specifications. 
Under the legal agreement EPA envisions entering into with the test provider(s), no funds would accrue to EPA, because
that is prohibited by the Miscellaneous Receipts Act, which only allows each Federal agency to retain those funds
which have been specifically appropriated for its use by the Congress. Awarding of the oversight contract and program
administration duties would, therefore, require EPA to divert funds and human resources from other activities to
perform the role currently performed in California by the Bureau of Automotive Repair. 
EPA requests comment on its proposal to establish a centralized, test-only network and to enter into a legal agreement
with one or more test providers as well as awarding a separate contract for data collection in support of program oversight.
EPA also requests comment on whether the Agency should enter into separate agreements and award separate contracts
for each FIP area, or if a single agreement and a single oversight contract for all FIP areas are appropriate. 
(d) Test Type and Procedure. The California Smog Check program currently employs a steady-state, unloaded, tailpipe
test, which is conducted with the vehicle parked and idling. The test is called ``steady-state'' because the vehicle
is operated in only one or two operating modes (typically at idle, or at both idle and 2500 rpm, depending upon the model
year of the vehicle); it is considered ``unloaded'' because the vehicle is parked and therefore encounters no additional
power demands to overcome road resistance. Emissions are measured by placing a probe in the tailpipe to gather a sample
which is analyzed to determine the relative concentrations (i.e., percentage or parts per million) of CO, carbon
dioxide, and hydrocarbons in the exhaust (the analyzer-test type combination used in the Smog Check program is currently
unable to measure NO

X

 emissions). Given that the volume of exhaust from any vehicle is unknown, the concentration of pollutants measured
during a Smog Check cannot indicate the emission level of the vehicle in terms of grams of pollutant emitted per mile
driven_or from the fleet all together in terms of tons of pollutant emitted per day. 
Studies conducted by EPA's Office of Mobile Sources, at the National Vehicle and Fuels Emission Laboratory and elsewhere
have shown that steady-state, idle, concentration-based tests such as those used in California's Smog Check program
are not highly effective at identifying and reducing in-use emissions from the types of vehicles which currently
dominate the fleet (and will continue to dominate the fleet in the future). (See the I/M rule's technical support document,
entitled ``I/M Costs, Benefits, and Impacts,'' November 1992, for more details on these studies and their results.)
Steady-state idle tests were originally designed to detect excess emissions from relatively low- technology, pre-1981,
carbureted, non-computerized passenger cars and worked well enough for these vehicles because the typical emission
control problems they experienced tended to involve ``rich'' air/fuel mixtures which are detectable at idle as well
as other driving modes. To meet increasingly stringent emission standards, however, current high-technology cars
must use an elaborate array of sensors and computer feedback controls to continuously adjust engine operations,
optimizing the air/fuel mixture depending upon the current driving mode. Such vehicles are more effectively tested
with procedures that address the full range of driving modes, including cruise, idle, acceleration, and deceleration
cycles under loaded conditions.

Emission tests which include driving cycles are called ``transient tests,'' and are performed by running a vehicle
on a treadmill device known as a dynamometer which allows the vehicle to be driven in place and which can be made to simulate
road load conditions by increasing the resistance on the treadmill rollers. Transient tests capture a known volume
of exhaust and produce actual grams-per-mile results as opposed to the relative concentration values generated
by steady-state, idle tests. Transient, mass emission testing also measures fuel economy, and the results can be
provided to the vehicle owner. A transient test known as the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) has been used for certification
testing of new vehicles for over twenty years and is considered the yardstick by which other testing strategies are
measured. 
A full Federal Test Procedure involves special vehicle preparation and takes several hours to conduct, making it
impractical as an I/M test type. But EPA has developed a shortened version of the FTP known as the IM240, which more closely
reflects how vehicles perform under actual driving conditions than do current idle inspections, while also being
short enough to be practical in an I/M setting (the ``240'' stands for the maximum number of seconds it takes to perform
an IM240 test). In its development and evaluation of the IM240, EPA has found the test to be superior to alternative
I/M testing strategies for all relevant evaluation criteria, including accuracy and overall cost effectiveness.
Using the pass/fail limits proposed in this action, the IM240 has been shown to have a zero percent false fail rate,
while also accurately identifying the vast majority of the highest emitting vehicles. The result is that the IM240
is able to get more emission reductions by failing fewer cars than is the case for other I/M tests yielding comparable
emission reductions. Furthermore, since the equipment required to perform the IM240 is based upon that used to perform
certification testing, IM240 test sites will not become obsolete with future changes in vehicle technology; driving
cycles and testing algorithms may require changes in software, but the hardware configuration will remain substantially
similar well into the next century. Transient testing is also the only currently known reliable way to test for NO

X

 emissions_
something not possible with an idle-based test, yet nevertheless required in order to achieve the NO

X

 reductions necessary for ozone attainment, and specifically required by section 182(c)(3) of the Clean Air Act.

The enhanced I/M program being proposed in this action also includes two functional tests to detect excessive evaporative
emissions. Over the last several years, EPA has learned that vapors which escape from various points in a vehicle's
fuel system represent a huge source of hydrocarbon emissions, generally greater than those present in now highly
controlled tailpipe exhaust. In response to this finding, EPA has developed two functional tests which can determine
whether vehicle evaporative emission control systems are operating properly. The first test is a simple pressure
check to find leaks in the fuel system (e.g., bad gas caps or cracked evaporative system hoses). The test, referred
to as the ``pressure test,'' is simple to perform and highly cost effective. The second test_called the ``purge test''_is
a check of the evaporative system's purge function, which involves removing gasoline vapors stored in the charcoal
canister and routing them to the engine where they can be burned as fuel. The purge test is performed in conjunction
with the IM240 (i.e., while the vehicle is operating on the dynamometer). Performance of the purge test is not possible
using a traditional idle inspection, since most automobiles are not designed to purge extra vapors when they are not
needed during the idle mode. 
EPA is proposing to use the IM240, and purge and pressure testing, as the main group of high-technology emissions tests
around which the FIP's I/M program would be built. The FIP's I/M program would also retain the current Smog Check program's
visual antitampering inspections for the air pump and PCV system, but would eliminate the catalyst, inlet, and evaporative
canister inspections. The evaporative canister inspection would be eliminated because it would be redundant in
the face of the more rigorous purge and pressure tests. The catalyst and inlet checks would be eliminated because the
IM240 is sufficiently sensitive to detect the fact that a catalyst has either been removed or poisoned through the
use of leaded fuel. The air pump check, on the other hand, would be retained because this emission control device only
operates during cold start conditions and its malfunction affects emissions only in this driving mode. Since vehicles
will generally be warmed up by the time they arrive for their I/M inspection, this type of malfunction is difficult
to detect without a visual inspection. The PCV inspection would be retained because malfunction of this device can
produce emission leaks that are not detectable through the tailpipe. Lastly, the FIP's I/M inspection would also
include a test portion involving connection to and the interrogation of the onboard diagnostic (OBD) computer on
vehicles so equipped beginning with the 1994 model year. Information in the form of trouble codes would be downloaded
from the OBD computer and analyzed for the presence of emissions-related system malfunctions. 
All of the proposed FIP I/M program's inspections would be conducted in compliance with the test procedure guidance
developed and issued by EPA in conjunction with the I/M rule. The IM240 standards will be set at the following gram-per-mile
cutpoints for HC, CO, and NO

X

, respectively, for Tier 0 vehicles (with somewhat more stringent first and second test cycle standards for Tier 1,
TLEV, LEV, and ULEV vehicles in the pre-1999 model year group): 
First test cycle: 1.2 / 20 / 3 
Second test cycle: 0.8 / 15 / 2 
Third test cycle: 0.6 / 10 / 1.5 
The third test cycle cutpoints represent the final IM240 cutpoints for 1983-1998 model year vehicles and would
be used for all subsequent test cycles. Model year 1999 and newer vehicles are addressed as part of the discussion of
the enhanced in-use compliance program in section III.D.2.d of this preamble; I/M cutpoints for these vehicles are
contained in Appendix 1, section A(4). EPA is also in the process of developing test procedures for performing the
OBD check portion of an I/M inspection and will propose these as amendments to the I/M rule later in 1994.

(e) Vehicle Coverage and Test Frequency. The proposed FIP I/M program would cover all model year 1966 to 1998 gasoline-fueled
vehicles, excluding motorcycles but including heavy-duty vehicles to 19,500 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight Rating
(GVWR), including vehicles with engine-based certification. The proposed FIP I/M program would also cover all model
year 1999 and newer vehicles of all fuel types, excluding motorcycles, but including heavy-duty vehicles to 14,000
pounds GVWR (except for 8,500 to 14,000 pound vehicles with engine-based certification). The IM240 tailpipe emission
test would be performed on all vehicles including the heavier trucks for administrative simplicity. Model-year
based cutpoints for pre-1983 light-duty vehicles are included in this proposed rule, as are cutpoints for heavy-duty
trucks, although these latter cutpoints are subject to possible amendment prior to program implementation, based
upon the experience of state-adopted enhanced I/M programs that begin operation prior to the scheduled implementation
date for the proposed FIP I/M program. The purge, pressure, and visual inspections would be performed on all model
year 1971 and newer vehicles. Older model years were not equipped with the evaporative control systems subject to
the purge and pressure tests. EPA will also study the sales and in-use performance of pre-1999 diesel and alternatively
fueled vehicles, to determine if significant, additional emission reductions can be achieved by testing such vehicles
as part of the FIP I/M program. 

EPA proposes to require I/M testing biennially in the California FIP areas, with new vehicles being exempt until the
second anniversary of the initial registration date. Notification of scheduled testing times would be through regular
mass mailings conducted by the test provider(s), with individual motorists receiving notification no less than
45 days prior to the individual's testing deadline. The test provider(s) would use mailing lists obtained from the
Department of Motor Vehicles to conduct the test notification mailing. 

EPA has chosen to retain biennial testing for the California FIP's I/M program due partly from an interest to minimize
the disruptive impact of the new program, but mainly because biennial testing is simply more cost effective, especially
when conducted within the context of a high-technology I/M program such as the one proposed. Simply put, the IM240,
purge, and pressure tests are so effective that a biennial test program will yield almost the same emission reduction
benefits as an annual program. In its research on the relative benefits of test accuracy versus test frequency, EPA
has found that doing the test right is far more important than doing it more often. Furthermore, the types of repairs
needed to pass these high-technology tests are substantive and durable_something which is not always the case with
repairs aimed at passing an idle-based I/M program. 

(f) Waivers and Special Warranty Protection. The FIP I/M program would include the opportunity for owners of failing
vehicles to apply for a cost waiver once they have spent at least $450, adjusted annually for inflation, in relevant
emission control repairs. The $450 figure is required by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 for state-adopted, enhanced
I/M programs. While EPA is not required to include such a waiver limit in this FIP, EPA is proposing this waiver limit
because it is practical, ensures repair of virtually all failures, and will simplify the transition once California
adopts its own program. The $450 figure will be adjusted annually, based upon the difference between the Consumer
Price Index for the current year and that of a 1990 base year, and would not include costs related to the repair of tampering-related
defects or emission control components the servicing of which are covered by an unexpired warranty. The test provider(s)
would be responsible for issuing such waivers and for conducting a visual inspection to confirm that all claimed repairs
have, in fact, been made. Motorists on public assistance would be able to apply for a one-time, non- renewable time
extension on making repairs, not to exceed one full test cycle. Only one such time extension will be granted per the
lifetime of a vehicle. 

The California Motor Vehicle Control Program provides for warranties similar to those included under Federal law.
These warranties would be available to owners of failed vehicles up to the specified age and mileage limitations which
vary depending on the model year of the vehicle. Special warranty protection would be available to owners of vehicles
certified under the proposed enhanced in-use compliance program for model year 1999 and newer vehicles (see Section
III.D.2.d). 

(g) Enforcement and Oversight. Under the FIP I/M program, it would be a violation of Federal law for the California
Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), its employees, or any other representative of the State of California to register
any vehicle subject to the FIP's I/M requirement for which a valid certificate of compliance or waiver (either paper-based
or electronic) has not been presented. DMV employees or other State representatives suspected of violating the FIP
I/M requirement would be subject to prosecution under Federal law and, if found guilty, could be subject to civil penalties
up to $25,000 per violation. Each instance of unlawful registration would be considered a separate offense. 

Motorists who were late for either regularly scheduled tests or who failed to comply with an out-of-cycle test required
because the vehicle was identified by a remote sensing unit (see below), would be assessed a late fee at the rate of $10
per week late. EPA requests comments on other means of enforcing program requirements, including the possibility
of tying penalty fees to the length of violation multiplied by the level of excess emissions. 

(h) Convenience Issues. EPA would make customer convenience an important criteria in entering into any legal agreement
with a test provider(s). Minimum convenience requirements would be established and addressed. For example, EPA
intends to require in any such agreement that test stations be sited such that 80 percent of all subject motorists are
within a 5 mile radius of a test station, with 95 percent of all motorists within a 10 mile radius. Wait times between
entering a test station queue and the initiation of actual testing would be tracked and would not be allowed to exceed
15 minutes on average. Scheduling individual vehicles for tests would be required to be done on a weekly basis, as opposed
to monthly, to help reduce the impact of the end-of-the-month rush. To avoid being assessed a late penalty, motorists
would have to report for testing sometime during the scheduled testing week, with the week beginning on Sunday and
ending on Saturday. The test provider(s) would be allowed to use late fees paid by motorists who do not show up during
the specified test week to either create an incentive program to stimulate off-peak test lane usage or to expand capacity.
The test provider(s) would also be required to offer ``valet testing'' for a reasonable fee. Such an option would allow
motorists to have their vehicles picked up for testing from their homes, work places, etc., and returned.

(i) Onroad Testing. Although not expressly required to do so as part of its FIP effort, EPA proposes to use remote sensing
devices (RSD) as a supplement to the proposed FIP I/M program, because EPA believes RSD to be a useful way of identifying
gross emitters for possible out-of-cycle repairs. The actual onroad testing would be performed by the test provider
and would cover a larger percentage of the fleet than the minimum required of state-adopted enhanced I/M programs
under the I/M rule (i.e., approximately 10 percent). Owners of vehicles which fail the RSD check would be notified
of the failure by registered mail, and would be required to report for an out-of-cycle confirmatory test at a test-only
test site. Should the vehicle fail this confirmatory test, the owner would be responsible for the procurement of necessary
repairs and would be required to submit the vehicle for retesting. The owner would have an opportunity to apply for
a waiver, but only after meeting all the same criteria that would apply during the regular testing cycle. Vehicle owners
who did not respond to the NPRM of RSD failure would be assessed a late penalty at the time of their next scheduled test.
The late penalty would be the same as that charged for missing a regularly scheduled test (i.e., $10 per week late).

(j) Program Start Date. The FIP I/M program would initiate testing 100 percent of the subject vehicle population beginning
in January 1997.



d. Enhanced In-Use Compliance Program for Light-Duty Vehicles

_EPA expects the California Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) program will substantially reduce emissions of cars and light-duty
trucks, compared to the federal standards. However, despite the use of advanced technologies and the OBD requirements,
CARB projects LEVS will exceed their certification standards in-use, although, for the reasons noted in Section
III.D.1.a(2), by a much smaller margin than has occurred in the past. Emissions above the certification standards,
referred to as excess emissions, will occur because some models may experience more in-use deterioration than expected,
or because individual vehicles experience component failure or improper maintenance which is not immediately corrected
by the various existing in-use compliance programs, including enhanced I/M. Because the magnitude of the emission
reductions needed for attainment is so great, the adoption of further measures to reduce these remaining excess in-use
emissions will help reach attainment of the ozone standard.

EPA is therefore seeking comments on the need for and benefits of adopting an enhanced in-use compliance program which
would provide extra emission reductions above and beyond the substantial reduction provided by the California LEV
program, and cause in-use emissions to approach the certification standards. Specifically, EPA is considering
three approaches. The first would modify the current federal recall program to initiate recalls based on the emission
results of vehicles tested in their as received condition. This differs from current practice, and would result in
a shift of responsibility for maintaining low emissions from the consumer to the vehicle manufacturers.

The second possible program would make manufacturers responsible for repairs for vehicles whose failure rate for
that model in an enhanced I/M program exceeds a threshold level (e.g., greater than 5 percent within the first 5 years).
This approach, like the first approach, provides an incentive for vehicle manufacturers to increase the durability
of their designs, or implement other programs designed to maintain the emissions of their products in-use. Both of
these possible programs would apply throughout a vehicle's statutory useful life.

The third possible program involves adoption of a requirement that the on-board diagnostic system of new vehicles
be capable of communicating, to on-road sensors, the operational status of the emission control system (i.e., whether
a fault has been detected). This approach allows for the immediate identification of high emitting vehicles, and
their timely repair. Unlike the first two approaches, this approach would remain in effect for the vehicles's entire
life, a significant point since over 40 percent of cars and light trucks on California's highways have over 100,000
miles on their odometer.

EPA requests comments on these three approaches, and on any other approaches to further reduce in-use emissions.
Comments should address the need for and viability of EPA implementing, within the context of the FIP, compliance
programs in addition to those already adopted by California. EPA is proposing to adopt the enhanced in-use compliance
program described in Appendix I A.



e. On-highway Motorcycles

_Provisions for on-highway motorcycles are contained in section III.D.4.c(1). Because engines used in nonroad
recreational vehicles such as all terrain vehicles and dirt bikes are similar to those used in on-highway motorcycles,
all control strategies for these engines are contained in the section referenced in the preceding sentence.



f. Discussion of Emission Registration and Fee Systems for Light Duty Vehicles

_In the light duty vehicle and light duty truck sector, emission reductions can result from direct regulation of the
vehicle and fuels or can be brought about by regulations or incentives (either positive or negative) to change vehicle
ownership patterns and/or driver behavior. Emission standards for light duty vehicles and their fuel have significantly
decreased the amount of pollution emitted by any one vehicle over a given mile. Standards continue to tighten and within
the FIP EPA is proposing to reduce tailpipe and evaporative emissions even further.

Additional reductions could come from incentives to increase the number newer vehicles on the road and reduce the
number of older vehicles. Accelerating fleet turnover through any means would reduce on road emissions by replacing
older vehicles (which have older emissions technology) with newer, cleaner vehicles.

Increasing the number of newer vehicles purchased could be achieved either by offering incentives, such as rebates
or reductions in registration fees, and/or with disincentives for owning older vehicles, i.e. higher registration
fees based on age or on emissions.

Despite the impressive reductions in tailpipe emissions, on highway motor vehicle emissions remain a source of concern.
Increases in the number of vehicles on the road and the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMT), threaten to outpace
gains from technology. For the three FIP areas EPA utilizes the VMT growth projections provided by the local MPO or
air quality management district. Growth in VMT can have significant impact on a given nonattainment area's ability
to show attainment.

In most, if not all, nonattainment areas changing driver behavior has been addressed primarily (if at all) through
implementation of transportation control measures (TCMs). The TCMs found in SIPs have generally, in the past, been
voluntary in nature and often have consisted of efforts to make transit more available through increased bus routes,
light and heavy rail expansions and the building of park and ride lots. While these steps are laudable they do little
to change the current equation faced by a user of our transportation system. Because our road and highway system is
financed in large part by general revenues (40 percent), and because drivers do not pay for the congestion and pollution
they cause, the use of our roadways appears to users to carry a relatively low cost. In addition, single-occupant vehicles
have considerable advantage in terms of convenience and privacy. Thus, any attempt to promote the use of alternatives
to single-occupancy vehicles faces quite a challenge.

The limited effectiveness of traditional TCMs has led many in Federal, State and local government and in academia
to promote instead the use of market-based TCMs. (See Cameron, Shoup for DOT, EPA/DOT Report to Congress, forthcoming
NARC report by Apogee). Congestion pricing, parking reform, and VMT and emission fees all show great promise as effective
means of changing driver behavior by making travel choices reflect more closely their true social costs.

EPA seriously considered making market-based TCMs an integral part of the FIP, however, within the context of the
FIP, neither traditional TCMs nor market-based TCMs lend themselves easily to Federal implementation. The very
nature of many traditional TCMs limits their usefulness within the context of the FIP. FIP authority does not allow
the Agency to take on fundamentally local roles such as building new transit lines, expanding bus services, or building
HOV lanes. If EPA were to impose emission fees or VMT fees or to institute congestion pricing, all revenue generated
would have to go to the Federal Treasury (see the above discussion of the Miscellaneous Receipts Act in section III.A.2.b).
Such a flow of revenue out of the FIP areas could have numerous adverse impacts.

In addition, the issue of fees, especially VMT fees, raises other inherently local issues such as land use planning.
There are many theories and explanations for the rapid and continual growth in VMT over the last few decades_increases
in women in the work force, population growth, increases in average income_but suburban sprawl also plays a significant
role. For a variety of reasons, crime, housing costs, land costs, etc. the bulk of growth in metropolitan areas has
been occurring in the suburbs. The lower housing densities and lack of mixed use zoning in most suburbs have made use
of a car a daily necessity. Just as these patterns of land use occurred over a long period of time in response to local
demands, so must future changes.

Despite the EPA assessment that control of VMT growth and the use of market-based TCMs are most appropriately considered
at the local level, EPA would like to present an outline of a reasonable and, at the state or local level, an arguably
workable light duty vehicle fee system, based on both emissions and vehicle miles traveled. EPA invites comment on
federal implementation of this approach or any other appropriate market-based measures. If changes in technical
estimates or in the stringency of other controls are made following public comment, EPA may have to turn to a fee system
as described below despite the reservations voiced above. In such a case, EPA would obtain more public input on program
specifics before implementation, including if appropriate, reproposal and public comment.

A fee on the product of emissions level and VMT would provide incentives for individuals to reduce emissions but also
would provide them with some flexibility to achieve those reductions. A driver could choose to reduce her fee by buying
a cleaner vehicle, or she could reduce her fee burden by driving fewer miles. Most likely, individuals would consider
the trade-offs they face and choose a course of action most appropriate for their circumstances. In thinking about
this fee system, EPA has attempted to remain sensitive to many issues surrounding fees and the incentives they provide.
EPA used as a guide California Senate Bill 1070, and many of the principles it provides. As in Bill 1070, EPA believes
a fee collected at biennial inspection and maintenance points which is a function of VMT in excess of an annual per driver
allotment of 5,000 miles and of the vehicle's I/M score recorded after any necessary repairs have taken place would
be most workable.

EPA recognizes that the automobile represents for many people in the FIP area the only means of getting to work. Therefore,
EPA suggests each licensed driver over the age of 18 could be allocated 5,000 ``free'' miles annually. Drivers in one
household could combine their allowances however they choose, and use them to cover some of the VMT from the household's
vehicles. EPA suggests this lifeline level based on data in the 1990 National Personal Travel Survey (NPTS) conducted
by DOT. According to the 1990 NPTS, on average 32 percent of VMT and 26 percent of trips are directly the result of commuting.
The average new car mileage (older model years are driven fewer miles in each successive year) is 15,000 miles. Thus
5,000 represents, on average, the upper end of commuting miles for a given driver. However, EPA invites comment on
this issue.

Obviously the emission component of the fee provides an incentive for the vehicle owner to reduce vehicle emissions.
How an individual chooses to do so is somewhat dependent on the way in which the fee is set. If the fee is charged based
on how much the vehicle's emissions exceed the average emissions from other vehicles from the same model year, then
the owner of the vehicle is interested in keeping the vehicle in good working order to ensure average or better emissions
for a car of that model year. A fee set in this way does not penalize an owner for having an old car (and therefore old emissions
technology) per se, but for having an old car dirtier than other cars of its age. The fee then does little to encourage
the owner to replace the vehicle with one offering newer and therefore cleaner technology.

If, on the other hand, the fee is set based on actual emissions, owners still have an incentive to keep each car as clean
as possible, but they face an added incentive to invest in cleaner technology. An added bonus for California of this
type of emission fee is that it would address the question of vehicles not meeting California emissions standards
which are brought into California by new residents (``49 state vehicles''). Any additional emissions resulting
from a 49 state vehicle would be appropriately charged a fee, eliminating the need for a separate program to address
those emissions.

However, such an incentive structure raises obvious questions regarding equity. Many, although not all, older cars
are often perceived to be utilized by citizens with lower incomes. Thus, one could argue straight emission-based
fees are regressive. However, on average, older vehicles are driven fewer than 5,000 miles annually for reliability
reasons. A fee formula structure which forgives the first 5,000 miles of VMT and emissions, such as the system outlined
here, allows low income car owners continued free use of their vehicles for daily necessities.
If EPA or the FIP areas were to adopt a VMT/emission fee system other details would need to be addressed. For example,
EPA would suggest using actual VMT for each vehicle as determined by odometer checks at the time of the biennial I/M
inspection. To discourage odometer tampering, EPA would propose to include in all registration material home and
work addresses for all household members so that the distance from home to work could be estimated. EPA would also propose
some type of system to ``stop the clock'' on VMT additions when the vehicle is being used out of state as during a vacation.
(Granting fee exemptions for all VMT outside the FIP area appears to be too complex and/or cumbersome). EPA invites
comment on this and other odometer tampering issues.
For the emission portion of the fee calculation, EPA would suggest using the actual IM240 scores without regard to
model year and with no adjustments for evaporative or cold start emissions. Since all three FIP areas need substantial
reductions in both VOC and NO

X

 emissions, EPA suggests that the emission readings for the two pollutants be given equal weight in calculating the
VMT/emissions fee. As with other fee programs described in this document, the fee could be charged at the rate of $10,000/ton
of emissions, based on the emissions generated by an individual car.
Again, EPA is not proposing a VMT/emission fee within the FIP. EPA believes such a fee system is most appropriately
implemented at the local level and invites comment on the suggested program outlined here.


g. Parking Cash Out_

Even in downtown areas, most employees in California receive free or subsidized parking spaces. Current tax codes
allow employers to offer this benefit without the employer or the employee having to pay taxes on the value of the space.
Since parking costs represent the bulk of the daily cost of driving to work, these ``free'' spaces are a strong incentive
for employees to drive to work alone. For example, in downtown Los Angeles the average employer-paid subsidy for employee
parking is 43 percent more than the cost per average commute trip for gasoline.
As part of his Climate Change Action Plan, President Clinton has called for transforming the existing tax subsidy
for employer-paid parking into a powerful reward for commuters to ride transit, carpool, or find other ways to get
to work. The Administration will shortly propose changes in the tax law necessary to bring about parking subsidy reform.
This same proposal is included in the FIP, in a form which is consistent with EPA's authority. The proposal does not
modify the tax code or require payments by any employer. Rather, it applies certain restrictions.
Certain employers may not offer free parking unless they offer employees the option of retaining the parking space
or accepting a cash allowance equal to the market cost of the parking space. The cash allowance will be considered taxable
income, but under current tax law, up to $60 per month of the cash may be taken in the form of a transit pass, which would
be tax-exempt. Those who opt for the parking space will be unaffected by the change. Whether the employee decides to
take the free parking or the cash allowance, the company can still deduct the cost from corporate income tax.
The cash out provision would be applicable to employer-paid parking provided by firms of 25 or more employees, located
in an access-controlled parking lot not owned by the employer. Those spaces or lots leased by employers from a third
party before March 14, 1994 are included only if the lease explicitly includes the value of the parking per space and
the lease allows the employer to reduce the number of parking spaces leased without monetary penalty. The provisions
will apply to all spaces leased on or after March 14, 1994, regardless of the form of the lease. Employers who execute
leases on or after this date should make sure the per space value and the right to reduce the number of leased spaces are
included in the lease. Absence of either will not be grounds for exemptions. Absence of a per space value will mean that
the employer may not offer free parking.
At this time EPA lacks information on the number of employers and employees who would be affected by this program or
the average value of leased parking spaces in each of the three nonattainment areas, making it difficult to estimate
the exact impact of a cash out program. Analysis by Dr. Donald Shoup of UCLA suggests that if offered in downtown Los
Angeles, one form of parking cash out would reduce employee solo driving by 20 percent, and would eliminate 9,000 vehicle
trips per day. (See: Cashing Out Employer-Paid Parking, U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Transit Administration,
Final Report FTA-CA-11-0035-92-1, December 1992.)

<DOCNO> FR940505-1-00120 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


Dr. Shoup's analysis of Los Angeles predicted these impacts in a location where parking costs approximately $5.00
per day. Once EPA has more specific information on the three nonattainment areas, EPA proposes to assume for emission
reduction crediting purposes a linear relationship between the value of parking in a given area and the employee response
to a cash out program, based on Dr. Shoup's work. EPA invites comment on this assumption. EPA also asks for information
on the employer composition and parking lease practices in the three non-attainment areas.
It should be noted that for this proposal EPA has assigned credit to the ECO program in the Sacramento FIP area assuming
a 20-percent reduction in affected employers' employees who drive alone to work. The universe of employers who are
subject to ECO and to the cash out provisions do overlap and in the final FIP rule EPA will ensure that emission reductions
taken for the two programs do not include any double counting.
EPA recognizes that this provision is similar to the cash out legislation recently enacted in California. Since the
Administration will soon offer legislative language to enact parking cash out nationally EPA is proposing a cash
out program in keeping with the federal proposal. The most obvious difference between the two proposals is in the definition
of affected employers. California's legislation applies to employers with 50 or greater employees, while the Climate
Change Action Plan calls for parking cash out for employers with 25 or more employees. The EPA proposal simply makes
mandatory an option many employers have had as a way of achieving the South Coast and Ventura goals. As with the President's
plan, this proposal requires cash out in such a way to ensure that no employer will have a net loss.


h. Importation of Vehicles Into California_

Little data are available on the population and characterization of 49-state vehicles in California and nationwide.
However, it is estimated that out-of-state passenger vehicles (49-state vehicles) currently make up about 10 percent
of the VMT in California. As a result of the California's LEV program and the proposed enhanced in-use compliance program,
the difference in the emissions level between California certified vehicles and federally certified 49-state vehicles
is expected to increase, and 49-state vehicles will therefore have increasing negative impact on air quality. Moreover,
if California and 49-state vehicles further diverge in design there may be an increased incentive for California
residents to purchase vehicles designed to meet only 49-state standards. Currently, 49-state vehicles with less
than 7500 miles of operation (classified as new) may not be brought into California, but older vehicles can be upon
payment of a California DMV fee, which is not prohibitive in comparison to many vehicle's market value.
Today's FIP therefore proposes to impose a restriction, starting in 1999, on California residents importing 49-state
vehicles. Specifically, EPA proposes to prohibit (with an exception noted below) the State of California from allowing
California residents to register for the first time in California any vehicle that was previously registered in another
state, unless that vehicle was originally certified to the vehicle requirements set forth in this proposal for its
class. In addition, EPA proposes to prohibit California residents from owning and keeping a car in California that
is currently registered in another state.
As an exception to this prohibition, EPA proposes that the State of California may allow recent immigrants to California
(defined as residents of California for less than three months) to register a car, over 7500 miles, that they had previously
registered for at least three months in another state while a resident of that state. EPA's attainment demonstrations
are based on migration patterns for out-of-state vehicles that match the restrictions described above. EPA solicits
comments on these rules and restrictions.
EPA is also inclined to provide exemptions for historic and collector vehicles, and requests comment on methods for
providing these exemptions.


3. Programs for Onroad Heavy Duty Vehicles and Engines




a. Overview_

Heavy-duty mobile sources (trucks and HDVs) are large contributors, especially for NO

X

, to the emissions inventories in the three FIP areas. Existing standards for heavy-duty engines in California are,
for the most part, the same as the Federal standards. Further control of these engines is necessary to meet the attainment
targets. For these reasons, EPA will propose an enhanced in-use compliance program for heavy-duty vehicles, similar
to the one proposed for light duty vehicles, which includes not only tighter standards but also selected controls
on higher emitting interstate trucks.
Larger heavy-duty engines see substantially heavier use than smaller engines. These engines are built to very high
durability standards and are designed to be cost effectively rebuilt one or more times within their total lifetime.
To provide assurance of emissions control over this extended actual life, this proposal includes certification
and liability requirements for rebuilt engines as well.

b. Air Quality Significance_

  Heavy-duty highway mobile sources are significant contributors to the emissions inventories in all three of the
FIP areas. The table below (``1990 Base Year Inventory of Heavy Duty Vehicles'') details the level of emissions from
onroad heavy-duty mobile sources in each of the FIP inventories for the 1990 base year. The information contained
in this table illustrates the large portion of the FIP inventories that is attributable to emissions from onroad heavy-duty
mobile sources. 








c. Enhanced In-Use Compliance Program for Heavy-duty Vehicles_

EPA is proposing an enhanced in-use compliance program for onhighway heavy-duty engines. The heavy-duty vehicle
program described in Appendix I Section B is based in large part on the enhanced light-duty vehicle program, described
in Appendix I Section A. However, certain changes and additions were made in order to deal with the differences between
heavy- and light-duty vehicles. The reader is advised to read the discussion of the enhanced in-use compliance light-duty
vehicle program as the information will facilitate understanding the heavy-duty program. 

The enhanced program for heavy-duty vehicles consists of several parts: More stringent emission standards, new
full useful life requirements, high-emitting interstate truck regulations, expanded recall scope, a fleet averaging
program and I/M for certain vehicle classes. Each of these program elements is discussed further in Appendix I Section
B; however, a short introduction is provided here. 

Heavy-duty on-highway engines contributed 19 percent of South Coast NO

X

 emissions and 6 percent of South Coast VOC emissions in 1990. These engines are predicted to continue to contribute
significantly to the inventory, even though, for NO

X

, the applicable standards have decreased in recent years (1989 and 1990) and will continue to do so (1998). These NO

X

 inventory contributions continue to be significant largely because the heavy-duty engine NO

X

 standards have been introduced relatively recently and because of a continued increase in heavy duty VMT. In addition,
the heavy-duty NO

X

 standards are significantly less stringent than the light-duty standards due to the historical inability of heavy-duty
diesel engines to attain low NO

X

 levels. The VOC contribution from heavy-duty engines, although smaller than the NO

X

 contribution, is also a significant part of the inventory. Additional reductions in the contribution of heavy-duty
engines to the NO

X

 and VOC inventory are required in order to meet the objectives of the FIP. Thus, EPA has developed the enhanced heavy-duty
vehicle program being proposed today. 

California's heavy-duty engine standards are not significantly more stringent than federal standards. A large
part of the reason for this relates to interstate commerce. Approximately 22 percent of the VMT traveled by heavy-duty
trucks in California are from out-of-state trucks engaged in interstate 
commerce. California cannot effectively deal with its air quality problems without regulating these engines, but
the State has hesitated from regulating interstate commerce because of concerns about the impact on in-state firms
and lawsuits. In order to effectively deal with NO

X

 from heavy-duty engines, controls on interstate trucking must be considered. For these reasons, the program proposed
today for heavy-duty vehicles includes not only tighter standards (as described in Appendix I Section B(3)) and a
fleet averaging program (as described in Appendix I Section B(9)), but also selected controls on higher emitting
interstate trucks (as described in Appendix I Section B(7)). 

Larger heavy-duty engines see substantially heavier use than smaller engines. These engines are built to very high
durability standards and are designed to be cost effectively rebuilt one or more times within their total lifetime.
To provide assurance of emissions control effectiveness over this extended actual life, this proposal includes
revised recall provisions (similar to those for light-duty) and certification and liability requirements for rebuilt
engines (as described in Appendix I Section B(4)).

EPA is proposing to adopt the enhanced in-use compliance program described in Appendix I Section B. EPA also requests
comments on all aspects of its proposal and on any other approaches to further reduce in-use emissions. 



4. Nonroad Engines and Vehicles 





a. Overview_

(1) Statutory Authority. Authority for the actions proposed to regulate nonroad engines is granted to EPA by sections
110, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 213, 215, 216, and 301(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) as amended (42 U.S.C.
7410, 7522, 7523, 7524, 7525, 7541, 7542, 7543, 7547, 7549, 7550, and 7601(a)). 

The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 extended EPA's authority regarding regulation of nonroad engines and vehicles.
Specifically the revised CAA section 213(a) directs EPA to: (1) Conduct a study of emissions from nonroad engines
and vehicles; (2) determine whether emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NO

X

), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from nonroad engines and vehicles are significant contributors to ozone
or CO in more than one area that has failed to attain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone and
CO; and (3) regulate those categories or classes of nonroad engines and vehicles that contribute to such air pollution
if nonroad emissions in the aggregate are determined to be significant by November 1992. Under CAA section 213(a)(4),
EPA may also regulate emissions other than CO, NO

X

, and VOCs from new nonroad engines and vehicles if EPA determines that such other emissions contribute to air pollution
that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. Finally, Section 213 directs EPA to regulate
emissions from new locomotives.

EPA is already required by statute, and, in some cases, court order, to promulgate national rulemakings for various
categories of nonroad engines. In this NPRM, EPA proposes to allow credit for these rules, which will be promulgated
either before or within a relatively short time after promulgation of these FIPs. Thus final issuance of these rules
is legally compelled well in advance of their scheduled implementation.

 Because of the imminence of these rulemakings, and because EPA's commitments to them are legally guaranteed, EPA
believes it is appropriate to give credit in the FIP for the emissions reductions they are expected to generate. The
emissions reductions involved are relatively small, and are further ensured by EPA's regulatory guarantee to achieve
the level of credited emission reductions by other means if necessary.

Canvassing the alternatives to this approach bolsters EPA's conclusion. One option is to accelerate the statutory
and court-ordered deadlines so that they precisely fit the FIP promulgation date. But the rulemakings at issue are
national in scope, and it would be detrimental to cut short the time Congress and the courts have allocated for their
analysis and consideration as a technical accommodation to the localized FIP deadlines. The only remaining alternative
would be to promulgate temporary, interim measures that would in all probability never be implemented, and that would
evaporate when the national rules were issued. This approach would be wasteful, inefficient, and confusing for regulated
sources.

(2) General Nonroad Background.  This section provides general background on nonroad sources excluding large ocean-going
ships, locomotives, and Federal sources such as aircraft. These sources will be covered starting with Section III
D.4.e of this preamble. The Nonroad Engine and Vehicle Emission Study (hereafter, ``Nonroad Study'') required by
section 213(a)(1) was completed in November 1991. The Nonroad Study is available in docket A-91-24. The
determination of the significance of emissions from nonroad engines and vehicles in more than one NAAQS nonattainment
area, required by section 213(a)(2), was proposed on May 17, 1993 (58 FR 28809). At the same time, the first set of Federal
regulations for a class or category of nonroad engines that contribute to air pollution, required by section 213(a)(3),
was also proposed (58 FR 28809) for new nonroad compression-ignition (CI) engines at or above 37 kilowatts (kW) (50
hp). As EPA continues to implement section 213(a) (3) and (4), it will propose Federal emission standards for new nonroad
spark-ignition (SI) engines at or below 19 kW (hereafter, ``small SI engines''), and spark-ignition (SI) marine
engines (hereafter, ``SI marine engines'') as well as other classes or categories of nonroad engines that contribute
to air pollution.

On the basis of the Nonroad Study, EPA has proposed its determination that emissions of CO, NO

X

, and VOCs from nonroad engines and vehicles contribute significantly to ozone or CO in more than one NAAQS nonattainment
area (see 58 FR 28809, May 17, 1993). According to the Nonroad Study, nonroad engines and vehicles contribute an average
of 10 percent of summer VOCs and 17 percent of summer NO

X

 in the 19 ozone nonattainment areas included in the study. Small SI engines are the source of half of those nonroad summer
VOC emissions. CI engines over 50 kW used in farm, construction, and utility applications are a major source of nonroad
NO

X

 emissions. In the 16 CO nonattainment areas included in the study, nonroad engines and vehicles account on average
for 9 percent of winter CO emissions. Small SI engines are the source of 56 percent of the nonroad winter CO contribution,
according to the study. In the Sacramento, Ventura, and South Coast FIP areas, nonroad sources comprise 10 percent,
5 percent, and 6 percent of the baseline VOC inventory, respectively. Nonroad sources contribute 22 percent of Sacramento's
baseline NO

X

 inventory, 12 percent of Ventura's, and 21 percent of South Coast's. 

(3) Sierra Club Suit. The Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund brought suit against EPA in Federal District Court for the
District of Columbia for failure to meet certain deadlines required under the Clean Air Act (

Sierra Club

 v. 

Browner,

 Civ. No. 93-0197 NHJ (DDC 1993)). Plaintiffs and EPA have entered into a settlement agreement in that case that,
among other things, requires EPA to finalize Federal emission standards for certain categories of nonroad engines
on the following schedule: 






The Settlement also requires that EPA make a decision regarding whether to regulate SI engines over 19 kW (25 hp) and
CI engines under 37 kW (50 hp) by December 1996. Given the reductions available through other measures proposed today,
it will not be necessary to develop special control measures for the FIP areas for these two categories of nonroad engines.
However, certain SI engines over 37 kW (50 hp) may be affected by the enhanced nonroad program described in the Appendices
of today's proposal. 

(4) Rationale for Implementing the Federal Programs in the FIP Areas. Nonroad sources are a diverse class of engines
used in as many as 80 applications. The structure of the industry that manufactures nonroad engines and vehicles is
complicated in that it is not integrated. Some manufacturers manufacture only engines, others manufacture only
equipment, few manufacture both engines and equipment. Much of the equipment is portable and is not registered, making
enforcement of regulations challenging. Almost without exception, nonroad engines have not been regulated previously
by EPA for emissions. Much of the data which existed relating to emissions from nonroad engines prior to 1991, while
adequate to estimate emissions inventories for the purpose of the Nonroad Study, needed updating and analysis before
comprehensive regulatory programs could be developed. For some categories of engines, little emissions data existed;
for other categories of engines, EPA believes that the emission test procedures need to be validated to ensure accurate
representation of in-use emissions using advanced control technology. 

The Agency is now in the process of gathering more emissions data and validating and developing test procedures for
nonroad engines. Because of the need to achieve near-term emissions reductions from nonroad sources in the nonattainment
areas and the lack of certain data, the Agency adopted phased Federal regulatory strategies for two nonroad categories:
CI engines at or over 37 kW and SI engines at or under 19 kW. In Phase 1 for each of these categories, EPA either has proposed
or will soon propose standards that will achieve maximum reductions in the near term using existing test procedures
and technology or modifications of existing technology. Phase 2 will deal with 
those issues for which a longer review time is advisable, such as development of new technologies and test procedures.


For the purposes of the FIP, the Agency proposes to implement certain Federal programs that have not yet been promulgated
by EPA. In particular, the Agency proposes to implement the Phase 1 and Phase 2 Federal Standards for nonroad SI engines
at or under 19 kW. These Phase 1 and 2 standards are now under development and will be proposed by May of 1994 and May 1996,
respectively. EPA also proposes to implement the Federal Standards for CI Nonroad Engines at or over 37 kW which have
been proposed (58 FR 28809) and will be made final by May 31, 1994, and National Standards for Spark-ignition Marine
Pleasure Craft which are under development and will be proposed by September 1994. These programs are described in
the section entitled, ``Federal Nonroad Requirements.''

(5) California's Nonroad Program/Preemption. Section 209(e)(1) prohibits California, and all other states, from
adopting standards for new locomotives and for new engines and vehicles used in farm and construction equipment under
175 hp. CAA section 209(e)(2) authorizes California to adopt and enforce emission standards for all other nonroad
engines if it is California's determination that such standards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protective
of public health and welfare as applicable Federal Standards and if EPA finds that: (1) California's determination
is not arbitrary and capricious; (2) California needs such standards to meet compelling or extraordinary conditions;
or (3) California's standards and accompanying enforcement procedures are consistent with that section. CAA section
209(e)(2) also authorizes other states to opt into California standards. 
The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has chosen to create categories for regulation of nonroad sources based
on application or end use of the engines. The Federal program for control of emissions from nonroad sources creates
categories for regulation based on engine parameters and characteristics such as size and fuel system, rather than
application. The Agency believes that this regulatory scheme provides criteria that make it easier to clearly determine
which engines are covered by which set of standards. The Agency does consider application or operating environment
in its regulatory scheme for some engines. In general, the Federal categories are broader than those chosen by California
and encompass a wider range of engines and applications. CARB has approved standards for nonroad lawn and garden and
utility SI and CI engines from 0-25 horsepower. EPA is currently reviewing CARB's section 209(e) waiver request
for its lawn and garden and utility rule. A decision will be issued once EPA's section 209(e) procedural rule is finalized.
There is potential for other states to adopt the California standards, which are scheduled to become effective in
1995. CARB also has proposed standards for other classes of nonroad vehicles. 
Federal Standards will be more comprehensive than California's proposed standards for lawn and garden equipment
or heavy-duty farm and construction equipment because the Federal programs will cover engines used in new farm and
construction equipment under 175 hp which California is preempted from regulating. About 1 in 5 engines that would
otherwise be covered by California's proposed lawn and garden standards are preempted because they are classified
as farm or construction engines. The Federal program for control of SI marine engines, which will be proposed by September
1994, will also be applied in the FIP areas. California has no proposed standards for marine pleasure craft, however,
CARB has conducted a public meeting to consider a plan to control emissions from ``large'' marine vessels. 


b. Federal Nonroad Requirements

_(1) Federal Requirements for CI Engines at or above 37 kW. This section provides a general overview of the major elements
of the Federal program to control emissions from new nonroad CI engines at or greater than 37 kW. 
(a) Applicability. The regulations are expected to apply to all new nonroad CI engines at or above 37 kW with certain
exemptions and exclusions. Engines included in this rule will be referred to as ``large nonroad CI engines.'' 
The vast majority of large nonroad CI engines currently being used and manufactured are diesel-fueled engines. The
use of alternative fuels will not be necessary to meet the emission standards. However, these regulations would apply
to large nonroad CI engines regardless of the fuel that is used (for example, diesel, compressed natural gas (CNG),
rapeseed, methanol, ethanol, and blends). Provisions are expected to be included which will allow manufacturers
to apply for Administrator approval of alternative test procedures if fuel other than diesel is to be used. 
(b) Standards. EPA expects to adopt NO

X

 emission and smoke standards for all large nonroad CI engines at or above 37 kW as proposed May 17, 1993 (58 FR 28809).
Furthermore, EPA expects to adopt standards for HC, CO, and PM emissions for engines at or above 130 kW, consistent
with those standards adopted by California in section 2420-2427, Chapter 11, Title 13 of the California Code
of Regulations, ``California Regulation for New 1996 and Later Heavy-duty Off-road Diesel Cycle Engines.''

<TEXT>
 



(c) Compliance Dates. Under the expected regulations, all engines produced by an engine manufacturer on or after
January 1 of the implementation year specified below by power category would be required to be certified by the engine
manufacturer according to the requirements in effect for that year. EPA expects equipment manufacturers to begin
installing certified engines as soon as they become available from engine manufacturers, with some lag time expected
for equipment manufacturers to clear out normal inventories. Early certification will be allowed one year prior
to the applicable effective date for engines participating in the averaging, banking, and trading (ABT) program.






(d) Certification and Test Procedures. The exhaust emission 8-Mode test procedures for NO

X

 emissions and the smoke test procedures are expected to be adopted as they were proposed with minor revisions. The
8-Mode test procedure would also apply to emissions of HC and CO. 
For PM emission measurement, EPA would adopt the California test procedures as finalized in Section 2420-2427,
Chapter 11, Title 13 of the California Code of Regulations, ``California Regulation for New 1996 and Later Heavy-duty
Off-road Diesel Cycle Engines.'' 
Manufacturers of engines that are not able to operate properly over the 8-Mode or smoke test cycles (such as engines
with constant speed governors), would be able to petition the Administrator to allow use of an alternative test procedure.
Upon adequate demonstration of need, the Administrator may allow use of alternative procedures. If an engine is unable
to be operated over the smoke test procedure, the manufacturer would be required to submit an alternative test plan
to the Administrator for approval in advance of any testing. 
The particulate standard adopted in the rule would be based on the use of the low sulfur fuel. Should a manufacturer
or EPA choose to perform certification or in-use compliance testing with commercially available fuel containing
higher sulfur, the particulate measurement will be adjusted by using the following equation to reflect the effects
of higher sulfur content of the fuel on particulate emissions


 

PM

adj

=PM_[BSFC x 0.0917 x (FSF^USLF

CA

)] 



Where: 


PM

adj

=adjusted measured PM level [g/kWh] 
PM=measured weighted PM level [g/kWh] 
BSFC=measured brake specific fuel consumption [(G/kW-hr) hr] 
FSF=fuel sulfur weight fraction 
USLF

CA

=upper sulfur level weight fraction of California test fuel specification 



This adjustment only applies to engines with no exhaust gas aftertreatment. No adjustment is provided for engines
with exhaust gas aftertreatment. 
(2) Federal Requirements for Small Nonroad SI Engines at or Under 19 kW. 
(a) Background. Since March 1992, EPA has held several public workshops and meetings to solicit information on technical
characteristics, emissions, potential regulatory strategies, and general regulatory issues related to small
SI engines. Public notice of such meetings may be found in the docket for this rulemaking. 
At the March 1992 public workshop, the Engine Manufacturers Association and the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute
encouraged Federal regulation of nonhandheld small SI engines and expressed interest in working in a cooperative
program with EPA to develop regulations by November 1993. Likewise, the Portable Power Equipment Manufacturers
Association encouraged Federal regulation of portable 2-stroke power equipment and expressed interest in working
cooperatively with EPA. 
Following the March 1992 workshop, EPA determined that setting emission standards for the small SI engine category
might be suitable for a consultative approach to rulemaking, such as negotiated rulemaking. The Negotiated Rulemaking
Act (5 U.S.C. 581-590) establishes a framework for conducting negotiated rulemaking. The goal of a regulatory
negotiation committee is to reach consensus on the language or issues involved in a rule. If consensus is reached,
it is used as the basis of the Agency's proposal.

EPA initiated a convening process to determine the best way to work with industry and other interested parties in developing
regulations for small SI engines. The conveners interviewed individuals in leadership roles in key organizations
identified by EPA to determine what parties were interested in these regulations, what issues were important to interested
parties, and whether a consultative rulemaking process would be feasible and appropriate. A copy of the convening
report dated August 24, 1992, is available in the docket for this rulemaking. 
The convening report recommended an exploratory meeting of interested parties to discuss, but not initiate, a consultative
process. Time-forcing factors lending an air of urgency to issuance of the rule include: (1) The need of states to realize
emission reductions from nonroad sources that are creditable toward Reasonable Further Progress requirements
of the CAA, and (2) the potential threat to industry of patchwork regulation if a number of states opt into California's
program in order to attain national air quality goals. The deadlines created by the settlement of the 

Sierra Club

 suit mentioned earlier led to even further need to issue a rule quickly. 
The exploratory meeting recommended in the convening report was held in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on November 16-17,
1992. Participants decided that state and public interest representatives needed more technical information to
fully understand some of the regulatory issues participants might face. It was also decided that another meeting
was necessary to discuss the potential design of a consultative process for a small SI engine rulemaking. The technical
briefing for state and public interest representatives was conducted in Ann Arbor on December 16, 1992. On January
28-29, 1993, a meeting to discuss consultative process design was held in Ann Arbor. 
At the January meeting, it was suggested that EPA consider a two-phased approach to regulation of small SI engines.
In the first phase, EPA would propose regulations for small SI engines through the normal regulatory process rather
than a consultative process. The suggested Phase 1 regulations would be similar to California's Regulation for 1995
and Later Utility and Lawn and Garden Equipment Engines, modified as necessary to meet CAA requirements. (For example,
EPA's proposal would modify CARB's program by including engines preempted from regulation in California.) The Phase
1 proposal would be completed as soon as possible, but no later than the spring of 1994. The final rule would be completed
no later than spring of 1995. The second phase of regulation would be developed through the consultative process of
regulatory negotiation. It would include issues such as useful life, in-use emission, evaporative emissions, refueling
emissions, test procedure, and market-based incentive programs. 
Today's action proposes that both phases of regulation for small SI engines be applied to the FIP areas. An overview
of what EPA anticipates will be included in a Phase 1 program is outlined below. EPA believes that the Federal Phase
1 Standards will result in a 40 percent reduction in the HC inventory with a slight (less than l percent) increase in
NO

X

. Phase 2 small SI engine regulations are expected to achieve 90 percent reduction in the small SI engine baseline HC
emissions inventory. The Agency expects that achieving a 90 percent reduction would not depend solely on more stringent
exhaust standards, but rather a combination of strategies (i.e., a scrappage program or other programs to accelerate
turnover, spillage control programs, fuels requirements and evaporative emission controls) that added together
would result in the anticipated reduction. Negotiations have been underway since Fall 1993 and will continue for
approximately 18 months. 
The phased approach to regulation of small SI engines is incorporated in the 

Sierra Club

 v. 

Browner

 settlement. Phase 2 regulation is expected to apply federally and in California in approximately 2000-2001.
Should the Agency's Phase 2 small SI engine program fail to provide for a 90 percent reduction from the current uncontrolled
emissions inventory, EPA shall promulgate a more stringent program applicable to California, or the FIP areas, or
propose fees for commercial operators of SI engines at or under 19 kW. 
(b) Overview of Program to Control Emissions from SI Engines Under 19 kW. The general provisions that EPA expects to
propose for the Phase 1 and Phase 2 rules, as well as the rationale for the key parts of the proposal, are briefly described
in the following section.

EPA expects to propose to regulate the emissions of hydrocarbons (HC), oxides of nitrogen (NO

X

), and carbon monoxide (CO) from certain new nonroad SI engines that have a gross power output at or below 19 kilowatts
(kW) (small SI engines). An SI engine is an internal combustion engine in which the air/fuel mixture is ignited in the
combustion chamber by an electric spark and are generally fueled by gasoline. The scope of these rules are expected
to encompass a broad range of small SI engine applications, including farm and construction equipment, which states
are preempted from regulating under section 209(e)(1) of the CAA. Anticipated exclusions from the rules are detailed
below. 

1. Engines used to propel marine vessels as defined in the General Provisions of the United States Code, 1 U.S.C. 3 (1992).
A ``vessel'' includes every description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being
used, as a means of transportation on water. 1 U.S.C. 3 (1992). 

2. Engines used in underground mining or engines used in underground mining equipment and regulated by the Mining
Safety and Health Administration (MHSA). See 30 CFR parts 7, 31, 32, 36, 56, 57, 70, and 75. 

3. Engines used in motorcycles and regulated in 40 CFR part 86 subpart E. 

4. Engines used in aircraft as that term is defined in 40 CFR 87.1(a). 

5. Engines used in recreational vehicles. Recreational engines are those engines which have no installed speed governor
and which have a rated speed of greater than or equal to 5000 revolutions per minute (RPM). Recreational engines are
not used to propel marine vessels and do not meet the criteria to be categorized as a Class III, IV, or V engine under this
rule. 

(c) Standards.




Phase 1



Under the expected Phase 1 proposal, exhaust emissions from small SI engines cannot exceed levels for a given engine
class as listed in the table below (``Phase 1 Small SI Exhaust Emission Standards''). Engine classes are specified
both by engine displacement, as measured in cubic centimeters (cc), and by the type of equipment the engine will power_either
handheld or nonhandheld. The emission standards that EPA expects to propose are considered Phase l small engine standards.








Class I: engines less than 225 cc in displacement 

Class II: engines greater than or equal to 225 cc in displacement 





Engines powering equipment defined as handheld must meet Class III, IV, or V emission standards as follows: 





Class III: engines less than 20 cc in displacement 

Class IV: engines at or above 20 cc to less than 50 displacement 

Class V: engines equal to or greater than 50 cc indisplacement 



Phase 2 



Standards are currently being negotiated for Phase 2 through the regulatory negotiation process and will cover exhaust
as well as evaporative emissions.

(d) Regulatory Scheme. 



Phase 1 



This rule is expected to propose the following regulatory scheme: 

 Designation of product lines into groups of engines with similar emissions, and manufacturer emission testing
of selected engines with a specified test; 

 Labeling of engines, and alternatively, equipment labeling; 

 Submission of an application for certification for each engine family; 

 Inclusion of various certification requirements such as the prohibition of defeat devices; 

 Issuance of an emission certificate of conformity for each engine family; 

 Prohibition against sale of engines in the U.S. not certified by EPA; 

 Requirement that equipment manufacturers use the appropriate handheld or nonhandheld certified engine
in their equipment; 

 Recordkeeping and reporting requirements; 

 Design warranty provisions and prohibition on tampering; 

 Inclusion of all farm and construction engines preempted under the CAA from state regulation; 

 Development of an engine manufacturer's program to evaluate in-use emission deterioration; 

 Requirement that, if catalysts are used in an engine family, catalyst durability must be confirmed by means
of the evaluation procedure that is specified in this NPRM; 

 Defect reporting; 

 Importation provisions; and 

 Production line Selective Enforcement Auditing (SEA). 



Phase 2 



The regulatory scheme for Phase 2 will be negotiated through the regulatory negotiation process. 



3. Federal Requirements for SI Marine Engines 



The EPA is currently in the process of developing a Federal rulemaking to control emissions from SI marine engines.
The proposed standards will be expected to result in a 70-80 percent reduction in HC emissions from two-stroke
outboard engines which comprise over half of the engines in this category. On average there will be a 50-60 percent
reduction in emissions from the fleet of SI marine engines. However, as a result of controlling HC emissions, NO

X

 emissions are expected to increase by a factor of 2-4 (baseline NO

X

 for these engines, on average, is about 2 
g/kWh). This Federal program will apply to FIP areas. EPA is under court ordered deadline for this regulation; the
schedule is for the NPRM to be signed by the Administrator by September 30, 1994 and final rule signed by November 24,
1995. The general provisions that the Agency anticipates will be included in the proposal for regulation of SI marine
engines are briefly described in the following section. Today, EPA is also proposing a system of emission based fees
for use of SI marine pleasure craft in the FIP areas. If the Agency finds that the Federal program for controlling emissions
from SI marine engines does not achieve the anticipated reduction, adjustments will be made to the stringency of the
fees or the standards to compensate for any loss in benefit from the Federal program. 

(a) Overview of Requirements for SI Marine Engines 

EPA will propose to regulate the emission of hydrocarbons from SI marine engines. Included under this regulation
will be emission standards for SI marine propulsion engines which include the following engine types: outboard,
sterndrive (inboard/outboard), inboard, and personal watercraft (e.g., Jet Ski). 

A compliance program involving pre-sale certification and in-use enforcement is also expected to be proposed for
marine engines. The proposed program will be similar to the current on-highway engine program. EPA expects to include
the following provisions: 

 Designation of product line into groups of engines with similar emission characteristics (such groups are
called engine families); 

 Manufacturer emission testing of selected engines with the specified test procedure to demonstrate compliance
with emission standards; 

 Labeling of engines from each engine family; 

 Submission of application for certification for each engine family by model year;

 Issuance of an emission compliance certificate for each engine family;
 Prohibition against sale of engines not certified by EPA;
 Recordkeeping and reporting;
 EPA confirmatory certification testing;
 Production line Selective Enforcement Auditing (SEA);
 In-use testing and enforcement;
 Warranty and prohibition on tampering; and
 Importation provisions.
Certain modifications to the on-highway program are expected to be proposed for this program. These modifications
include: (1) only one emission test engine required, and (2) a national averaging, banking, and trading program modified
to suit this industry.
For the FIP areas, EPA proposes that phased emission standards and certification of new engines commence with the
1998 model year for outboard, sterndrive and inboard engines, and 1999 model year for personal watercraft.
(b) Definition of SI Marine Engine. 

A spark-ignition engine is an internal combustion engine in which the air/fuel mixture is ignited in the combustion
chamber by an electric spark. EPA is expecting to propose defining marine engines as any nonroad engine which is used
on a ``vessel'' as defined in 1 U.S.C. Section 3 (1992).





(c) Applicability. Under the expected proposal all SI marine engines must comply with the proposed emission standards,
with some exceptions as discussed below.


Exclusions from the Proposal


Certain engines that are included within the proposed definition of marine engine just discussed are expected to
be excluded from the Federal marine engine emission standards. SI engines expected to be excluded are the following:
(1) Engines used in marine ``vessels'' as defined in 1 U.S.C. Sections 3 (1992) which are used exclusively as marine
auxiliary power generation units;
(2) Exported engines, either loose marine engines or marine engines in boats or vessels that are to be exported.


Exemptions From the Proposal


Pursuant to section 203(b)(1) of the CAA, the Agency is expecting to propose categories of exemptions from new SI marine
engine regulations similar to the existing exemptions for new large nonroad CI engines (see 40 CFR part 89 subpart
I). These include exemptions for purposes of research, investigations, studies, demonstrations, training, or
for reasons of national security. Exemptions are justified in these cases because the sources are limited in number
or scope so no environmental harm results, the particular use of the source is determined to further air quality research,
and/or the exemption is vital to the security of the nation. (See 39 FR 10601, March 21, 1974 for history of on-highway
exemptions policy.)
(d) Emission Standards. The numerical emission standards are expected to be proposed for the category of SI marine
vessels which includes inboard engines, sterndrives, and outboard engines. EPA realizes that these standards will
cover engines that use different technology, but EPA believes that creating separate standards based on categories
such as 2- and 4-stroke engines sets up artificial barriers to competition in the market and will not achieve as efficiently
reductions from this category as a single set of standards. EPA will in its proposal for the Federal program take comment
on the scheme of classification and level of standards. Separate standards are expected to be set for HC and NO

X

 emissions on a brake-specific basis (i.e., grams of pollutant per brake kilowatt-hour). EPA realizes that there
is a tradeoff between the level of HC emissions and NO

X

 emissions and intends to take comment on setting a combined HC+NO

X

 standard for this category of nonroad engines.
EPA believes that for current outboard engines these standards will be technology forcing. For other types of engines
these standards may require better calibration and more advanced fueling systems. The emission standards will be
proposed to take effect at the earliest possible date, as required by paragraph 213(b) of the Act.
SI marine engines are very rarely designed to operate on alternative fuels. EPA does not believe that new emission
standards for marine engines will require increased use of alternative fuels. EPA therefore does not expect to propose
procedures or emission standards for SI alternative-fueled marine engines. EPA does expect to request comment on
the need for regulations and the potential for increased market share for SI marine engines that operate on alternative
fuels such as natural gas, methanol, or ethanol.

In addition to the numerical emission standards described above, EPA expects to propose to prohibit direct emissions
of crankcase vapors into the atmosphere. Motor vehicles have been subject to an analogous requirement since the first
stages of emission-control regulation.
(e) General Enforcement Provisions. The Agency is expected to propose regulations that require marine sources to
obtain certification and subject them to selective enforcement auditing and in-use enforcement. The Agency is also
expected to propose regulations similar to those for on-highway vehicles under sections 203, 204, 205, and 208 of
the Act.
(f) Compliance Dates for Certification. The Federal marine program as it applies to the FIP areas will phase standards
in over time. EPA proposes that emission standards become effective in the FIP areas beginning in the 1998 model year
for outboard, sterndrive, and inboard SI marine engines, and in the 1999 model year for personal watercraft SI engines.
Companies considered small marine businesses will be defined in the Federal rule and would first be subject to emission
standards no earlier than the 2000 model year.
(g) Averaging, Banking, and Trading. Provisions of the national enforcement program are expected to include an averaging,
banking, and trading Program. EPA will not propose an averaging, banking, and trading program for marine engines
specifically for the FIP areas. However, EPA does plan on proposing such a program for the Federal regulation.


c. Special FIP Measures. 

The Agency believes that the above Federal programs will have sound technical basis and will achieve projected emissions
reductions. The Agency also acknowledges that the marine pleasure craft standards are likely to be technology forcing.
However, the Agency also recognizes that many other sources, which have been previously regulated, will be required
to meet new and more stringent standards than they are required to meet federally. For the purposes of equity and to
achieve added emissions reductions from nonroad sources, the Agency proposes to and will take comment on a fees program
for certain classes of these nonroad engines. The Agency is also proposing today a program to control emissions from
engines used in recreational vehicles and nonroad and on-highway motorcycles as a special FIP measure.
(1) On-Highway Motorcycles and Nonroad Engines Used in Nonroad Motorcycles. The Agency intends to exclude from its
regulation of SI engines at or under 19 kW, engines used in recreational vehicles because they have fundamentally
different operating characteristics than other small SI nonroad engines. In general, engines used in recreational
equipment are similar to engines used in on-highway motorcycles in that they use a continuously variable throttle
(not a governor), have rated engines speeds in excess of 5000 RPM, and wide variations in both engine load and speed.
These engines, like motorcycle engines, are primarily used to transport people. CARB has estimated that engines
used in nonroad vehicles such as motorcycles, all terrain vehicles, go-carts and other nonroad recreational vehicles,
contribute 21 tons of HC and 100 tons of CO per day to the statewide inventory. Further, EPA estimates that on-highway
motorcycles and engines used in nonroad motorcycles, including dirt bikes, ATVs, and similar equipment contribute
3, l, 30.3 tons of HC per day to the emissions inventories in the Sacramento, Ventura, and South Coast, respectively.
To achieve reductions from this category of nonroad sources as well as to achieve reductions from on highway motorcycles
and mopeds, EPA proposes to promulgate emissions restrictions for motorcycles and nonroad recreational vehicles
similar to EPA's existing on-highway motorcycle program found in 40 CFR part 86 subpart E.
(a) Overview. EPA today proposes to promulgate a definition of on-highway and nonroad motorcycles applicable in
the State of California for the purposes of the FIP, as well as standards for those classes of motorcycles and engines
used in them. Today's proposal encompasses on-highway motorcycles, and engines used in such vehicles as mopeds,
dirt bikes, all terrain vehicles, and go-carts. EPA is also proposing a more stringent set of exhaust emission standards
applicable to all new on-highway and nonroad motorcycles sold in the State of California after January 1, 1996. EPA
proposes that all other requirements of the current Federal motorcycle regulations contained in 40 CFR part 86 subparts
E and F, apply to motorcycles sold in California, including provisions for certification, test procedures, and enforcement.
(b) Definition of On-highway and Nonroad Motorcycles. For the purpose of the FIPs, EPA proposes to use the definition
of motorcycle in 40 CFR part 86 to refer to on-highway motorcycles and add the following definition for nonroad motorcycles.
A nonroad motorcycle means any motorized land vehicle designed for transporting persons or property and manufactured
for sale, sold, offered for sale, introduced into commerce, or imported into the State of California and which has
two wheels, or three or more wheels and a curb mass less than or equal to 680 kilograms; it does not include devices regulated
by the State of California as other classes of motor vehicles or devices regulated by EPA as other classes of nonroad
engines.

(c) Applicability. The Agency believes that it is necessary to control emissions from all on-highway motorcycles
and engines used in 
nonroad motorcycles, as defined in the previous section, on a 
statewide basis to achieve needed emission reductions in the FIP 
areas. It is the Agency's intent that the standards proposed 
today, as well as the requirements of 40 CFR part 86 subpart E, 
apply to all on-highway motorcycles, and engines used in nonroad 
motorcycles regardless of displacement. The following are 
examples of vehicles covered by the definition of nonroad 
motorcycles: dirt bikes, all terrain vehicles, go-cart, and 
mopeds. It is the Agency's intent that engines used in these 
vehicles and similar nonroad vehicles meet the standards. It is 
also the Agency's intent that on-highway motorcycles with 
displacements less than 50 cc (3.1 cu. in.) meet the proposed 
standards. 

(d) Standards. EPA proposes that all motorcycles sold in California meet a 0.8 g/km standards for HC, a 0.8 g/km standard
for NO

X

, and a 
12 g/km standard for carbon monoxide. 

Certification data from current technology on highway 
motorcycles indicates that over 50 percent of these motorcycles 
are certifying to exhaust HC emission levels at or below 0.8 
g/km HC. EPA believes that by using existing on-highway 
motorcycle technology it is reasonable to expect that 
motorcycles should be able to achieve comparable emission levels 
for HC. The Agency understands that an 0.8 g/km standard may 
require substitution of 4-stroke nonroad engines for 2-stroke 
nonroad engines currently used in dirt bikes, ATVs, and similar 
vehicles. However, EPA is also aware that catalyst technology 
exists and is currently being applied to 2-stroke motorcycles 
and mopeds sold in other countries to meet stringent legal 
emissions levels in those countries. EPA believes that this 
simple oxidation technology is viable for reducing emissions 
from engines used in both on-highway and nonroad motorcycles to 
the 0.8 g/km HC and 0.8 g/km NO

X

 level. 

The Agency has considered a 0.5 g/km HC standard for on-highway motorcycles and takes comment on restricting emissions

from on-highway motorcycles to this more stringent level and on 
the applicability of this standard to the smaller displacement 
on-highway motorcycles under 50 cc (3.1 cu. in.). 

Although the test data on NO

X

 emissions from motorcycles is 
more limited, experience with light duty cars suggests that with 
a catalyst, NO

X

 emission levels are approximately equal to HC 
emission levels. In addition, legal emission levels for 
motorcycles in Taiwan, beginning in 1996, will be 0.8 g/km for 
both HC and NO

X

. Testing data submitted by one catalyst 
manufacturer shows that HC+NO

X

 levels range between 0.30 g/km 
and 1.88 g/km. The Agency realizes that there is a trade-off 
between HC emission and NO

X

 emission and solicits comment on the 
benefit of setting a combined standard of 1.6 g/km for HC + NO

X

. 

EPA also realizes that less emission data exists for 
nonroad engines used in nonroad motorcycles and solicits data 
from manufacturers as a basis for evaluating the level of the 
standards proposed today. 

(e) Certification and Test Procedure. EPA proposes that the test procedure for on-highway and nonroad motorcycles
will be the same as that procedure described in 40 CFR part 86 subpart F. EPA acknowledges that the test procedure described
in 40 CFR part 86 subpart F, in general is 
performed on a dynamometer designed for two-wheeled motorcycles 
and that many motorcycles as defined above have more than two 
wheels. The test procedure described in 40 CFR part 86 subpart 
F, involves testing motorcycles as whole vehicles on chassis 
dynamometers designed for two-wheeled motorcycles, driving the 
same driving cycle (vehicle speed versus time) that is used for 
cars and light trucks. 

Current Federal regulations contain a general provision for 
EPA to authorize special test procedures for vehicles which 
cannot be properly tested under the standard procedures. EPA 
believes it is appropriate to test all of the new motorcycles 
and engines included in today's proposal as whole vehicles under 
this same procedure used for current motorcycles. The special 
test procedure provision would be applied as necessary to test 
any vehicles which cannot be physically tested using current 
motorcycle dynamometers. For example, vehicles having more than 
one drive wheel on an axle exceeding the width of current 
motorcycle dynamometer rolls might be tested using normal 
passenger car chassis dynamometers, or motorcycle dynamometers 
with specially widened rolls. Vehicles with multiple drive 
axles would be handled, as much as possible, like four-wheel 
drive passenger cars and light trucks are currently tested, with 
all the power supplied through only one primary drive axle. If 
the foregoing adaptations of the currently available motorcycle 
and passenger car chassis dynamometers cannot be applied, EPA 
would expect to apply special procedures involving directly 
connecting the drive axle to a dynamometer, driven at an axle 
speed that corresponds to the required vehicle speed. EPA 
solicits comments on the test procedures outlined in 40 CFR, 
Subpart F, and its applicability to four-wheeled nonroad 
motorcycles. EPA specifically requests comments on J1088 as an 
alternative test procedure. For J1088 and other alternative 
procedures suggested, EPA specifically requests data to allow 
correlation between the stringency of the proposed standards as 
measured on the test procedure defined in 40 CFR, Subpart F, and 
any test suggested by commentors.

(f) Authority. As explained above, in promulgating a FIP under section 110 (c) of the Act, EPA may take any actions that
the state could 
take. As section 209 of the CAA provides that California is not 
preempted from adopting and implementing a motor vehicle 
emissions control program provided its program satisfies the 
criteria of section 209(b), EPA believes that it, acting on 
behalf of California in the context of a FIP, may adopt a motor 
vehicle program or supplement California's own motor vehicle 
program provided that EPA's actions would satisfy the criteria 
of section 209(b) for a waiver of Federal preemption. Moreover, 
EPA believes that it, acting on behalf of California in the 
context of a FIP, may adopt a nonroad engine program or 
supplement California's nonroad engine program provided that 
EPA's actions satisfy the criteria of section 209(e)(2) for a 
waiver of Federal preemption and provided that the program does 
not establish emission standards or accompanying enforcement 
procedures for any new nonroad engines that California, under 
section 209(e)(1) is precluded from regulating (i.e., new 
locomotive and new engines used in locomotives and new engines 
used in construction equipment or vehicles or used in farm 
equipment or vehicles and which are smaller than 175 
horsepower). Section 209 provides that EPA is to grant 
California a waiver of preemption if the State determines that 
its standards ``will be, in the aggregate, at least as protective 
of public health and welfare as applicable Federal standards.'' 

Section 209 further provides that no waiver or 
authorization is to be granted if EPA finds that: (A) the 
determination of the State that the standards are, in the 
aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare 
as otherwise applicable Federal standards is arbitrary and 
capricious; (B) State standards are not needed to meet 
compelling and extraordinary conditions; or (C) the State 
standards and accompanying enforcement procedures are not 
consistent with section 202(a) (or are not consistent with 
section 209, as is the case of nonroad engines under section 
209(e)). EPA has interpreted the consistency criterion as 
meaning that California standards and accompanying enforcement 
procedures must be technologically feasible within the leadtime 
provided, taking into account the cost of compliance, and that 
they not impose inconsistent certification test procedure 
requirements such that the same vehicle or engine could not be 
used to comply with both State and Federal certification 
requirements. 

EPA believes that the on-highway and nonroad motorcycle 
program that would be applicable to vehicles and engines in 
California under the proposed FIP would satisfy the section 209 
waiver criteria. Thus, California could undertake the on-highway and nonroad motorcycle program described above,
and, 
therefore, EPA has authority under section 110(c) to undertake 
the proposed programs. 

With respect to the protectiveness of the standards, all of 
the proposed standards are at least as protective as the 
otherwise applicable Federal standards. 

With respect to the need to meet compelling and 
extraordinary conditions, EPA has repeatedly found that 
California's air quality problems satisfy the need criterion of 
section 209. Moreover, the magnitude of the reductions in 
emissions needed to reach attainment in the FIP areas, including 
mobile source emissions, provides ample evidence of the need for 
more stringent motor vehicle emission standards in California. 

Finally, with respect to the criterion of consistency with 
section 202(a) or section 209, EPA believes that its proposed 
enhanced nonroad program is consistent with both the 
technological feasibility and certification elements of that 
criterion. EPA believes that the various elements of the 
program are technologically feasible within the leadtime 
provided, taking into account the cost of compliance. Moreover, 
no aspect of the program establishes any new certification test 
procedures that are inconsistent with either existing Federal or 
California test procedure requirements. Consequently, EPA 
believes that its proposed on-highway and nonroad motorcycle 
program satisfies this prong of section 209 as well. 

In addition, as none of the classes of nonroad equipment 
EPA is regulating under this program are new farm or 
construction equipment or new locomotives, this program meets 
the requirements of section 209(e)(1). 

(2) Fee on Marine Pleasure Craft. Although the new national emission standards for spark ignition engines in marine
pleasure craft described above will result in substantial emissions reductions per engine, overall 
reductions in emissions from this category will depend primarily 
on the amount of fleet turnover after the new standards are 
introduced. Under conditions of normal turnover, EPA expects 
that approximately one half of the total fleet of marine 
pleasure craft will meet the new standard by 2005. However, 
even normal turnover may not result in enough emission reduction 
to accomplish the goals of this FIP. EPA believes that 
additional measures are needed to strongly encourage the use of 
only cleaner engines in the FIP areas. Therefore, EPA proposes 
to require that all owners of marine pleasure craft with spark 
ignition engines obtain an emission permit before operating 
their boats in the FIP areas during each area's ozone season 
beginning in 2004.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940505-1-00133 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Under this proposed permit system, all operators of marine 
pleasure craft will be required to carry an emission permit on 
board their boats while operating in the FIP area. Since boats 
are often operated in areas other than where the owner resides, 
permits will be required only for operation of a boat within the 
FIP area, not for ownership of a boat within the FIP area. 
Boat-owners who reside in the FIP area but only use their boats 
outside the FIP area would not be required to purchase permits. 

Two types of permits will be sold, annual permits and daily 
use permits. Owners of boats meeting the new emission standards 
described above would be eligible for permanent emission permits 
free of charge. Owners of all other boats could choose to buy 
either an annual permit which would allow them to operate their 
boats in the FIP area for the entire year, or a daily use permit 
which would allow them to operate their boat on a single 
specified day in the FIP area (owners could also purchase 
multiple daily use permits if they plan to operate their boats 
in the FIP area for only a few days per year). 

The fees for emission permits will be based on the average 
excess emissions of pre-standard engines compared to engines 
meeting the new emissions standards described above. For the 
purpose of permit fee calculation, the engines of marine 
pleasure craft will be divided into the following classes: 4- 
cycle gasoline inboard, 4-cycle gasoline outboard, 2-cycle 
gasoline outboard, 4-cycle gasoline sterndrive, sailboat 
auxiliary engines, and personal watercraft (e.g., Jet Ski). EPA 
invites comment on whether these general categories are 
appropriate for permit fee calculation, or whether they should 
be further subdivided to reflect differences in emissions or use 
within a class (e.g., some of these classes, such as 2-cycle 
outboards, could be further subdivided based on horsepower to 
reflect the very wide range of horsepower, usage, and total 
emissions that might be seen within the class). 

Average excess emissions per engine would be calculated 
separately for each engine class based on the difference between 
the sum of average HC and NO

X

 emissions for pre-standard engines 
and the sum of average HC and NO

X

 emissions for engines meeting 
the appropriate new standard. Total average excess emissions 
would then be calculated as the product of average excess 
emissions per engine for the engine class and the time of use 
for the engine class. For an annual permit, time of use would 
be based on the average annual use for the particular engine 
class. For a daily permit, eight hours of continuous use would 
be assumed for all engine classes. EPA requests comment on 
other options for time of use when assessing fees for daily 
permits. 

EPA currently estimates that a boat with a typical pre-standard 2-cycle gasoline outboard motor would be assessed
an 
annual fee of approximately $400, based on typical emission 
rates and hours of use and using a rate of $10,000 per ton of 
excess emissions (this example assumes 35 hours of annual use, 
with HC emissions reduced from 118 g/hp-hr to 35 g/hp-hr as a 
result of the new standard while NO

X

 emissions increase from 2.4 
g/hp-hr to 4.7 g/hp-hr; this example is based on EPA's best 
current estimates which may change as more information is 
received and as the engine standards are finalized). At this 
time, EPA believes that this fee level will effectively 
discourage the operation of pre-standard engines in the FIP 
areas. However, EPA will monitor the effectiveness of this fee 
level in discouraging operation of pre-standard engines, and 
increase the fee per ton if needed to discourage virtually all 
such operation. 

To obtain a permit a boat owner would have to present to 
the permit office documentation regarding the engine class and 
whether or not the engine meets the new emissions standard. The 
boat's state registration documentation may be sufficient to 
ascertain the engine class. If not, one time physical 
inspections may be needed, in which case EPA would seek to 
delegate such inspections to local or state agencies. Engines 
meeting the new emissions standard will be required to be 
labeled as such by the manufacturers. Boat owners will be 
required to show that their boat engines have such a label in 
order to obtain a free permit. In the absence of such proof, 
the permit fee will be based on the assumption that the boat 
engine does not meet the new standard. 

Some boat engine manufacturers may already be producing 
engines that meet the new standards, before the labeling 
requirements have been finalized. These manufacturers have the 
option of presenting to EPA evidence (in the form of emissions 
test data which meets EPA's test requirements for these engines) 
of which engines met the requirement before it went into effect. 
If EPA accepts this evidence, owners of such engines could 
qualify for a free permit if they can prove that their boat 
engine qualifies based on the serial number of the engine.

Emission permits must be prominently displayed at all times 
in boats operating in the FIP area under this proposal. EPA 
will enforce this permit system through the inspection of 
permits at boat ramps, marinas, and other access points, and 
through patrols of boating areas. EPA will have the authority 
to inspect boat engines, permits, and any other required 
documentation. Failure to display the proper daily or annual 
permit, falsification of a permit or of any documentation 
required to get a permit, or failure to surrender documentation 
or allow inspection of a boat or engine will be strictly 
prohibited and will be punishable by fines of up to $25,000. 

As explained above, in promulgating a FIP under section 
110(c) of the Act, EPA may take any actions that the state could 
take. As Section 209 of the CAA does not preempt states from 
regulating the use of marine engines, EPA believes that it, 
acting on California's behalf in the context of the FIP, may 
adopt this fee program. 

(3) Measures for Nonroad SI Engines over 19 kW and CI Engines under 37 kW. The Agency will decide whether to propose and
implement national control programs for emissions from heavy-duty SI nonroad engines greater than 19 kW and small
CI nonroad engines under 37 kW by November 1996. These small CI engines are used in such types of equipment as generator
units, pumps, air compressors, welders, and pressure washers. The heavy-duty SI engines are used in forklifts and
a small percentage of farm tractors. 

Today's proposal does not contain provisions for controlling emissions from these engines except for certain SI
engines over 37 kW. The Agency does not today have information sufficient to determine whether such engines 
should be regulated in the context of section 213 (a)(3). The Agency solicits comments on the greatest degree of emissions
reductions which may be achieved from these engines through the application of various technologies and 
information on the costs of such technologies; the time period within which manufacturers could implement technologies;
and the safety, noise, and energy implications of such technologies. 



d. Enhanced In-Use Compliance Program for Nonroad Engines 
Over 37kw.

 EPA is proposing an enhanced in-use compliance program 
for nonroad engines that is intended to apply to most of the larger nonroad engines, both compression ignition (CI)
and spark ignition (SI). More specifically, it covers all nonroad engines at or above 37 kilowatt (kw)(50 horsepower
(HP)) in size except for engines used in aircraft, locomotives, underground mining equipment, SI engines used in
recreational marine engines and low speed CI (diesel) engines used in oceangoing ships. Most of these engine categories
are dealt with in other portions of this FIP.
 
The proposal is very similar to the program for new heavy-duty onhighway engines. The program will contain tighter
NO

X

 standards for the FIP areas. It will also have an HC standard and evaporative free requirements to prevent a shift to
engines operating on high volatility fuels, such as 
gasoline. Finally, a ``normal maintenance'' recall program and engine rebuild requirements will be applied. Readers
should refer to the onhighway descriptions of these programs (contained in Sections A. and B. of Appendix I) as well
as Appendix I, Section C., regarding nonroad, for more information. 

These nonroad engines are proposed to be regulated 
because of their significance to the FIP area emissions 
inventories. In 1990, emissions from nonroad engines 
constituted 24 to 27 percent of the NO

X

 emissions, depending 
on the FIP area concerned. NO

X

 emissions reductions of 40 to 
70 percent are required for attainment of the ozone standard. 
These reductions are well beyond those expected from the soon 
to be adopted Federal nonroad standards. EPA's data shows 
that without control beyond the national standard, the 
percentage contribution of these engines will increase by 
almost one-third in each FIP area. 

The standards being proposed are the same as those 
proposed for onhighway heavy-duty engines. Since the engines 
involved are often derived from onhighway engine designs, the 
technologies used for compliance in the onhighway sphere can 
also be applied here. These rules ensure that similar 
stringency is applied across engine categories in the FIP. 

Many of the provisions for nonroad engines that are being 
proposed are similar to EPA's earlier proposed Federal nonroad 
program. That program was proposed in May of 1993 (58 FR 
28809, May 17, 1993), and when finalized will provide details 
regarding definitions, test procedures, general certification 
and enforcement protocols. The reader is referred to that 
proposal for further information.

program described in Appendix I, Section C. EPA also requests 
comments on all aspects of its proposal and on any other 
approaches to further reduce in-use emissions. 


e. Programs for National Transportation Sources and Federal 
Activities.

 (1) Introduction. The litigation which resulted in today's FIP proposal 
arose at least in part from a feeling in California that the 
emission regulation of certain sources was not keeping pace 
with the attainment needs of California areas or with the 
stringency of control imposed on other sectors of the 
California economy. For today's FIP proposal, EPA is 
proposing controls for these sources, and this section details 
the mixture of new engine standards and innovative market- 
based controls that will be proposed. 

The table below (``1990 Base Year Inventory of National 
Transportation Sources'')
 details the level of emissions from 
national transportation sources in each of the FIP inventories 
for the 1990 base year. The information contained in this 
table illustrates that while these sources are not as large as 
other mobile sources, their contribution to the emissions 
inventories warrants control by EPA. 




 


(2) Civil and Military Aviation 

(a) General Description of Category 

(

1

) Aircraft Operational Classes 

Aircraft operations can be segregated into four general 
categories: 

Commercial_aircraft operated on a scheduled basis 
by international, national, regional, and commuter air 
carriers, and unscheduled charter operators 

Military_aircraft operated by the Department of 
Defense

General Aviation_aircraft privately owned and operated on a nonscheduled basis 

Public_aircraft operated by federal, state, or local government agencies other than the Department of Defense 

Aircraft in each category are operated in considerably different fashion. For example, commercial aircraft operate
on a relatively fixed schedule while military aircraft operate according to specific mission requirements. For
that reason, each aircraft category will be controlled separately under this proposed FIP program. 

(

2

) Related Mobile Sources. Emissions related to aircraft operations are generated by a variety of mobile sources.
Ground support equipment (GSE) includes vehicles such as aircraft tugs, baggage tugs, fuel trucks, maintenance
vehicles, and other miscellaneous vehicles. Ground access vehicles include vehicles used by passengers, employees,
freight operators, and other persons using an airport. These sources have been considered in developing this program.


(

3

) Need for Control. Aircraft and aircraft-related emissions as a category represent significant sources of air pollution
in the FIP areas. In the South Coast air basin, the FIP area where airports represent the greatest portion of the inventory,
aircraft operating at the five commercial airports alone contributed 0.3 and 1.1 percent of the total 1990 baseline
emissions inventory for VOC and NO

X

, respectively. At projected growth rates, aircraft at these five airports_Los Angeles, Ontario, Burbank, John
Wayne, and Long Beach_will consume nearly 3.9 and 4.4 percent of the basin's allowable 2010 NO

X

 and VOC inventory, respectively, if left uncontrolled. 

(

4

) Level of Control. EPA intends to reduce emissions resulting from aircraft and aircraft-related activities in the
three California FIP areas to a level and at a rate commensurate with that required for stationary emission sources
in those areas which are subject to the proposed emission cap rules described in section III.C.5. of this NPRM. This
approach was selected by EPA for aviation primarily because of the difficulty in identifying specific control measures
given the diverse operational nature of the aviation sector and the leadtime available for FIP development, the difficulty
of requiring specific operational or procedural control measures for aircraft due to safety and operational flexibility
concerns, and the desirability of achieving emission reductions comparable to those being demanded from other significant
source categories. 

Currently, the proposed stationary source rules include a range of potential emission reduction requirements.
Consequently, the overall reduction targets for aviation reflect the same range of stringency. The proposed control
levels for these sources are expressed as the percentage reduction from the respective 1990 baseline emissions inventory
that must be achieved by 2005. The range of required reductions for each pollutant by area are shown below. 







The Agency will promulgate a specific percentage reduction target in the final rule based on public comments and any
additional technical information. 

(b) Commercial Aviation. (

1

) Overview. (

a

) Airline Focus and Specific Sources Covered. The FIP strategy for commercial aircraft operations is aimed at reducing
total emissions from all emission sources under direct control of commercial airlines operating at all airports
in each nonattainment area. The strategy is constructed so that each airline is responsible for its own compliance.
``Commercial airlines'' are defined as those air carriers operating aircraft with any of the following FAA operational
certificates: Parts 121, 125, 127, 129, and 135.

Commercial airline emission sources include aircraft, aircraft auxiliary power units (APUs), GSE, and any other
mobile sources under the control of airlines. For the purposes of this regulation, emission sources defined as ``under
the control'' of a commercial airline include all sources owned or leased by the airline, and all sources whose operations
are controlled under a contract agreement by the airline (for example, GSE servicing an airline that are owned and
operated by a fixed-base operator under contract to the airline).






Some GSE that service aircraft are owned by fixed based operators (FBOs) rather than airlines. Emissions from these
vehicles must be included in the airport bubble since they are a direct result of aircraft activity. EPA proposes today
to allocate these GSE to specific airlines based on servicing provided under contract agreements, and requests comment
on possible alternatives to such an allocation strategy. 

EPA proposes a target-based emission reduction program for these commercial aircraft emission sources. Each commercial
airline will be required to comply with a declining emission limit, expressed in allowable emissions per passenger
and freight handled. The proposed target-based program will include emission fees assessed on any airline that fails
to meet this emission rate target. The proposed target has been selected so that, even with expected passenger and
freight growth, compliance with the target by all airlines will result in total emissions declining at a rate and to
a level equivalent to that required of many stationary sources in the same basin. EPA will through experience raise
the level of the emissions fees as needed to achieve such aggregate emission reductions. 

As described above, EPA currently intends to establish emission reduction requirements for commercial aircraft
that are generally consistent with the emission cap requirements for stationary sources in the FIP areas. Although
not firmly decided, the current stationary source control strategy for the South Coast requires that VOC and NO

X

 emissions be reduced by 20-45 and 30-45 percent, respectively, from the 1990 baseline inventory by 2005,
through a series of uniform annual reductions of baseline emissions of each pollutant: 4-9 percent per year
for VOC and 6-9 percent per year for NO

X

, both starting in 2001. Stationary source requirements for the 2006-2010 period have not been established
at this time. The requirements for Ventura from 2001-2005 are identical to that for the South Coast. 

For Sacramento, the strategy requires a VOC reduction of 20-45 percent, with a uniform annual reduction of 4-9
percent. The timeframe for achieving this reduction is the same as for the South Coast and Ventura areas (i.e., 2001-2005).
The stationary source control strategy for Sacramento does not require a NO

X

 reduction since other actions will be adequate to achieve the area-wide NO

X

 emissions level needed for attainment. 

For this proposal, the overall reduction targets are expressed as a range of percentages; the final rule will contain
a specific percentage reduction target. EPA requests comment on whether the stationary source emission reduction
targets are appropriate for use with the commercial aircraft control strategy. 

(

b

) Geographic Scope. As already described, today's proposal applies to all three affected California control areas:
South Coast, Ventura, and Sacramento air basins. However, EPA requests comment on the desirability of removing the
Ventura and Sacramento control areas from this commercial aircraft control strategy. 

 The Sacramento air basin includes a single commercial airport. Aircraft emissions from this airport contributed
significantly less than one percent of the air basin
s total VOC and NO

X

 baseline emissions inventory for 1990. Current projections show that if uncontrolled, this airport
s emissions would consume less than one percent of the basin
s allowable 2005 inventory for VOC and NO

X

. Additionally, the SIP and FIP for Sacramento are expected to achieve VOC and NO

X

 reductions adequate for attainment, not counting additional reductions from airports. This expectation is based
on the best available, but still preliminary, analysis of current and future emissions. Further analysis may change
the picture. Similarly, the Ventura control area has only minimal commercial aviation activity; an extensive emissions
control program for the limited emissions resulting from such activity may not be desirable given the resource expenditure
necessary for implementation. The Agency, therefore, requests comment on whether it is necessary to implement a
commercial aviation control program in Sacramento and Ventura.

(

c

) Control Period. EPA proposes to establish a fee-based program focused on controlling commercial aviation emissions
only during the ozone season in each FIP area. Further, EPA proposes to assess fees on the basis of the season-long average
of emissions per passenger and freight carried. There would be no enforceable expectation for emissions in a single
day or month. 

This extended averaging period differs from the stationary source cap program in which year-round control and monthly
control periods are proposed. Because of the complex nature of operational scheduling, commercial aircraft operations
appear to have much less potential to vary significantly over the course of the ozone season in comparison to stationary
sources. This reduces the need to be concerned about particular days with significantly more emissions than average
that could adversely affect attainment. In addition, if the program is fee-based rather than based on a specific emissions
limitation, enforcement does not require a short control period to be practicable as it does for the stationary source
cap program. The proposed program for commercial aviation is both novel in concept and stringent, and EPA does not
wish to burden the industry with controls outside the ozone season if they are not essential to the air quality goals
of the FIP. Furthermore, operational changes outside the ozone season may provide some opportunity to ease the compliance
burden during the season. 

The annual ozone seasons for each of the three FIP areas are:

 


South Coast_March through October 

Ventura_April through October 

Sacramento_May through October 





Alternatively, EPA could establish a year-round fee program and apply fees separately in each month in order to even
better ensure that emissions are controlled each day. Beyond its contribution to ozone attainment, year-round control
of NO

X

 emissions from commercial aviation may aid efforts to comply with the particulate air quality standard, particularly
in the South Coast control area. (Ensuring particulate air quality is not a requirement for this FIP.) Since state
and local regulation over commercial aviation emissions is preempted by the federal government, such control would
have to come at the federal level. The Agency, therefore, requests comment on potential alternative compliance strategies.


(

) Key Regulatory Elements. (

a

) Summary. A detailed control strategy is described here for the South Coast FIP area, but will apply for all three control
areas. Any differences in detail or emission reduction requirements for Ventura and Sacramento will be identified
separately. 

The control strategy for commercial aircraft proposed today relies on a fee system to achieve a series of annual emissions
reductions from a baseline commercial aircraft emissions inventory. Airlines subject to the requirements of this
program will report activity and emissions during the ozone season on an annual basis beginning in 1999. An airline's
compliance with the program requirements will be determined for a given year by comparing an environmental performance
factor, expressed as pounds of pollutant emitted per passenger-equivalent unit (PEU) as calculated in the annual
report, against EPA's published pounds-per-PEU target for that year's ozone season. Airlines that exceed a particular
year's pounds-per-PEU target will be required to pay a fee in proportion to the excess emissions. EPA is proposing
pounds-per-PEU targets that will achieve the requisite annual emission reductions based on projected growth in
passenger and freight activity. (A more complete description of the proposed PEU factor and emission targets is presented
in section III.D.4.e.(2)(b)(

2

)(

b

).) 

In order to obtain airline compliance with these pounds-per-PEU targets, the Agency will observe the airlines' responses
to the initial fee level in 2001, and will adjust the fee level to a higher or lower level if needed. The final FIP regulations
will contain commitments to this effect, and will specify the specific level to which the fees will be adjusted or a
formula for determining such level. Comments on this adjustment process are requested. EPA expects that the final
fee program for this source will be consistent with the Agency's Economic Incentive Program rules as discussed in
section III.D.5 of this NPRM. 

This commercial aircraft emission reduction program will apply to all commercial aircraft operators in the FIP areas,
including domestic airlines, foreign airlines, and new entrant airlines. EPA recognizes the economic and social
importance of accommodating new entrants and the expansion of existing airlines in any commercial aircraft emission
reduction program. This control strategy attempts to accommodate these important concerns by not directly requiring
EPA to allocate emissions or operational rights to individual airlines.

The methodology for determining the environmental 
performance targets reflects projected growth in air travel 
within the respective FIP control area. As a result, new 
entrants simply would be required to achieve the appropriate 
environmental performance targets upon initiation of service. 
Both new entrants and expanding airlines are automatically 
accommodated by the control strategy as long as growth beyond 
predicted levels does not occur. In event that activity grows 
faster than originally forecast, EPA will revise the performance 
targets, as discussed in greater detail later in this section. 
Therefore, the Agency believes that the proposed program 
incorporates features which provide flexibility for new entrants 
or existing airlines to begin and expand environmentally 
responsible aircraft operations in the basin. Nonetheless, all 
airlines will face significant economic and technical challenges 
as a result of this program. 
(

b

) Pounds per PEU Scheme. The FIP strategy for commercial aircraft operations will 
center on a schedule of declining emission performance targets 
(i.e., pounds per PEU) for the combined emissions from all 
commercial airports in each control area. Separate targets will 
be established for HC and NO

X

 emissions. These emission targets 
will yield benefits consistent with the percentage reduction from 
1990 inventory for stationary sources. Ultimately, the emissions 
from commercial aviation in the South Coast and Ventura areas 
will be reducted by 20-45 percent and 30-45 percent from 1990 VOC 
and NO

X

 emission levels, respectively, by 2005. The goal for VOC 
emissions in the Sacramento area is 20-45 percent by 2005. As 
already discussed, there is currently no stationary source 
emissions cap for NO

X

 in Sacramento. 
This control strategy fundamentally relies on the 
calculation of an emissions baseline as a reference point for 
determining future year emission limits during the control 
period. The Agency proposes to use currently available emissions 
inventory data for aircraft and aircraft-related activities to 
establish the requisite emissions inventory for the baseline year 
of 1990. Once established, the seasonal emission limits for each 
year can be calculated from the baseline inventory established 
according to the annual uniform schedule of percentage reductions 
described above. 
The choice of 1990 as the baseline year is consistent with 
the Act's requirement for modeling reasonable further progress 
(RFP) and attainment of the ambient standards. However, aviation 
activity in 1990 may not be representative of typical operations, 
because the aviation industry experienced significant change 
during this period. Several air carriers, notably Eastern 
Airlines, ceased operations or stopped serving airports in the 
South Coast and Sacramento areas. Others such as Southwest 
Airlines had only a minimal presence in these areas during that 
period, but greatly expanded operations in subsequent years. 
In addition, the Desert Shield/Desert Storm military action 
caused an increase in jet fuel prices and a rapid decline in 
commercial passenger traffic. For these reasons it may be 
desirable to use a two-year average, perhaps 1989-1990, for 
establishing a baseline inventory in preference to using 1990 
data alone; this could lessen the effect of unusual circumstances 
on a single year's inventory. EPA requests comment on the 
desirability of using a two-year average for establishing a 
baseline inventory. Any such multi-year average, however, may 
require an adjustment to the emission performance targets in 
order to assure consistency with the stationary source cap 
requirements and EPA's demonstration of attainment. 
Alternatively, EPA could utilize baseline reports from 
commercial airlines to establish this inventory. Given the 
importance of this baseline inventory in setting realistic 
emission limits and environmental performance targets, such 
industry baseline reports could provide information more 
representative of airline operations in the control area than 
generic default data currently being used EPA for some portions 
of the inventory.

For example, EPA currently has only estimated information on 
GSE and limited primary data concerning commercial aircraft 
operations in Ventura and Sacramento. These reports could also 
provide data on certain ground access vehicles that are directly 
under the control of airlines. These sources are presently 
unaccounted for in today's proposal due to insufficient 
information.
 Therefore, baseline reports could provide 
additional detail and precision, albeit at the expense of an 
additional administrative burden for commercial airlines. 
Information that could be requested for such baseline reports is 
discussed in ``Reporting and Recordkeeping'' below. EPA requests 
comment on the desirability of requiring airlines to submit 
baseline reports, and on other possible alternative methods for 
establishing a reasonable baseline emissions inventory. 




The Agency further proposes to modify the stationary 
source-related approach just described in order to ``lock in'' 
additional emission reductions that are expected to result from 
other non-FIP requirements such as the commercial aircraft fleet 
modernization that will occur in response to FAA noise reduction 
regulations. According to the Air Transport Association,
 
these requirements could generate a 40 percent reduction in VOC 
emissions by 2000 from 1990 levels, when the requirements are 
fully implemented. This represents the maximum period of effect 
for these requirements, however, since the affected aircraft 
would be retired eventually even in the absence of specific 
regulations. EPA estimates that the emissions reduction benefit 
resulting from noise reduction requirements declines to zero by 
2010 because of such expected retirement schedules. 




To ensure these potential emission benefits occur, the 
Agency proposes to modify the stationary source approach for 
developing the commercial aircraft baseline inventory and 
seasonal emission limits as follows. The target for basin-wide 
emissions will be the lower of either the emissions level 
calculated from the percentage-reduction-from-1990 schedule being 
proposed for the stationary source cap program, or the emissions 
level that is expected to result from non-FIP regulatory 
requirements such as the fleet modernization under the noise 
reduction requirements (i.e., emission improvements accompanying 
the retirement of older, dirtier aircraft). The Agency requests 
comment on this ``lock-in'' approach and potential alternatives 
that would ensure progress and attainment under the FIP. 
The two tables below present examples of the proposed ozone 
season emission inventory limits for VOC and NO

X

 in the South 
Coast area. The emission limits in these tables are presented 
for illustrative purposes and for the purpose of facilitating 
public comment only. They do not represent the final values from 
which the enforceable emission performance targets will be 
derived, since EPA will continue to refine the baseline emissions 
inventory, aviation activity projections, and the effect of 
noise-driven fleet modernization based on information received 
during the comment period.

[

Note: 

These emission limits reflect currently available data on aircraft, auxiliary power units, and ground service equipment
only. They do not include the proposed lock-in VOC reductions from the noise-driven fleet modernization forecast.]










EPA proposes to use a constant annual reduction between 2001 and 2005 in determining the seasonal area-wide emissions
limits, since this straight-forward and simple approach is being proposed for the stationary source cap program.
EPA requests comment on the appropriate schedule of reduction (i.e, faster or slower phase-in) for the seasonal emission
limit even though the final (2005) emission limit would not change.
EPA will establish enforceable environmental performance targets that will serve as the primary mechanism to achieve
the annual emission limits for commercial aircraft operations in each FIP area. These area-wide performance targets
will be calculated for each ozone season from 2001 through 2005 using the following formula:



Performance target (lbs/PEU)=seasonal emission limit (lbs)/seasonal projected activity (PEUs)



Passenger equivalent units (PEUs) will reflect the projected number of passengers and the amount of cargo carried,
as described below. The example environmental performance targets presented for illustrative purposes in the tables
above use EPA's current PEU activity forecast, which assumes an annual linear growth rate of approximately 1.5 percent
per year from 1990 through 2005 based on information from the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG).

<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


Individual airlines will determine their compliance with these basin-wide performance targets by calculating
their annual pounds-per-PEU performance using the following formula:



Performance result (lbs/PEU)=actual seasonal emissions (lbs)/actual seasonal activity (PEUs)



This performance will be compared against the basin-wide targets to determine compliance; non-compliant airlines
will pay an emissions fee proportional to their excess emissions, as discussed in greater detail below.
PEUs will reflect both the actual number of passengers carried and the actual tonnage of cargo transported on commercial
airlines. EPA will establish in the final FIP a conversion factor for combining passenger and freight movement into
a single PEU total. The airlines have reported using as a ``rule of thumb'' 200 pounds of payload for each passenger,
which includes the weight of the passenger and his or her luggage. EPA proposes to use this conversion factor of 200
lbs/passenger to convert cargo weight into PEUs. EPA requests comment on whether this is an appropriate and equitable
value.
EPA will develop a forecast of control area airline PEU activity for the control period (2001-2005) to develop
each year's environmental performance targets. EPA proposes today to use currently available activity projections
for the South Coast from the South Coast Air Quality Management District for this purpose. Similar existing projections
will be used for Ventura and Sacramento, as discussed in the Technical Support Document.
Certain discrepancies may arise, however, between current forecasts and actual activity some years in the future.
If actual PEU activity is higher than EPA forecast, compliance with the annual pounds-per-PEU level could result
in total emissions higher than the basin-wide targets. If actual activity is lower than EPA forecast, the promulgated
pounds-per-PEU limit will be more restrictive than actually needed. For that reason EPA will periodically review
the PEU forecast, given its importance in establishing the environmental performance targets.
This review will occur approximately every three to five years at a minimum. EPA will revise the area-wide PEU forecast
in a subsequent rulemaking action if the periodic review indicates that the forecast is significantly inaccurate.
EPA also will revise the seasonal environmental performance pounds-per-PEU targets in the same rulemaking action
in the event that the PEU forecast is revised. EPA also requests comment on alternative methods for establishing activity
factors (and the resulting environmental performance targets) that may be automatically updated based on prior-year
operational data.
The two tables below present examples of the proposed seasonal environmental performance targets for VOC and NO

X

 in the South Coast area. As with the emission limits presented earlier in this section, these example targets are provided
for illustrative purposes only and do not represent the final enforceable emission performance targets.

[See note on previous tables.] 




For 2006 and beyond, EPA proposes to retain for now the same 
pounds-per-PEU limit used for 2005 in all three areas, pending 
promulgation of the additional rules envisioned under today's 
proposed strategy for 2010 attainment in the South Coast and the 
preparation of maintenance SIPs for the Ventura and Sacramento 
areas. Comment is invited on this aspect of the proposal. 
(

c

) Fee System. EPA will establish, and as necessary adjust, the level of a fee-based compliance system in consultation
with the FAA to 
achieve the seasonal commercial aircraft emissions targets for 
each pollutant. Each commercial airline will be expected to meet 
the seasonal pounds-per-PEU environmental performance target as 
described above. Any airline that exceeds the target in any 
ozone season will pay an emissions fee proportional to the excess 
emissions. Expressed differently, the fee will be applied only 
to the incremental emissions which are in excess of the 
performance target, not to the airline operator's total seasonal 
emissions. Through an iterative process, EPA will set the 
emissions fee at a level designed to discourage such 
noncompliance. 
EPA requests comment on a triggering mechanism that would 
prevent implementation of the fee system as long as the area-wide 
commercial aircraft emission allowance target is achieved. 
Beginning with the 2001 annual report, EPA could use airline 
annual emissions/activity reports to determine total actual 
area-wide commercial aircraft emissions. If this total emissions 
quantity did not exceed the allowance for that year, airlines 
could operate undisturbed by the FIP. If the total actual 
emissions quantity did exceed a given year's allowance, however, 
the emissions fee system would be implemented for that year and 
would remain in effect for all subsequent years. 
It is important that the fee paid by the airlines for excess 
emissions be high enough to encourage adherence to the pounds-per-PEU limit but not so high as to needlessly reduce
industry 
profits or to drain away funds that should be spent for 
mitigating emissions. For the other fee systems discussed in 
this FIP, EPA proposes a base fee of $10,000/ton of pollutant. 
The following example describes the impact of a $10,000/ton fee 
on a commercial airline under the proposed control strategy. The 
1990 emissions per PEU are 0.087 pounds of VOC per PEU and 0.162 
pounds of NO

X

 per PEU using current EPA data (see discussion 
above). The 2005 example environmental performance targets as 
presented in Tables D and E are 0.039 pounds of VOC per PEU and 
0.073 pounds of NO

X

 per PEU . Assuming that there is no 
improvement in environmental performance from the current 
uncontrolled rate, a maximum fee for 2005 can be calculated as 
follows: 



VOC Fee: (0.087 lbs/PEU-0.039 lbs/PEU) X $10,000/ton 
divided by 2000 lbs/ton = $0.24/PEU for VOC 
NO

X

 Fee: (0.162 lbs/PEU-0.073 lbs/PEU) X $10,000/ton 
divided by 2000 lbs/ton = $0.45/PEU for NO

X

 



On this basis the maximum fee would be $0.69 per PEU. This 
is equivalent to approximately $120 per landing plus takeoff, for 
an average airplane. To put this excess emissions fee in the 
context of other fees, collected from commercial aircraft 
operators for other purposes, current landing fees at LAX are 
$1.56/1,000 pounds of gross landing weight; for a typical Boeing 
737 this is about $178 and for a Boeing 747 about $913. From 
another perspective, the FAA allows airports to apply passenger 
facility charges of $3 per passenger to pay for qualified airport 
improvements. 
The $10,000/ton emission fee, therefore, may be an 
inappropriate starting point for commercial aircraft, since the 
likely impact is so small, that between 2000 and 2005 upwards 
adjustment is very likely to be needed. EPA believes that a 
substantially higher fee may be necessary for commercial aircraft 
in order to ensure compliance with the seasonal environmental 
performance targets. On the other hand, the expectation of larger 
fees after 2001 may have an effect on its own. Also, there are 
enough fee cycles between 2001 and 2005 that a fee level which 
will produce the desired reductions by 2005 should be reachable 
by 2005 even if the fees initially are based on $10,000 per ton. 
EPA requests comment on what fee levels will achieve the 
objective of discouraging noncompliance without being excessive, 
and on what the starting level of the fees should be.

EPA believes that fee collected under this program must be 
submitted to the United States treasury and can not be redirected 
for air pollution mitigation projects or other purposes. The 
Agency requests comment, however, whether this is true for fees 
collected from foreign flag air carriers under international 
aviation agreements. For a general discussion on the disposition 
of collected fees see section III.A.2.b. 
(

d

) Averaging and Trading. The Agency proposes to allow an airline to calculate its average seasonal environmental
performance across the entire area in order to determine compliance with the emission rate target. 
This approach will provide airlines with the flexibility to shift 
operations within the basin to meet demand in an environmentally 
beneficial manner; an airline could move some of its operations 
to a less-congested airport to take advantage of reduced taxi 
times and resultant emissions reductions, for example. It also 
allows an airline to operate at some airports in excess of the 
pounds-per-PEU level and offset the excess at other airports 
where emission control may be more economical. EPA requests 
comment on the feasibility and desirability of determining 
compliance in such a manner. 
EPA also requests comment on including an emissions credit 
program as part of the control strategy proposed today. Any 
commercial airline that achieves emission reductions greater than 
those required could sell or otherwise transfer credits thus 
generated to other commercial airlines, which in turn could use 
the credits to comply with the pounds per PEU target and minimize 
or avoid paying emissions fees. Such a credit program would 
provide commercial aircraft operators with an incentive to reduce 
emissions to a level below that required, thus rewarding those 
airlines with the ability to operate in an efficient and 
environmentally beneficial manner. A credit program also would 
accommodate those airlines that cannot achieve their individual 
emission rate targets because of certain operating circumstances. 
Simple, direct airline-to-airline credit trades could be 
incorporated into EPA's annual reporting and fee calculation 
program fairly easily with little extra resources on EPA's part. 
An expanded credit system in which credits become a commodity 
that can be purchased and re-sold would require more monitoring 
and enforcement to prevent error and fraud. EPA would be likely 
to allow such a system only if a state or local agency took 
responsibility for the work of keeping it honest and accurate, 
given the expected limits on EPA resources to implement all 
aspects of the FIP. 
EPA notes that the RECLAIM credit trading program for NO

X

 
emissions was recently adopted in the South Coast, and is an 
example of cross-source trading of excess emission reductions 
relative to well quantified baselines and requirements for 
further emission reduction. The RECLAIM program covers certain 
NO

X

 source types that were most amenable to emissions 
quantification and verification. Such a cross-source trading 
system has obvious attractions in terms of achieving a given 
environmental goal, while allowing the most economically 
efficient business choices consistent with that goal. 
EPA anticipates that commercial airlines may be interested 
in a program that provides the option of purchasing emission 
credits to allow more operational flexibility. Since the RECLAIM 
program operates off a declining schedule of allowable emissions 
from the subject sources, rather than from the declining 
emissions caps established by the FIP, RECLAIM NO

X

 credits are 
not necessarily surplus to the FIP and cannot be used by sources, 
including commercial airlines, to meet their FIP emission limits 
or to reduce their fee liability. Given EPA's concern about the 
adequacy of its implementation resources, EPA is not proposing to 
establish a cross-source trading program of its own. However, 
EPA welcomes comments on whether and how state or local agencies 
could help operate a credit trading system which would be in 
keeping with the FIPs control levels and which would be 
available to the airline industry. 
(

e

) Reporting and Recordkeeping. (i) Compliance plans. The stationary source cap program includes a requirement for

affected sources to submit compliance plans that describe planned 
emission reduction measures. EPA could establish a similar 
requirement for commercial airlines as part of today's proposed 
control strategy. Such compliance plans would be submitted by 
airlines in advance of the control period and would describe in 
some detail the various emission reduction measures planned for 
the 2001-2005 control period. Compliance plans also could 
include information on expected activity during the control 
period, which would provide EPA with an opportunity to review the 
PEU forecast and update the environmental performance targets if 
necessary. Most importantly, compliance plans could provide an 
opportunity for the FAA to review airline emission reduction 
plans for safety considerations. 
Compliance plans would impose significant administrative 
burdens on commercial airlines, EPA, and the FAA, however. The 
Agency therefore requests comment on the desirability of 
requiring airlines to submit compliance plans, and on the 
information that should be provided in such plans should they be 
required. EPA does not contemplate that compliance plans if 
required would become legally binding on the airlines that submit 
them since that would impede business flexibility and is not 
essential to the effectiveness of the program. However, if EPA 
does require compliance plans, deliberate misrepresentation of an 
airlines plans may be made a violation of the FIP.

(ii) Baseline reports. As described above, EPA requests comment on requiring airlines to submit baseline reports
that provide emissions data 
for the baseline year of 1990, or some alternative baseline 
reporting period as discussed in section III.D.4.e.(2)(b) above. 
Baseline reports would provide EPA with additional detail and 
precision for the purpose of establishing the baseline emissions 
inventory, the seasonal emission limits, and, ultimately, the 
seasonal environmental performance targets. Any revisions to the 
emission limits and environmental performance targets would be 
made after notice and opportunity for public comment. 

One alternative for implementing a baseline reporting 
requirement, is to require commercial airline operators to report 
data concerning aircraft operations into or out of the basin for 
their particular airline in the baseline year of 1990 (or for 
1989 and 1990 for the purpose of calculating a two-year average). 
Airlines would submit this data to EPA no later than 180 days 
following finalization of this rule. These reports could also 
provide information on ground access vehicles under the direct 
control of airlines for incorporation into the control strategy. 
More specifically, the baseline reports could include the 
following information to be provided by airlines: 

 Aircraft type and model, engine type and model, and number 
of landing/take-off operations (LTOs).
 Taxi/idle time by engine for each flight.
 Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) operating time. 
 Ground Support Equipment (GSE) population by type.
 GSE activity by fuel type, engine size, and annual use hours.

EPA recognizes that detailed information may not be 
available in each of these categories for 1990. In these 
instances affected airlines could report estimated data; such 
estimates would be accompanied by a description of the estimation 
methodology used, including any supporting data. Alternatively, 
EPA could establish a set of default values for use in the 
absence of detailed data, as described above. The Agency 
requests comment on these and other baseline report alternatives. 

(iii) Annual compliance determination reports. Beginning with a report describing activity during the 1999 ozone
season, the FIP will require commercial airlines to submit annual reports within 60 days of the close of each calendar
year. These reports will include information on aircraft-related 
emissions and airline activity for the previous year's ozone season. 

Commercial airline operators will be required to submit 
annual reports describing regulated aircraft-related activities 
and emissions in each control area for their airline during the 
preceeding year's ozone season beginning in 1999. These annual 
emissions/activity reports will be submitted to EPA within 60 
days of the close of each calendar year; the first report thus 
would be due by March 1, 2000. Initiating these annual reports 
in 1999 will provide airlines and EPA with an opportunity to 
assess data-gathering and -analysis requirements well in advance 
of the first emission targets in 2001, as well as providing 
airlines with important information on their performance needs 
prior to the first round of required reductions. Subsequent 
annual reports will be used to determine compliance with the 
seasonal emission targets. 

Failure to submit an annual emissions/activity report will 
subject an airline to EPA enforcement. Affected airlines will be 
required to maintain appropriate data collection equipment and 
procedures necessary to complete the annual report in a 
satisfactory manner. Failure to maintain such equipment and 
procedures also will subject an airline to EPA enforcement. 

Annual emissions/activity reports will include the following 
information for aircraft and aircraft-related operations during 
the seasonal control period: 
 Flight number for each flight.
 Aircraft type and model for each flight.
 Engine type and model for each flight.
 Taxi/idle time by engine for each flight. 
 Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) operating time. 
 Number of passengers carried for each flight. 
 Weight of non-passenger cargo for each flight. 
 Ground Support Equipment (GSE) population by type. 
 GSE activity by fuel type, engine size, emission control 
level, and number of hours used.

Airlines will be required to track and report actual data 
for the above information categories. Default values will not be 
accepted for the purposes of determining compliance with the 
environmental performance target. 

Reporting airlines will be required to calculate their VOC 
and NO

X

 emissions for the ozone season using the above data and 
enter these emissions on the report form. The Agency 
anticipates using existing EPA documents for the emission 
calculation methodology. Comments are requested on the 
desirability of issuing additional specific technical guidance 
concerning emissions calculations for aircraft and 
aircraft-related operations. Reporting airlines also will be 
required to calculate their total PEUs using passenger and cargo 
data, as well as their pounds/PEU emission rate for VOC and NO

X

, 
and enter these results on the report form.

<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



An airline's compliance with a seasonal environmental 
performance target will be determined by comparing actual 
pounds-per-PEU performance against the target. An airline whose 
actual performance exceeds the target will be required to submit 
a fee proportional to the resultant excess emissions, as 
described in ``Fee System'' above. This fee will be remitted along 
with the annual compliance determination report. 

An airline's annual emissions/activity report will include a 
statement signed by a corporate officer affirming the report's 
accuracy. Failure to provide accurate information in the annual 
emissions/activity report will be considered a FIP violation 
subject to EPA enforcement. Reporting airlines will be required 
to maintain copies of their annual reports for three years, 
including all relevant calculation worksheets and supporting 
data. 

(

f

) Exemptions. EPA requests comment on the desirability of providing 
exemptions from the requirements of this control program for 
certain types of commercial aircraft operations or unusual 
situations. Atypical aircraft operations beyond the control of 
an airline and not anticipated in the design of the operations 
data collection system, such as in-flight emergency situations 
requiring emergency landings, could be exempted from reporting 
requirements and would not count toward an airline's 
environmental performance. Also, certain small commercial 
aircraft operators might be unnecessarily burdened under this 
program relative to the emissions reductions that might be 
obtained. EPA requests comment on the desirability and 
feasibility of establishing a de minimis exemption for this 
control program. Additionally, the Agency requests comment on 
the desirability of waiving part or all of any fee incurred by 
individual airlines that can demonstrate unreasonable economic 
hardship or burden on interstate commerce. Finally, comments are 
solicited on appropriate procedures and criteria for granting 
exemptions to foreign flag air carriers to ensure compliance with 
international treaties, bilaterial agreements, or when the 
Secretary or Deputy Secretary of the Department of State find 
that granting such an exemption is in the national interest of 
the United States. 

(

) Legal Authority and Regulatory Interactions. As noted in this preamble, EPA has broad authority under 
section 110(c) to promulgate regulations in a FIP when states 
have failed to submit a state plan or have submitted defective 
state plans. 

See Southland Terminal Corp. 

v. 

EPA, 

504 F.2d 646, 
669 (1st Cir. 1979). The courts have not required EPA to 
demonstrate explicit authority for promulgating specific control 
measures in FIPs. Instead, EPA may exercise its broad authority 
under section 110(c) unless such authority is expressly 
prohibited under the Act, other statutes, or the United States 
Constitution. EPA's general regulatory authority and its 
authority under section 110(c) include the ability to impose and 
enforce pollution fees. 

See 

42 U.S.C. Sections 110(a)(2)(A); 
172(c)(6). 

Congress has also granted express authority to EPA to set 
emissions standards for certain sources of pollution, such as 
aircraft and new locomotive engines. 

See 

42 U.S.C. Sections 
7547, 7571 (a)(2). In vesting EPA with authority to promulgate 
aircraft emissions standards, Congress recognized the authority 
of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to regulate aircraft 
design and manage the navigable airspace to assure safety and 
efficiency. Sections 231 and 232 of the Act establish a 
cooperative scheme in which EPA is required to consult with FAA 
in setting emissions standards, and FAA is charged with enforcing 
those standards. 42 U.S.C. Sections 7571-7472. The president 
may disapprove any standard after notice and an opportunity for a 
hearing, based upon a finding by the FAA that the standard would 
create a hazard to safety. Additionally, in section 233, 
Congress preempted the states from enacting or enforcing any 
emission standards for aircraft that did not conform to the 
federal standards. 

Id. 

Section 7573. 

EPA's broad powers under section 110(c) provide the legal 
authority for promulgating the control strategy proposed in the 
FIP_an emissions fee system based on a declining performance 
target expressed in per passenger emissions that can be achieved 
through either operational or technological means. EPA is not 
exercising its authority under section 231 to promulgate 
technology forcing emission standards for aircraft engines as the 
control strategy in this FIP. Nevertheless, the proposed control 
strategy maintains cooperative interaction between EPA and FAA 
and recognizes FAA's expertise in aircraft safety and navigation. 
EPA has consulted with FAA in drafting the proposed control 
strategy and will continue to consult and cooperate with FAA in 
finalizing and implementing the control strategy. 

EPA has determined that the proposed control strategy is 
well within the broad scope of powers under section 110(c) and 
that the strategy is not prohibited under any provisions in the 
Act. As explained elsewhere in this preamble, EPA has solid 
legal authority for fee systems to encourage emission reductions. 
Further, EPA believes that the proposed control strategy is not 
prohibited by or in direct conflict with other federal 
regulations and statutes, such as the Airline Deregulation Act of 
1978 (``ADA''), the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 
(``ANCA''), or the Federal Aviation Act, which establishes FAA for 
overseeing aircraft safety, the efficient use of the navigable 
airspace, and the national air transportation system.

The proposed program is designed to ensure that substantial 
emission reductions are achieved by the aviation industry. 
However, the strategy neither establishes a hard and fast 
emissions budget or cap for individual commercial airline 
operators, nor specifies compliance measures. Instead, the 
program relies on environmental performance targets or emissions 
rate goals with fees for excess emissions. The approach leaves 
each operator with the discretion to choose the best compliance 
strategy for achieving environmental goals and satisfying market 
demands. 

A commercial airline may choose to satisfy the emission 
reduction requirements with compliance measures ranging from 
relatively straightforward options to very challenging, more 
difficult approaches. EPA's preliminary analysis suggests that 
the lower end of this range includes such measures as converting 
ground service equipment to cleaner power sources; increased use 
of single engine taxiing; implementing procedural improvements to 
reduce congestion and taxi/idle times; purchasing cleaner, 
current production aircraft; or possibly purchasing emissions 
credits. 

At the upper end of this range, airlines may choose to tow 
aircraft rather than taxi with onboard power; substantially 
improve load factors; pursue the production of new engine designs 
with low-NO

X

 staged-combustion systems which are presently 
nearing production for certain applications; or develop 
additional clean engine technology. An airline which continues 
to have excess emissions after choosing from among these possible 
measures will pay emission fees on its activities. It might then 
choose to limit activity to reduce its total fee liability. 

Concerns have been raised that this strategy may require airlines 
to choose operational measures that, for safety reasons, should be left to 
the discretion of the pilot in command. For example, the FAA has 
advised that the decisions to reduce use of reverse thrust and 
increase use of single-engine taxiing should ultimately be those 
of the pilot. 

Beyond these choices, concerns have been raised that 
compliance with the no-fee emission reduction targets may depend 
on technology-forcing aircraft engine development, and that the 
liability for noncompliance fees may directly or indirectly 
result in a limitation on activity. EPA requests comments on the 
likelihood that, and the point within the range of proposed 
emission reductions (e.g., 30-45 percent for NO

X

) at which, such 
measures as advanced engine development may be required. The 
Agency also seeks comment on the legal and policy implications of 
a strategy that has the potential to create an economic incentive 
for airlines to limit operations at airports in the FIP areas. 
EPA also requests comments on the legal and policy implications 
of the proposed strategy if, after public comment and further 
study the Agency determines that at the upper end of the 
emissions reduction range under consideration, the requirement 
may have the potential to induce airlines to choose between such 
options as encouraging implemention of aircraft operational 
measures that currently are left to pilot discretion for safety 
reasons on the one hand, and limiting the number of operations at 
the airport on the other. Finally, comment is requested on the 
relationship between EPA's legal authority under section 110(c) 
and section 231, should the strategy result in the regulated 
industry having as its only options, outside of activity limits, 
reliance on either technology-forcing aircraft engine advances to 
meet the emission reduction targets, or paying the proposed fees.
 
Regardless of the means by which compliance is achieved, the 
proposed control strategy does not appear to mandate or 
indirectly require an accelerated fleet turnover that would 
potentially conflict with the schedule established under ANCA for 
reducing noise by the end of 1999 (See 49 U.S.C. App. Section 
2157 (a)), because the first FIP controls would not apply until 
2001 and the most stringent controls would not be required until 
2005. The proposed control strategy also appears consistent with 
the statutory requirements and mandate for the FAA under the 
Federal Aviation Act, 49 U.S.C. App. 1348. 

During the drafting of the proposed control strategy, EPA 
considered but rejected requiring the airport proprietor to 
implement and enforce regulation of the commercial airlines. EPA 
rejected this concept and chose for EPA and FAA to implement and 
enforce the proposed strategy because the proprietor has more 
limited authority over the commercial airlines and because the 
courts have held that there are limits on EPA's ability to 
mandate municipal entities to control the behavior of others by 
requiring specific measures. 

See Brown v. EPA, 

521 F.2d 827 (9th 
Cir. 1475), 

vacated on other grounds

, 431 U.S. 99 (1977).

The proposed control strategy treats all commercial airlines identically, and the proposed strategy envisions
compliance by international air carriers as well as domestic airlines. EPA believes that international air carriers
are required to comply with all applicable rules and regulations, including air quality laws. Therefore, EPA is not
proposing to treat foreign air carriers any differently than the domestic commercial airlines, subject to any supervening
requirements in treaty obligations. During the comment period on the proposed control strategy, EPA will be contacting
the Department of Transportation, the Department of State, and other federal agencies to ensure consistencies with
relevant rules, regulations, and agreements. EPA will also explore any additional requirements or flexibility
for the handling of fees collected from foreign carriers. 

(

4

) Ground Access Vehicles Controlled by Other FIP Elements. The proposed control strategy only applies to aircraft
and related emission sources that are under the direct control of commercial air carriers. This is because the other
major sources of emissions operating at airports, such as GAV and stationary sources, are being substantially controlled
under other regulations. Emissions from significant stationary sources are controlled under stationary source
rules implemented by the state and local agencies or the FIP. Emissions from GAV are comprehensively regulated under
state rules and other FIP measures. Also, in conjunction with promulgating the proposed strategy, EPA is recommending
amending provisions in the Airports and Airways Improvement Act (``AAIA''), 49 U.S.C. Section 2210, that limit the
airport proprietor's ability to spend landing fee revenues on projects that reduce GAV emissions through promoting
mass transit or eliminating congestion. 

(

5

) Issues for Specific Comment. EPA requests comment on the desirability of removing the Ventura and Sacramento control
areas from this commercial aircraft control strategy. 

EPA requests comment on whether stationary source emission reduction targets are appropriate for use with the commercial
aircraft control strategy. 

EPA requests comment on the desirability of using a two-year average for establishing a baseline inventory, although
EPA notes that any multi-year average must represent 1990 emissions in some manner consistent with Clean Air Act requirements.


EPA requests comment on the desirability and feasibility of modifying the basin-wide emissions target to lock in
emissions reductions that will result from non-FIP requirements such as the Airport Noise and Capacity Act. 

EPA proposes today to allocate GSE operated by fixed-base operators to specific airlines based on servicing provided
under contract agreements, and requests comment on possible alternatives to such an allocation strategy. 

EPA requests comment on potential alternatives to the ozone-season control period proposed today. 

EPA requests comment on the appropriate schedule of reduction for the seasonal emission cap even though the final
(2005) emission cap would not change. 

EPA requests comment on a triggering mechanism that would prevent implementation of the fee system as long as the area-wide
commercial aircraft emission allowance target is achieved. 

EPA requests comment on what fee levels will achieve the objective of discouraging noncompliance without being excessive.


EPA requests comment on alternative methods for establishing activity factors that may be automatically updated
based on prior-year operational data. 

The airlines have reported using as a ``rule of thumb'' 200 pounds of payload for each passenger, which includes the
weight of the passenger and his or her luggage. EPA requests comment on whether this is an appropriate and equitable
value. 

EPA requests comment on the possible incorporation of an emissions credit program as part of the control strategy
proposed today, and on ways to involve state and local agencies in order to make more trading opportunities available
to the airlines. 

EPA requests comment on the desirability of issuing additional specific technical guidance concerning emissions
calculations for aircraft operations. 

EPA requests comment on the desirability of requiring airlines to submit baseline reports, and on possible alternative
methods for establishing a reasonable baseline emissions inventory. 

EPA requests comment on the current emissions inventory methodology that uses airport-specific average summer
day, mid-morning mixing heights for July and August 1990 as the basis for calculating aircraft climbout and approach
emissions. (The amount of time spent in each of these operational modes depends on the height of the inversion layer.)
Alternatively, a single default mixing height (e.g., 3000 feet above ground level) could be used for all aircraft
operations. This could simplify the calculation procedure, but may not be as representative. 

EPA requests comment on the desirability of requiring airlines to submit compliance plans, and on the information
that should be provided in such plans should they be required. 

EPA requests comment on the desirability of providing exemptions from the requirements of this control program for
certain types of emergency or atypical commercial aircraft operations beyond the control of aircraft operators.


EPA requests comment on the desirability and feasibility of establishing a de minimus exemption for this control
program. 

The Agency requests comment on the legal and policy implications of a strategy that has the potential to create incentives
to limit operations at airports in the FIP areas. 

EPA requests comment on the relationship between EPA's legal authority under sections 110(c) and 231 if the strategy
results in the regulated industry having as a principal option, reliance on technology-forcing aircraft engine
advances to meet the emission reduction targets.

Persons submitting comments on these issues or other 
specific aspects of today's proposal should consider and discuss 
the possible impact of their comments on other elements of the 
control program, particularly when such comments propose 
alternative strategies that would achieve smaller or larger 
emission reductions from commercial aviation. 

(

6

) Aviation Working Group Issues/Concerns To gather information used in preparing today's action, the Agency formed
a working group composed principally of representatives from EPA, FAA, various State and local regulatory authorities,
airport operators, and airlines. The mission of the 
working group was to acquire emission inventory data, assess inventory methodologies, and identify operational
and technological issues regarding potential control strategies.


The proposed environmental performance target/fee control program represents a new and innovative strategy for
aviation. EPA has attempted to address many of the issues and concerns 
raised by the working group members, but recognizes that 
significant issues and differences of opinion remain. In order 
to facilitate public comment on these issues, EPA has requested 
comment on specific topics throughout the description of the 
proposal. Nonetheless, EPA is taking an additional step to 
ensure that concerns raised by the airline industry are fully 
aired as part of this rulemaking. The industry's concerns, as 
submitted by the Airline Transport Association,
 are summarized 
as follows:





 Further regulation of aircraft emissions under the FIP is 
 unnecessary because VOC emissions from aircraft have already 
 been reduced and will continue to decrease substantially 
 through the next decade. Fleet modernization due to market 
 forces and phase out of Stage II aircraft will substantially 
 decrease VOC emissions. 

 Any FIP requirements for aircraft emission reductions would 
 be illegal per section 110(a)(5)(C) of the Clean Air Act. 
 It would also run counter to the jurisdiction of DOT to 
 ensure a safe and efficient air transportation system. 

 Emission reductions required by the FIP would ultimately 
 require limiting the number of flights, which would have a 
 devastating effect on the region's economy. 

 Airlines will be subject to NO

X

 reductions under a 
 regulatory scheme being developed by the International Civil 
 Aviation Organization (ICAO). This international approach 
 is necessary to keep from placing U.S. airlines at a 
 competitive disadvantage in the global marketplace. 

 Any FIP proposal that directly or indirectly affects 
 aircraft operations would unwisely and unlawfully impinge on 
 the control of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
 over the safety and efficiency of airport operations. The 
 pilot in command is the final authority as to the operation 
 of the aircraft. Measures such as single engine taxiing, 
 derated takeoffs, and limiting use of reverse thrust on 
 landing may pose safety hazards. 

 EPA has no authority to prescribe a bubble to control 
 airport or airline emissions. Proposal of an airline or 
 airport-wide emissions cap would require either operational 
 changes that raise serious safety and efficiency concerns or 
 a reduction in the number of flights. These would violate 
 either the Federal Aviation Act, FAA regulations or the 
 Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. 

 Airport proprietors are preempted from exerting operational 
 controls with regard to aircraft and airlines. 

 Use of a bubble would be unworkable, since neither EPA nor 
 airport proprietors have the expertise or the resources to 
 supervise and enforce restrictions on the hundreds of 
 businesses and operations that are potential emission 
 sources at an airport. 

 Control of domestic aircraft emissions under the FIP would 
 discriminate unfairly against U.S. air carriers. Foreign 
 carriers, military and general aviation must be subject to 
 the same controls as commercial domestic carriers. 

 Any emissions decreases from the closure or realignment of 
 military airfields must be credited to the aviation sector 
 as a whole. 

 Although the Clean Air Act requires EPA to use a 1990 
 baseline for determining overall emission reduction goals 
 for the FIP, EPA should allow the use of other years for 
 particular sources. A 1987 baseline year for aircraft would 
 be more equitable, because individual airlines have been 
 voluntarily reducing their VOC emissions since that date by 
 phasing in quieter and cleaner engines. 

 As an alternative to allowing an earlier baseline year, the 
 rule might provide that the benefit of percentage reductions 
 by those industries that have made the least pre-1990 
 emission reductions be shared with industries that made the 
 most pre-1990 progress. 

 ATA questions the authority of EPA to regulate airline 
 ground service equipment (GSE) emissions. 

 The airline industry maintains that EPA has unfairly focused 
 on airline GSE regulation, while ignoring similar off-road 
 vehicles used by other industries. 

 The airline industry has provided evidence that GSE 
 emissions amount to nearly 40 percent of airline-controlled 
 emissions, in contrast to the substantially lower percentage 
 estimated by EPA. Thus, there may be much greater 
 opportunity for emission reductions from GSE than EPA has 
 previously contemplated. 

 To the extent that GSE emission regulation is permissible, 
 EPA should develop a reasonable phase-in schedule for such 
 regulations to allow for the development of appropriate 
 controls and to work through the associated technical 
 problems. 

The Agency requests comments on the concerns and issues 
raised by the airline industry.

(c) Military Aviation. (

1

) Overview. (

a

) Military Air Base Operations. Military air bases are defined for the purpose of this proposal as facilities owned
and operated by the Department of Defense with the primary mission of aircraft operation. Aircraft operation emissions,
defined here as emissions from aircraft themselves, dominate total emissions at a military air base. Like commercial
airports, ground support equipment and ground access vehicles also contribute to a military air base's total emissions.
Mobile source-related emissions from these ``other base operations'' sources have never been fully inventoried.
EPA has established a working group in conjunction with the Department of Defense (DOD) to compile and assess complete
emission profiles for all air bases. The information that is currently available is contained in the Technical Support
Document, which is available in the rulemaking docket for today's proposal. 
 


Table F lists the military installations in the control areas where aircraft activity has been identified, ranging
from active air bases with intensive activity, to bases with only minimal transient operations. The South Coast Air
Basin contains most of the installations. As an example of their significance in FIP areas, emissions from military
aircraft operations in the 
South Coast air basin currently are about 20 percent of those generated by commercial aircraft operations, or about
0.3 percent of the total South Coast Air basin's 1990 baseline emissions inventory based on current inventory data.





 A military air base usually has specific aircraft based on-site; the operational characteristics for these aircraft
can vary widely depending on the specific mission requirements for the based unit or units. Transient operations
resulting from military aircraft based elsewhere can comprise a significant portion of a military air base's total
aircraft operations, 
depending on specific military requirements, but most of these transient operations are unscheduled and difficult
to characterize. The military aircraft fleet experiences relatively slow turnover; aircraft remain in service
for many years, and new airframe designs enter the fleet at a relatively slow pace. 
 


The ongoing base closure and realignment process introduces an important element into the process of developing
a control strategy for military aircraft operations. The Secretary of Defense and the Defense Base Closure and Realignment
Commission have recommended a series of defense base closures across the nation, including the FIP areas, as well
as a concurrent sequence 
of ``realignment'' actions with shifts in the location and intensity of military activity. The closure of several
air bases within the control areas represents the more significant impact on the control strategies described here.
Of the seven military air installations located in the South Coast area, three are scheduled for closure and one will
be realigned. Aircraft 
operations at the realigned installation are expected to decrease. (See the table below for the air bases recommended
for closure.) As a result of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process, emissions from military aircraft will
be significantly reduced by the year 2000. For example, emissions of VOC and NO

X

 will decline by at least 50 percent in the South Coast control area as a result of air base closures, according to current
information. (See the Technical Support Document for further discussion.) 
 


Certain bases are slated for re-use by civilian entities following closure; this re-use may include aircraft activity.
Some of any such activity may represent relocation of current or future growth in civilian aviation from other airports
in the respective air basins; some may be activity which would not have occurred in that basin but for the availability
of the closed base.

) Control Strategy. As with commercial operations, the EPA examined various options for reducing total emissions
from military aircraft 
operations and other base operations. These options included: (1) exempting military aircraft operations from
FIP requirements while maintaining a cap on all other mobile source emissions from other base operations at military
air stations; (2) an absolute cap on total emissions (including aircraft) under the direct control of the Department
of Defense; and (3) a target based 
program using an allowable emission rate and a fee for excess emissions above this rate, like that proposed for commercial
airports. 
 

EPA proposes the first of these three options. EPA is proposing to exclude military aircraft operations from FIP requirements
for national security reasons, as explained in more detail below. Applying restrictions on military aircraft operations
will inevitably degrade training and combat readiness. 
Restrictions would impair the ability of the Department of Defense to perform assigned missions (including humanitarian
and natural disaster relief, surveillance, and logistic support). 
 


The options available for reducing emissions from military aircraft without requiring a significant decrease in
the number of aircraft operations are minimal. Military aircraft are designed to specific mission requirements
including power, maneuver, lift, and load. Application of control technologies to existing aircraft would degrade
characteristics inherent in military aircraft design. Arbitrary reductions in aircraft operations that may be
required to meet the second or third alternative control strategies listed above may be inconsistent with training
and operational requirements necessary for national security. In selecting this proposal to exempt military aircraft

operations from the FIP requirements, EPA has considered the approved base closings within California which will
provide significant reductions in current emissions from stationary, aircraft and other mobile sources under the
direct control of the Department of Defense. One consequence of these closures is that the reductions in operations
least harmful to military readiness have already been made. The incremental risk to readiness of further reductions
in operations is therefore that much more. 
 

The DOD established an internal FIP working group in December 1992 to examine the problems associated with potential
FIP strategies, identify impacts to military operations and readiness, and collect data from military installations
in the FIP areas. Several concerns have been identified. The principal concern is that although military aircraft
operations contribute 
a very small portion of the total area-wide emissions, they would be severely restricted within an emissions cap.
On military air installations, the predominant source of mobile emissions is aircraft and aircraft support operations.
Severe restrictions will inevitably degrade training and combat readiness necessary to minimize the risks associated
with military aviation. An emission cap or reduction in training operations may impair the ability to perform assigned
national missions (including humanitarian relief, surveillance and logistics support). The options available
for reducing mobile source emissions from military air stations without requiring a decrease in aircraft operations
are minimal. 


 Another issue is the limited ability for DOD to transfer aircraft to military air stations outside the FIP areas. To
move a specific aircraft type requires that the receiving installation have the necessary infrastructure to accommodate
that particular aircraft type. Additionally, permanent moves of military assets and personnel are also not fully
at the discretion of the 
military. Any significant base closure action or realignment that meets certain thresholds requires that the action
be presented to the BRAC Commission and subsequently be presented to Congress.

Based on the impact the second and third possible FIP 
control strategies (listed above) would have on military 
readiness, and the already scheduled decrease in military 
aircraft operations, EPA proposes that military aircraft be 
exempt from the FIP. EPA requests comments on excluding military 
aircraft from the FIP control strategy. 

The proposed FIP program will control mobile source 
emissions from other base operations under the control of DOD. 
These sources include APUs, GSE, captive vehicle fleets, 
privately-owned vehicles, and any other mobile sources operated 
within an air base's boundaries. The military bubble also will 
include DOD-controlled non-aircraft emissions sources that 
operate at locations other than military bases, such as ground 
equipment based at civilian airports. The bubble will be 
basin-wide rather than air base-specific, given the variability 
introduced by base closure and realignment activities, as well as 
the need for operational flexibility. 

EPA proposes to impose a declining cap on total emissions 
for controlling these other base operations emissions from all 
air bases within each FIP area. This avoids the difficulty of 
having to allocate baseline emissions among multiple entities (e. 
g., perhaps down to individual air bases). This approach also 
takes advantage of the military's centralized command structure; 
DOD (or each branch of the armed forces) can mandate air base 
performance at a certain emissions level (excluding aircraft 
emissions) commensurate with environmental objectives while 
maintaining the flexibility to stage specific missions and other 
functions among various bases inside or outside of the basin. 
This control strategy provides individual base commanders with 
the flexibility to implement specific operational and procedural 
measures necessary to achieve the specified emissions goal, and 
avoids having EPA attempt to implement specific control measures 
for military operations. The centralized command structure means 
that a single entity is the focus of the control strategy. 

An absolute emissions cap approach does not require a 
projection of activity in future years, one of the required 
assumptions for a program based on allowable emissions per 
activity unit. Finally, a control strategy that fundamentally 
relies upon the environmental efficiency of operations, such as 
the emission rate-based program proposed for commercial aircraft, 
appears less desirable for military air bases given the inherent 
unpredictability of military operations. 

EPA also seeks comments on the second alternative approach, 
to establish a declining cap for an emissions bubble which 
includes military aircraft emissions and therefore requires 
reductions in aircraft emissions also. Further, comments are 
requested on the desirability of the third possible control 
approach, an approach that includes aircraft emissions but is 
based on a target average emission rate per aircraft operation 
with a fee for emissions above the target. This third approach 
would be similar to that being proposed today for commercial 
aviation.

With respect to the second and third possible control 
approaches, several additional issues have been identified if 
military aircraft operations are included within the scope of a 
bubble program. EPA requests comment on the following issues. 
If emissions from aircraft are included, a fee system based 
on an emission rate target (i.e., the third approach), consistent 
with the proposed strategy for commercial airlines, or a 
variation of the second approach but with a fee for emissions in 
excess of the cap, may be more equitable and desirable than an 
absolute emissions cap that applies uniquely to military 
aviation. Emissions that exceed the emissions target would be 
subject to emission fees instead of an enforcement-related fine 
or penalty. The emission target would apply to air emissions 
only during the ozone season in each FIP area. The method of 
determining the excess emissions and the resulting fee would be 
addressed in subsequent rulemaking. 
Another issue identified involves the method of allotting 
the emission caps or emission rate targets by the EPA. To be 
most effective, the DOD Working Group recommends that any caps on 
total emissions, targets for total emissions, or emission rate 
targets which include aircraft emissions be allocated to the 
individual Military Departments. Each Military Department will 
be responsible for attaining the target for installations under 
its control. This system is consistent with existing DOD command 
structure and can be readily implemented. Trading between 
Military Departments and between installations is proposed. Trading is applicable only to installations within
the same FIP 
area. 
To reduce the potential impact on aircraft operations of an 
emissions cap or emission rate target which includes aircraft 
emissions, the DOD working group identified as essential the 
ability to trade excess emission reductions between stationary 
and mobile sources. Maximum flexibility and minimal operational 
impacts can be achieved by allowing trading between stationary 
and mobile sources, in addition to trading between all types of 
military installations within the same FIP area. In other words, 
major reductions or elimination of a stationary source may allow 
continued essential flight operations. EPA acknowledges this 
concern and supports such trading programs as created by State 
and local governments as discussed elsewhere in today's proposal. 
Of particular concern to the Navy with respect to the second 
and third options identified above is the inclusion of Naval 
Auxiliary Landing Field San Clemente Island (SCI) in the list of 
military air installations regulated by the FIP. SCI is an 
isolated and remote area, with few emissions sources, either 
mobile or stationary, other than aircraft. The impact on 
aircraft operations will be substantial, as almost the entire 
amount of required reductions will have to be a result of 
decreased aircraft operations. SCI is the primary training 
location for Navy pilots prior to carrier deployment. This 
training is vital and represents a significant military readiness 
issue. SCI is located 55 miles southwest of Long Beach. Meteorological data indicates that SCI emissions do not impact

the South Coast Air Basin, and at best the contribution of air 
emissions from SCI to the South Coast air quality is not well 
defined. Consistent with EPA's request for comment on exempting 
Sacramento and Ventura areas from the FIP commercial airport 
requirements, EPA also requests comments on exempting emissions 
from on or near San Clemente Island from the FIP control 
strategy, if aircraft are ultimately included in the final rule. 
The proposed emission reduction requirements under a bubble 
concept for military air bases_regardless of whether it 
includes aircraft emissions_would be generally consistent with 
the emission cap requirements for stationary sources in the FIP 
areas. Although not firmly decided, the current stationary 
source control strategy for the South Coast requires that VOC and 
NO

X

 emissions be reduced by 20-45 and 30-45 percent, 
respectively, from the 1990 baseline inventory by 2005, through a 
series of uniform annual reductions of baseline emissions of each 
pollutant: 4-9 percent per year for VOC and 6-9 percent per year 
for NO

X

, both starting in 2001. Stationary source requirements 
for the 2006-2010 period have not been established at this time. 
Until modified in a future rulemaking, the 2005 cap will apply 
through 2010. 
The requirements for Ventura from 2001-2005 are identical to 
that for the South Coast. For Sacramento, the strategy requires 
a VOC reduction of 20-45 percent, with uniform annual reduction 
of 4-9 percent. The timeframe for achieving this reduction is 
the same as for the South Coast and Ventura areas.

For this proposal the overall reduction targets are 
expressed as a range of percentages; EPA anticipates establishing 
a specific percentage reduction target in the final rule. EPA 
requests comment on whether these stationary source emission 
reduction targets are appropriate for use with the military air 
base control strategy. 
A military air base can utilize any of a variety of emission 
reduction options, at the discretion of the Department of Defense 
and the base commander, to meet the annual emissions target. For 
example, reductions in ground equipment could be obtained through 
GSE electrification and restrictions on ground traffic within 
base boundaries. If the final rule does include emissions from 
military aircraft, a base commander may choose to restrict 
aircraft taxi procedures, perhaps by mandating specific direct 
routes to and from runways, or by towing aircraft into takeoff 
position; certain training procedures could be altered to 
minimize the frequency of high-emission operating modes within 
the basin mixing zone. 
(

c

) Geographic Scope. The control program for military air bases will cover the 
three FIP areas: South Coast, Ventura, and Sacramento Air 
Basins. The Agency requests comments on the need to control air 
base emissions in each area based on air quality effects or 
equity considerations. In particular, EPA requests comments on 
exempting emissions from on or near San Clemente Island from the 
FIP control strategy, if aircraft are ultimately included in the 
final rule. 
(

d

) Control Period. EPA proposes to control military air base emissions only 
during the ozone season in each FIP area. Further, EPA proposes 
to require compliance with the program based on the season-long 
average of emissions. As already described, such operations may 
be highly variable. Although this variability tends to argue for 
a shorter compliance (e.g., a monthly period as in the stationary 
cap program), the longer period seems preferable to provide 
military commanders with the flexibility to conduct operations as 
necessary. EPA requests comment on the desirability of the 
seasonal compliance demonstration versus shorter periods. 
(

2

) Key Regulatory Elements. (

a

) Summary. EPA proposes to specify in the final FIP a linear declining 
cap on total mobile source emissions from military air bases in 
each FIP area, excluding emissions from aircraft themselves. 
This declining cap will be designed to achieve the emissions 
reduction targets for each area as described under ``Control 
Strategy.'' Military air bases will submit a baseline emissions 
report and annual compliance determination reports similar to 
those required for commercial airlines as discussed previously. 
Military air bases are defined for the purpose of this proposal 
as facilities owned and operated by the Department of Defense 
with a primary mission of aircraft operation. The Department of 
Defense also will be responsible for submitting baseline 
emissions reports and annual compliance reports for military 
operations that occur at civilian facilities in the control area. 
(

b

) Baseline Inventory and Emission Caps. EPA currently does not have sufficient data for all subject 
emission sources included in the proposed military air base 
control program to establish a reasonable baseline inventory. 
EPA, therefore, will require each military air base in the 
control area to calculate and report total subject emissions for 
the baseline year of 1990 within 180 days following finalization 
of this rule. Information to be included in the baseline report 
is described in ``Reporting and Recordkeeping'' below. The 
military bubble will be the sum of emission inventories from all 
air bases in the basin. 
EPA requests comment on the desirability of using an 
alternative baseline scheme, given the variability introduced by 
operations related to Desert Shield/Desert Storm during 1990. 
One alternative could be to require air bases to submit data for 
1989 and 1990 so that a two-year average inventory can be 
calculated. The DOD working group recommended that installations 
have the option of identifying the baseline year, between the 
years 1989 and 1992, which resulted in the most representative 
total emissions. The DOD working group also requested a one time 
adjustment of the baseline inventory be allowed, based on actual 
inventory data, once the FIP requirements are in effect. The one 
time adjustment could help eliminate errors based on assumptions 
and estimates used in developing the baseline.

EPA will establish in a subsequent rulemaking action a series of declining seasonal emissions allowances for NO

X

 and VOC as described above using the modified baseline emissions inventory. Both the baseline inventory and the seasonal
targets will be expressed as allowable tons of pollutant emitted on average per day during the control period.  

An additional concern regards the requirement for baseline inventories for installations that are closing. The
DOD working group further recommended that inventories not be required for bases closing before 2000. Emission sources
are already being phased out and there would be no benefit derived from funding such inventories in terms of helping
to design emission control strategies for those bases. On the other hand, the estimates of emissions eliminated by
base closures will affect the effective stringency of a declining cap program if the baseline for the cap was prior
to closure since there will be credit for base closings. 

(

c

) Averaging and Trading. EPA proposes to determine compliance for military air base operations by averaging emissions
across the control area, rather than establishing specific seasonal emission limits for individual air bases. Such
a control strategy would provide the military with the flexibility to transfer operations between air bases as needed
to meet realignment requirements or other specific mission needs, as long as the overall emissions reduction target
is met. Alternatively, the Agency could establish seasonal emission allowances for each military air base in the
control area. EPA requests comment on the desirability of using area-wide averaging to determine military compliance,
and on possible alternative compliance determination schemes.  

The Agency also requests comment on the inclusion of military air base operations in any civilian emission credit
trading scheme if such a program is established by a local government. Such an expansion could provide the Department
of Defense with additional incentive to implement emission reduction measures that generate tradable credits,
or provide a mechanism for obtaining credits from other sources to ensure compliance should unforeseen difficulties
arise. (See the discussion of averaging and trading for commercial aviation for more detail of this topic.)  

Several of the military air installations in the FIP areas have already been identified for closure (Table F), and
military operations will cease at the identified bases prior to the year 2000. These reductions do not even consider
BRAC 95 which could result in further reductions. The DOD Working Group recommends that any emission reductions resulting
from closure or realignment should be credited to the Military Department. These credits would then be available
for transfer by the Military Department as part of the President's five point plan for community redevelopment at
closing bases and/or to meet service Department needs within the specific FIP areas. 

(

d

) Annual Compliance Determination. Beginning in 1999, military air bases will be required to submit annual emissions
reports as described below. The total military emissions inventory from subject mobile sources at all air bases in
the area will be compared to the given year's seasonal emissions target to determine compliance with the FIP requirements.


(

e

) Reporting and recordkeeping. (i) Compliance Plans. The stationary source cap program includes a requirement for
affected sources to submit compliance plans that describe planned emission reduction measures. EPA could establish
a similar requirement for military air bases as part of today's proposed control strategy. Such compliance plans
would be submitted by Department of Defense in advance of the control period and would describe in some detail the various
emission reduction measures planned for air base operations in the control areas.  

Compliance plans would impose a significant administrative burden on EPA and the Department of Defense, however.
EPA therefore requests comment on the desirability of requiring compliance plans, and on the information that should
be provided should they be required. EPA does not contemplate that these plans, if required, would legally bind the
military, since that would impede flexibility and is not essential to the effectiveness of the program. However,
any deliberate misrepresentation in the compliance plan may be made a violation of the FIP.

(ii) Baseline Reports. As discussed above, EPA currently does not have sufficient information to establish a reasonable
baseline military air base emissions inventory from which annual emission targets can be developed. EPA therefore
will require military air bases to collect and report data concerning both aircraft operations and other air base
operations in the baseline year of 1990, or alternative years as discussed in ``Baseline Inventory and Emission Caps''
above. These reports will be submitted to EPA no later than 180 days following finalization of this rule. These reports
would be used by EPA to calculate the military's air base emissions baseline; seasonal emission targets will be established
in a subsequent rulemaking action as a series of reductions from this baseline.  

These baseline reports will include, but may not be limited to, the following information to be provided by each military
air base: 

 Aircraft type and model, engine type and model, and number  of landing/take-off operations (LTOs) 

 Times in mode by engine for each flight 

 Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) operating time 

 Ground Support Equipment (GSE) population by type 

 GSE activity by fuel type, engine size, and annual use hours 

 All other off-highway equipment activity by fuel type,  engine size, and annual use hours 

 Vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by highway certified vehicles  (federal owned, contract personnel, privately
owned, etc.)  operated within air base boundaries  

Although EPA is not proposing to include aircraft emissions in the FIP program, aircraft emissions are included in
the above list of reporting items. EPA believes that information on aircraft operations and emissions will allow
it to better review the submitted information on emissions from other sources. Comment is requested on the necessity
and usefulness of this information to EPA
s implementation of the FIP and to local air quality planning activities.  

EPA recognizes that detailed information may not be available in each of these categories for 1990. In these instances
military air bases may report estimated data; such estimates would be accompanied by a description of the estimation
methodology used, including any supporting data. The Department of Defense will be required to identify a reporting
entity for military operations at civilian airports; EPA also requests comment on alternative schemes for tracking
and reporting such activity. 

(iii) Annual Compliance Determination Reports. Beginning with a report describing activity during 1999, the FIP
will require military air bases to submit annual reports within 60 days of the close of each calendar year. These reports
will include information on emissions for that year's ozone season, as described below. EPA will use these reports
to determine the military's compliance with the seasonal emissions targets. Initiating these annual reports in
1999 will provide the Department of Defense and EPA with an opportunity to assess data gathering and analysis requirements
well in advance of the first emissions target in 2001, as well as providing the DOD with important information on its
performance needs prior to the first round of required reductions. Failure to submit annual emissions reports will
be subject to EPA enforcement.  

Annual emissions reports will include the following information: 

 Aircraft type and model for each flight during the ozone  season 

 Engine type and model for each affected flight 

 Times in mode by engine for each affected flight 

 Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) operating time during the ozone  season 

 Ground Support Equipment (GSE) population by type 

 GSE activity by fuel type, engine size, and seasonal use  hours 

 All other off-highway equipment activity by fuel type,  engine size, and seasonal use hours 

 VMT by highway certified vehicles operating within air base  boundaries during the ozone season  

Military air bases will be required to track and report actual data for the above information categories. Default
values will not be accepted for the purposes of determining annual compliance with the military's emissions target.
As with baseline reports, the Department of Defense will be required to identify a reporting entity for military aircraft
operations at civilian airports; EPA also requests comment on alternative schemes for tracking and reporting such
activity.  

Military air bases will be required to calculate their total hydrocarbon and NO

X

 emissions for the report year's ozone season using the above data and enter these emissions on the report form. Emission
calculation methodology will be taken from existing EPA-approved documents. EPA also requests comment on the desirability
of issuing additional specific technical guidance concerning emissions calculations for military aircraft operations.


(

f

) Exemptions. EPA requests comment on the desirability of providing exemptions from the requirements of this control
program for certain types of military air base operations. For example, emissions resulting from actions in response
to emergencies, such as those that support operations of the United States forces introduced into hostilities, introduced
into situations where involvement in hostilities is indicated, actions to resolve in-flight emergencies, or rendering
emergency humanitarian or natural disaster relief should be exempt from reporting requirements and not count towards
the military's environmental performance. Other actions which should also be included in this category are those
to extinguish wildfires and immediate responses to the release or discharge of oil or hazardous material in accordance
with approved Spill Prevention and Response Plans or Spill Contingency Plans. In addition, certain small military
facilities with only minimal aircraft activity might be unnecessarily burdened under this program relative to the
emissions reductions that might be obtained. Therefore, EPA requests comment on the desirability and feasibility
of establishing a de minimis exemption for this control program. 

(

3

) Legal Authority. Section 118 of the Act requires all federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, to comply
with rules and regulations promulgated under the Act in the same manner and to the same extent as non-governmental
agencies. 42 U.S.C. Section 7418. 

(

4

) Issues for Specific Comment. EPA requests comment on the proposed exemption of military aircraft from FIP requirements
on the basis of national security considerations, and on the alternative proposals described in this section.  

EPA requests comment on whether stationary source emission reduction targets are appropriate for use with a military
control strategy.  

EPA requests comment on the manner in which non-Department of Defense government-operated aircraft emission sources
should be included in this FIP control strategy. EPA requests comment on the desirability of exempting such sources
from the requirements of the control program.

(d) General Aviation. (

1

) Source Description. The general aviation category consists of privately-owned 
aircraft operated under FAA Parts 91, 133, or 137. As such, it 
encompasses aircraft types with a variety of different engines, 
including piston, turboprop, and turbine. It also includes both 
fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft. Most general aviation 
aircraft are owned and operated by private individuals. Other 
aircraft are owned and operated by businesses. Much of the 
general aviation fleet is old, with few significant technological 
improvements in emissions performance expected in the foreseeable 
future. 
 General aviation aircraft operate at a variety of facilities 
in the control areas, ranging from large commercial airports to 
small privately-owned airstrips and helipads. The table below 
(``Civil Airports in FIP Areas'') lists the civil airfields in the 
control areas, based on information provided by the FAA and 
discussed in the Technical Support Document. In addition to 
these civil airfields, FAA data for 1991 lists 198 helipads in 
the South Coast control area, 3 helipads in the Sacramento 
control area, and 12 helipads in the Ventura control area; this 
includes private helipads, medical facilities, and various local 
government facilities.

Much less specific information is available concerning the 
emissions resulting from general aviation activity than is 
available for commercial and military aircraft operations. The 
FAA collects some information on general aviation operations at 
airports with FAA-operated (or contractor-operated) control 
towers, but these data are not comprehensive, and do not capture 
operations occurring at non-tower-controlled facilities. In 
particular, the lack of data specifically addressing general 
aviation operations by type of aircraft makes an accurate 
assessment of the emissions from this source more difficult. 
(

2

) Overall Control Strategy. Although general aviation operations represent a small 
fraction of total emissions in most FIP areas, EPA is proposing 
to include this source in the FIP control strategy along with 
commercial and military aircraft operations as part of the broad, 
comprehensive control scheme for these areas. As described 
below, developing an effective comprehensive control strategy for 
this source, and effectively administering it, is an especially 
challenging task due to the diverse aircraft types and usage, the 
great number of individual owners/operators, and the large number 
of airfields in each most FIP areas. Nonetheless, if this source 
were excluded from the FIP, the potential reductions from this 
category would have to be achieved from another source. 
Today's proposal would establish an operations fee to reduce 
the emissions from general aviation activity during the ozone 
season in each FIP area. The Agency intends that the proposed 
approach provide the same level of benefits as the emission cap 
requirements for stationary sources in each of the FIP areas. 
(See section III.D.4.e.(2)(a)(

4

), above, for the specific 
percentage reductions.) Comments are also requested on three 
alternative control schemes. EPA has chosen not to apply a 
comprehensive emission cap to this source because the significant 
data requirements and level of EPA involvement in such a program 
make that strategy impractical. 
In developing the proposed strategy, EPA notes that there 
appear to be few, if any, regulatory options for innovatively 
reducing emissions from general aviation aircraft, given the age 
and emissions performance of the general aviation fleet, and the 
economic status of the general aviation industry. Unlike many 
other sources, improving the emissions performance of these 
aircraft through new, industry-wide emission standards is 
problematic. Even if cleaner engines could be made available, 
the general aviation fleet is unlikely to experience significant 
introduction of cleaner alternatives, since fleet turnover is 
relatively low (sales of general aviation aircraft in fact have 
declined in the past several years). 
This is not to suggest that emission benefits are 
unavailable through the careful selection of aircraft/engine 
combinations or the possible limited introduction of new models 
in the future. Rather, there are no substantially cleaner 
alternatives to current technology engines for the vast majority 
of the fleet. Therefore, the strategies that rely on turnover 
to cleaner technologies are unavailable in this instance. 
Operational and procedural measures such as reduced-power 
takeoffs and direct routing from hardstand to runway also would 
be difficult to implement for general aviation on an area-wide 
basis, given the widely varying aircraft and facility 
characteristics found amongst general aviation operations. These 
measures also offer little opportunity for emission reduction, 
due to minimal congestion at most general aviation airports, 
short taxi distances, and relatively low power-range engines. As 
a result, the only available measures that would provide 
significant emission benefits appear to involve activity 
reductions. 
The diverse and diffuse nature of general aviation 
operations creates significant obstacles for any emission control 
program. General aviation aircraft and the facilities at which 
they operate are controlled by a large and varied group of 
individuals and organizations. General aviation operations 
typically occur on a highly variable schedule and many operations 
can occur at completely uncontrolled airports. Despite these 
difficulties, EPA believes that an emission reduction program for 
general aviation could be implemented. The specific proposed 
control measures and alternatives discussed below reflect varying 
degrees of direct EPA involvement and participation by the 
general aviation community, with resultant variation in the 
certainty of obtaining emissions reductions. 
The control strategy applies to general aviation aircraft 
operated at commercial airports as well as those operated at 
public and private general aviation facilities. It does not 
apply to civilian general aviation aircraft operations at 
military bases; these are included in the military control 
strategy described above. 
Comments are specifically requested on the need to control 
emissions from general aviation in each area based on local air 
quality concerns, given the potential difficulty and likely 
resource-intensive nature of administering an effective program.

) Key Regulatory Elements. The EPA proposes an operations fee program to reduce 
emissions from general aviation activity. By implementing a fee 
system, EPA can avoid establishing direct allocation of landing 
slots for general aviation as discussed later in this section, 
thereby maintaining the flexibility that is desirable for general 
aviation operations.

EPA specifically proposes two options for an operations fee 
program. The first option implements a takeoff fee for all 
general aviation operations in the affected areas. Conceptually, 
the fee would be high enough to limit general aviation activity 
without making such activity prohibitively expensive. The second 
program option also implements a takeoff fee for all general 
aviation activity in these areas, but would incorporate a 
lifetime fee exemption for engines/aircraft meeting ``clean'' 
emission levels. For example, aircraft engines with emissions 
comparable to the levels originally required by EPA in 1973 (38 
FR 19088), but subsequently withdrawn, would be deemed ``clean'' 
for the purpose of this program and would receive a lifetime 
exemption from any FIP general aviation takeoff fees. Certified 
engines/aircraft would be identified by a certificate or decal. 
As with commercial aircraft, EPA proposes an initial fee 
based on $10,000 per ton of pollutant, and will commit in the 
final FIP to review the effect of this fee and adjust it upwards 
if necessary to achieve the target emission reductions. 
Emissions per LTO based on a representative fleet of general 
aviation aircraft are:




VOC_0.394 pounds per LTO 
NO

X

_0.065 pounds per LTO

 

On this basis the takeoff fee can be calculated as follows:

 

($10,000/ton) x (0.394 lbs/LTO) divided by 2,000 lbs/ton=$1.97/LTO for VOC 
($10,000/ton) x (0.065 lbs/LTO) divided by 2,000 lbs/ton=$0.325/LTO for NO

X



 

The total fee thus would be $2.30 per LTO. In light of this 
low dollar amount, and since EPA would plan in any case to adjust 
the fee upward to get the desired effect, the Agency requests 
comments on whether it is reasonable to depart from the $10,000 
per ton level generally being used for all proposed fee systems 
in this NPRM, and start with a higher fee in the final rule for 
general aviation. 
The Agency also requests comment on differentiating the fee 
to reflect the varying pollution potential of different aircraft 
(e.g., single- versus twin-engined and piston versus turbine 
powered). As a further differentiation, EPA requests comment on 
a variable fee structure for specific airports where other 
emission reduction schemes have been implemented by the airport 
proprietor beyond those required by the FIP or other regulations. 
This would encourage control measures such as vapor recovery. 
A takeoff fee would be assessed by selling one-time takeoff 
permits. The program would be administered and ultimately 
enforced by EPA, presumably at each airport. Denial of takeoff 
permission is the most practical means of enforcement for most 
general aviation applications, given the number of individual 
pilots that would be involved in such a program. The Agency is 
consulting with the FAA in this regard, and requests comments on 
the legal authority for and practical consequences of enlisting 
FAA assistance in this program. At uncontrolled public and 
private airports, proprietors or owners may be able to refuse 
services such as tie-down facilities or refueling to noncomplying 
aircraft. Otherwise, EPA would have to have a presence or a 
credible prospect of enforcement against noncomplying pilots in 
order to enforce the program. 
In order to accurately track and help enforce the proposed 
fee program, EPA will require owners or operators of civil 
airports in the control areas with general aviation activity to 
obtain a general aviation operations certificate and submit 
seasonal aircraft activity reports during the ozone season. This 
will provide EPA with the information necessary to verify that 
general aviation emission reductions are occurring as intended. 
Military air bases with general aviation activity will not be 
subject to these requirements, since such activity will be 
included in an air base's environmental performance evaluation as 
described in section III.D.4.e.(2)(c) above. 
All civilian airports in the control areas with general 
aviation activity will be required to obtain a general aviation 
operation certificate no later than December 31, 2000. 
Applications for these certificates will be submitted to EPA by 
March 20, 2000 and will include the following information: 
 Airport name 
 Airport location, including latitude and longitude

 Number of general aviation operations in 1999

 Number of general aviation aircraft based at the airport

 Services provided at the airport

This information will provide EPA with a measure of current activity levels, which in turn will be used to evaluate
the effectiveness of the emission reduction program that is implemented. Beginning January 1, 2001, airports with
general aviation activity in the absence of a certificate will be subject to EPA enforcement.

Beginning with the 2001 ozone season, civil airports will be required to submit seasonal activity reports during
the ozone season on general aviation activity. These reports will include the following information:

 Airport name as indicated on the General Aviation Operation  Certificate

 Total number of general aviation operations for the reported  season

 For each general aviation operation during the reported  season, the aircraft's FAA registration number (``N''
number)

These reports will be submitted to EPA no later than the 60 days following end of the ozone season, and will be used to
track the effectiveness of the activity reduction program that is implemented. Airports with general aviation activity
during the control period that fail to submit reports will be subject to EPA enforcement.

The Agency recognizes the potentially burdensome nature of the above comprehensive reporting and recordkeeping
scheme, and requests comment on the desirability and need for such a program element.

EPA is also interested in receiving comment on the desirability of providing exemptions from the requirements of
this control program for certain types of general aviation aircraft operations. General aviation activity at non-tower
controlled facilities could be exempted from this program; such activity likely represents only a small fraction
of total general aviation activity and would be difficult to control under any of the programs discussed today, relative
to the limited emissions benefits likely to result from such control. In addition, atypical aircraft operations
beyond the control of a general aviation aircraft operator, such as emergency operations, could be exempted from
the requirements of this control program.

The Agency also requests comments on three alternative concepts for reducing emissions from this source. Under the
first alternative, EPA would implement a slot program for general aviation operations in the control areas. Such
a program would require EPA to develop a baseline general aviation activity inventory and a series of declining activity
targets designed to achieve emission reduction targets for each control area. The declining activity targets would
be expressed as a number of allowable operations during an ozone season.

Operation ``slots'' would be distributed to the general aviation community; perhaps through an annual auction.
General aviation operations that occur during the ozone season without an approved slot would be subject to enforcement.
The program would require registration with EPA for each facility where general aviation operations occur, so that
EPA can establish and track an accurate general aviation activity inventory. A slot program provides a great deal
of certainty that emission reductions are taking place, but at the expense of an extensive administrative burden
imposed on the general aviation community and the government.

Under the second alternative, EPA would establish an environmental surcharge on the sale of aviation fuel distributed
to facilities that service and refuel general aviation aircraft. This surcharge would be set at a rate high enough
to reduce general aviation activity without making such activity prohibitively expensive. The assumption in this
case is that declining fuel use on the part of the general aviation community represents declining operations with
resultant emissions reductions.

Airport proprietors could be responsible for collecting this surcharge each time that a general aviation aircraft
refuels; alternatively, those parties supplying aviation fuel to general aviation facilities could collect the
surcharge upon delivery of fuel to the facility. In either case, the surcharge would be remitted to the federal government
on a regular basis along with a report detailing fuel use during the reporting period. Fuel costs are small relative
to the total costs of owning and operating a general aviation aircraft. As a result, the effect of an environmental
fuel surcharge is uncertain and the fee may need be quite large relative to the present cost of fuel in order to ensure
the activity reductions. Also, refueling an aircraft with non-conforming fuel (e.g., aviation fuel imported from
outside the area or automotive gasoline used in certain piston-powered aircraft engines) would have to be made an
illegal act in order to prevent cheating.

Under the third and final alternative, EPA would implement a annual emissions registration fee for each general aviation
aircraft residing in the FIP area. EPA would issue these certificates indicating that all applicable fees had been
paid. As with the other programs described here, the FIP emissions registration fee would be set high enough to reduce
operations. Airport proprietors or owners may be required to refuse services such as tie-down facilities or refueling
to aircraft operators without the appropriate certificate. This alternative has the distinct disadvantage that
it bluntly increases the cost of ownership without regard to how much any individual aircraft is used.

emission reductions from general aviation operations other than the emission reduction programs described today.

Comments are specifically requested on the need for an emissions control program for general aviation operations
in each control area based on local air quality concerns.

EPA requests comment on whether the proposed operations fee is appropriate given the program's objective of reducing
emissions from general aviation activity in the control areas.

EPA requests comment on the possibility of FAA assistance in EPA implementation of the proposed takeoff fee program
at tower controlled airports.

The Agency solicits comment on the legal and policy implications of a strategy that has the potential to create economic
incentives for general aviation to limit operations at airports in the FIP areas.

EPA requests comment on differentiating the operations fee structure for specific airports where other emission
reduction schemes have been implemented by the airport proprietor.

EPA requests comment on the need for a comprehensive reporting requirement for general aviation airport owners/operators.

EPA requests comment on three alternative emission reduction concepts for general aviation: takeoff slot program;
environmental surcharge on general aviation fuels; and registration fee program.

EPA requests comment on the desirability of providing exemptions from the requirements of this control program for
certain types of general aviation aircraft operations, such as operations at non-tower controlled facilities or
atypical operations.

Persons submitting comments on these issues or other specific aspects of today's proposal should consider and discuss
the possible impact of their comments on other elements of the control program, particularly when such comments propose
alternative strategies that would achieve smaller or larger emission reductions from general aviation.

(e) Public Aviation.  EPA requests comment on the manner in which public aircraft emission sources should be included
in the FIP control strategy. Such sources range from aircraft operated by federal agencies such as the Coast Guard
and the Forest Service to aircraft operated by local governments, for example police helicopters. EPA does not have
sufficient inventory data concerning such aircraft operations to assess their contribution to the overall emissions
inventory in the control area, although such emissions are likely to be limited relative to other aviation sources.
It may be desirable to exempt these types of aircraft operations from a specific FIP control program, given their importance
to the local community and the limited emissions benefits that likely would result from their control. EPA requests
comment on the desirability of such an exemption.

(3) Locomotives. (a) Introduction. Locomotives and locomotive engines contribute approximately 5 percent, 1 percent
and 2 percent of the total NO

X

 emissions in the Sacramento, Ventura and South Coast areas respectively. As with all emission sources, NO

X

 emissions from locomotives and locomotive engines in the three California FIP areas must be reduced for the areas
to reach attainment in the most equitable and cost effective manner possible. Locomotives are not significant sources
of HC at this time.

In 1990 Congress passed major amendments to the Clean Air Act of 1970. New Section 213(a)(5) of the Act directs EPA to
promulgate the first national regulation governing emissions from locomotives. EPA is required by statute to promulgate
final national rules for the control of locomotive emissions by November 15, 1995. Final issuance of the national
rule for locomotives is legally required within eight months of the date required for promulgation of the final rule
for this FIP, and well in advance of the date required for compliance with the FIP regulations. Because of the imminence
of the national rule for locomotives and because EPA's commitment to it is legally guaranteed, EPA believes it is appropriate
to give credit in the FIP for the emissions reductions that will result from the national rule for locomotives. Moreover,
since the locomotive rulemaking is national in scope, it would be inappropriate to foreshorten consideration of
it solely to conform to the FIP schedule.

Some special issues are present in the development of locomotive emission regulations. These issues include the
relationships between: (a) Locomotive life, rebuild practices and emissions benefits, (b) the mode selected for
freight transportation and its effects on emissions, (c) interstate commerce and state and national standards and
(d) the requirement for national control and the different emission control requirements in different areas of the
nation. Each of these problem areas is briefly discussed in the following paragraphs.

The first point requiring special attention is the long life of locomotives and procedures used to keep the locomotive
operating reliably throughout its life. Locomotives are typically operated by their original owners for millions
of miles over periods of thirty years or more. At the end of these periods, the locomotive may be scrapped or sold to a
smaller railroad and continue in service for many more years. During this total life of a locomotive, the engine and
other components of the propulsion system undergo several rebuilds which restore the components to an essentially
new condition. Typically these rebuilds occur on a five to seven year schedule. As a result of the long life spans of
locomotives and their engines, replacement rates are low and it takes forty or more years for fleet turnover to occur.

<TEXT>
 



This issue can have, if not addressed, a substantial effect on benefits of emission controls when applied to locomotives.
First, because of the very slow turnover rate, the effects of emissions standards applicable to freshly manufactured
locomotives require forty or more years to be fully realized. At this rate, the full effects of emissions standards
applicable to freshly manufactured locomotives
 will not be realized until midway into the twenty-first century. Second, because locomotives are rebuilt at several
points during their total life, emission control regulations, if limited to a traditional useful life, would only
be effective for a small fraction of the total life of a locomotive. If EPA only regulated locomotives or locomotive
engines for a useful life, traditionally defined as miles and/or time operated to the first remanufacture,
 the bulk of emission reductions possible would not be realized.






If a national program were to use the traditional useful life definition, many cost effective emissions reductions
would be lost. California regulators, EPA, and the railroad industry have recognized this potential loss of benefit.
A federal rule which relied on traditional useful life practices would achieve only small reductions and would deprive
states of a means that could be helpful in their attainment of the health based standards for ozone and particulate.
However, CARB regulators have expressed concerns that a federal rule would not require reductions sufficient to
the needs of their state.

The second point of concern pertains to the amount of emissions produced from the movement of freight by different
transportation modes. Information currently available to EPA shows that truck-based freight movement generates
more pollutants per ton of freight hauled than rail-based forms of freight movement. Estimates quantifying the difference
indicate that locomotives are on the order of three times cleaner than trucks on an emissions per ton moved basis. While
stringent regulations would theoretically reduce emissions from locomotives, their actual effect could be to increase
total emissions. This result is due to the substantially increased operating and equipment costs for the railroads
caused by overly stringent control requirements. These increased costs would be reflected in the price of hauling
freight and could even eliminate rail carriers from the market. In both of these cases customers would switch to trucks
for the movement of their freight. Any freight normally carried by rail that is hauled by trucks instead of by rail will
increase the overall emissions level, given railroads' overall efficiency benefits, ton per mile emissions, and
productivity even at current emissions levels. The effects of any such shift are very undesirable in the South Coast.
For this reason, it is essential that the current balance of rail based freight and truck based freight not be shifted
toward increased use of truck based systems.

The third point of special concern is the effect that emission standards for locomotives could have on interstate
commerce and on international commerce at ports. A substantial portion of the freight and people moved by railroads
in California is on trips beginning and/or ending outside of the state. This fact raises two issues. The first is that
much freight never has to enter California and would avoid the state if it saved money. The movement of that freight
supplies jobs not only in the railroads, but also to tugboat operators, port operators, truckers and shippers in California.
It also supplies revenue to the state. EPA is concerned that this FIP not affect California's economy unnecessarily.

Another concern is the effect that a patchwork of state locomotive regulations across the nation will have on interstate
commerce. Depending on the treatment of remanufactured locomotives under this FIP and the national rule, such a patchwork
could come to exist (see discussion of remanufactured engines). It would be exceedingly difficult for railroads
that must cross multiple state lines to comply with multiple state emission levels. If a train had to proceed through
several states with differing emission standards, either the locomotive(s) would have to meet the lowest state emission
standard for the entire trip or the railroad company would be forced to change locomotives at state boundaries. Facilities
for such changes do not exist. Even if such facilities were to exist, the process of changing locomotives at state borders
would add significantly to operational costs and shipping times and could also result in increased idle emissions.
For these reasons, safety regulations regarding locomotives and trains have historically been national. Lack of
cohesive, uniform national regulations for locomotives could be expected to disrupt interstate commerce.

An additional complication exists in the form of the different promulgation deadlines required for the FIP, California's
SIP, the national locomotive rulemaking and California's locomotive regulatory efforts. The FIP proposed today
is not scheduled to be finalized until February of 1995. Meanwhile California will develop State Implementation
Plans which must show attainment in the relevant areas and EPA will propose a national locomotive program. Additionally,
CARB will submit a recommendation to the California legislature on a state rule for locomotives and will begin work
on a regulation.

EPA is required by statute to promulgate a final national rule for the control of locomotive emissions by November
15, 1995. Since passage of the Clean Air Act in 1990, EPA has scheduled its investigative, research, contracting and
rulemaking efforts towards meeting this November 15, 1995 deadline. Because this rulemaking is the first of its kind
for locomotives, EPA has a full schedule of technical and operational issues to address. Many of these issues are not
fully resolved at this time. Therefore, in describing the effects of a national rulemaking on California FIP areas
in terms of emission reductions, EPA must base its estimates on a draft of its proposed national rulemaking that has
not been fully developed. EPA stresses that the proposed national rulemaking described here, for purposes of estimating
emission reductions in the California FIP areas, is preliminary and may be modified in the NPRM for the national locomotive
rulemaking that EPA expects to propose in November of 1994.

A final additional issue exists regarding the level of emission reductions appropriate for California, the South
Coast and the nation as a whole. South Coast authorities have indicated that they would like to see a 90 percent reduction
in rail emissions in the South Coast. CARB has indicated that an 80 percent reduction statewide would be appropriate.
EPA, as described below, is considering reductions on the order of 65 percent to 70 percent for the nation, phased in
over several years. EPA is also proposing today substantially larger reductions, and a more swift implementation
schedule, for the South Coast. Trying to fit different national, state and local needs together is difficult in the
best of circumstances. When the potential economic and environmental costs of inappropriate requirements are as
significant as they are here, it is much more difficult.

EPA's proposed locomotive FIP regulations are described below in three parts. The proposed regulations for freshly
manufactured locomotives are the same as those EPA intends to propose in November for the national locomotive program.
For remanufactured locomotives, EPA is considering two options. The first is a national program for such engines
which requires that existing locomotives meet a significant reduction and that locomotives complying with national
standards meet those standards throughout their full operating lives. The second is a California-only program with
the same requirements. Under that option, California could replace such a California-only program with more stringent
requirements if it finds such requirements are appropriate. The final part of this proposal is a fleet averaging standard
program for the South Coast only.

(b) Freshly Manufactured Locomotives. This section describes EPA's current thinking regarding its planned November
1994 proposal for regulation of new locomotives and engines used in locomotives nationally. As described above,
EPA is still analyzing data in preparation for that rule and hopes that it will receive additional useful data in response
to this NPRM. At this time, EPA intends to propose that freshly manufactured locomotives and locomotive engines built
between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2004, be required to meet a NO

X

 emission standard no higher than 7.0 g/bhp-hr. EPA is carefully studying the possibility of lower standards, and
is asking for comment on a NO

X

 standard as low as 5.0 g/bhp-hr. Estimates of emission rates from in-service locomotives range from 13.5 to 12.0 g/bhp-hr.
This requirement represents approximately a 42 percent to 48 percent reduction in NO

X

 emissions from uncontrolled levels.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940505-1-00164 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



EPA is also currently planning to propose in November 1994, a second tier standard. Under this standard, beginning
on January 1, 2005, freshly manufactured locomotives and locomotive engines will be required to meet a NO

X

 emission standard no higher than 6.0 g/bhp-hr. EPA is also considering standards more stringent than this number,
to approximately 4.0 g/bhp-hr. EPA requests comment on the feasibility of these standards, especially on the use
of diesel fuel. Again, on the basis of an average locomotive and an average train, this requirement represents a reduction
of between 61 percent to 65 percent in NO

X

 emissions from uncontrolled levels when fully phased in. 

EPA also intends to set standards for hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, particulate and smoke emissions for freshly
manufactured locomotives and locomotive engines. To the extent EPA regulates remanufactured engines, the standards
for these pollutants will also apply to these engines. The standards that become effective in 2000 will be set at levels
that approximately equal present emission levels. For the standards that become effective in 2005 for freshly manufactured
locomotives, EPA is presently considering some increase in the stringency of the particulate standard. 

Emission controls on freshly manufactured locomotives would achieve only limited emission reductions in the time
frame required for compliance under the California FIPs without some effort to significantly enhance turnover.
EPA's best estimate of emission reductions resulting from freshly manufactured locomotives is approximately a
5 percent to 7 percent reduction in locomotive NO

X

 emissions in 2005, and a 11 percent to 14 percent reduction in 2010. 

(c) Remanufactured Locomotives. While EPA's authority to regulate freshly manufactured locomotives is clear from
section 213(a)(5), EPA has not yet determined whether to regulate remanufactured engines in its national rule. National
regulation of remanufactured locomotives would alleviate many of the concerns described above regarding interstate
commerce and could potentially avoid intermodal shift. It would also get quicker and more lasting reductions in emissions
for the nation than would a rule which only regulated freshly manufactured locomotives. However, it would be designed
to achieve reductions appropriate for the nation and may not be as aggressive as regulations applied to other sources
in California. EPA is therefore proposing two options for remanufactured engines, a national approach and a California
only approach. 

It is important to keep in mind that there are at least two types of remanufactured engines. First, there are those engines
built before the effective date of EPA's regulations on new locomotives. Most of these engines can be remanufactured
to achieve emissions levels lower than they are currently meeting. Second, there are those engines built to comply
with EPA's national regulations on new locomotives. If EPA does not regulate remanufacture of these engines, most
of the engines will be unregulated after they reach their first rebuild. Depending on the emissions standard they
are designed to meet and the technology used to meet it, these engines could be remanufactured to meet substantially
more stringent levels. On the other hand, requiring them, after remanufacture, to continue to meet the emissions
levels they were designed to meet would not add any cost. 

A national or state remanufactured engine emission standard could affect either or both groups of engines. EPA is
discussing them together because they raise very similar legal and enforcement issues. Additionally, it is our understanding
that CARB is considering regulations that will affect both groups of engines. Commenters are encouraged to consider
the requirements and note any differences that need recognition in their comments. EPA also requests comment on any
other alternative plan or plans to achieve meaningful emission reductions from remanufactured engines. 

(

1

) Option I: National Regulations. Under Option I, a national locomotive program would be proposed in November 1994
which would regulate locomotives and locomotive engines remanufactured after January 2000. These locomotives
and locomotive engines would be required to comply with an emission standard such that emissions would not exceed
approximately 8.0 g/bhp-hr, for locomotives manufactured prior to January 2000, or the standard the engine was originally
certified to meet, for locomotives manufactured beginning in January 2000. EPA expects that this option will be generally
feasible for locomotives and locomotive engines manufactured after January 1, 1973 and would apply until scrappage
to all locomotives affected. 

According to the American Association of Railroads the usual time between rebuilds for Class I railroads is approximately
6 years. Therefore, most, if not all affected locomotives should be remanufactured within six years of the program
being implemented, i.e. by January 2006. EPA's best estimate of emission reductions attributable to this option,
including the reductions achieved from freshly manufactured locomotives, is approximately a 35 percent to 43 percent
reduction in 2005, and a 38 percent to 46 percent reduction in 2010 from the unregulated baseline, depending on the
assumed levels for today's unregulated engines.

<TEXT>
 



EPA is still considering the proper standard for remanufactured engines built before the implementation date of
the national rule. EPA is considering standards as low as 6.9 g/bhp-hr, approximately the national standard that
has been proposed for new nonroad engines above 37 kw. The railroads have requested that EPA also consider a cap on the
potential costs of remanufacture to meet lower emissions levels. While EPA is taking their recommendation under
advisement, we do not currently intend to promulgate such a requirement. Cost cap provisions create definitional
difficulties, and are potentially abused. 

EPA is concerned that emission rates, expressed as grams of emissions per brake horsepower hour (g/bhp-hr), of pre-1973
engines may be significantly higher than corresponding rates from newer locomotives. Achieving significant emission
reductions from these engines is expected, however, to be challenging and potentially costly. These engines, by
the year 2000, will be almost exclusively used by Class 2 and 3 railroads
 or for switching. They will therefore have relatively low usage and emissions rates when expressed as grams per year.
Since the benefits from emission control could be low, expressed as an annual mass of emissions, and the costs of control
high, the application of controls to these locomotives may prove to be inappropriate. EPA is continuing, however
to evaluate the practicality of requiring these locomotives to be remanufactured or possibly requiring that these
locomotives be repowered to achieve emission reductions.
 Another solution may be to move these older locomotives out of non-attainment areas. However, there are concerns
that any requirement may impose economic burdens on Class 2 and 3 railroads that tend to operate older engines, and
which may not be able to absorb the economic burden. 






Option I would be applicable nationwide, with emission reduction benefits realized across the nation. EPA would
be proposing this option under its Section 213 authority. The requirement would preempt states from regulating both
freshly manufactured and remanufactured locomotives or locomotive engines. States could however still regulate
operational practices such as idling and speed. 

(

2

) Option II: California Only Requirements. The second remanufacturing option would include the same requirements
as the first option but would limit the requirements to locomotives operating in California. There would be no remanufacturing
requirements for pre-2000 locomotives or post-2000 locomotives after their initial useful life for the rest of the
nation. This option would produce approximately the same percent emission reductions for California as would be
provided for the entire nation under option I. An enforcement mechanism would be required to ensure that only locomotives
remanufactured since the effective date of the program, to the California standards would be permitted in California.


EPA is proposing this option by taking the narrowest reading of its authority under Section 213(a)(5). Under this
reading, EPA may only regulate brand new engines and the states have authority to regulate in use engines. Therefore,
California would have the authority to replace this program with a program it believes is more appropriate. Additionally,
other states could choose to develop their own requirements or to adopt requirements designed for California. Each
state could promulgate different standards for remanufactured locomotive engines. As described above, the result
of such a scenario could be a disruption of interstate commerce and a corresponding shift to trucks and/or increase
in transportation costs.

(d) Additional Measures for the South Coast. (

1

) Fleet Average Standard Program. The reductions required for the South Coast to attain the air quality standards
by 2010 cannot be achieved without significant reductions in every source of emissions. EPA estimates the national
program for freshly manufactured locomotives would reduce emissions in the South Coast by approximately 5 percent
to 7 percent by 2005 and 11 percent to 14 percent by 2010. The addition of either option 1 or option 2 for in service locomotives
would result in total reductions of NO

X

 emissions in the South Coast of approximately 35 percent to 43 percent in 2005 and 38 percent to 46 percent in 2010.
 As the total NO

X

 reduction from all sources required in the South Coast is 70 percent, EPA would like to achieve percent reductions
of this magnitude from the rail industry. These requirements call for a more stringent program regulating locomotive
emissions. EPA's plan to further regulate locomotive emissions in the South Coast, hereafter referred to as the ``South
Coast locomotive fleet average standard program,'' is designed to achieve reductions on this order. 





EPA is not currently proposing to require additional locomotive control measures for the Sacramento and Ventura
FIP areas. EPA believes that Sacramento does not need further NO

X

 reductions beyond the programs described above to meet its attainment requirements. Ventura's train traffic is
very limited, and any additional program there would only achieve small benefits, with costs out of proportion to
the benefits received. EPA determined that further reductions are necessary for the South Coast, due to its massive
non-attainment problems, and the significance therefore of any source of pollution. Locomotives currently contribute
2 percent of South Coast NO

X

 and that percent contribution would be expected to rise without further regulation, due to the regulation of other
South Coast emission sources. 

EPA proposes and asks for comment on the following locomotive NO

X

 emission reduction plan for the South Coast. All railroad locomotives or locomotive engines used by a railroad company
in the South Coast area would be averaged together to achieve an average emission standard level. EPA proposes that
NO

X

 emission levels from the regulated sources must be no greater than 5.5 g/bhp-hr by 2007 and 4.0 g/bhp-hr by 2010. Average
emission levels would be calculated for each railroad company based upon fuel usage and engine emission levels. For
each ton of emissions over this average, a noncompliance fee will be assessed based on the $10,000/ton figure used
for on highway heavy-duty engines. EPA is interested in including other locomotive emission sources
 in the average but has very little information regarding use or emissions levels. Commenters are urged to provide
this information.





This program preserves as much flexibility as possible for railroad companies to meet the additional emission reductions
in the South Coast. This flexibility will allow individual railroad companies to reduce emissions in the most cost
effective manner possible for their companies. EPA believes that an averaging program will be the most cost effective
method of reducing locomotive emissions in the South Coast. 

Starting January 1, 2007 and effective until December 31, 2009, each individual railroad company that operates within
the South Coast will be required to meet on average, an emissions level of 5.5 g/bhp-hr. Starting January 1, 2010 and
in effect thereafter, each individual railroad company that intends to operate within the South Coast will be required
to meet on average an emissions level of 4.0 g/bhp-hr. Average emissions would be calculated based on fuel usage. The
g/bhp-hr level of a locomotive engine would be multiplied by the gallons of fuel that an engine consumed during a given
year within the South Coast nonattainment area. The products of the locomotives' g/bhp-hr level and fuel usage would
be summed for all of the engines in a railroad company's fleet. The resultant sum would then be divided by the total gallons
of fuel used. The resultant g/bhp-hr average must be at or below 5.5 g/bhp-hr for the years 2007-2009 and below
4.0 g/bhp-hr for 2010 and thereafter. This calculation is summarized in an equation in the regulations. 

EPA realizes there may be alternatives to basing the average calculation on fuel usage such as basing the average calculation
on mileage or hours of operation. These two alternatives do not necessarily reflect emissions level well because
they take improper account of idling. However, EPA is interested in comments regarding the appropriate measure.


EPA is proposing that electrified mileage be counted as producing zero emissions as long as the electrical powerplants
supplying the electricity are located outside of the South Coast. If the powerplants were inside South Coast, some
calculation of the pollutants created from the production of the electricity consumed would have to be used. Additionally,
a conversion factor to equate kilowatt hours used to gallons of fuel used would be necessary so appropriate credit
may be given for electrification for purposes of calculating the emissions average. The Department of Energy recently
proposed a rule, (

Federal Register

 Vol. 59, No. 24, February 4, 1994), that specifies how to calculate such a conversion factor. EPA requests comment
on this proposal.

Additionally, EPA is proposing to allow companies to pool their operations for measurement of the emissions average.
This proposal could facilitate investment in electrification or alternative fuel usage. By combining an investing
company's average emissions with that of another company, the electrified or alternative fuel railroad company
could help subsidize its investment. 
EPA does not see the need for an emissions cap with this program. A cap may be necessary because the averaging program
is based upon fuel used. EPA believes it unlikely that the amount of fuel used by railroad companies will increase in
the South Coast. The trend in current engine design is toward increased fuel efficiency, and railroad companies place
a high premium on saving fuel. It is in the best economic interests of the railroads to do so. EPA thus expects the positive
trend in fuel efficiency to continue. The only way there could possibly be an increase in emissions or less emissions
reductions for the rail sector than projected, due to increased fuel usage, would be for the railroad industry to experience
rapid expansion. If this were to happen, actual net emissions in the South Coast would probably be positively affected
because it would mean that more freight was being hauled by rail instead of truck. Alternatively it could be as a result
of expansion in mass transit trains. In either case, the net emission impact in the South Coast would be in a positive
direction. EPA therefore is not proposing an actual emissions cap at this time, however EPA requests comment on the
need for including a cap on emissions produced from locomotive sources. 
This regulatory program is aimed exclusively at the South Coast FIP area. Moreover, EPA's authority to propose this
program is at least partially derived from California's own authority. EPA therefore encourages California authorities
to manage this program or propose a program that achieves similar reductions. EPA believes that California would
be more sensitive to the specific issues and problems of implementing a program of this nature. If California were
to agree to manage this program, California would handle the administration and enforcement of this program. In any
event, California will retain the right to regulate operational changes in the railroad industry within California.
This includes but is not limited to time spent idling, rail lubrication, and operating times, etc.

(

) Compliance. EPA is proposing under the South Coast locomotive fleet average standard program that each railroad
company that intends to operate locomotives or locomotive engines within the geographical confines of the South
Coast should designate certain locomotives or locomotive engines which will operate within the South Coast. When
these locomotives or locomotive engines operate in the South Coast, fuel usage for each locomotive type shall be recorded
by the locomotive operator. Such records shall be submitted to EPA in March of each calendar year for the preceding
year of operation and be kept for a period of five years. EPA will specify in its national regulation what test procedure
and method will be used for certifying an engine at a particular emissions level. 
EPA proposes that each individual railroad company which owns or operates locomotive emission sources within the
South Coast keep a roster of engines and locomotives that operate within the South Coast. This roster would include
the locomotive type, the engine type and relevant emission characteristic data on the engine. Summary rosters shall
be reported to the Administrator yearly, and supporting data is proposed to be kept for a period of 5 years thereafter.
Locomotives and locomotive engines that are designated to operate within the South Coast would be marked by a permanent
identifier on the engine and labels displayed prominently on both sides of the exterior of the locomotive which will
identify the locomotive as a South Coast designated locomotive. 
EPA would reserve the right to audit any locomotive emission source in regard to performance and compliance, that
EPA finds operating within the South Coast. EPA inspectors would be given rights of access to inspect railroad property
and equipment. Any non-South Coast designated locomotive or locomotive engine or locomotive emission source that
EPA finds operating in the South Coast without being properly identified or without proper maintenance could face
instant fines as high as $25,000 per day of operation. 

Each company that operates locomotives is responsible for meeting its individual fleet average emissions standard.
EPA proposes to assess annual noncompliance penalties for companies similar to those described for heavy-duty noncompliance
in section 3(D)(3) of this document. Each company that operates one or more locomotives will have to show compliance
each year with the fleet average emissions standard. Any excess emissions produced beyond the average will be assessed
an annual noncompliance fee of $10,000 per ton of emissions produced. This penalty is in addition to any charged for
a violation as described in the preceding paragraphs. 

(

3

) Authority. EPA is proposing this South Coast emission averaging standard program under its broad remedial authority
under section 110(c). No provision of section 213, section 209, or any other sections of the Clean Air Act, clearly
prohibits EPA from exercising its section 110(c) in the manner proposed herein.

) Emission Reductions. EPA believes the average g/bhp-hr level for line haul locomotives and locomotive engines
operated by class 1 
locomotives in California is approximately 13.5 g/bhp-hr. This 
estimate was developed from train data and locomotive emission 
data supplied to EPA by railroad companies that operate within 
California, and locomotive engine manufacturers.
 The 
railroads have however claimed that the average emission level of 
locomotives operating in California is 12 g/bhp-hr. While they 
have provided no accounting of that average level, and the 13.5 
g/bhp-hr level was calculated from data provided by the 
railroads, EPA has used both levels in its estimates of the 
benefits of this program. The range provides for conservative 
estimates both of the current emissions impact of locomotives and 
the reductions from this program. Other locomotives, those 
operated by class 2 and 3 railroads and switcher locomotives 
operated by class 1 railroads have g/bhp-hr levels higher than 
13.5 g/bhp-hr. 





To calculate a minimum emission reduction, one can assume 
that all locomotives are at 12 or 13.5 g/bhp-hr. EPA's 2007 
requirement that railroad emissions average 5.5 g/bhp-hr would 
therefore provide overall emission reductions of 54 percent to 59 
percent. The 2010 requirement that railroad emissions average 
4.0 g/bhp-hr would therefore provide overall emission reductions 
of 67 percent to 70 percent. Since the current overall average 
emissions, due to switching operations and class 2 and 3 
operation, must be higher than 13.5 g/bhp-hr, a reduction in 
excess of 70 percent is likely. 

EPA believes the reductions necessary to meet the 5.5 g/bhp-hr emission average will be achievable through the use
of clean 
diesel technology and operational changes. Some use of 
alternative fuels may be necessary to supplement the emission 
reduction achieved by clean diesel and operational changes or to 
allow significant growth. Electrification, under strong 
consideration for at least some South Coast lines would greatly 
facilitate compliance and reductions. EPA requests comment on 
what types of engines or strategies may be required to comply 
with this program. 

EPA does not anticipate that additional measures of 
reduction will be required at this time. However several 
options, which EPA could not finalize due to technological 
issues, but could develop later as provided by section 182(e)(5) 
of the CAA, are widespread use of electrification and the use of 
fuel cells. 

(

5

) Other Options. EPA requests comment on three other options being promoted 
by the South Coast, the CARB and the AAR, respectively. The 
South Coast Air Quality Management District is proposing that a 
90 percent reduction in railroad emissions in the basin be 
required by the year 2010. This proposal requires 
electrification of all locomotive operations, including 
switching. They have not yet determined how such a project could 
be funded. For this reason, EPA is not proposing this option. 

The CARB is considering an option that would require an 80 
percent reduction in locomotive NO

X

 emissions statewide by 2003. 
Emissions of HC and CO would be allowed to rise and emissions of 
particulates would be reduced after 2003. It appears likely that 
this level of reduction could require that all locomotives used 
in California operate on a fuel other than diesel, with natural 
gas being a likely candidate. Alternatively, electrification of 
a number of lines may be necessary. EPA is concerned about the 
practicality and costs associated with electrification, and is 
therefore not proposing this option. 

The AAR has proposed that linehaul locomotives be required 
to average 6 g/bhp-hr by the year 2010. This proposal could 
presumably build from national standards on new locomotives and 
some regulation of remanufactured locomotives. However, it does 
not affect switching and other non-line operations, such as 
loading and unloading. The effect of that omission has been 
variously estimated at from 5 to 30 percent of emissions 
depending on the geographic area. Because this program does not 
achieve sufficient reductions, EPA is not proposing this option. 
However, EPA requests comment on this and the other two options.

(4) Marine Vessels/Ports. (a) Background and Program Description. Marine vessels are the largest uncontrolled
source of 
emissions of NO

X

 and SO

X

 in California. According to a study 
prepared by Sierra Research, Inc.,
 marine vessels account for 
approximately 40 percent of all SO

X

 emissions and 12 percent of 
all NO

X

 emissions from both mobile and stationary sources 
statewide (Sierra report, p. 3). While most emissions associated 
with marine vessels occur at sea, a great deal occur while the 
vessel is at port, during maneuvering and hotelling activities 
(hotelling refers to the time a vessel ``spends moored or at 
anchor, for such purposes as loading or unloading cargo or 
awaiting a berth''_Booz-Allen report,
 p. II-16). Both at-sea 
and in-port emissions are of concern for ambient air quality in 
the South Coast area, since emissions from vessels at sea can be 
transported onshore by prevailing winds, and since emissions from 
vessels at port are added to those already occurring from 
stationary facilities at a port. 





The contribution of diesel marine engine emissions to local 
air quality is influenced by at least two factors. The first 
concerns the nature of the engines themselves. Large marine 
vessels have high NO

X

 emissions because of the nature of the 
machinery and equipment used to power them. These vessels are 
typically powered by very large diesel engines that are optimized 
for power and fuel consumption, and those optimization processes 
(such as high temperatures) tend to boost NO

X

 emissions. In 
addition, marine engines are usually old and unregulated, and 
generally do not have many of the combustion improvements that 
are incorporated into new on-highway engines to reduce 
particulate matter and NO

X

 emissions. 
The second determinant is the time spent and frequency of 
activity at or near port. Analysis of 1989 data shows that about 
10 percent of the vessels in California's ports accounted for 
more than 50 percent of the emissions from marine vessels (Sierra 
report, p. 9). Control strategies are more effective which focus 
on those ships that contribute the most to air quality problems 
while in port. If those ships can be targeted, any reduction in 
their emissions will have a large impact on air quality. 
Similarly, control strategies are more effective which 
target those ships that stop often in California. Vessels that 
do not frequently use South Coast ports do not contribute as much 
to local air quality problems. Based again on 1989 data, 
approximately 60 percent of the vessels at California's ports 
made merely one or two trips per year, each contributing only a 
relatively small fraction to total emissions (Sierra report, p. 
9). 
EPA has considered several strategies to achieve reductions 
in ship emissions. One potential emission control strategy would 
be to require vessels to be outfitted with NO

X

 and SO

X

 control 
equipment. There are several technologies available, and these 
technologies are associated with different levels of emissions 
decreases, ranging from 25 percent to 90 percent, depending on 
the nature, age, and condition of the ship's engine and 
equipment.
 For example, fuels with ultra-low sulfur content 
can reduce SO

X

 emissions by as much as 96 percent and cause 
measurable NO

X

 decreases as well (Sierra report, p. 25). 
Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) can reduce NO

X

 emission by as 
much as 90 percent. Water/fuel emulsion technology can reduce 
NO

X

 by approximately 25 percent (Sierra report, p. 34). These 
technologies are discussed in more detail below. 




At the same time, many of these techniques have substantial 
drawbacks, including increased capital and operating costs. NO

X

 
control techniques are generally expensive and often difficult to 
retrofit on older vessels (although they can be cost-effective to 
incorporate on new engines) and may be costly to maintain.
 In 
addition, many NO

X

 control technologies are also associated with 
a decrease in fuel efficiency of up to 5 percent (Sierra report, 
p. 71). Also, results depend on certain operating 
characteristics. For example, optimal SCR results depend on a 
steady-state operation mode. Reductions are less certain during 
maneuvering procedures when engine speed is constantly changing; 
yet, this is the kind of operation that is typical while a vessel 
is near or in-port. Controlling SO

X

 by fuel composition changes 
may be problematic for compliance reasons. This is because 
vessels would be required to use low-sulfur fuel only when they 
are in the vicinity of the California coastline and in 
California ports. While they operate at sea, ships could use 
conventional fuels. This means that vessels can be equipped with 
two kinds of fuel tanks: one for clean fuel for use in-port, and 
one for ordinary fuel for use at sea. However, for obvious 
reasons, it would be hard to verify that vessels use low-sulfur 
fuel while near shore or in-port.

<TEXT>
 



Because of these and other potential drawbacks, EPA believes 
that it would be preferable at this point in time to avoid 
mandating the use of these control technologies by all ships when 
they are in California ports. There are at least three reasons 
why other solutions should be pursued at this time. First, as 
shown above, not all ships are high emitters. Therefore, it does 
not make sense to mandate special technologies for all ships, 
since this would mean imposing costly retrofits on some existing 
ships that are not high emitters. Second, and more importantly, 
not all ships spend a lot of operating time in California ports. 
It does not make sense to mandate permanent, expensive control 
technologies for ships that visit California ports only once or 
twice a year which, as noted above, is the case for approximately 
60 percent of the vessels that use California's ports. 
Finally, the regulation of oceangoing marine vessels 
registered in the United States has been traditionally undertaken 
by the United States Coast Guard, and through international 
organizations such as the International Maritime Organization 
(IMO), for ships registered outside the United States. 
International trade may be significantly harmed by unilateral and 
contradictory actions taken by various countries around the world 
mandating different control methods and technologies for vessels 
engaged in international trade. EPA believes that it is 
appropriate at this time to avoid unilaterally mandating the use 
of control technologies or other methods on ships that are 
inconsistent with the technologies currently being advocated by 
the United States in the IMO.
 This is especially important in 
the South Coast region because approximately 80 percent of the 
larger marine vessels that call on the LA ports, for example, are 
registered in foreign countries. EPA believes that it is 
important to create a regime that will encourage all ship 
operators and owners to reduce their emissions of NO

X

 and SO

X

 
while in California ports without creating significant problems 
for international trade. 




Emission control strategies must also take into account 
economic realities. Ships and ports bring more than pollution to 
California. They also perform the obvious function of 
transporting products and raw materials to the area for 
manufacturing and production purposes, and they bring jobs and 
money. Many millions of dollars of imports and exports travel 
through the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach every day, on 
their way from the Midwest to the Far East or vice versa. Any 
program for the control of emissions from ships and ports must 
also consider the effects of such a program on this trade and on 
the South Coast economy. Inappropriate treatment could move the 
trade out of the area, or even out of the country, with 
corresponding economic effects. While it is true that trade has 
centered in the South Coast because the area is well situated to 
accept it, having adequate facilities for moving and processing 
the products delivered, it is also true that emission control 
strategies should stress appropriate regulations which would 
balance emissions reductions with possible negative impacts on 
trade. 
For all of these reasons, EPA is proposing a flexible 
control strategy for the reduction of emissions from ships at 
port. This strategy will rely on economic incentives to 
encourage operators and owners of ships that frequently use 
California's South Coast ports to take the steps necessary to 
reduce their emissions. Specifically, this strategy involves 
imposing user fees for ships that use ports in the South Coast 
region. These fees will be based on the level of emissions of a 
ship using the port, among other things. EPA is proposing a 
three-tier fee structure, as more thoroughly described below. 
Like other emission charges proposed today, the ship fee will be 
based on a price of $10,000 per ton of NO

X

 emissions emitted to 
the atmosphere. 
In addition to encouraging ship operators and owners to 
install and use emission control systems, the program contains 
two other features that should help reduce marine vessels' 
contribution to California's pollution while ships are berthed in 
port and while they are operating at sea. First, ship operators 
may receive a reduction in the fees outlined below if they use 
onshore power sources instead of internally generated power while 
they are at port (this is called ``cold ironing''). Second, ship 
operators may receive a reduction in fees if they use a relocated 
Santa Barbara shipping channel. EPA is proposing that this 
shipping channel be located at least 70 miles from the shore to 
decrease the amount of marine emissions that are transported 
onshore by prevailing winds. Both of these aspects of the 
program are described in greater detail below. No fee will be 
assessed any shipper who uses the lowest emitting class of 
engine, cold irons and avoids the Ventura air basin. 
There are several advantages to this type of emission 
control program. First, it allows a ship operator or owner to 
make decisions about which control technologies to adopt, if any, 
based not only on the characteristics of a particular vessel but 
also based on the extent to which the vessel uses South Coast 
ports. Those ships that use South Coast ports more frequently 
will be faced with higher annual fees and therefore will have a 
greater incentive to install more efficient emission control 
devices to reduce those annual fees. Vessels that use these 
ports infrequently are not faced with the same level of annual 
fees and would therefore probably elect to pay the fee instead of 
installing more expensive emission control devices. EPA believes 
this is a fair strategy because these vessels contribute less to 
overall regional air quality problems than those vessels that use 
these ports more often. At the same time, payment of a fee by a 
vessel that infrequently uses port facilities is justified 
because the vessel is contributing to local air quality while it 
uses the port.

<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



A final advantage to this kind of emission control program is that the fees collected could be used to help ship owners
and operators reduce their ships' emissions, thus advancing additional emission benefits. For example, the fees
could be used to help ship owners and operators purchase and install emission reduction equipment, through loans
or grants or other financial assistance programs. It should be noted, however, that the Miscellaneous Receipts Act
requires EPA to submit any fees paid pursuant to this program to the U. S. Treasury. Therefore, in order to use the fees
collected under such a program for emissions control, it is necessary for California or the South Coast to develop
a replacement program that would supersede this proposed EPA program. Then, the fees would be paid to the State of California
or the South Coast Air Quality Management District instead of to EPA, and those organizations could use the funds for
such purposes. By adopting a replacement program, California or the South Coast could take steps to decrease any adverse
economic impacts resulting from the program. EPA is proposing to begin instituting the port fee schedule described
below in 2001. This date is beneficial for two reasons. First, EPA hopes that in the intervening seven years, the California
and IMO efforts to regulate ship emissions and the Coast Guard effort to move the shipping channel will have all borne
fruit. Thus, 2001 allows enough time to respond to these changes and work out details about the form of this program
in light of them. Second, by beginning to develop this program nine years before the attainment date, EPA allows time
to adjust the fees and discounts to achieve the necessary emissions reductions at the least cost, as described below.
EPA anticipates that the ships and ports fees program described in this preamble will achieve an approximately 30
percent NO

X

 emission reduction in the South Coast. This estimate is based on the assumption that the 10 percent of the ships which
create 50 percent of the emissions due to frequent visits will have on average 30 percent lower emissions after implementation
of the program. This reduction will likely be achieved by ship operators and owners using newer ships for their California
trips, by using better fuels, and by using timing retard technology, at least in the short run. A further 7.5 percent
NO

X

 reduction should be achieved through increased cold ironing. The remaining 7.5 percent NO

X

 reduction will come from isolated use of available low emitting engines, such as turbines and SCR equipped ships,
by the remaining 90 percent of the ships visiting the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. In response to these fees and
to ongoing actions by the Coast Guard to protect the Monterrey Bay Sanctuary, EPA expects most ship owners or operators
will choose shipping routes that will take them away from Ventura's coast. This will have the effect of reducing the
transfer of marine emissions to the coast in that area. The user fees will have this effect because the vast majority
of ships that currently use the shipping channel that takes them along the shoreline close to Ventura will stop or have
stopped at the Ports of Long Beach or Los Angeles. Under the proposed emission reduction strategy, these ship owners
and operators can reduce the user fees they will be charged at these ports by using a relocated shipping channel that
takes them away from the coastline. EPA believes that the discounts associated with using the relocated channel will
be sufficient to eliminate most of that traffic. In addition, the Coast Guard has undertaken a study to evaluate the
impact of relocating California shipping channels.
 Such relocation may be necessary to reduce environmental damage to the Monterrey Bay Sanctuary due to ship traffic.
As part of that study, the Coast Guard has requested comments regarding relocation of the channel near Ventura. EPA
has recommended to the Coast Guard that the channel near Ventura should be moved as far as feasible from the coast. Such
a decision by the Coast Guard will also reduce airborne marine emissions in Ventura. 




These emission reduction estimates were made without sufficient knowledge of the effects of a fee on the behavior
of shippers. Shippers may find it easy to reschedule their ships so that only the lowest emitting ones are used in the
South Coast. On the other hand, shippers may have difficulty reducing their emissions if equipment and/or installation
services are insufficient to meet demand. EPA intends to monitor the fee's effects and adjust the fees and discounts
as necessary to achieve a NO

X

 emission reduction approximately similar to that required under the stationary source cap. 
The following sections describe in greater detail the components of this fee-based control strategy. As described
in Section III.D.4.e (5), this program does not apply to military vessels. EPA requests comments on all features and
calculations associated with this proposed program, as well as the proper application. As described above, EPA is
proposing to apply the program to the two major South Coast ports for ocean going ships: the Ports of Los Angeles and
Long Beach. EPA requests comment on applying the program to all basin ports, all California ports, or only as proposed.

(b) Control Strategies_Fee System Based on Emission Levels. (

1

) Fee Categories. The goal of this proposal is to encourage the use of cleaner marine engines. A number of emission control
technologies for reducing NO

X

 from marine diesel engines are described in the following section. Although the emission reduction strategies described
in the following section each contain a range of reduction potential, there appears to be a number of technologies
that offer the potential to achieve reductions of 30 percent or greater. Also, reductions of greater than 80 percent
are possible through three options: Selective catalytic reduction (SCR), steam turbine engines and gas turbine
engines. Other technologies, such as natural gas engines, may also achieve reductions in excess of 80 percent.

EPA proposes to encourage the use of cleaner marine engines 
through a three-tier fee program based on emission reductions 
from a diesel engine baseline. The first tier is a 0-10 
percent fee (90 percent fee reduction) for engines that achieve 
greater than or equal to 80 percent NO

X

 reduction compared to 
typical marine diesel engines.
 These could include SCR- 
equipped diesel engines, steam turbine engines or gas turbine 
engines, or engines equipped with other technologies that can be 
shown to achieve such reductions. The second tier is a 50 
percent reduction from the full fee for engines that achieve 
greater than or equal to 30 percent and up to 80 percent NO

X

 
reduction compared to typical marine diesel engines. Such 
engines could include such technologies as injection timing 
retard, engine fine tuning, EGR, water emulsification, and 
selective non-catalyst reduction, or other technologies that can 
be shown to achieve such reductions. The third tier would be a 
full fee for engines that do not achieve at least a 30 percent 
reduction in NO

X

 emissions from the baseline. 




This fee structure can easily be adjusted to incorporate 
standards set out by the International Maritime Organization 
(IMO). The IMO is currently developing an annex to MARPOL 
(Marine Pollution Convention) 73/78 to control air pollution from 
ships on international voyages. Target emission reductions for 
the annex are a 30 percent reduction in NO

X

 and a 50 percent 
reduction in SO

X

. As part of the compliance verification 
procedure, the IMO is currently considering type approval (i.e., 
test bed confirmation), and onboard surveys and re-surveys. The 
onboard surveys would consist of a simplified test for 
verification based on measuring NO

X

 and O

2

 concentrations. For 
these surveys, the IMO is currently considering test procedures 
drafted by the International Standards Organization (ISO) for 
measuring emissions at site (ISO/DIS 8178-2: Reciprocating 
internal combustion engines_Exhaust emission measurement_Part 
2: Measurement of gaseous and particulate emissions at site). 
EPA requests comments on the use of this test procedure to 
establish fee levels based on measured emission levels from 
marine engines. 

Based on information supplied by Japan as input into the IMO 
air pollution annex development, NO

X

 emission levels showed the 
best correlation with engine speed as compared to other 
parameters. Slow speed engines generally have higher thermal 
efficiencies and therefore higher NO

X

 than medium and high speed 
engines. Many delegations to IMO believe the data provided by 
Japan to be the best published information on emission rates for 
the range of marine engines. Based on this data, Japan has 
proposed that a 30 percent NO

X

 reduction could be achieved by NO

X

 limits for the IMO air pollution annex of the form:





NO

X

 (g/kW-hr)=45 x n

^0.2







where n is engine speed in revolutions per minute 
EPA proposes that the second tier fee level coincide with the IMO 
proposal. In other words, those engines that meet the proposed 
IMO standards are proposed to be eligible for a discounted fee 
(i.e., be categorized in the second tier fee level). To 
accomplish this, EPA proposes that the baseline emissions level, 
for fee calculation purposes, be of the form:




NO

X

 (g/kW-hr)=64.3 x n

^0.2





where n is engine speed in revolutions per minute 
for any given RPM range, this equation calculates an emission 
rate baseline. The equation proposed by Japan for the IMO annex 
thus represents a 30 percent reduction in emissions from this 
baseline. Therefore, engines which can achieve emission 
reductions of greater than or equal to 30 percent from this 
baseline (i.e., that meet the IMO proposed standard) will be 
eligible for a fee discount (a 50 percent discount for engines 
achieving 30 percent to less than 80 percent NO

X

 reduction and a 
90 percent discount for engines achieving greater than or equal 
to 80 percent reduction in NO

X

). 



The main caveat with this strategy is that the IMO emission 
standards are still under development. In addition to the 
proposal for NO

X

 limits based on engine speed, another proposal 
under consideration by IMO is for NO

X

 limits to be set based on 
specific fuel consumption of the engine. EPA requests comments 
on the appropriateness of the proposed baseline emissions 
equation or other approaches for the purposes of calculating 
fees.

The full fee level is proposed to be based on the above 
equation to generate the baseline emission rate. Also, the full 
fee level is proposed to be based on a fee of $10,000/U.S. ton of 
NO

X

, which is consistent with other fee levels proposed in this 
FIP. To obtain total tons of NO

X

 emitted, the number of hours of 
operation in the port area must be reported, as well as the rated 
power for each applicable engine on board. Thus, ships which 
enter and leave their berth efficiently will receive a lower fee. 
A load factor of 80 percent
 of rated output is assumed, which 
is a typical load for vessels that are cruising at sea. For 
berthing and hotelling operations, a load factor of 25 percent is 
assumed for main propulsion engines. For auxiliary power 
generators, a load factor of 50 percent is assumed. EPA is 
proposing that cruise hours are determined as the hours that an 
engine operates when the ship is between 3 and 100 miles from 
port; and maneuvering/hotelling hours are hours that an engine 
operates when the ship is less than 3 miles from port. Both the 
cruise time and the maneuvering/hotelling time are proposed to be 
reported for each main propulsion engine and auxiliary engine of 
each ship entering port. CARB has indicated that emissions from 
these distances may affect shore pollution levels. However, EPA 
is currently evaluating, with the assistance of the State 
Department and Coast Guard, the appropriateness of applying these 
fees to foreign flag vessels in light of international maritime 
law and international trade concerns. EPA requests comment on 
the appropriateness of the distances proposed. 





The way the proposed fee structure would work is illustrated 
by the following example. Based on the above equation, a 10,000 
kW MCR (maximum continuous rating), 500 RPM engine would emit NO

X

 
at a rate of 18.6 g/kW-hr (64.3 x (500)

^0.2

) at MCR. If this 
engine operated within the port area for 6 hours in cruising mode 
(0.8 load factor) and 12 hours in maneuvering and hotelling 
operations (0.25 load factor) it would be assessed a fee of about 
$16,000 ([18.6 x 10,000 x 0.8 x 6 x $5.00 x 1 lb/453.59 gr] + 
[18.6 x 10,000 x 0.25 x 12 x $5.00 x 1 lb/453.59 gr] = $16,000). 
By using technologies that achieve between 30 and 80 percent 
reduction, this fee would be reduced to $8,000 ($16,000 x .50). 
Technologies achieving over 80 percent reduction would be charged 
$1,600 ($16,000 x .10). Discounts described below will be 
applied on a percentage basis to these base fees, provided that 
no ship meeting the requirements for the 10 percent fee category, 
cold ironing and avoiding the Ventura Air Basin will be charged 
any fee. 
These fees would be in addition to any fee assessed by the 
port for docking or other benefits. EPA requests comments on: 
the appropriateness of this fee calculation methodology, whether 
or not other methodologies are more appropriate, and how likely 
the proposed scheme encourages the use of technologies that would 
achieve the emissions reduction objectives. Specifically, EPA 
requests comments on the appropriate load factors for engines 
during cruising (at sea) and maneuvering/hotelling operations, 
and on the level of discount for the three fee levels.

) Emission Reduction Technologies. A number of technical designs/engine modifications are known 
to reduce, or are technologically feasible for reducing, 
emissions of NO

X

 from marine diesel engines. These technologies 
are presented in the table below and more fully discussed in the 
following text. Also, these technologies form the basis of the 
three-tier fee level described in the previous section. 
New engines can easily achieve the IMO specified reductions 
and have achieved the lowest levels shown. Retrofitting some of 
these technologies, however, can be difficult.

(

a

) Retarded Injection Timing. A feasible and simple means of reducing NO

X

 from diesel 
engines is by retarding injection timing. This method lowers the 
peak combustion temperature and pressure in the cylinder, 
resulting in lower levels of NO

X

. This strategy has been 
estimated to reduce NO

X

 emissions by 10-30 percent. However, 
disadvantages include higher specific fuel consumption, lower 
power, harder startability, and higher levels of HC, CO, 
particulate matter and smoke emissions. To recover the lost fuel 
economy and performance or to reduce the amount of injection 
timing retard, additional technologies that improve fuel 
atomization have been employed. Fuel atomization can be improved 
by increasing fuel pump pressure, improving fuel pump advance 
strategies, and incorporating smaller injector nozzle tip holes. 
(

b

) Engine Fine Tuning.
 Engine fine tuning includes modification of essential engine 
components and could result in 20-40 percent reduction in NO

X

 
emissions. More specifically, engine fine tuning could include 
modifications in the injection system, charge air system, and 
combustion chamber design. Such changes on new onhighway engines 
have already achieved more than 50 percent NO

X

 reductions. 
However, retrofitting such changes on existing engines makes 
equally large reductions for marine vessels unlikely. 
(

c

) Exhaust Gas Recirculation.
 Exhaust gas recirculation involves recirculating some of the 
exhaust gas back into the intake manifold. This lowers the 
combustion temperature and therefore can lower NO

X

 emissions by 
as much as 20-50 percent. For marine engines, the applicability 
of EGR is complicated by the quality of the fuel. Sulfur and 
soot from combustion gases can cause increased wear of piston 
rings, valves, and other components. Therefore, EGR is more 
likely to be used with engines running on cleaner distillate 
fuels. 
(

d

) Water Emulsified Fuel.
 Water emulsification of the fuel is a technique which also 
lowers maximum combustion temperature, reducing NO

X

 by 20-50 
percent without an increase in fuel consumption. There are at 
least two ways to accomplish the emulsification during 
combustion: in the combustion chamber or in the fuel tank. 
Combining water and fuel for the first time in the chamber 
requires significant changes to the cylinder head to add an 
injector. Combining water with fuel in the tank may introduce 
combustion problems due to unstable emulsion. Also, this 
technique requires a significantly redesigned fuel handling 
system to overcome the potential risk of corrosion and to 
maintain power output. In any event, extra liquid storage 
availability is necessary to retain similar range. 
(

e

) Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR).
 One of the most effective, but also most complex and 
expensive, means of reducing NO

X

 from large diesel engines is 
with the use of selective catalytic reduction (SCR). Emission 
reductions in excess of 90 percent can be achieved using SCR. In 
SCR systems, a reducing agent, such as ammonia, is injected into 
the exhaust and both are channelled through a catalyst where NO

X

 
emissions are reduced. These systems are being successfully used 
for large stationary source applications which operate under 
constant, high load conditions. 
A number of disadvantages are apparent for the use of 
current technology SCR systems on ships. The SCR system is 
effective only over a narrow range of exhaust temperatures. The 
effectiveness of the system is decreased at reduced temperatures 
exhibited during engine operation at partial loads. Also, excess 
ammonia in the exhaust (referred to as ``ammonia slip'') can occur 
during transient operation, where control of optimum ammonia 
injection is difficult. However, non-toxic urea can be used in 
place of toxic ammonia. 
SCR is currently being used in the South Coast region on 
three new ships built with the technology incorporated (not 
retrofitted). Retrofitting ships with this technology is 
problematic and raises significant space and cost concerns. The 
SCR systems are very bulky and require high investment, 
operational, and maintenance costs. 
(

f

) Speed Reduction.
 A potential operational method for reducing NO

X

 is speed 
reduction. By reducing speed, the load requirements on the 
engine are reduced. Speed reduction cannot be applied to all 
different ship types and sizes in the same manner, and may be 
beneficial only for certain types and sizes. Also, speed 
reduction does not address emissions from auxiliary engines. In 
addition, many coastal areas already have factors that limit 
vessel speed; for example, amount of traffic, distance to the 
shore and port, and water depth. Since speed reduction will 
affect the amount of cargo transported within a specified time, 
additional transport capacity or travel time must be accounted 
for when calculating emission benefits from such a strategy. EPA 
requests comments on how speed reduction could be figured into 
the fee scheme. 
The technologies listed above are not intended to be an all- 
inclusive list of potential emission reduction technologies. EPA 
requests comments on other technologies that may be employed to 
reduce emission of NO

X

 from diesel marine engines. Comments 
should address the emission reduction potential, technological 
feasibility, cost, and safety issues of additional NO

X

 reduction 
methods.

(c) Control Strategies_Discount for Using Port Facilities While Hotelling.
 As noted earlier, marine vessels account for approximately 12 percent of all NO

X

 emissions from both mobile and stationary sources in the State of California. According to the Booz-Allen & Hamilton
study, emissions from maneuvering and hotelling activities make up a large portion of those emissions. That report
shows that maneuvering and hotelling activities by commercial vessels contribute an average of approximately 64.9
tons of NO

X

 to local air quality every day (Booz-Allen report, p. A-2). This amount is equal to an average of 16 percent of
daily average NO

X

 emissions from all fishing, harbor, and commercial vessels that use these ports. For the South Coast, ship berthing
and other ship port operations for commercial vessels contribute approximately 26 tons of NO

X

 emissions per day, of which 16.5 tons are attributable solely to hotelling operations. Emissions from vessels at
port affect local ambient air quality in the same way as stationary sources, in that the vessels assume the characteristics
of large stationary plants when they are berthed in a port. According to the Sierra report, ``total SO

X

 and NO

X

 emissions from marine vessels currently exceed the corresponding total (i.e., combined emissions) for the 100 largest
SO

X

 and NO

X

 stationary sources in California'' (Sierra Report, p. 70), which includes all of the state's larger power plants,
oil refineries, and cement plants. This huge contribution is in large part because the stationary sources are subject
to emission controls while the marine vessels currently are not. A significant portion of the time a ship spends in
a port is spent moored or at anchor, for loading or unloading purposes. In addition, vessels also spend time waiting
for a berth. Typically, during the loading and unloading periods, a vessel uses its own engines to generate power for
steam generation, auxiliary electrical power, hot water, and so on. This is referred to as hotelling. In this respect,
ships act like stationary power plants while in port, contributing large amounts of NO

X

 emissions to local air quality in the same way as stationary sources. There are several reasons why ships use their
own power sources for hotelling. First, it is simpler for a ship to continue using its own power instead of taking the
time to tap into port power facilities. Second, it is difficult and time-consuming to start a ship's very large primary
and auxiliary engines once they have been shut off. Third, shore and vessel power characteristics and connecting
hardware are sometimes incompatible. Because the time spent in port is relatively short, it often does not seem worth
the trouble to spend the time connecting to port facilities or even ensuring that such connections are possible. To
reduce these emission levels, it is necessary to encourage ship operators to use port power facilities instead of
generating power on board. The proposed control strategy will accomplish this by providing a discount to the port
fees described in the previous section for ships that use port power facilities. The amount of the discount is proposed
to be equal to the average contribution to NO

X

 emissions levels from commercial vessels attributable to hotelling. This is because cold ironing would reduce NO

X

 emission by an equivalent amount. On a statewide basis, the Booz-Allen & Hamilton study estimates the portion
of average daily NO

X

 emissions attributable to hotelling of commercial vessels to be 7.38 percent (Booz-Allen report. p. A-2).
Requiring vessels to use port power facilities will reduce discharges of NO

X

 from these vessels by an equivalent amount. Therefore, using the Booz-Allen data, the amount of the discount for using
port power facilities would be 7.38 percent. If average daily contribution of NO

X

 emissions by commercial vessels is limited to the South Coast, the relevant reduction is 24.12 percent, which would
be associated with an equivalent discount. EPA requests comments on these discount levels and whether the average
state or South Coast figures should be used. As described above, EPA proposes to consider maneuvering (berthing)
operations in calculation of the base fee.
 Berthing operations must be powered by the ship's engine; ships cannot be powered by onshore power plants during those
maneuvers. In addition, even if such emissions could be eliminated, berthing operations account for only about 9
percent of total NO

X

 emissions from commercial vessels. Therefore, EPA is not considering additional fee discounts for reductions in
berthing emissions. 




The primary argument against offering a discount for using local onshore power facilities when at port is that using
those port facilities simply displaces emissions from one area to another. In other words, although the ship is not
discharging NO

X

 and SO

X

, the power plant that is supplying the electricity is. Thus, hotelling will cause an increased demand for electricity
from the power plant, which will result in an increase in electric output from that utility. The power plant, in turn,
will increase emissions to meet that increased demand.

EPA does not believe this is a concern for the South Coast region for at least three reasons. First, approximately half
of the power generated in California is generated by technologies that do not generate harmful ground-level ozone-producing
air pollutants.
 Second, the NO

X

 emissions that are discharged by the generation of electricity using technologies based on petroleum products (primarily
natural gas) are much less than those that are generated by today's ships for the same amount of energy.
 This is because onshore electric power plants operate at optimal steady-state conditions, are required to use emission
control systems, and generally use cleaner fuel than that used in ships. Finally, the power plants from which the electricity
would be drawn for hotelling are located far from South Coast population centers. This means that any increase in emissions
at the power generation source will occur away from the South Coast area, in areas that have less severe, if any, air
quality problems. 





EPA solicits comments on whether the full discount as proposed above should be allowed, or if that discount should
be reduced to account for the displaced emissions. EPA also solicits comments on how the discount is calculated. 
(d) Control Strategies_Discount for Staying Outside the Region.  Emissions from marine vessels operating in the
Santa Barbara Channel can be transported onshore by prevailing winds and can contribute to onshore air pollution
in the South Central Coast Air Basin (which includes Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties). Particularly
of concern (for FIP purposes) are the offshore NO

X

 emissions that drift onshore and that can impact Ventura County's air quality. As discussed in section III.H. of this
NPRM, ships are estimated to represent 15 percent of Ventura's total current NO

X

 emissions. Most of the offshore sources that contribute to NO

X

 emissions include: Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) activity (which represents support crew and supply boats), exploratory
drilling vessels and oil platforms, tugs and tankers, recreational marine, U.S. Navy and Coast Guard vessels, and
large foreign and U.S. vessels. 
Because of the reported 1990 emission inventory from marine vessel activity that occurs offshore and external requests
to evaluate moving the shipping channel lanes, EPA is proposing to offer, as part of the emission reduction strategy
described in this proposal, incentives for ships to use a relocated Santa Barbara shipping channel. This relocated
channel would take marine vessels farther from land and reduce the amount of emissions that are transported inland.
These incentives are intended to reduce the impact of marine vessel emissions on ozone concentrations in Ventura
County. 
The proposed control strategy for Ventura County targets both NO

X

 and VOCs for reduction in order to attain the ozone standard. Because the emissions from marine vessels represent
a substantial portion (CARB estimates show approximately 12 percent statewide) of total emissions of NO

X

, control of marine vessel emissions is potentially an important control strategy. EPA's proposed control strategy
focuses primarily on the reduction of NO

X

 emissions from vessels, since they are nominal contributors to VOCs in Ventura County. 
Summertime meteorological data for Ventura County indicate that emissions from marine vessels could be transported
to Ventura County by prevailing air currents. This is also consistent with the meteorological data for the specific
episode days chosen for photochemical modeling. The meteorological data indicates that the emissions from marine
vessels could be transported onshore, and therefore have the potential to impact ozone concentration in Ventura
County. However, the actual impact of the emissions on the ozone concentrations in Ventura County depends on the time
the emissions arrive in the onshore area as well as the interaction of the marine vessel emissions with the emissions
from other sources. 
CARB has suggested that emissions from up to 100 miles out from the coastline have a significant impact on ozone concentration
in the California coastal air basins. EPA is in the process of evaluating CARB's data to justify this distance. EPA
believes that these uncontrolled mobile sources have the potential to affect the air quality onshore. EPA further
believes that the farther out from shore the ship's activity, presumably, the more apt those emissions are to disperse
before reaching the coast. EPA requests comment on the effect of offshore activity on onshore air quality and the proper
distance to which the channel should be moved. 
EPA believes that it has authority to offer port charge rebates for operational changes such as controlling speed,
cold ironing or, as described here, moving offshore. EPA FIP authority under section 110(c) of the Clean Air Act allows
EPA to regulate sources contributing to air quality degradation provided EPA is not so prohibited. While the U.S.
has historically allowed that nations do not have sovereignty in truly international waters, a surcharge provision
of this type is significantly different. It applies charges to ships while they are in U.S. waters, and merely discounts
the charges in light of operational changes the ships make, at their option, within and outside U.S. waters. EPA is
unaware of any provision of a statute or international agreement that would prohibit such an approach.

In addition, the U.S. Coast Guard is directed to reconcile 
the need for safe access routes with the needs of all other 
reasonable uses of the area involved, and has the experience in 
the areas of vessel traffic management, navigation, and ship 
handling. Also, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA) has been directed by the Department of 
Commerce (DOC) to identify and designate as national marine 
sanctuaries areas of the marine environment and implement 
coordinated plans for the protection and management of those 
areas. Finally, marine vessels operating in or near an IMO 
approved TSS (traffic separation scheme) are subject to Rule 10 
of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at 
Sea. EPA is working with all three groups to ensure that ships 
seeking to move further offshore can travel freely and safely. 

EPA is proposing two different discount strategies to 
encourage ships to move off Ventura's coast. The two methods are 
proposed because it is difficult to quantify the appropriate fee. 
First, EPA does not know the impact of any fee on shippers. 
Second, EPA cannot quantify the exact benefits of moving further 
from Ventura. Finally, EPA cannot compare effects of the 
discounting on emissions reductions for Los Angeles and Ventura. 
EPA requests comments on the fee most likely to move shippers 
offshore of Ventura while still maintaining an incentive to use 
low emission ships in the area. As described above, EPA will 
monitor the fee structure and change it to achieve the intended 
air quality benefits. The first option is a discount of 50 
percent from the fee otherwise applicable to any ship (before the 
hotelling discount is applied) for ships staying 70 miles from 
shore and outside the Ventura Air Basin (under this option a 10 
percent fee is applied to ships in the low emission category). 
The second option would restrict any discounts to those ships 
which avoided the Ventura Air Basin. Thus even a ship in the low 
emission category would pay the highest fee if it entered the 
Ventura Air Basin (under this option a 0 percent fee would be 
applied to ships in the low emission category). This option 
would also offer a 50 percent reduction to ships which avoided 
the basin. Under both options, any ship in the low fee category 
which cold ironed and stayed out of the Ventura Air Basin would 
pay no fee. 

EPA is also considering the option of requiring that 
shipping move outside of the air basin when not berthing or at 
port. To the extent that no fee structure is fully achieving 
its goals, such a requirement may be necessary. EPA requests 
comment on this option. 

(5) Other Non-Air Base Military Installation. 
EPA requests comment on the feasibility and desirability of 
implementing a similar emission control strategy for military 
bases in the FIP areas with non-aircraft mobile sources of 
emissions, such as the Navy's construction base at Port Hueneme 
(with the exception of military vessels due to national security 
concerns as described for military aircraft), which is similar to 
that proposed for military air bases. These bases could be 
included in the proposed military air base control program 
described in section III.D.4.e.(2)(c) simply by expanding the 
definition of covered facilities to include all sources operated 
by the Department of Defense in the control areas. 



5. Impact of the Economic Incentive Programs Rule on Fee 
 Programs in the FIP 



a. Introduction 



The fee programs contained in today's proposal will be 
impacted by the rules and procedures established in EPA's 
Economic Incentives Program (EIP) Rulemaking (NPRM_58 FR 11110, 
February 23, 1993; NFRM due March 15, 1994). The EIP includes 
the Agency's guidance on fee programs and the requirements that 
must be met in order for them to be approvable as a SIP revision. 
It is EPA's intention that the FIP abide by these guidance 
provisions. The EIP, as applied to the FIP, requires that 
emission reductions credited to an economic incentive program be 
surplus to the reductions required by, and credited to, other 
implementation plan provisions to avoid double counting of 
reductions; quantifiable; enforceable at both the State and 
federal levels; consistent with SIP attainment and RFP 
demonstrations; and permanent within the timeframe specified by 
the program. These provisions address primarily the case of an 
economic incentive program in which emission sources are allowed 
to generate and trade emission reduction credits to show 
compliance with emission targets. The proposed FIP does not 
contain such a credits trading program. In addition, and 
directly relevant to the fee programs in the proposed FIP, an 
approvable emissions fee program must contain a provision that 
accounts for the uncertainties inherent in such programs, an 
auditing procedure, and reconciliation procedures; and must also 
contain an implementation schedule and administrative procedures. 
Each of these requirements is summarized below.

b. Requirements Under the EIP 



(1) Surplus.

 All emission reductions achieved from a fee system must be surplus to those already being achieved under other control
strategies in the FIP. The primary concern of the EIP is that the fee system not take credit for or ``double count'' reductions
that are a result of other strategies. It is therefore necessary to define the baseline for the fee program and use this
baseline as a basis for projecting program results. 
Today's proposal clearly satisfies this requirement. The baseline is clearly described in section III.H.2 and EPA
has made certain that there has been no double counting of emissions reductions. 

(2) Quantifiable.

 The fee programs in the FIP must describe how emissions and changes in emissions will be quantified. The program must
specify the minimum required credible, workable, and replicable procedures for quantifying emissions, which could
include emission factor calculations, direct monitoring of usage, and the calculation procedures that will be used.
While today's proposal does not contain a comprehensive description of how EPA will quantify emissions changes caused
by fees, the final FIP will. 

(3) Enforceable.

 A fee program must include adequate enforcement consequences for noncompliance with any source requirements, including
the monitoring, record keeping, and reporting requirements of the program. Since the proposed fee programs will
be federal programs, it is not necessary that they be enforceable by the state, but only federally enforceable. At
this time, EPA has not developed regulatory language delineating the monitoring, record keeping, and reporting
requirements that will be necessary for the FIP. However, EPA intends on producing this language when it promulgates
the fee programs in the final rule and asks for comment on how these requirements should be structured. 

(4) Consistent With SIP Attainment and RFP Demonstrations.

 The EIP states that programs must be consistent with SIP attainment and RFP demonstrations. The fee programs will
be consistent with the SIP attainment demonstration since the requirement of the FIP is to show attainment. The fee
program will not need to be consistent with the RFP demonstrations as EPA is not required to comply with the RFP demonstrations
in the FIPs. 

(5) Permanent.

 The EIP requires that all reductions be permanent within the timeframe specified by the program. The important issue
for this requirement is the determination of the timeframe of the program. The fee programs will most likely have a
timeframe of 1 year and therefore the desired effects during that period are what is important. Since the fees will
have the result of either increased turnover or reduction of usage, and since these will presumably cause permanent
reductions within the 1 year period, then the permanence requirement will be satisfied. 

(6) Uncertainty Provisions.

 The EIP requires that projected emissions reductions from a fee program must be adjusted to reflect the uncertainties
inherent in these programs through the use of a ``program uncertainty factor.'' EPA must specify a value for this factor,
between 0 and 1, which reflects the level of uncertainty inherent in the program. EPA must also include a justification
for this value. This factor must then be applied to the predicted level of emission reductions expected from the fee
program. Today's proposal does not contain an estimate of an uncertainty factor, however, EPA fully intends to use
one in the final promulgation. EPA is not proposing an uncertainty factor at this time because it feels that it does
not have the best information. EPA wants to remain open minded about the range of possible impacts from the fee programs
and asks for comment as to what uncertainty factors should be applied. It should be noted, however, that, as shown in
section III.H, EPA's control strategies do achieve surplus emission reductions and therefore provide for some room
should programs not perform as expected. 

(7) Auditing.

 A fee program must also contain audit procedures designed to evaluate program implementation and track program results.
The auditing methods and the timing must be specified in the FIP. These audits are to be performed at time intervals
consistent with RFP milestones and other emission inventory requirements, which is generally once every three years.
Since OGC has determined that EPA need not satisfy the state's RFP requirements, the time interval requirement under
a FIP is unclear. Since the EIP also specifies that states are free to perform audits at shorter intervals as they deem
appropriate, EPA believes it is free to develop any auditing time interval it deems reasonable and appropriate.

Today's proposal does not contain specific auditing procedures, however, EPA fully intends to specify specific
auditing procedures for each fee program in the final promulgation. EPA invites comments on the auditing procedures
that should be used for each of the fee programs. 



(8) Reconciliation Procedures.

 Program audit provisions for fee programs must also be accompanied by reconciliation procedures, designed to compare
credited emissions with actual emissions. The reconciliation procedures must specify a range of appropriate actions
or revisions to the program requirements (e.g., increase the fee) that will make up for any shortfall between credited
and actual emissions revealed by the audit. Such measures must be automatically executing to the extent necessary
to make up the shortfall, with state action required only to identify which of the specified actions are necessary
to make up the shortfall. Such measures must not require a revision to the SIP to be effectuated once identified by the
state, rather the measures must be built into the original EIP design (or incorporated by reference). As with the auditing
procedures, the EIP directs states to perform reconciliation procedures at time intervals consistent with RFP milestones
and other emission inventory requirements. 

The reconciliation procedures in the EIP clearly indicate that EPA can reconcile a fee program by increasing the fee;
however this increase must execute automatically. This language indicates that EPA, for example, could propose
that if it determines, through the auditing process, that a fee program for a given source category has not yielded
within 10 percent of the predicted effect, it will increase the fees by 50 percent to reconcile this shortfall. 

While EPA fully intends to include reconciliation procedures for each fee program in the final promulgation, this
NPRM does not contain such procedures. EPA invites comment on the the best way to reconcile fee programs should the
program audits show that the effect of a program is not what was estimated. 



(9) Implementation Schedule.

 A fee program in the FIP must include an implementation schedule. The schedule must include dates for notifying potentially
affected sources, as early as possible, about the impending program, initialization and start-up procedures, submittal
requirements from affected sources, and the reconciliation process and any subsequent actions required to make
up for any shortfall that occurs. 

The implementation schedules for each fee program are contained in the detailed discussions of each program. 



(10) Administrative Procedures.

 As part of a fee program, EPA must establish appropriate administrative procedures. For example, a fee program must
ensure the proper administration of the fee collection process. Is should be noted that the EIP contains requirements
for the use of collected fees. These rules do not supersede the Miscellaneous Receipts Act and are therefore not applicable
to the Federal Government in the FIP. 

While EPA fully intends to include administration procedures for each fee program in the final promulgation, this
NPRM does not contain such procedures. EPA asks for comment as to how these procedures should be structured. 



E. Fuels Programs 



1. Reformulated Fuels 





a. Federal Reformulated Gasoline.

 Since the 1970s, gasoline sold in California generally has been subject to two sets of emission related standards:
federal standards promulgated by EPA under the Clean Air Act and California standards set by CARB. Both EPA and CARB
have established two-phase reformulated gasoline programs which affect much or all of California's gasoline. 

Reformulated gasoline, as prescribed by section 211(k) of the Act, is to improve air quality by requiring that gasoline
be reformulated to reduce motor vehicle emissions of toxic and tropospheric ozone-forming compounds. 

On December 15, 1993, the EPA Administrator signed the final rule requiring the sale of reformulated gasoline in the
9 largest metropolitan areas with the worst ozone nonattainment problems in the U.S., as well as in a larger number
of areas which have voluntarily chosen to participate in the program. The Los Angeles Metropolitan Area (which includes
Ventura County) is one of the mandated areas. Sacramento is not among the areas currently slated to receive federal
reformulated gasoline, but a bump-up of Sacramento to ``Severe'' will subject that area to the reformulated gasoline
requirement, effective one year after reclassification. Due to California's reformulated gasoline program described
below, we do not propose to require the sale of federal reformulated gasoline in Sacramento in this FIP. In Los Angeles,
federal Phase I reformulated gasoline will reduce VOC emissions by 13-21 percent beginning in 1995, relative
to base California gasoline and depending on the type of I/M program in place. NO

X

 emissions will remain unchanged (no net increase over baseline NO

X

 levels). Beginning in the year 2000, a more stringent federal Phase II VOC standard will apply and VOC emissions will
be reduced by 16 percent relative to pre-1995 California gasoline, assuming enhanced I/M is in place. In addition,
beginning in the year 2000, EPA is requiring that reformulated gasoline reduce in-use NO

X

 emissions by 6.8 percent, on average, again relative to pre-1995 California fuel.

EPA's 7.8 RVP summertime standard under the federal Phase II volatility control program, which began in 1992, is the
same as California's Phase I reformulated gasoline, which also began in 1992. The detergent requirement is also essentially
equivalent to a CAA requirement affecting all gasoline which is required to begin in 1995, see section 211(l) of the
CAA.

Toxic emissions, overall, are expected to decrease during the high ozone season due to Phase II RVP control. Reductions
in non-exhaust VOC emissions will account for most of this decrease.



b. California Reformulated Gasoline (Phase II).

 The California Phase I reformulated gasoline program began in 1992 and applies to all gasoline sold in the state. It
primarily requires that gasoline meet a 7.8 RVP standard and contain detergents which prevent deposits from accumulating
in fuel injectors and intake valves.

In November 1991 CARB approved regulations for the Phase II reformulated gasoline program that begins on April 1,
1996. The California Phase II reformulated gasoline regulation established standards for eight gasoline characteristics,
briefly summarized below. The 1.8 percent by weight oxygen content refers to wintertime only.








Refineries may choose whether to conform to the flat limits which apply to all batches of gasoline when it is initially
sold from the product facility, or to the average limits which apply to the average of all fuel produced by a given refinery.
In the case of a refiner choosing averaging, the absolute cap or absolute limit also must be met. California is also
allowing the sale of alternative fuel formulations which meet the emission reduction potential of a fuel meeting
the average limits. However, even these alternative gasolines must still meet the cap limits described above. Gasoline
meeting the average limits will reduce VOC and NO

X

 emissions by 17-18 and 13-14 percent (relative to pre-1995), respectively, according to EPA's complex
model as revised in November 1993. Thus, California Phase II gasoline should provide at least as much VOC and NO

X

 emission reductions as the federal Phase II standards.

In its recent rule, EPA determined that fuel meeting California's Phase II standards will produce greater emission
benefits than federal Phase I reformulated gasoline and it was therefore appropriate to exempt California gasoline
from the enforcement procedures for the federal Phase I standards. Thus, there would be no attainment benefit to requiring
federal Phase I reformulated gasoline to be sold in Sacramento, although emissions reductions would be achieved
during the summer of 1995. At this time it appears from the available data that California's fuel achieves as much reduction
as federal Phase II reformulated gasoline and therefore EPA is not proposing any changes to California's gasoline
program today. If later EPA determines that further reductions can be achieved through use of either federal Phase
II reformulated gasoline or some new formulation, EPA will propose appropriate changes to the fuel program in California
as a FIP revision if such reductions are needed.



c. California Reformulated Diesel Fuel.

 On August 21, 1990, EPA finalized its low-sulfur diesel rulemaking. CARB adopted their clean diesel fuel regulations
in November 1988 and on December 26, 1991, enacted their clean diesel fuel program. Both the federal and CARB programs
became effective on October 1, 1993. The two programs are similar, and are designed to substantially reduce sulfate
particulate and NO

X

 emissions, and to allow manufacturers to comply with 1994 and newer emission standards for diesel vehicles. Important
differences exist between California and the federal program, as outlined below.

The EPA program only applies to diesel fuel for use in on-highway vehicles. Trucks, automobiles, and buses would be
affected, for example, but construction and farm equipment would not, unless they chose to use the low-sulfur diesel
fuel. The regulation sets a 0.05 percent by weight sulfur limit for all on-road diesels, and requires a minimum cetane
index of 40 or maximum 35 percent by volume aromatics percentage. The current maximum sulfur content in on-highway
diesel fuel is approximately 500 ppm. Since direct measurement of aromatics is a somewhat complicated procedure,
EPA chose to use a minimum cetane index as a surrogate for capping aromatics. Few refiners have had trouble meeting
this requirement and those who cannot can sell fuel into the nonroad market. The price differential between high-sulfur
and low-sulfur fuels is expected to be approximately 2$/gallon once initial distribution blips have resolved
themselves.

<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 





The California program applies to vehicular diesel fuel. Essentially any vehicle with wheels, including construction
and farm equipment, is covered. The regulation establishes a 500 ppm sulfur limit as well as a 10 percent cap on aromatics
(20 percent for small refiners). Diesel normally has about 30 percent aromatics. California and EPA believe aromatics
contribute to the formation of NO

X

 and particulate emissions. California includes an equivalency provision which allows refiners to make diesel with
more than 10 percent aromatics if engine testing demonstrates equivalent emissions.

Most if not all of the large California refiners are pursuing higher-aromatic equivalent fuels. While a few oil companies
have received CARB certification for their equivalent fuels, only Chevron has gone public with its formulation at
this time. One of Chevron's alternatives has 19 percent aromatics with 200 ppm sulfur and a cetane number of 59. The
company estimates that it can manufacture this fuel at an incremental cost of 6-7 cents per gallon. This is about
half the incremental cost to make a strict 10 percent aromatics fuel. California has granted temporary waivers from
the requirements provided the refiner pays 6$/gallon into a trust fund. However, prices in California initially
jumped far more than 20 cents per gallon and California is in the process of investigating its rule.

EPA believes that California's rule is likely to achieve NO

X

 emissions reductions which will not be achieved by the federal program. CARB estimates these reductions will be approximately
4-7 percent of diesel engine NO

X

. EPA therefore is not proposing any changes to California's diesel fuel regulations. EPA is working with California
to help understand the reasons behind the huge price rise, supply, and injector/pump seal problems and will take note
of any change to California's rule. The South Coast and Ventura have been using the low-sulfur fuel since 1985 without
any problems.

Even if California were to relax its rule, EPA's diesel fuel standards still apply. However, since the FIP takes credit
for the California rule which delivers more NO

X

 credits than the federal rule, EPA may have to propose additional FIP reductions if the California rule were to be relaxed.



F. Severe Area Requirements for Sacramento



1. Introduction




As discussed in section III.B.3., EPA is proposing attainment demonstrations for 1999 and 2005 for the Sacramento
FIP. If EPA promulgates a 2005 attainment demonstration, the Sacramento area will be reclassified as a severe ozone
nonattainment area and become responsible for meeting all applicable deadlines and requirements for SIP purposes,
which include the requirements outlined in section III.B.3.e. As part of the alternative proposal for 2005, EPA will
address the additional severe area requirements with the following.



2. Employee Commute Options Program





a. Introduction and Statutory Requirements.

 In the alternative that EPA bumps up Sacramento to ``Severe'' and establishes a 2005 attainment date, EPA proposes
that an Employee Commute Options (ECO) program be included in the FIP package. Because more people are driving than
ever before and they are driving longer distances, the ECO provision was included in the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990 at section 182(d)(1)(B) (42 U.S.C. 7511a(d)(1)(B)). Currently, increasing numbers of drivers and vehicle
miles traveled (VMT) offset a large portion of the emissions reductions achieved through producing and selling vehicles
that operate more cleanly. Without limits on increasing vehicle travel, the emissions caused by more vehicles being
driven more miles under more congested conditions will outweigh the emissions reduced per vehicle from cleaner fuels
and improved emission control technologies. Ultimately, this will result in an overall increase in motor vehicle
emissions.

Section 182(d)(1)(B) of the CAA requires State or nonattainment areas with ozone pollution levels defined as ``Severe''
or ``Extreme'' under the CAA to develop and implement an ECO program designed to reduce work-related vehicle trips
and vehicle miles travelled during peak commuting periods. Specifically, section 182(d)(1)(B) requires employers
with 100 or more employees to participate in a trip reduction program. These employers must submit compliance plans
to the state or governing agency two years after an ECO regulation is submitted to EPA for inclusion in the SIP. These
employer compliance plans must convincingly demonstrate an increase in the average passenger occupancy (APO) of
their employees who commute to work during the peak travel period by no less than 25 percent above the average vehicle
occupancy (AVO) of the nonattainment area during the peak travel period. These compliance plans must also convincingly
demonstrate that employers will meet the 25 percent increase APO target no later than four years after the ECO regulation
is submitted to EPA.


b. ECO program requirements and Sacramento ECO regulation implementation approach. 

The proposed ECO regulation meets the basic ECO program requirements:



(1) calculate an AVO for the nonattainment area or for each zone if the area is divided into zones;
(2) specify target APO(s) which are no less than 25 percent above the AVO(s);
(3) include enforcement procedures to ensure that employers develop and implement compliance plans; and
(4) provide an ECO program that has a process for ensuring that compliance plans are a ``convincing'' compliance demonstration.



The proposed ECO regulation uses data collected from the 1991 Caltrans (California Department of Transportation)
State Travel Survey to produce the baseline AVO for the nonattainment area and the target APO for the regulation. This
survey estimated Sacramento regional AVO to be 1.11 in 1991. It is EPA's opinion that no substantial changes in travel
patterns have taken place since that time such that there is reason to believe this number has changed since 1991. Consequently,
a 25 percent increase in AVO produces a regional APO target of 1.38; the performance target included within the ECO
regulation.
The Caltrans Statewide Travel Study attempted to estimate the number of persons telecommuting by asking the question,
``do you work at home?''. This survey question does not distinguish between those who work at home because they are
self-employed and their business is located in their home and those who work away from home but participate in an employer-sponsored
telecommuting program. EPA believes that a large percentage of those who work at home would be self-employed. Consequently,
any APO target based on the Caltrans study and including all of these home workers as telecommuters would be inflated
by some degree and result in a regional target APO of 1.46. EPA has chosen the 1.38 APO target because it is comparatively
a more reliable baseline AVO estimate.
The third ECO program requirement concerns sufficient enforcement procedures. Through the provisions of the ECO
regulation, EPA must be able to invoke penalties that are severe enough to provide an adequate incentive for employers
to comply and no less than the expected cost of compliance. Section 113 of the Act provides the statutory authority
for federal enforcement and the ability to assess penalties for violations under this ECO regulation. EPA may assess
civil or criminal penalties up to $25,000 per day per violation; however, Section 113 requires EPA to consider the
size of the business, the economic impact of the penalty on the business, the violator's compliance history and good
faith efforts to comply, the duration of the violation, payment of penalties for previous similar violations, the
economic benefit of noncompliance, and the seriousness of the violation in assessing a penalty fee.
Finally, Section 182(d)(1)(B) requires that employer compliance plans ``convincingly demonstrate'' prospective
compliance with the target APO. EPA's 

ECO Guidance 

defines four ECO regulation design options for eliciting compliance plans that make this convincing demonstration.
An ECO regulation may:



(1) provide for effective plan-by-plan review of employer-selected measures to ensure the high quality of compliance
plans and that unconvincing compliance plans will be rejected;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940505-1-00183 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


(2) contain a convincing minimum set of measures that all employers must implement to reach the target APO;
(3) provide that failure by the employer to meet the target APO will result in implementation of a regulation-specified,
multi-measure contingency plan designed to meet the target APO; or
(4) include financial penalties and/or compliance incentives for employers who fail to meet the target APO that are
large enough to provide a significant prospective incentive for the employer to design and implement an effective
compliance plan.



An option can be used by itself or in combination with others. The proposed ECO regulation uses a combination of the
first and the fourth program design options.


In sum, the proposed ECO regulation meets the basic ECO program requirements. Consequently, the proposed ECO regulation
may be adopted by a state or locality to meet the requirements of Section 182(d)(1)(B). A general discussion of its
requirements is included below in section (c). The detailed proposed ECO regulation is included in this Federal Implementation
Plan NPRM at 40 CFR 52.2999.


c. Employer and compliance plan requirements. 

The proposed ECO regulation requires the following seven actions of employers:



(1) register with EPA as an employer subject to the regulation;
(2) designate an Employee Transportation Coordinator (ETC) at each work location;
(3) conduct an annual APO survey of its employees at each work location to determine employees' current commute patterns
and report the results of the APO survey to the EPA;
(4) develop and submit to the EPA before March 1, 1997, 2 years from program inception, and in subsequent years as required
by the regulation, trip reduction plans that describe activities to be implemented at the location under an ECO program;
(5) implement the ECO program described in the approved trip reduction plan;
(6) no later than March 1, 1999, 4 years from program inception, increase the average passenger occupancy (APO) at
each location by not less than 25 percent over the average vehicle occupancy (AVO) for Sacramento ECO program area;
(7) maintain the target APO upon achieving it.



An employer failing to accomplish any or all of these actions would be in violation of the proposed ECO regulation and
would be subject to penalties under section 113 of the Clean Air Act.


The required components of an employer's compliance plan are as follows:



(1) the name of the employer, address of the work location, and name, title, and signature of the Employee Transportation
Coordinator (ETC) at the work location;
(2) the results of the most recent APO survey and a description of the procedure used to conduct the APO survey;
(3) a description of the physical and transportation service characteristics of the work location, and demographic,
work, and travel-related characteristics of the employee population;
(4) a description of ECO strategies currently implemented that provide commute alternative incentives to employees
at the work location and additional ECO strategies the employer will implement at the work location;
(5) activities planned by the employer to implement the ECO program and a time schedule for implementation of the program;
and
(6) a description of the process by which the employer will periodically monitor and review progress toward the APO
target.



Employer plans will be certified by a third party for completeness in order to reduce EPA's implementation burden.
EPA will approve or disapprove plans. The Air Pollution Control Districts for the Sacramento nonattainment area
will have the right of first refusal to certify plans of employers in their district. Should one or more APCDs decline
the opportunity to certify employers, another organization or other organizations will be designated by EPA as plan
certifiers.
By March 1, 1999, all employers must submit either a maintenance plan describing either how the employer will maintain
the target APO, or an update compliance plan describing what additional measures the employer will take to reach the
APO target within one year. An employer's update compliance plan must discuss good faith efforts to achieve the target
APO, provide an explanation of why the ECO strategies included in the last plan did not produce the target APO, and discuss
how the update compliance plans will cause the employer to achieve the target within one year if the target has not been
met by then as required.

As part of the FIP, EPA is including a parking cash out regulation. Under this regulation, employers would offer employees
the option of taking the cash value of employer paid parking as a financial incentive to reduce solo commuting. Where
applicable, employers would be able to include a parking cash out incentive as part of their ECO program trip reduction
plans. 



d. ECO rule development issues. 

 Because the following components are common to other trip reduction regulations in California or are discussed extensively
in EPA's 

ECO Guidance

, EPA wishes to discuss these issues and the agency's rationale for not incorporating them into the proposed ECO regulation.

First, this proposed ECO regulation does not allow for APO averaging, banking or trading. Including such a component
within the ECO regulation would add an administrative and enforcement burden beyond EPA's present resources and
is perhaps better administered at the local level. Should the state or local agencies develop an ECO regulation with
APO averaging, banking, or trading consistent with EPA's 

ECO Guidance, 

EPA would accept such a regulation for review and possible approval and incorporation into the SIP as a replacement
for the proposed federal ECO program. 

Related to the issue of APO averaging and trading is the issue of consolidated compliance plans. The proposed ECO regulation
requires employers to achieve the APO target at each work location. Again, this is due to EPA's administrative and
enforcement resource constraints. Therefore, to provide this type of individual employer accountability for achieving
the APO target, the proposed ECO regulation does not allow consolidated compliance plans. A single employer with
multiple work locations or a confederation of employers with geographically related work locations, such as a business
park, are thus not allowed to average their APO survey results together to achieve the target APO. However, the proposed
ECO regulation does not preclude employers from forming or participating in transportation management associations
or using complementary ridesharing and commuter matching services to reduce trips to their respective work locations
and promote ridesharing, so long as they demonstrate compliance at each individual worksite. 

Second, this ECO proposed regulation does not divide the Sacramento ECO program area into subregional AVO zones or
target areas for the purpose of achieving the target APO. Subregional AVO zones or target areas would allow different
geographic subregions to start from different existing AVO baselines for the purpose of calculating the APO target.
Thus, different subregions could have different APO targets, but still meet the performance requirement of Section
182(d)(1)(B), a 25 percent increase in APO from the AVO baseline. 

AVO zones may be applicable within the Sacramento ECO program area if there are significant subregional differences
in commute patterns, land use, transit availability, and baseline AVO. However, EPA has no information to suggest
that these differences do exist. To conclusively assess whether or not these differences exist and develop subregional
AVO zones would require detailed surveys of home to work commute patterns in the Sacramento ECO program area to supplement
1990 census data and the 1991 Caltrans State Travel Survey. Should California conduct such surveys and determine
it appropriate, the State could include AVO zones in its ECO SIP. 

As a third and final issue, this regulation does not allow for APO crediting from the use of satellite work stations.
Cold start emissions from motor vehicles are a significant proportion of motor vehicle emissions and will become
an even larger proportion as future motor vehicles run cleaner. Consequently, EPA believes that satellite work stations
are a relatively ineffective strategy for reducing vehicle emissions and vehicle trips unless they can reduce a significantly
large vehicle miles traveled component of a work trip or allow an employee to substitute a commute mode of travel other
than a motor vehicle. Based on its understanding of Sacramento commuting patterns, EPA concluded that this kind of
vehicles miles traveled reduction through use of satellite work stations would not occur in Sacramento and has therefore
not included credit for them in the FIP. However, this proposed ECO regulation does provide for telecommuting from
home as an acceptable trip reduction strategy in employer compliance plans. EPA believes that telecommuting from
home is a very effective trip reduction measure because an entire commute trip is eliminated when an employee works
out of his or her home.

<TEXT>
 



In summary, although EPA's 

ECO Guidance

 addresses the use of averaging, banking, and trading of APO credits as well as using AVO zones, EPA does not believe
these elements are appropriate for the proposed ECO program. APO averaging, banking, and trading would add an administrative
and enforcement burden beyond EPA's present resources and is perhaps better administered at the local level. In the
case of AVO zones, EPA has no information suggesting that significant subregional differences in commute patterns,
land use, transit availability, and baseline AVO exist to justify this approach. Finally, while EPA may approve a
local or state ECO regulation incorporating crediting of satellite work stations under very restrictive conditions,
EPA has chosen not to credit satellite work stations in the proposed ECO regulation for the reasons stated above. 

3. RACT for 25 Ton Per Year Sources



a. Applicable requirements. 

As discussed in the General Preamble for Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (57 FR 13521),
for ``Severe'' areas, reasonable available control technology (RACT) must be applied to any source that emits or
has the potential to emit 25 tons per year of VOC or NO

X

. If the Sacramento area is bumped-up from ``Serious'' (major source = 50 tons per year) to ``Severe'', in order to address
this requirement, RACT regulations must be developed for sources which are caught by the more stringent major source
definition. EPA believes that between current State and local regulatory requirements and today's proposed FIP
regulations (Section III.C.), there should be few, if any, uncontrolled stationary sources which emit more than
25 tons per year. However, EPA plans to continue working with the State and local agencies to identify all stationary
sources which have the potential to emit greater than 25 tons per year or more of VOC and NO

X

 and apply RACT regulations as needed. 



4. New Source Review 





a. Background. 

Today's proposed rule is based on the New Source Review rules in the affected air pollution control districts (APCDs).
It includes necessary revisions to those rules that will satisfy severe area requirements, including a major source
definition of 25 tons/year and a 1.3:1 offset ratio requirement. The rule also incorporates EPA's permitting requirements
(primarily those at 40 CFR 51.165), and changes necessitated by the 1990 CAAA. EPA is expecting to shortly publish
proposed changes to the regulations at 40 CFR 51.165 in order to codify and interpret changes to nonattainment permitting
requirements pursuant to the CAAA. As appropriate, EPA will rely on that proposal as guidance in taking final action
on today's rule. 

If EPA's final action includes a severe-area classification for the Sacramento FIP areas, this rule will apply in
each of the affected APCDs. EPA's main goal in following the structure and, where possible, the actual language of
the existing rules is to provide a rule that is easy for the local APCDs to adopt and implement and familiar to industrial
sources subject to NSR, and thus provide the least disruption when incorporated in the local programs. However, should
the local APCDs fail to adopt the necessary requirements, EPA will implement the severe area NSR requirements through
today's rule. 

EPA is specifically soliciting comment on the issue of the source size affected by the rule. As the rule is structured
in this proposal, it requires permits of all sources currently required to obtain permits at the APCDs. EPA has several
reasons for including this requirement. First, EPA wants to make this rule as similar to the current District rules
as possible so that the Districts can be reasonably certain that adopting this rule will lead to rapid SIP approval
such that EPA will move into an oversight rather than permit issuance mode. The current District rules use an accumulation
structure that sums all emissions increases, and triggers substantive requirements based on that accumulation.
EPA considered making the rule only apply to sources with a potential to emit greater than 25 tpy. However, because
the Districts' emissions inventory is based on actual emissions rather than potential emissions, EPA would be unable
to know clearly to which sources the rule applies. Second, EPA is concerned that excising those portions of the rules
related to minor sources will lead to increased confusion by sources as to jurisdiction and applicable requirements.
Third, EPA believes that not including minor sources will result in a rule capturing fewer emissions than the current
District rules, a result contrary to the intent of the FIP. On the other hand, EPA is concerned about the effective use
of its resources, and about the burden placed on companies constructing very small sources having to obtain air pollution
permits from two agencies. Even so, because EPA has the ability to delegate today's rule to the Districts, the effects
of dual permitting should be short lived. EPA is therefore soliciting comment on whether to include minor sources
or not, and, if a commenter suggests excluding minor sources, EPA solicits comment on the most effective way to exclude
minor sources while maintaining the structure of the rule.

b. Overview of Rule Requirements.

 There are three sections of the rule that together establish 
the NSR requirements for the FIP areas. The first, 40 CFR 
52.3000, describes which sources are required to obtain a pre-
construction permit, and sets out most of the procedural 
requirements involved in permitting. The second section, 40 CFR 
52.3001, contains the substantive requirements related to New 
Source Review, including control technology determinations and 
offset requirements. The third section, 40 CFR 52.3002, 
describes the procedure EPA will use to determine the amount of 
creditable reductions available and authorize them for use as 
offsets. 
 In general, the rule is designed to meet each of the severe 
area NSR requirements mandated by the Act, meet each applicable 
requirement for State and local NSR rules as set forth in 40 CFR 
51.165, as well as be consistent with EPA's policies for 
permitting. 
 The rule requires that any source
 owner proposing to 
construct an emitting piece of equipment obtain a permit prior to 
construction of that equipment. A permit applicant must provide 
EPA all information necessary to process the permit. Once all 
such information is received by EPA, the application is 
administratively complete and EPA will begin the process of 
analysis and permit preparation, and will then issue or deny the 
permit. Except for certain small sources, EPA will present a 
draft permit for public notice and provide an opportunity for 
comment. 




The substantive requirements that may apply to construction 
or modification of certain larger emission units include: Best 
Available Control Technology (BACT), offsets, statewide 
compliance, and alternative siting analysis, and are discussed 
below. 
(1) Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER). LAER is required for any emission unit construction or 
modification where the potential emissions of that unit exceed 
ten pounds per day. This requirement is consistent with the 
Clean Air Act and is based on the requirements of the Districts' 
rules. The applicable Clean Air Act control technology 
requirement is Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate (LAER) (CAA 
section 173(a)(2)). The District rules use the term Best 
Available Control Technology, but define it to meet the LAER 
requirement. Therefore, as used in today's rule, the term ``BACT'' 
satisfies CAA section 173(a)(2). 
(2) Offsets. Today's rule implements the offset requirement mandated by 
the Act for severe areas by adding a 1.3:1 offset ratio to the 
base District rule. The rule triggers the offset requirement once 
the potential to emit of the source exceeds 7,500 pounds per 
quarter (approximately 15 tons per year). Once the source 
exceeds the offset trigger, all subsequent emissions increases 
are required to be offset at this ratio. 
(3) Statewide Compliance. The owner or operator of all major new sources and 
modifications is required to demonstrate that all major sources 
under his or her ownership or control within the state are in 
compliance or on a schedule for compliance with all Clean Air Act 
requirements. This requirement has been in effect since the 1977 
Clean Air Act amendments, and is already part of all of the 
District rules. 
(4) Alternative Siting Analysis. The requirement for an alternative siting analysis is found 
in section 173(a)(5) of the Clean Air Act. An applicant for a 
major new source or modification is required to perform an 
analysis of alternative sites, sizes, production processes and 
environmental control techniques and demonstrate that the 
benefits of the source significantly outweigh the environmental 
and social costs of construction of the source at that location. 
Today's rule implements the alternative siting analysis 
requirement at 40 CFR 52.3001 (c)(7). 


c. Existing NSR Rules.

 The five Districts affected by today's Rule are all within 
the same air basin and Metropolitan Statistical Area. While 
each District adopts NSR rules independently, all but one of the 
Districts' rules are similar in structure and substance. Feather 
River Air Quality Management District's rules have similar 
definitions and substantially similar requirements as the other 
Disticts, but differ in minor structural and other respects. 
Today's rule is similar to the existing rules in Sacramento 
Metropolitan Air Quality Management District, Placer Air 
Pollution Control District, Yolo-Solano Air Pollution Control 
District and El Dorado Air Pollution Control District.
 
However, today's rule is numbered differently and is written to 
address only ozone precursors. 





None of the District NSR rules in the State Implementation 
Plan currently meet all the requirements of the 1990 CAAA. On 
January 15, 1993, EPA found that Feather River AQMD, El Dorado 
APCD, Placer APCD, and Yolo-Solano APCD failed to submit NSR 
rules meeting certain requirements mandated by the CAAA. 
However, Feather River AQMD, Placer APCD, and Yolo-Solano APCD 
have since submitted rules for inclusion into the State 
Implementation Plan. EPA expects submittals from El Dorado APCD 
and Sacramento Metropolitan AQMD in the next year. Because all 
of these rules were written to only meet the requirements for 
serious nonattainment areas, they do not meet the requirements 
for severe nonattainment areas. 




d. Changes From Original APCD Rules. 

(1) Changes to Address Severe Area Requirements. In order to satisfy the provisions required by the Clean Air Act for
severe areas, EPA has included several requirements in 
today's rule which differ from those of the current Districts' 
rules. The changes include the addition of a more stringent 
major source threshold and a more stringent offset ratio. These 
requirements are in accordance with Section 182(e) of the CAA. 
The minimum size threshold for a major source is 25 tons per year 
and the lowest acceptable offset ratio is 1.3 to 1.

<TEXT>
 



(2) Changes to Address Federal Approvability. Significant changes in today's rule include deletion or 
revision of certain sections which exist in the Districts' 
current rules, as well as the inclusion of new sections to 
address federal requirements. 
 Federal new source review at 40 CFR 51.165 applies to 
certain source categories which were exempt from District new 
source review requirements. Therefore, such exemptions are 
excluded. Some of the District rules allow trading between 
different precursors of a secondary pollutant. As EPA does not 
currently allow trading between either of the ozone precursor 
criteria pollutants addressed in this rule, this rule does not, 
as proposed, allow such trading. In addition, 40 CFR 52.3000 
contains wording which emphasizes the federal enforceability of 
an Authority to Construct and its validity for the life of the 
source. In order to match EPA's enforcement authority over past 
violations, and to be consistent with requirements in EPA's 
Operating Permits Program (40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)), today's rule 
requires retention of records for five years. 
 This rule contains certain other provisions which are not in 
the current District rules. A subsection is included in this 
rule to address the minimum offset ratio for emission reductions 
achieved from mobile sources. Furthermore, the ERC Authorization 
includes provisions to certify that ERCs are surplus at time of 
use, that prior shutdown credits are federally approvable, and 
that ERCs from non-permitted sources are surplus, permanent, 
enforceable, and quantifiable. 
(3) Changes to Address Federal Implementation. Some significant changes in the APCD rule are necessary for 
federal implementation. Today's rule excludes all references to 
requirements contained in state law. All district fee 
requirements are removed and are replaced with a provision 
allowing EPA to collect fees. Upon delegation of authority to 
implement and enforce any portion of this NSR rule, EPA will 
cease to collect the fees associated with that portion of this 
rule, and the delegated agency will calculate and collect fees in 
accordance with the fee rules of that agency. 
 Language was added to section 52.3001 to provide the 
opportunity to request a public hearing as provided by 40 CFR 
124.12. Language was also added to section 52.3000 to allow for 
petition to the Environmental Appeals Board for review and 
reconsideration within 30 days of any final decision issued 
pursuant to this NSR rule, including decisions made by a 
delegated agency pursuant to this NSR rule. A petition for 
review can also be filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals as 
provided in section 307(b) of the Act. 
 Because this rule is explicitly intended for preconstruction 
review for ozone precursors, it does not reference other criteria 
pollutants nor District operating permits programs. 
 The ERC Authorization section of this Rule allows sources to 
meet the offset requirements of this Rule through use of the 
existing District banking system. Functions of the District 
Banks and District Priority Reserve Banks are not affected by 
today's Rule. 


e. Dual Permit Application and Review. 

Today's proposed NSR Rule does not replace the Districts' 
existing permitting programs. New or modified sources of ozone 
precursors must continue to meet the applicable District NSR 
requirements. This may result in sources of such pollutants 
having to apply for permits from both the EPA and the District in 
which the source is located.
 As a practical matter, however, 
because EPA has maintained the structure and requirements of the 
existing District Rules, by meeting the requirements of this 
``bumped up'' rule, the source will have also met the District NSR 
requirements. Additional preparation in the form of permit 
applications, modeling, or research on the part of the applicant 
would be minimal, if required at all. EPA has no statutory 
authority to repeal or supplant the existing State or local laws, 
nor would this be desirable since the existing District 
permitting programs regulate the emissions of pollutants not 
covered by this rule. 




One difficulty EPA has encountered in proposing this ``dual 
system'' is how to operate federal emission reduction credit 
``banks'' that meet federal requirements and still preserve the 
integrity of existing District banks. As required by the Act and 
set forth in section 40 CFR 52.3001 of this rule, new sources or 
modifications that emit ozone precursors above an established 
threshold must obtain offsets. Under current District programs, 
emission reduction credits can be certified and obtained from 
District banks to meet offset requirements. However, to be 
creditable for use as offsets under this rule, EPA must ensure 
that the credits in the District banks meet federal approvability 
criteria as set forth in the Emission Trading Policy Statement 
(ETPS, 51 FR 43815) and in the General Preamble to Title I at (57 
FR 13553). 
 The ERC authorization process described in today's rule 
would allow emissions reductions to be certified directly by EPA 
and would also allow sources to use ERCs which have previously 
been certified by a District rule and authorized to meet federal 
NSR requirements. EPA requests comment on today's proposal and 
alternative methods that would preserve the integrity of the 
District banks under the proposed ``dual'' permitting system. 


f. Operating Permits.

 The permits issued by EPA under today's NSR rule will not 
expire upon issuance of a District operating permit. The 
Districts are encouraged to include the requirements contained in 
permits issued by EPA, pursuant to this rule, in their operating 
permits since sources must continue to comply with the 
requirements of these EPA issued construction permits. Districts 
must include conditions contained in permits issued pursuant to 
this rule in any operating permit issued under a program adopted 
pursuant to 40 CFR part 70 or Title V of the Act, as discussed in 
section III.J of this preamble.

g. Federal Implementation and Delegation to Local Agencies. 

As discussed below in section III.J of this preamble, if EPA 
reclassifies the ozone nonattainment areas of the Sacramento 
Valley Air Basin as ``severe'', the applicable portions of the 
California SIP must be revised to meet the CAA requirements for a 
severe ozone nonattainment area and submitted to EPA on or before 
the date of final promulgation of this FIP. Until such time as 
EPA approves the revisions for the NSR portions of the applicable 
SIP, the NSR requirements of this FIP shall apply. When the 
revisions are approved into the SIP, EPA will withdraw this NSR 
portion of the FIP. 
EPA will encourage delegation of the final version of this 
NSR rule to the local Districts prior to SIP approvability, thus 
eliminating the need for sources to apply for permits from both 
the EPA and the local permitting agency. To do so, Districts 
must revise their existing NSR rule to meet the requirements of 
this federal rule, or adopt EPA's final NSR rule, through their 
existing notice and comment rulemaking procedures. The revised 
rule must then be submitted to EPA, which will evaluate the NSR 
rule for consistency with the requirements of the NSR portion of 
the Federal Implementation Plan. EPA will then delegate to the 
District, by letter, the authority to implement and enforce those 
portions of the FIP that are consistent with District 
requirements. When the revisions are ultimately approved in the 
SIP, EPA will withdraw the NSR portion of the FIP. 
Revision of the District regulations is necessary to allow 
the local agencies to use their own requirements, such as fee 
provisions and enforcement procedures, to implement the 
requirements of this NSR rule. While both SIP revisions and 
delegation will require revision of the District regulations, 
delegation is a much more expedient process than EPA approval of 
revisions as part of the SIP. 
5. TCMs to offset VMT increases. If bumped up to a severe nonattainment classification, 
Sacramento would also need to consider the requirements of 
Section 182(d)(1)(A). This section requires States containing 
severe ozone nonattainment areas to submit a SIP that identifies 
and adopts specific, enforceable transportation control measures, 
as necessary, to offset growth in vehicle emissions due to growth 
in vehicle miles traveled. Beyond demonstrating that these 
measures offset growth in emissions, they must be sufficient to 
allow total regional emission levels to comply with the 
reasonable further progress and attainment requirements of the 
Act. 
As described in the General Preamble to Title I of the CAAA, 
57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992), the TCM offset SIPs required from 
areas already designated severe or extreme must: (1) Identify and 
adopt specific and enforceable transportation control strategies 
and TCMs to offset any growth in emissions from growth in VMT or 
number of vehicle trips; (2) identify and adopt specific and 
enforceable transportation control strategies and TCMs that 
attain reductions in motor vehicle emissions (in combination with 
other emission reduction requirements) as necessary to comply 
with RFP milestones; and (3) identify and adopt specific and 
enforceable transportation control strategies and TCMs that 
attain reductions in motor vehicle emissions (in combination with 
other emission reduction requirements) as necessary to 
demonstrate attainment of the NAAQS. 
As discussed in the General Preamble, EPA has interpreted 
the provision to offset any growth in VOC from VMT increases to 
``require that sufficient measures be adopted so that projected 
vehicle VOC emissions will never be higher during the ozone 
season in one year than during the ozone season in the year 
before.'' Further, the attainment year is the last year for which 
this test applies. The calculation of VOC emissions from on road 
mobile sources may ``include the effects of Federal measures such 
as new motor vehicle standards, Phase II RVP controls, and 
reformulated gasoline, as well as Clean Air Act-mandated SIP 
requirements such as enhanced I/M, the fleet clean-fuel vehicle 
program, and the employer trip reduction program.'' 
For Sacramento, as can be seen in the Technical Support 
Document, on-road mobile source emissions through 2005 are never 
projected to be greater in one year than the year before once the 
FIP control strategies are implemented. Therefore, there is no 
need for TCMs in Sacramento to offset emissions increases from 
growth in VMT. 
As for requirements (2) and (3) pertaining to TCMs for RFP 
and attainment demonstration, the FIP has addressed TCMs for 
Sacramento in the discussion of Employee Commute Options 
(III.F.2) and the discussion pertaining to fees on light duty 
vehicles (III.D.2.f). 
6. Reformulated fuel. a. 

Provision satisfied in FIP/SIP actions above. 

Reclassification of the Sacramento area to ``Severe'' would 
mandate sale of reformulated gasoline in the area, effective one 
year after reclassification. There may be no emission reduction 
benefits from applying the federal reformulated fuel requirements 
to Sacramento, however, since the California reformulated fuel 
program already applies throughout the State. If the federal 
reformulated fuel program achieves greater reductions than the 
California program, EPA will impose the federal requirement in 
Sacramento. If the California program is more stringent, EPA 
would consider modifications to its enforcement program to avoid 
duplication with California's program. 


G. Section 182(e)(5) New Technology Measures for the South 
Coast 


1. Introduction.
After application of the FIP's stationary, area, and mobile 
source rule requirements, the ozone attainment requirements for 
the South Coast demand further reductions from the same source 
categories in order to achieve cumulative reductions from 1990 
baseyear emissions of approximately 90 percent VOC and 70 percent 
NO

X

Currently, there is no technological basis to prepare full regulations to achieve this additional level of control.
Instead, the additional reductions will need to come from either new technologies or further improvements to existing
technologies, such as those discussed in section III.B.5.d.iii. The federal control technology projects described
in that section are current examples of federal initiatives supporting the development and commercialization of
low-emitting products and technologies, pollution prevention approaches, and new control techniques. In each
future year, additional federal projects will be undertaken which should help to provide the technical, commercial,
and regulatory basis for the emission reductions needed for attainment in the South Coast. 

In these circumstances, EPA believes it is appropriate to make federal commitments to promulgate in the future regulations
based on the development of new technologies or control techniques, as authorized in section 182(e)(5) of the Act.
Section III.B.5.c.4. of this NPRM discusses extensively this CAA section and provides the prerequisite demonstration
that the new technology measures are not needed to meet the incremental reduction requirements for the period 1990-2000.


2. Commitment to adopt measures and schedule of emission reductions.


EPA's policy for implementation of section 182(e)(5) demands a commitment from the responsible agencies to achieve
specified reductions by particular dates. The Act also explicitly requires a commitment to adopt contingency measures
no later than 3 years before the scheduled reductions from the new technology provisions (section 182(e)(5)(B)).
The contingency measures must be adequate, in combination with other controls, to achieve the periodic emission
reduction requirements and attainment. EPA's commitments to both the new technology measures and the contingency
measures appears at proposed 40 CFR 52.2951. 



a. Stationary and Area Sources. 

(1) Sources Subject to Cap Rules. EPA proposes to make section 182(e)(5) commitments to prepare rules for each of the
control categories covered by the cap rules described above in section III.C.5. The commitments are identical for
each stationary and area source category, and establish rulemaking and implementation schedules to achieve two
additional increments of reduction beyond the sources' baseline emissions. 

For VOC the schedule is as follows. At the beginning of 2005, the declining cap rule will have required sources to reduce
baseline emissions by between 20 and 45 percent. The first new technology rule will be proposed by January 1, 2004,
and promulgated by January 1, 2005, and will require a 60 percent reduction from baseline emissions by January 1, 2007.
The second new technology rule will be proposed by January 1, 2006, and promulgated by January 1, 2007, and will require
a 90 percent reduction from baseline emissions by January 1, 2009. 

The schedule for NO

X

 is similar. At the beginning of 2005, the SCAQMD regulations, including the NO

X

 RECLAIM rules, will have achieved substantial reductions in baseline emissions. The first new technology rule will
be proposed by January 1, 2004, and promulgated by January 1, 2005, and will require a 50 percent reduction from baseline
emissions by January 1, 2007. The second new technology rule will be proposed by January 1, 2006, and promulgated by
January 1, 2007, and will require a 70 percent reduction from baseline emissions by January 1, 2009. 

(2) Consumer Products, Architectural Coatings, and Pesticides. For the consumer products (including aerosol paints),
architectural coatings, and pesticides categories, including those sources subject to the proposed provisions
of 40 CFR 52.2957, 40 CFR 2958, 40 CFR 52.2959, and 40 CFR 52.2960, EPA proposes to make section 182(e)(5) commitments
to prepare new technology rules to reduce VOC emissions by a further increment of 80 percent, beyond the control level
achieved under the proposed FIP statewide rules cited above. 

The schedule for rule promulgation and compliance is as follows. The first new technology rule will be proposed by
January 1, 2004, and promulgated by January 1, 2005, and will require a 40 percent reduction from baseline (year 2003)
emissions by January 1, 2007. The second new technology rule will be proposed by January 1, 2006, and promulgated by
January 1, 2007, and will require an 80 percent reduction from baseline emissions by January 1, 2009. 

(3) Remaining Stationary and Area Sources. For remaining stationary and area emission sources emitting less than
4 tons per year and not already regulated under sections III.G.2.a.(1) or III.G.2.a.(2), EPA proposes to make section
182(e)(5) commitments to prepare new technology rules to reduce VOC emissions by 80 percent from baseline emission
levels. 

Emission sources regulated under this section represent a large number of small sources which emit less than 4 tons
per year and/or may be exempt from regulation. These sources account for an estimated 300 tons per day of the remaining
VOC emissions after application of currently proposed FIP regulations. These sources include but are not limited
to gasoline service stations, livestock waste operations, commercial food production and preparation, printing
shops, miscellaneous coating and solvent cleaning operations, miscellaneous chemical/product manufacturing,
bakeries, waste disposal sites (e.g., landfills), publicly owned treatment works, waste burning operations, miscellaneous
fuel combustion sources, and miscellaneous fugitive emission sources. 

The schedule for rule promulgation and compliance is as follows. The first new technology rule will be proposed by
January 1, 2004, and promulgated by January 1, 2005, and will require a 40 percent reduction from baseline (year 2003)
emissions by January 1, 2007. The second new technology rule will be proposed by January 1, 2006, and promulgated by
January 1, 2007, and will require an 80 percent reduction from baseline emissions by January 1, 2009.

b. Mobile Sources. 


EPA believes that the utilization of technological advances 
for mobile sources, such as those discussed above in section 
III.B.5.d.iii., will ultimately allow the South Coast FIP area to 
attain the ozone NAAQS by the CAA deadline. Were EPA required to 
achieve the standards with mobile source measures that relied 
only on the current level of technology, EPA would be forced to 
propose measures which it believes would bring about severe 
economic hardship to the South Coast. 
As indicated in the attainment demonstration discussion 
(section III.H.), ozone attainment in the South Coast requires 
approximately a 90 percent reduction in VOC and a 70 percent 
reduction in NO

X

 emissions from the 1990 baseline. Mobile source 
emissions will need to be reduced by this percentage to yield 
attainment. The proposed mobile source strategies presented in 
section III.D. will achieve reductions of 66 percent for VOC and 
51 percent for NO

X

 from the 1990 baseline. EPA proposes to 
commit to achieving the remaining balance of 24 percent VOC and 
19 percent NO

X

 reductions from future technologies, such as the 
ones discussed in section III.B.5.d.iii. 
EPA proposes to make section 182(e)(5) commitments to 
accomplish these mobile source reductions according to the 
following schedule. New technology rules will be proposed by 
January 1, 2001, and promulgated by July 1, 2002. The rules will 
provide for the additional 24 percent VOC and 19 percent NO

X

 
reductions by the year 2010. Since sufficient lead time to 
introduce any new technology will be needed, EPA proposes that 
the rules will begin implementation by January 1, 2006. This 
implementation date will allow for four years of fleet turnover 
to produce the needed reductions. 
3. Commitment to adopt contingency measures. 

In this NPRM, EPA also proposes to commit to issue by 
January 1, 1999, contingency measures sufficient to achieve the 
cumulative percent reduction in VOC and NO

X

 emissions assigned to 
each new technology measure. As the Act requires, these 
contingency measures would go into effect and achieve substitute 
emission reductions, if the new technology measures are not 
developed or fail to achieve the specified reductions. 


H. Attainment Demonstrations 


1. Introduction.
An attainment demonstration is a key part of a State or 
Federal Implementation Plan: using air quality modeling, it shows 
that the proposed emission control measures are sufficient for 
the NAAQS to be attained by the applicable deadline.
 For 
ozone nonattainment areas classified ``Serious'', ``Severe'' or 
``Extreme'', section 182(c)(2)(A) requires an attainment 
demonstration based on photochemical grid modeling, for which the 
Urban Airshed Model (UAM) is the EPA-approved model. (See 
Appendix W of 40 CFR part 51.) Under section 187(a)(7), SIPs for 
CO areas having design values above 12.7 ppm must also have an 
attainment demonstration, which EPA has generally interpreted to 
mean a UAM demonstration. As discussed previously in this NPRM, 
FIPs demonstrating attainment of the ozone NAAQS are required for 
Sacramento, South Coast, and Ventura, and a FIP carbon monoxide 
attainment demonstration is required for South Coast. 





It is a goal of EPA for the FIPs to match as closely as 
possible the ozone SIPs that California is developing for the 
November 1994 submittal. EPA and the State are coordinating FIP 
and SIP modeling to avoid duplication of effort and divergent FIP 
and SIP modeling conclusions. Projected reduction targets had to 
be determined well in advance of this NPRM in order to choose 
control strategies and develop regulations to implement them. 
Because the State and EPA are continuing to refine the modeling, 
the proposed FIP attainment demonstrations are based on 
preliminary modeling results for the three areas. Rather than 
using UAM to directly simulate the air quality benefit of the 
control measures, today's proposal shows attainment by reducing 
total emissions to meet UAM-generated reduction targets. The 
targets were derived from a series of UAM simulations of generic 
``across-the-board'' emission reductions that attain the NAAQS. 
This method has shortcomings discussed below, but is the best 
procedure available at this time, and gives results that are 
comparable to a full simulation. If subsequent analysis by the 
State and EPA shows that different target levels and control 
strategies are more technically appropriate, EPA intends to 
incorporate these in the final FIP notice or in subsequent FIP 
revisions. 
An additional issue for attainment demonstrations, not 
otherwise addressed in the FIP proposal, is the phenomenon of 
pollutant transport between air basins. If one area is causing 
nonattainment in another area downwind under some meteorological 
conditions, then additional controls may need to be applied in 
one or both areas. Ideally, a single large modeling domain 
incorporating both upwind and downwind areas should be used to 
assess pollutant transport between them. It is anticipated that 
the methods California will employ to address transport in the 
November 1994 ozone SIPs might be used in the final FIP. This 
could eventually result in revisions to the FIP, which may impose 
greater control requirements in the FIP areas than appear in 
today's proposal if there is, for example, transport from Los 
Angeles to San Diego and Ventura. The transport analysis could 
also result in additional FIP controls for areas not covered by 
the proposed FIPs, such as the San Francisco Bay Area or the San 
Joaquin Valley, which are upwind of Sacramento. 
2. Baseline inventories. 
(a) 

Adjustments to State's emissions inventories.

 
California provided 1990 base-year annual and peak season 
emissions inventories for ozone precursors (ROG, NO

X

, and CO) by 
air basin and county with the emissions inventory SIP submittal 
of November 13, 1992. EPA relied heavily on the November 1992 
inventory in this NPRM. Revised inventories for the base-year 
were provided by CARB on November 15, 1993, and these have been 
partially incorporated in this NPRM. In some cases, however, EPA 
did not have sufficient time to fully evaluate and/or incorporate 
the November 1993 data into the FIP modeling. It should be noted 
that CARB uses ROG almost interchangeably with ROC (reactive 
organic compounds), but both include ethane, which EPA exempts 
from the definition of VOC under the assumption that ethane 
reacts too slowly for significant ozone formation in the period 
of concern (up to several days). CARB compensates for the 
difference between ROG and VOC by providing EPA a listing of the 
fractional ethane emitted from each Source Classification Code 
(SCC). For purposes of this NPRM, EPA also drew on inventories 
prepared by local air pollution control agencies as discussed 
below. 
(b) Basis for projected emission inventories. 
Base-year (generally 1990) emission inventory estimates are 
projected to change in future years. EPA projects emissions for 
each emission category to the targeted attainment year (e.g., 
2010 for South Coast) based on category specific emission 
factors. These factors include, for example, housing starts, 
employment, population, gasoline sales, and sales tax revenues. 
(c) Stationary Sources.

For stationary source categories whose facilities range in size, a cutpoint differentiates point and area sources.
EPA guidance on emission inventories sets this cutpoint at 10 tpy for VOC sources, and 100 tpy for NO

X

 and CO.
 Point source emissions are calculated by adding estimates of individual source facilities in a category. Area source
emissions are generally determined by subtracting point sources from a total estimate derived from an emission factor
assumed for the entire category. Certain source categories are estimated by the State while others are estimated
by the local air pollution control agency. 





(1) Sacramento. For purposes of this NPRM, EPA relies largely on stationary source emission data provided in CARB's
November 1992 inventory submittal. This inventory includes VOC and NO

X

 estimates for Sacramento, Sutter, Solano, Yolo, Placer and El Dorado counties for 1990, 1999 and 2005. This inventory
is also similar to the inventory used in the 15 percent plan submitted by the Sacramento APCD in November 1993. EPA has,
however, made several adjustments to CARB's inventory which are discussed in the technical support document. 

The following table summarizes the estimated stationary source emissions used in this NPRM before applying FIP measures:






(2) Ventura. EPA and the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District are jointly funding a coordinated SIP and FIP
modeling effort in order to maximize consistency between these parallel efforts. Thus, for purposes of this NPRM,
EPA is using Ventura County's 1991 Air Quality Management Plan (1991 AQMP)
 as the starting point for estimating and projecting emissions from stationary sources in Ventura rather than CARB
inventories. The 1991 AQMP inventory also provides the starting point for the 15 percent plan submitted by Ventura
to EPA in November 1993. While the 15 percent plan incorporates a number of modifications to the growth factors, emission
processing mapping, and other inputs to the 1991 AQMP inventory, EPA was not able to evaluate and incorporate these
in time for this NPRM. In addition, the 15 percent plan only projects emissions through 1996, and projections are needed
through 2005 for the FIP. EPA expects, however, that the inventory used for the final FIP attainment demonstration
will incorporate many of the modifications included in the 15 percent plan. It should be noted that CARB's inventory
forms the basis of many of the specific source category emissions estimates in Ventura's AQMP and 15 percent inventories.






The following table presents the 2005 stationary source emission estimates before applying FIP measures. These
estimates are described further in the technical support document:

(3) South Coast. The FIP's 1990 base-year stationary source VOC emission 
estimates rely on the 1990 inventory described in South Coast AQMD's 15 percent Rate-of-Progress Plan that was submitted
to EPA in November 1993. The FIP's 1990 base-year stationary source NO

X

 inventory is based on estimates described in SCAQMD's 1991 Air Quality Management Plan (1991 AQMP).
 EPA is also using the 1991 AQMP for projecting VOC and NO

X

 emissions from stationary sources to the South Coast target attainment year of 2010. While 
CARB's inventory estimates are used for many specific source categories in the 1991 AQMP, EPA relies on the overall
SCAQMD rather than the CARB inventory in order to maximize consistency between the SIP and FIP. The SCAQMD is in the
process of updating its revised 2010 inventory for inclusion in the 1994 
AQMP, which is due for submittal to EPA in November 1994. Upon release of the revised 2010 inventory estimates, EPA
will incorporate applicable changes in its 2010 FIP inventory projections. 





The following table represents a summary of the major categories and emissions in the 2010 stationary source inventory
which are described further in the technical support document. Credit for adopted SIP and proposed FIP measures have
not been included in this table.

d. 

Mobile sources.

_(1) Highway vehicle emission factors. The on-highway emission factors for California vehicles are based on CAL15a,
which is the March 1993 release of MOBILE5a with modified model year emission control groupings, basic emission rates,
and registration age mix based on EMFAC7D. 


The EMFAC model could not be used for the FIP for several reasons. Most importantly, an enhanced I/M program is a key
part of the FIP proposal, and EMFAC does not allow the examination of I/M programs besides the one currently implemented
in California. Similarly, there is no mechanism within EMFAC to address the enhanced in-use compliance program being
proposed in the FIP. 

There is now an in-house EPA version of MOBILE5a for California based on EMFAC7F, EMFAC7D's replacement, referred
to simply as CAL15. More detailed descriptions of CAL15a and CAL15 are provided in the docket. EPA currently plans
to use CAL15 in subsequent analyses for the FIP. EPA invites comments on the merits of the various models. Based on these
comments and any new data that may become available, EPA may make inventory and control effectiveness adjustments
in the final FIP. Such technical adjustments could require or allow changes in the control measures. 


Vehicles certified to 49-State standards are assumed to comprise 10 percent of the light duty VMT and 20 percent
of the heavy duty VMT in the FIP areas. The emission factors for these vehicles were based on MOBILE5a runs using the
same inputs as for the CAL15a runs, except the LEV program was excluded, since it would not apply to 49-State vehicles.



It should be noted that the baseline emission calculations include control programs that have already been adopted.
This includes the California LEV program, California Phase 2 Reformulated Gasoline, and California Clean Diesel
Fuel.

(2) VMT Estimates. VMT estimates for Sacramento were derived mostly from an August 1993 draft of the Sacramento Area
Council of Governments (SACOG) Metropolitan Transportation Plan (MTP). That draft included only 1990 and 2015 estimates,
so intermediate years of 1999 and 2005 were estimated by linear interpolation. Also, SACOG does not currently include
Solano County, which is partially within the FIP area. VMT for Solano County were calculated from the 1992 CalTrans
MVSTAFF report using a CARB estimate of the portion of Solano County VMT in the FIP area. The final SACOG MTP includes
specific VMT estimates for 2000 and 2005 which are somewhat higher than the interpolated values used by EPA. EPA plans
to use the final MTP values in analyses for the final FIP rulemaking. 

Ventura VMT estimates come directly from the August 1993 JHK & Associates report done for the Ventura County Air
Pollution Control District. South Coast VMT are based on an August 1993 draft Southern California Area Governments
(SCAG) analysis. 

While EPA believes these are the most appropriate VMT estimates and projections for the FIP, comments are invited
on the merits of other VMT estimates. 

(3) Nonroad vehicles and engines. A full range of nonroad engines and vehicles are addressed in this NPRM, from small
hand-held gasoline lawn and garden equipment to heavy duty diesel engines used in farm and construction work. The
inventory for some of these categories is taken directly from CARB estimates, but for the categories listed below
EPA either adjusted the CARB inventory with different growth rates or used a totally different basis for the inventory.
In the first three categories listed (HD engines greater than 50 hp, lawn and garden equipment, and recreational boats)
the base-year estimate comes from CARB. However, to be consistent with the national rulemakings for these categories,
the growth rates are modified by EPA based on the most recent available population growth estimates for each area.
Whereas CARB grew these inventories at roughly a straight line 2 percent of the base-year's inventory per year, EPA
uses a straight line 3.4 percent per year for Sacramento, 3.0 percent per year for Ventura, and 1.8 percent per year
for the South Coast. 

(i) Heavy duty engines greater than 50 hp. EPA started with the 1990 CARB inventories for diesel and gasoline farm and
construction equipment (Mobile Equipment). As discussed in the technical support document, the CARB inventory
was then adjusted by a factor of 0.975 to account for engines less than 50 hp which are estimated to represent 2.5 percent
of the emission inventory. The population growth assumption described above was then used to grow the heavy duty engine
inventory. 

(ii) Spark ignition engines less than 25 hp (lawn and garden). EPA started with the 1990 CARB inventory for residential
and commercial utility (lawn and garden) equipment. The population growth assumption described above was then used
to grow the inventory. 

(iii) Recreational marine engines. EPA started with the 1990 CARB inventory for recreational gasoline and diesel
boats. This was modified for Sacramento using new data obtained from California on boat registrations and navigable
water area. This resulted in a greater 1990 inventory than CARB had been using. The EPA population growth assumptions
described above were then used to grow the inventory from 1990. For Ventura and South Coast, the ratio of CARB's Ventura
and South Coast tons to CARB's Sacramento tons was multiplied by the corrected Sacramento inventory to obtain consistent
inventories for all three areas. 

(iv) Locomotives. Inventories developed by Booz-Allen Hamilton for CARB show locomotive No

x

 contributions per summer day in 1990 of approximately: Nine tons in the Sacramento area, one ton in Ventura, and over
thirty tons in the South Coast. These contributions constituted approximately 5 percent, 1 percent, and 2 percent
of the total No

x

 emissions for Sacramento, Ventura and South Coast respectively. These inventories are summarized in the following
table. EPA refers readers to the Booz-Allen reports entitled: Locomotive Emissions Study and Report on Locomotive
Emission Inventory: Locomotive Emissions by County, presented as a supplement to the Locomotive Emission Study.






Systems Applications International (SAI), under contract to EPA, recently completed a draft report entitled 1990
Emissions from Diesel Locomotives in Three California Federal Implementation Plan Areas. There are large differences
between the emission estimates developed by Booz-Allen and SAI. As a result, EPA requests comment on the appropriate
inventory and methodology for calculating inventories to use. Emission inventories calculated by SAI are summarized
in the table below.

Due to the large differences between the SAI and Booz-Allen 
estimates, EPA requests comment on the appropriate inventory and 
methodology for calculating inventories to use. 

To calculate emission reductions (in tons), due to a 
regulatory program, it is necessary to first project an 
unregulated baseline into the future. EPA used two sources to 
estimate baseline locomotive emissions without FIP controls: 
Information from the Booz-Allen studies and information from the 
Association of American Railroads, (AAR). Booz-Allen developed 
emission inventory estimates based on locomotive application for 
the years 2000 and 2010. These estimates are illustrated in the 
following table. 






The validity of Booz-Allen's estimates depends upon the 
accuracy of its baseline emission inventory work and the 
soundness of its growth projections. EPA has concerns regarding 
Booz-Allen's estimates of growth because they are based directly 
on 1987 data. Several developments in the rail industry since 
1987, however, could significantly affect growth projections, 
particularly in the South Coast. 

EPA therefore requests comment on two alternative methods 
for calculating growth based on national industry-wide averages. 
The first calculates growth based on historic trends in tons of 
freight originated and national locomotive fuel usage. The 
second estimate uses ton-miles and national locomotive fuel 
usage. Data used to construct these analyses came from 
Locomotive Facts, 1993 Edition, published by the Association of 
American Railroads. These estimates are summarized in the tables 
below. A complete description of the EPA methodology used to 
arrive at the figures used in this section is included in the EPA 
support document entitled: Baseline Locomotive Emissions for the 
Three California FIP areas. 









(v) Aircraft and Airports.

For purposes of this NPRM, EPA relies on CARB's inventory 
for estimates of aircraft emissions. Emissions from mobile 
sources at airports also include ground access vehicles and 
airport ground service equipment. Ground access vehicle 
emissions are included in the overall FIP area numbers for on- 
highway vehicles described above in section (d)(1). Ground 
service equipment emissions are included in the overall FIP 
numbers for nonroad equipment described above in section 
(d)(3)(i). 

The work done specifically on airport control strategies for 
the FIP proposal uses more recent inventories based on research 
done by EEA with input from the airports and the local 
governments in 1993, and in the final rule the EPA may use an 
updated version of this EEA inventory. Comments are requested on 
the most appropriate inventory to use for aircraft and airport 
related emissions. 

(4) Mobile baseline inventory summary. The following tables summarize the baseline mobile source emissions in each
of the three FIP areas.

of the FIP areas. Included are brief 
descriptions of the pollution episodes modeled, the model application, and the base case simulations that resulted.

Specific EPA requirements for modeling procedures, data, and input parameters appear in Guideline for Regulatory
Application of the Urban Airshed Model (EPA, 7/91) and Guideline for Regulatory Application of the Urban Airshed
Model for Areawide Carbon Monoxide (EPA, 6/92). The UAM model uses an inventory of pollutant emissions, together
with air quality and meteorological data, as input to a system of algorithms incorporating chemistry and dispersion,
in order to simulate an observed pollution episode. Once a ``base case'' is developed that meets the minimum Guideline
performance criteria, projected future emissions are used as input to simulate air quality in the attainment deadline
year. Attainment is demonstrated when the modeled air quality with emission controls in effect is below the NAAQS
throughout the geographical modeling domain.
For carbon monoxide, a local or ``hot-spot'' component is added to the UAM areawide component. UAM can simulate the
accumulation of pollutants over several hours, from sources over a large area. By contrast, the CAL3QHC model is used
to reflect the localized effect of idling motor vehicles at key congested intersections, which is not otherwise accounted
for in UAM's typical one-mile resolution. For the attainment demonstration, the sum of the areawide and hot-spot
component must be less than the NAAQS.
A modeling attainment demonstration is subject to several uncertainties. The meteorological and air quality inputs
have their own associated uncertainties, both in measurement and in representativeness. In addition, not all variables
can be measured for all hours, so default and interpolated values must be used. Processes such as chemical reaction
and advection necessarily appear in the model in simplified form. The selected episodes may not represent all conditions
conducive to high pollutant levels. Finally, the projection of the emissions is uncertain. In spite of these sources
of uncertainty, photochemical grid modeling is the best tool that is available for determining the emission reductions
that are needed for NAAQS attainment. However, refinements in model inputs that will occur over the next year are likely
to change the combination and stringency of controls deemed necessary for attainment.
According to the EPA Guideline, control measures are to be used to adjust the emission inventory, which is then used
as input to UAM. This captures the effect of the changes in spatial and temporal distribution of emissions. However,
as of this writing the final modeling base cases are not ready for simulating the controls with UAM itself, since model
inputs are undergoing revision to improve performance. Instead, for this FIP proposal, percent emission reduction
targets were established using simulations of geographically and temporally uniform (``across-the-board'')
reductions. A series of these simulations are performed with various combinations of VOC and NO

X

 reductions. By interpolation, percent reductions of emissions of both pollutants that result in ozone concentrations
less than the NAAQS are determined. Similarly, for carbon monoxide various across-the-board reductions of CO are
simulated, and then interpolated to find a target reduction that meets the CO NAAQS.
Though derived from simulation of the rectangular modeling domain, the targets are applied to the emission totals
for just the nonattainment area, resulting in a maximum allowable level of emissions for the area. Attainment is demonstrated
when the emissions from all sources after control measures are applied is less than this maximum. This method does
not reflect the spatial and temporal variability in the effect of control measures, and so give a rougher estimate
of controls needed than full UAM modeling would. Because of the limitations of this methodology, further analysis
by the State and EPA may result in some changes in the control measures required between today's proposal and the final
notice.
(a) 

Sacramento ozone. 

The Sacramento area was classified as a ``Serious'' ozone nonattainment area based on a design value of .16 ppm recorded
at the Folsom station. This was based on 1987-1989 data; the 1990-1992 value was also .16 ppm. Exceedances
of the ozone NAAQS occur in the Sacramento area about 15 times per year.
In order to simulate air quality for the SIP and other planning needs, CARB and the Sacramento local agencies started
planning the Sacramento Area Ozone Study (SAOS) early in 1989, with intensive data collection performed during the
summer of 1990. This involved an extended network of air quality and meteorological instruments, including on airplanes,
to measure ozone and its precursors and also many meteorological inputs needed for UAM. The Sacramento Modeling Advisory
Committee (SMAC) was established for technical oversight of the modeling effort, and includes regulatory, industry,
and environmental group participants. CARB and its contractor, Systems Applications International, Inc., prepared
a modeling protocol which was accepted by EPA as meeting EPA Guideline modeling requirements.

The episodes selected for modeling included days on which ozone maxima occurred in the Interstate 80 and Interstate
50 corridors, downwind of Sacramento. While the observed ozone peaks were less than the design value of .16, they are
high enough to meet EPA guidelines for episode selection, especially considering the excellent database available
for analysis. They had features typical of urban ozone episodes, including temperatures exceeding 100 
 F, low winds, and a temperature inversion that tended to trap pollutants near the ground. Model performance
statistics for a July 11-13, 1990 episode, while not outstanding, were within the performance goals set in EPA's
Guideline. This episode's performance was judged adequate for determining emission reduction targets. A second
episode, in August 1990, was strongly affected by upper air transport of pollutants into the area. 
For the FIP proposal, only the July episode is being used. At the time the FIP proposal had to be designed, there were
unresolved questions about model performance for the August episode. In addition, this latter episode was dominated
by transport of pollutants from outside the Sacramento area. Through an analysis of wind trajectories, a contractor
to EPA determined that at various times transport could occur from the San Francisco Bay Area in the west, and also from
the San Joaquin Valley in the south. Conclusions on what additional controls, if any, are needed in these upwind areas
will not be available for some time. In order to proceed with FIP development while the complex transport questions
are resolved, EPA elected to proceed using the locally-generated ozone episode. The State's additional work on the
August episode and/or work on the SARMAP modeling project may indicate what, if any, additional controls are needed
in Sacramento or its upwind areas, in time for the final FIP. Since it is possible that transport analyses using SARMAP
for the Sacramento area will not be ready even by the time of the final FIP, EPA invites comment on how transport should
be addressed. 
Using socioeconomic and VMT data from SACOG and other local planning agencies, an EPA contractor projected emissions
to the year 1999. A series of ``across-the-board'' UAM simulations were then performed to determine an emission reduction
target. This work showed that any of the combinations in the following table would result in attainment. Note that
these are stated in terms of reductions from base-year 1990 levels, so that control measures would also have to make
up for growth between 1990 and the attainment year, whether 1999 or 2005. 






For the FIP proposal, anthropogenic emission reductions of 40 percent VOC and 30 percent NO

X

 were chosen as least disruptive of current residential, commercial, and industrial practices. Stated differently,
for ozone attainment, 1999 or 2005 Sacramento area VOC emissions must be no greater than 60 percent of 1990 levels,
and Nox emissions must be no greater than 70 percent of 1990 levels. 
An additional simulation of interest involved the elimination of motor vehicle emissions. This translated to an
ozone peak reduction about 5 percent greater than would be expected from an across-the-board reduction by the same
amount of emissions. Thus the FIP may be somewhat conservative in assuring attainment, since it relies heavily on
motor vehicle emission controls. This gives further assurance that the attainment demonstration method used will
in fact result in attainment. 
(b) Ventura ozone. Ventura County has been classified as a ``Severe'' ozone nonattainment area. The design value
for the years 1987-1989 is based on the 0.17 ppm maximum hourly value recorded at Simi Valley during that period.

The FIP attainment demonstration modeling is based on air pollution episodes for which intensive field data were
available through the 1984-1985 South Central Coast Cooperative Air Monitoring Project (SCCCAMP) field study.
The SCCCAMP Exploratory Field Study consisted of intensive monitoring of meteorological and air quality variables
over a geographical domain encompassing Ventura County as well as the southern half of Santa Barbara County. The study
produced higher quality data than available through routine monitoring activities in the area, and thus provides
a much more reliable basis for Urban Airshed Modeling (UAM) than more recent episode data. Two SCCCAMP episodes, September
5-7, 1984, and September 16-17, 1984, were selected from the period of the study. Both of these episodes
have ozone concentration maxima near the area's current ozone design value. As a result, the age of this data should
not detract from the validity of the modeling.

Previous analysis of the episodes was used to establish ``across-the-board'' reduction targets of 40 percent VOC
and 40 percent NO

X

 from a 1987 emissions baseline in order to attain the ozone standard. This translates to emission targets of 57 tpd
VOC and 46 tpd NO

X

, which are used as the basis of the attainment demonstration provided in paragraph III.H.5. of this NPRM. 
EPA plans, however, to significantly improve the attainment demonstration included in the final FIP notice. These
improvements are discussed in the technical support document, and include reevaluation of the base-year emission
estimates, modeling and attainment targets by the VCAPCD and its contractor, Alpine Geophysics, partially funded
by grants from EPA. When performance of the model is considered to meet Guideline criteria, the model will be used to
project air quality in the year 2005, including the effect of various SIP and FIP control strategies. The results of
this analysis will be used to reevaluate the amount of VOC and NO

X

 reductions needed from each source category to demonstrate attainment. 
In addition, previous analysis has indicated that pollutant transport occurred from the South Coast Air Basin to
Ventura during the September 5-7 episode. EPA is supporting, through grant funds to the SCAQMD, a study of the
impact of the transport from the South Coast Air Basin to Ventura County. 
(c) South Coast ozone. The South Coast Air Basin was classified as an ``Extreme'' ozone area, based on the design value
of 0.33 ppm recorded at the Glendora monitoring site. 
The attainment demonstration for South Coast is based on the air quality modeling performed by the SCAQMD in 1991,
potentially enhanced by the addition of several additional ozone episodes. The SCAQMD's 1991 modeling covered three
episodes (June 1985, August 1987 and June 1987). Based on that effort, ``across-the-board'' reductions of VOC and
NO

X

 of 90 percent and 70 percent respectively were determined to be sufficient to attain the ozone standard. 
More recently, several modifications have been made to the original modeling effort, including raising the height
of the top of the modeling grid, expanding the domain to the east to encompass the entire non-attainment area, and lowering
the level of pollutants entering the domain through the top boundary of the model. These changes will be incorporated
into the 1994 SIP modeling efforts and the FIP attainment demonstration. 
In addition, the possibility of modeling three new episodes is being explored (July 13-15, 1987, September
7-9, 1987, and October 7-9, 1992). The September 7-9, 1987 episode represents meteorological conditions
conducive to high ozone in Orange County. The October 7-9, 1992 episode is a weekend episode. The performance
of the additional episodes is being evaluated and improvements are being made. However, the performance may not be
adequate in time for the final FIP attainment demonstration. In case the additional episodes do not meet Guideline
performance criteria, the final FIP attainment demonstration will be based on the original three episodes. 
The 1991 modeling effort, updated to include the model improvements as well as additional episodes, if warranted,
will provide the base case for the final FIP attainment demonstration. 
(d) South Coast CO. The South Coast Air Basin was classified as a ``Serious'' area for CO, based on a design value of 23.4
ppm measured in 1988 at the Lynwood site. More recent data (1991-1992) indicate a lower design value of 16.4 ppm.

In preparing the 1992 CO SIP attainment demonstration, the SCAQMD selected a December 5-7, 1989 episode for
modeling because this episode included the first and second highest 8-hour average CO concentrations for the years
1989-1990: 21.75 ppm and 18.3 ppm. High 8-hour CO concentrations often occur during periods of high emissions,
low wind speeds, and poor vertical dispersion (e.g. a temperature inversion). 
The CO modeling for the FIP proposal is based on the April 29, 1993 correction to the November 1992 CO SIP. The hot-spot
modeling, which predicts high CO concentrations at intersections, was performed using the CAL3QHC model at four
intersections. For the 2000 attainment year, the traffic volume used was the same as that used for 1989, based on the
assumption that the traffic at the most heavily travelled intersections had reached a maximum and could not be increased.

The results of the base case episode areawide and hot-spot modeling are shown in the table below. 









The emission inventory was projected to the year 2000 by the CARB using VMT projections provided by SCAG. The air quality
for the year 2000 was predicted, using the UAM with the projected emission inventory and meteorological conditions
from the selected episode. The projected air quality, displayed in the table below, shows that the NAAQS of 9 ppm would
be attained at all sites based on the application of three control measures and considering the combined impact of
the areawide and hot-spot modeling results. 
Projected Eight Hour Carbon Monoxide Concentrations (in ppm) at Various Intersections for the year 2000 with the
implementation of the CARB's LEV program, oxygenated fuels program and enhanced I/M program. 









Based on modeling performed for the SCAQMD SIP for CO, an analysis of the ``across-the-board'' reductions of the overall
CO emissions necessary to attain the NAAQS was performed, and compared to the emission reductions resulting from
measures in the proposed FIP. A reduction of 45 percent of the overall CO emissions was determined to attain the CO standard.
Baseline and projected CO emissions are shown in the table below.

The year 2000 case emissions with Enhanced I/M, LEV and Oxygenated Fuels program are 3920 tons/days, a 45 percent reduction
from the 1990 base case.

This analysis, based on ``across-the-board'' assumptions, indicates that the proposed measures will attain the
standard by the year 2000. As for Sacramento and Ventura, the final FIP may be adjusted as appropriate to reflect further
analysis by the State and EPA, if that analysis shows that different target levels and control strategies are technically
more appropriate to show attainment.

4. State and local control measures. For all three FIP areas, most existing State and local control measures are included
in the emission projections used to compare to the target emission levels. However, since EPA uses the CALI5a motor
vehicle emissions model and its own non-road mobile source inventory, the associated emission reductions may not
match those assumed by California in its own projected inventories.

5. Attainment demonstrations. Emission reductions projected from proposed FIP measures are discussed in sections
3.C through 3.G of this NPRM. To show attainment, the projected ton/day benefits of the FIP control measures are subtracted
from the baseline inventories for the appropriate attainment year in each FIP area. The results are then compared
to the attainment target in each area as discussed in section 3.H.3 of this NPRM. This calculation is provided in detail
in the technical support document.



I. Transportation Conformity



Section 176(c) of the Clean Air Act requires transportation plans, transportation programs, and transportation
projects which are funded with title 23 U.S.C. or Federal Transit Act funds or approved by the Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA) or Federal Transit Administration (FTA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) to conform with
the applicable implementation plan for a nonattainment area. After promulgation, the FIPs will be part of the applicable
ozone and CO implementation plans for the Sacramento, Ventura, and South Coast nonattainment areas, and will therefore
add certain criteria which must be satisfied before the MPOs for these areas or FHWA/FTA can find that a transportation
plan, program, or project conforms. However, these additional criteria are limited, as explained below.

The proposed FIP will not alter the Criteria and Procedures for Determining Transportation Conformity which EPA
promulgated on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62188). The FIP itself will not impose any restriction on the selection and
implementation of transportation projects which can be found to conform under the terms of the promulgated transportation
conformity criteria and procedures. Furthermore, the FIP does not direct the expenditure of funds designated under
title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act to any specific projects or type of project.

The State of California is responsible for submitting to EPA a conformity SIP revision by November 24, 1994, as required
by 40 CFR 51.396. The conformity SIP revision is a requirement added in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, is not mentioned
in any of the settlement agreements, and therefore is not an obligation for EPA under the court orders.

Because it establishes strategies for Sacramento and Ventura to attain by 2005, the FIP will establish motor vehicle
emissions budgets for VOC and NO

X

 for those FIP areas for the year 2005. In addition, the CO attainment demonstration will establish a CO budget for the
year 2000 for the South Coast. These budgets play no role for the purposes of conformity until the FIP is promulgated.
(This is in contrast to state-submitted budgets, which do play a role upon submission to EPA.) Conformity determinations
made after the FIP is promulgated must use the FIP's budgets for the years indicated and any subsequent analysis years,
until the SIP process establishes different budgets for subsequent years (e.g., state-submitted plan with budgets
is approved). At a minimum, the conformity of the transportation plan must be redetermined using the FIP's budget
within 18 months of the FIP's promulgation (see 40 CFR 51.400(b)(3)(iii)). The conformity of transportation improvement
programs must be redetermined within six months following the adoption of a transportation plan (see 40 CFR 51.400(c)(3)).

There is some ambiguity in Clean Air Act section 176(c) and EPA's conformity rule regarding whether the proposed FIP,
when final, will create VOC and NO

 budgets for the South Coast, and if so, for which years. While the FIP analysis contains emissions projections for
2000, 2005, and 2010, EPA believes that its application of Clean Air Act section 182(e)(5) to the FIP means that the
South Coast FIP will not specifically allocate 2010 emission reductions between transportation and other sources.
Furthermore, there are no specific emission reduction requirements that the FIP must satisfy in 2000 and 2005. Therefore,
the South Coast FIP will establish no emissions budget binding on the MPOs or U.S. DOT.

The FIP will not alter the fact that the motor vehicle emissions budgets for 1996, which are contained in the 15 percent
SIPs submitted by California for these three nonattainment areas (required by Clean Air Act section 182(b)(1)(A)),
must be used for the purposes of conformity according to the requirements of 40 CFR 51.448. If EPA disapproves such
a SIP or finds it incomplete, the 1996 emissions budget shall be used for the purposes of conformity for 12 months following
the final disapproval or incompleteness finding, if EPA explicitly states that the SIP submittal would have been
considered approvable or complete with respect to requirements for emission reductions if all committed measures
had been submitted in enforceable form (see 40 CFR 51.448(a)(3) and (c)(1)(iii)). However, if there are other reasons
for the disapproval or incompleteness finding, time clocks will be started after which new plans and TIPs may not be
found to conform and existing plans and TIPs will lapse.

Budgets contained in any future state-submitted attainment and post-1996 RFP plans must also be observed. Such state-submitted
budgets may not replace budgets established by the final FIP until the state-submitted budgets have been approved
by EPA.

Demonstrations of conformity to the FIP may use the same motor vehicle emissions model which EPA uses to demonstrate
attainment in the final FIP, unless EPA announces a revision to the model. (In that case, a grace period for use of the
latest motor vehicle emissions model applies, as described in 40 CFR 51.414.) The final FIP will be based on a VMT growth
estimate which is the MPO's own growth projection at the time of FIP promulgation. Difficulty demonstrating consistency
with the FIP's budget would therefore most likely be due to VMT growth which is higher than the MPO expected.

The FIP does not propose any TCMs that are eligible for funding under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act. The
Employee Commute Options program proposed for Sacramento might be eligible for such funding if it were adopted by
local authorities, but EPA itself is not an eligible recipient. Therefore, determinations of conformity to the FIP
will not have to demonstrate timely implementation of TCMs in the FIP.



J. FIP Implementation by State and Local Agencies



Congress has determined that the primary responsibility for air pollution control rests with state and local governments.
CAA section 101(a)(3). Moreover, as discussed elsewhere in this NPRM, EPA lacks many of the authorities, instruments,
and established local and regional organizations and trained staff to administer, on a daily basis, comprehensive
air pollution control initiatives such as these FIPs, which affects hundreds of thousands of individual sources
and activities. Massive federal intrusion would inevitably result if EPA were to shoulder the chief burden of enforcing
the California FIP.

Accordingly, EPA has attempted to design the FIP rules to ensure that, wherever possible, State and local implementation
is encouraged and facilitated by the FIP's regulatory approach. Thus, for example, the FIP generally employs local
California rule organization and terminology in the proposed stationary and area source rules, including the new
source review permitting rules (40 CFR 52.284 through 52.289, and 52.304).

1. State and local obligation to incorporate FIP requirements in operating permits. In Title V of the 1990 CAA Amendments,
Congress established an important new state responsibility. Title V and EPA's implementing regulations require
state and local air pollution control agencies to adopt and submit for EPA approval a regulatory program for issuing
operating permits to major stationary sources, sources covered by emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants
pursuant to section 112 of the Act, sources covered by any new source performance standards set under section 111 of
the Act, and affected sources under the acid rain program. The operating permits must contain necessary limits and
conditions to assure compliance with all applicable requirements of the Act, including all provisions of the applicable
SIP and the FIP. Title V includes specific requirements for EPA oversight and for sanctions against states for failure
to adopt, administer, or enforce the operating permit program.

Title V establishes the following timeframes for state and EPA action:

1. Program submittal by November 15, 1993;

2. EPA approval or disapproval within one year of program submittal, with the possibility of interim approval for
up to two years;

3. EPA application of sanctions for failure to submit approvable programs, and establishment of a federal program
by November 15, 1995, if a state or local program has not been approved;

4. Source operating permit application within one year after EPA approval (or interim approval) of a state or local
program, or after EPA establishment of a federal program;

5. Issuance of all permits within three years after EPA approval of a state or local program or promulgation of a federal
program; and

6. Operating permit application within one year of commencement of operation for new sources subject to New Source
Review.

On July 21, 1992, EPA promulgated 40 CFR part 70, specifying the minimum elements of state operating permit programs
(57 FR 32250). EPA's promulgation makes clear the Agency's interpretation that approvable operating permit programs
must provide that the applicable permit include FIP emission limitations and other FIP requirements (57 FR 32258).

As noted, operating permits are required for all ``major'' stationary sources, as well as air toxics sources subject
to requirements under section 112 of the Act (unless exempted), and sources subject to any new source performance
standard under section 111.
 In ozone nonattainment areas, section 182 defines major source according to the area's classification and the source's
potential to emit VOC or NO

X

: 50 tons per year in ``Serious'' areas, 25 tons per year in ``Severe'' areas, and 10 tons per year in ``Extreme'' areas.

<TEXT>
 



Consequently, each air pollution control agency in the FIP 
areas must, by virtue of Title V, incorporate and enforce all 
applicable FIP requirements in operating permits for every source 
with a potential to emit at or above the level prescribed in 
section 182 for the area's classification. Title V and EPA's 
operating permit regulations do not, however, mandate adoption of 
an operating permit program for nonmajor source categories (for 
example, in ``Severe'' areas, sources with a potential to emit less 
than 25 tons per year of VOC and NO

X

). Nevertheless, some 
nonmajor sources are subject to operating permit requirements 
because they are major sources of air toxics,
 and for these 
sources all applicable FIP requirements must be included in the 
permit and enforced by the air pollution control agency. 





2. Full transfer of authority through delegation.  EPA hopes that the State and local air pollution control agencies
will quickly adopt SIP rules that are identical or comparable to the FIP rules, and which could be approved before the
FIP regulation is scheduled for initial implementation. If a 
State or local agency adopts an essentially indistinguishable 
rule, EPA intends to delegate full implementation 
responsibilities to the agency immediately following State or 
local adoption, without opportunity for public comment, unless 
the delegation is under the authority of section 112, and not 
covered by a good cause exception. See EPA's enabling guidance 
for section 112(1). EPA will publish a notice of this delegation 
in the 

Federal Register

 and will otherwise try to ensure that 
affected sources are aware of that a State or local agency has 
assumed program implementation responsibilities. Subsequently, 
EPA will take normal SIP approval action on the State or local 
substitute rule, simultaneously rescinding the FIP rule in the 
jurisdiction's control area. 

 As noted in the discussion above regarding the California 
consumer product rules, EPA is issuing federal rules for these 
categories because the State has so far chosen not to submit the 
rules for SIP action. Since EPA's FIP rules are essentially 
identical, EPA intends to delegate to CARB the authority to 
implement the program if CARB has not yet submitted its own rules 
for SIP approval, and if California adopts adequate authority to 
implement the FIP. In the event that CARB fails to implement its 
own rules or amends the State's rules so that they become less 
stringent than the otherwise applicable federal rule, EPA will 
continue to directly enforce the provisions of the FIP consumer 
product rules. 

 In the future, EPA intends to promulgate in 40 CFR part 71 
provisions for delegation of certain federal operating permit 
program responsibilities to State and local agencies with 
adequate authority to administer the program but lacking EPA 
approval of the State or local program. EPA could use this 
procedure to grant State and local agencies the authority to 
issue operating permits prior to full EPA approval of the 
agencies' permit program. 

3. Full transfer of authority through SIP approval.  A State or local agency may adopt a rule that is comparable to the
FIP rule in emissions capture, but is significantly different in approach. In that event, immediate transfer of implementation
and enforcement authority through delegation is 
inappropriate without opportunity for public review and comment. 
Instead, EPA will try to ``parallel process'' SIP approval and FIP 
rescission as the means to expedite State or local assumption of 
authority.
 This will minimize the time during which affected 
sources are subject to overlapping and conflicting obligations, 
and during which EPA and the State or local agencies must 
undertake redundant permitting, compliance plan review, and 
enforcement. 




4. Partial transfer of authority through delegation.  To the extent that State law allows agencies to perform certain
implementation responsibilities for FIP rules even without State and local rule adoption, EPA will encourage these
agencies to agree to undertake, on EPA's behalf, administrative 
and substantive roles of FIP implementation consistent with the 
agencies' authorities and capabilities. These roles could 
include: procedural and engineering review of permit 
applications and compliance plans, preparation of draft permit 
and plan approval or disapproval actions, administration and 
oversight of compliance reporting and recordkeeping requirements, 
conduct of source inspections, and preparation of draft notices 
of violation. Under these circumstances, EPA would retain the 
responsibility for actual federal permit issuance, where the FIP 
requires permits, and for enforcement actions against sources 
violating FIP provisions. EPA would also maintain direct 
authority to terminate, modify, or revoke permits, as well as 
responsibility for disapproving compliance plans. 

Partial transfer of FIP implementation authorities would be 
effected through delegation by MOU between the EPA Region IX and 
the air pollution control officer or executive officer of the 
responsible agency. EPA will announce the terms of the partial 
delegation in a 

Federal Register

 notice, and will inform affected 
sources, with or without additional notice and opportunity for 
comment. 



IV. Administrative Requirements



A. Executive Order 12866



 Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993), 
the Agency must determine whether the regulatory actions are 
``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the 
requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines 
``significant regulatory actions'' as ones that are likely to 
result in rules that may: 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940505-1-00203 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or 
more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, 
productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health 
or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; 
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere 
with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, 
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations 
of recipients thereof; or 
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal 
mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth 
in the Executive Order. 

 Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order 12866, it has 
been determined that the proposed Federal Implementation Plans 
are ``significant regulatory actions''. As such, these actions 
were submitted to OMB along with regulatory impact assessments of 
the proposed actions and salient alternatives. 

The estimated annualized control cost to meet the Ozone 
NAAQS is $150 million in the Sacramento Metro Area as well as in 
Ventura County with 2005 as the attainment date for both areas. 
The estimated annualized control cost to meet the Ozone NAAQS in 
the South Coast Air Basin is $3 to $4 billion with 2010 as the 
attainment date. The incremental cost to achieve the Carbon 
Monoxide NAAQS in the South Coast Air Basin is zero. The 
enhanced inspection and maintenance provisions to achieve the 
Ozone NAAQS will together with other acceptable state measures 
also accomplish the Carbon Monoxide NAAQS objective. The 
estimated cost for the enhanced inspection and maintenance 
provision was reflected in the cost to achieve the Ozone NAAQS 
for the South Coast. The attainment date for the Carbon Monoxide 
NAAQS is 2000. 

However, the environmental and economic gains from the 
Federal Implementation Plans are real and potentially large in 
terms of the human population affected as well as the amount of 
crop and forest acreage affected. Furthermore, because of the 
jointness of certain control measures, benefits will not be 
limited to reductions in ozone and carbon monoxide 
concentrations. Benefits will also accrue in the form of 
reductions in nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter and air toxics 
concentrations. 

Scientific and data limitations preclude a quantitative and 
comprehensive assessment of benefits. Without such an 
assessment, the Agency cannot determine whether these FIPs are 
allocatively efficient. 

Due to the short deadlines in the court ordered schedule for 
this rulemaking, OMB did not have time to carry out its normal 
review under Executive Order 12866. 



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 and 1992 EPA 
guidelines require the identification of potentially adverse 
impacts of Federal regulations on small entities. Small entities 
include small businesses, organizations, and governmental 
jurisdictions. These proposed rules may adversely affect such 
entities. Consequently, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is 
required and has been prepared. 

The potential impact of the proposed rules will vary among 
affected entities both large and small. In some cases, cost 
savings may accrue to affected entities. In other instances, 
cost increases may be relatively modest. In other instances, 
control costs may exceed 10 percent of anticipated sales. 
However, due to uncertainties regarding source identification, 
the Agency cannot distinguish between small emission sources 
owned by small entities and those owned by larger firms. 
Furthermore, uncertainties in the cost and process economics data 
preclude specific findings on where averting and mitigating 
measures are warranted. 



C. Paperwork Reduction Act


The Paperwork Reduction Act requires that a Federal agency 
prepare an Information Collection Request to obtain OMB clearance 
for any activity that will involve collecting information from 
ten or more non-Federal respondents. The proposed Federal 
Implementation Plans necessitate preparation of an Information 
Collection Request. The information requirements associated with 
the proposed rules include reporting, monitoring, and 
recordkeeping and will affect the private sector as well as 
local, state, and Federal authorities. 

The information collection requirements have been estimated 
and summarized in the Information Collection Request and 
forwarded to OMB for review and approval under the Paperwork 
Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq. 

Until OMB approves the 
Information Collection Request, the reporting, monitoring, and/or 
recordkeeping aspects of these rules are not effective. OMB is 
currently reviewing the Information Collection Request and 
supporting documentation. Given the potential for changes in 
elements of the package prior to promulgation, OMB will not 
approve the Information Collection Request until that time. 



D. Federalism Implications



A federalism assessment has not been conducted under 
Executive Order 12612. However, federalism effects have been 
considered through the development of the proposed rules and will 
continue to be addressed in the period between proposal and 
promulgation. In particular, the Agency has worked closely with 
the local and state authorities to reflect their concerns in the 
fashioning of these rules.

Appendix I. Enhanced In-Use Compliance Program 


A. Light-Duty Vehicles and Trucks 


1. Introduction 


As described in Section III.D.2.a and b of this preamble, 
VOC and NO

X

 emissions from light-duty vehicles (LDVs) and trucks 
(LDTs) represented significant fractions of the total VOC and NO

X

 
emission inventories in the three FIP areas in 1990. Light-duty 
vehicles have remained a major source of emissions even though 
emission standards for light-duty vehicle exhaust hydrocarbon 
emissions have dropped more than 90 percent since 1970. The 
continuing high emissions derive from increases in VMT, the long 
life of vehicles in the temperate California climate and the 
failure of many current in-use vehicles to meet the standards to 
which they are certified when new. 
California has adopted very stringent light-duty vehicle 
emission certification standards known as the LEV program. This 
program will assure that new vehicles sold in California will 
have very low emissions. This will be accomplished through use 
of advanced emission controls and a new onboard diagnostic (OBD) 
requirement which is intended by CARB to identify for the driver 
and the repair technician whenever an emission control system has 
degraded sufficiently to increase emissions 50 percent above the 
certification standards. 
EPA expects the California Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) 
program will substantially reduce emissions of cars and light-duty trucks, compared to the federal standards. However,
despite 
the use of advanced technologies and the OBD requirements, CARB 
projects LEVs will exceed their certification standards in-use, 
although, for the reasons noted in Section III.D.1.a(2), by a 
much smaller margin than has occurred in the past. Emissions 
above the certification standards, referred to as excess 
emissions, will occur because some models may experience more in-use deterioration than expected, or because individual
vehicles 
experience component failure or improper maintenance which is not 
immediately corrected by the various existing in-use compliance 
programs, including enhanced I/M. Because the magnitude of the 
emission reductions needed for attainment is so great, the 
adoption of further measures to reduce these remaining excess in-use emissions will help reach attainment of the
ozone standard. 
EPA is therefore seeking comments on the need for and 
benefits of adopting an enhanced in-use compliance program which 
would provide extra emission reductions above and beyond the 
substantial reduction provided by the California LEV program, and 
cause in-use emissions to approach the certification standards. 
EPA believes that much of the responsibility to ensure low 
in-use emissions must rest with vehicle manufacturers, since 
owners, although they have a significant part to play cannot 
ensure performance that is not available from the hardware. 
Traditionally, the incentive for manufacturers to build emissions 
durability into their vehicles has been limited. Owners do not 
have the ability, nor often the interest, to ensure their 
emissions control equipment is performing properly. 
This section presents EPA's proposed enhanced in-use 
compliance program for LDVs, LDTs and certain medium-duty 
vehicles (MDVs). MDVs, as defined by CARB, have a gross vehicle 
weight rating (GVWR) between 6000 and 14,000 pounds. For those 
MDVs above 8500 pounds GVWR, CARB gives manufacturers the option 
of certifying as a specific and complete vehicle, or as a heavy-duty engine which can be placed in any heavy-duty vehicle.
Since 
MDVs certified as complete vehicles are much more analogous to 
LDVs and LDTs than heavy-duty engines, chassis-certified MDVs are 
being included here in the enhanced in-use compliance program for 
light-duty vehicles and trucks. The enhanced in-use compliance 
programs for heavy-duty engines and nonroad engines are similar 
in purpose and are presented in Sections B. and C. of this 
appendix below. 
The light-duty enhanced in-use compliance program attempts 
to encourage manufacturers to build additional durability into 
their emission control equipment by increasing the manufacturers 
responsibility for repairing problem vehicles identified by the inspection and maintenance (I/M) and recall programs.
The 
I/M program is revised by shifting responsibility for repair to 
manufacturers if a significant percentage of vehicles are not 
performing close to certification levels in use. The potential 
responsibility shift should encourage manufacturers to build 
additional durability and improved repairability into their 
vehicles. The lower allowable I/M emission levels will ensure 
that vehicles are repaired if not performing satisfactorily. 
Also, the recall program is extended for the full useful life and 
all vehicles are tested and included provided they have not been 
obviously tampered or abused. Additionally, MDV emissions 
standards are reduced as significantly as light-duty standards 
have already been reduced. 


2. New Vehicle Program 


New vehicle certification, and particularly the associated 
emission standards, play an important role in defining the types 
of emission control hardware placed on vehicles. These standards 
also essentially define the best level of emission control that 
can be expected from in-use vehicles. The majority of current 
in-use emissions come not from vehicles meeting their emission 
standards, but from vehicles which exceed their standards. EPA 
believes that the CARB LEV program with enhanced I/M will 
substantially reduce the occurrence of vehicles which exceed 
their standards by a substantial margin. However, emission 
predictions indicate that on average vehicles will not meet their 
emission standards in use. Therefore, the focus of EPA's 
proposed enhanced in-use compliance program is on two programs, 
recall and I/M, which can provide additional incentives to 
vehicle manufacturers to build the lowest emitting vehicles 
possible. However, no changes to CARB's motor vehicle control 
program are necessary to implement these two approaches to an 
enhanced in-use compliance program for new LDVs, LDTs and MDVs. 
EPA is proposing that the enhanced in-use compliance program 
be applied to all new vehicles that are defined under California 
regulations as passenger cars, light-duty trucks, or medium-duty 
vehicles, beginning in model year 1999. This would include all 
on-highway vehicles up to 14,000 pounds GVWR, with the exception 
of those MDVs which are certified as engines under both CARB's 
program and EPA's enhanced in-use compliance program described in 
Section B. Any of these vehicles offered for sale or first 
registered in California would need to comply with the enhanced 
in-use standards described below.

<TEXT>
 



The application of this program on a statewide basis is 
considered necessary because vehicle traffic flow into and out of 
the areas covered by the FIPs is large. Any program constrained 
to only the FIP areas would be extremely difficult to implement 
and enforce. EPA is concerned that the benefits of the enhanced 
in-use compliance program may be diminished if a large number of 
vehicles first registered in other states are brought into 
California. These vehicles may be less expensive because they 
would not have to meet enhanced in-use or California low emission 
vehicle standards. EPA proposes, therefore, very strict 
restrictions on importation of 49-state vehicles (Section d.2.h. 
of the Preamble). 
Because new vehicle programs such as this one are relatively 
slow in achieving their full emission reduction benefit due to 
the time required for fleet turnover, EPA solicits comments on 
the feasibility of implementing this program earlier, such as via 
a partial phase-in in model year 1998. The emissions reduction 
achieved by earlier implementation could reduce the need for 
increased stringency in other source categories. 
As described below, the proposed enhanced in-use compliance 
program concerns only non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) and NO

X

 
emissions, and does not cover CO emissions. California is 
projected to be in attainment with the NAAQS for CO by 2000 as 
required by the Clean Air Act, before the enhanced in-use 
compliance program would have had a chance to achieve any 
significant CO emissions reductions. In addition, the FIP 
addresses only ozone non-attainment and thus focuses only on 
ozone precursors, NMHC and NO

X

. 
EPA's proposed requirements for the enhanced in-use 
compliance program are presented in Sections A.(2)(a) and 
A.(2)(b), respectively. Descriptions of new recall and I/M 
requirements under the enhanced in-use compliance program follow 
in Sections A.(3) and A.(4). 
a. 

New light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks.

 California's LEV program greatly reduces the emissions 
permitted from new LDVs and LDTs. CARB's 100,000 mile NMOG and 
NO

X

 LEV standards for LDVs and small LDTs are 0.09 and 0.3 gram 
per mile (g/mi), respectively. Higher numerical standards apply 
to Transitional LEVs (TLEVs) and lower numerical standards apply 
to Ultra LEVs (ULEVs). By model year 2000, CARB's fleet average 
NMOG standards require the average vehicle to be slightly below 
the emission standards applicable to LEVs. Assuming a reactivity 
adjustment factor of 0.98 for NMOG (that for California Phase II 
reformulated gasoline), CARB's LEV standards are 70 and 50 
percent below the Federal Tier I NMHC and NO

X

 standards, 
respectively. By model year 2003, CARB's fleet average NMOG 
standard for LDVs and small LDTs is even more stringent, 0.062 
g/mi. 
Under the enhanced in-use compliance program, EPA proposes 
that LDVs and LDTs comply with the in-use composite NMHC and NO

X

 
standards contained in Table AI.A-1. EPA is proposing a single 
composite NMHC recall standard (for each vehicle class) that will 
apply throughout the useful life of the vehicle. The proposed 
NO

X

 standards for post-1998 model year LDVs and LDTs are the same 
as CARB's standards for LEVs. To afford a smoother transition to 
this program, EPA proposes that up to 25 percent of a 
manufacturer's 1999 model year LDV and LDT sales fleet may comply 
with ``transitional'' enhanced in-use standards also contained in 
Table AI.A-1. The transitional enhanced in-use NO

X

 standards are 
the same as CARB's NO

X

 standards for TLEVs. EPA is proposing 
this transition, because CARB's fleet average NMOG standard for 
the 1999 model year will still allow a significant number of 
TLEVs to be sold. However, after 1999, the fleet average NMOG 
standard becomes sufficiently stringent to prohibit any 
significant number of TLEVs from being sold. Given that the 
great majority of vehicles will be meeting the NO

X

 standards 
applicable, it is not clear why any vehicles should be able to be 
sold which only meet the significantly less stringent TLEV 
standards (usually a factor of two higher than the LEV 
standards).

For NMHC, EPA is proposing a composite (exhaust plus 
evaporative) NMHC standard, as opposed to separate standards for 
exhaust NMHC emissions and the many types of evaporative-related 
NMHC emissions. This composite standard will allow greater 
flexibility, as well as reduced costs, while ensuring that the 
necessary in-use performance is attained. 
In order to determine compliance with a composite NMHC 
standard, it was necessary to develop a method for combining 
exhaust emissions and the three different components of 
evaporative emissions (i.e., diurnal and hot soak emissions 
(measured on a gram/test basis) and running loss emissions 
(measured on a gram/mile basis)). Resting loss emissions are 
another form of evaporative emissions. However, there is no 
current standard or separate test for resting losses because they 
are measured during the various parts of the evaporative 
emissions test procedure, particularly during the diurnal 
emission test, and are accounted for in those results. 
In support of its efforts to model in-use emissions (e.g., 
MOBILE5a), EPA has developed a methodology for combining exhaust 
and evaporative emissions into a composite emission factor. It 
essentially consists of converting those components not measured 
on a gram per mile basis to grams per mile and then summing the 
individual components. The key conversion factors are the number 
of trips per day (for hot soaks) and the number of miles driven 
per day (for hot soaks and diurnals). Estimates of these factors 
over the useful life of LDVs and LDTs were taken from MOBILE5a. 
Their use in converting individual NMHC emission levels into a 
single composite level or standard is shown in the equation 
below.












EPA has not included refueling emissions in this equation given 
the uncertainty with respect to the use of onboard vehicle 
controls in California. EPA requests comments on their exclusion 
and on the option of including refueling emissions in the 
composite standard should California vehicles be subject to the 
onboard refueling requirement. 
Refueling emissions would be relatively simple to include, 
as refueling emissions in terms of grams per gallon could simply 
be divided by fuel economy to obtain NMHC emissions per mile. 
The fuel economy used could either be measured over the FTP when 
exhaust NMHC and NO

X

 were measured (an urban only fuel economy) 
or taken from the certified urban/rural composite fuel economy 
value for that engine family. Including refueling emissions in 
this manner would give some credit for high efficiency vehicles, 
but would still represent additional testing and resultant cost. 
Given the high level of refueling emissions control expected with 
onboard controls, EPA believes that including refueling emissions 
in the composite standard would not justify the cost of the 
additional testing. 
EPA believes that the composite NMHC standards contained in 
Table AI.A-1 are feasible, particularly given the flexibility 
afforded in trading off exhaust and evaporative emissions. For 
example, a vehicle meeting the current CARB LEV standards for 
exhaust NMOG emissions and CARB's evaporative emission standards 
applicable to all LDVs and LDTs would comply with the proposed 
enhanced in-use standards. The CARB LDV/LDT standards are 0.05 
gram/mile for running losses and a total of 2.0 grams/test for 
diurnal and hot soak emissions combined. A vehicle meeting the 
running loss standard would contribute 0.05 g/mi or less to the 
equation presented above. The contribution of a vehicle meeting 
the 2.0 grams/test emission standard would depend on the 
breakdown between diurnal and hot soak emissions. The newly 
revised CARB and EPA evaporative emissions test procedures 
contain a one hour hot soak test and a multi-day diurnal test. 
This requires very stringent control of resting loss emissions, 
which occur during both tests. As the 2 gram standard requires 
the almost total elimination of NMHC emissions through the 
evaporative emission control canister, EPA expects that the bulk 
of in-use emissions will be resting losses. Given that hot soak 
emissions only include a single hour of resting losses, albeit at 
somewhat elevated temperatures, EPA expects that hot soak 
emissions will be very low relative to diurnal emissions and that 
the bulk of the 2 grams will be diurnal emissions. Specifically, 
assuming that vehicles meeting the 2.0 grams/test evaporative 
emission in-use emitted 1.9 grams/test diurnal and 0.1 gram/test 
hot soak, the overall contribution in the above equation would be 
0.082 g/mi. With running losses of 0.05 g/mi, this represents a 
total non-exhaust NMHC emission of 0.132 g/mi.

CARB's 50,000 and 100,000 mile LDV NMOG standards for LEVs are 0.075 and 0.09 g/mi, respectively. While CARB's NMOG
measurements include the direct measurement of aldehydes, which are undermeasured by 1-2 percent in the measurement
of NMHC by the flame ionization detector (FID), this is balanced by the 0.98 reactivity adjustment factor allowed
for CARB Phase II reformulated gasoline. Thus, numerically, for gasoline vehicles at least, NMOG and NMHC emissions
will be roughly equivalent. A LDV certified to CARB's LEV standards which just met its exhaust and non-exhaust emission
standards in use would exceed the proposed enhanced in-use composite NMHC standards by 0.007 




g/mi at 50,000 miles and 0.022 g/mi at 100,000 miles. EPA believes that it is extremely unlikely that a vehicle would
just meet all 4 of these NMHC emission standards simultaneously during certification with all of its emission controls
performing as designed. Manufacturers utilize significant safety margins in certification to avoid the costs of
modifying their design and retesting. Therefore, EPA does not expect that emission levels in certification will
have to be reduced to meet the enhanced in-use standards relative to those otherwise occurring. The feasibility of
meeting these standards in use is discussed in the next section addressing recall standards and testing. 



As noted earlier in describing the enhanced in-use NO

X

 standards, EPA is proposing to allow up to 25 percent of a manufacturer's 1999 model year sales to meet transitional
enhanced in-use standards. Comparing EPA's proposed transitional enhanced in-use standards to CARB's individual
emission standards for non-exhaust NMHC and CARB's exhaust NMOG emission standards for TLEVs results in essentially
the same comparison as that shown above for LEVs. EPA requests comments on the proposed enhanced in-use standards
for LDVs and LDTs and on the methodology used to combine exhaust and non-exhaust NMHC emissions. 

Manufacturers will have to demonstrate in their application for certification to EPA that each of their vehicle engine
families will comply with the enhanced in-use standards described above, as well as the I/M standards described in
Section A.(4) below. As discussed in Section A.(4), the enhanced in-use I/M standards are numerically less stringent
than those described above. Also, the I/M 240 test does not include cold start emissions, which form the bulk of FTP
NMHC emissions. Thus, EPA expects that the demonstration of compliance with the enhanced in-use standards will focus
on those standards described above. For the great majority of post-1998 model year California vehicles, this demonstration
will consist of the submission of information already required by CARB along with the calculation of composite NMHC
emissions using the equation presented above and a showing that composite NMHC and NO

X

 emissions comply with the enhanced in-use standards contained in the table ``Proposed Certification and In-Use
Standards for Post-1998 Model Year LDVs and LDTs.'' The application would also include such other information as
necessary to show that the vehicle engine family will meet these standards under typical in-use conditions (i.e.,
absent obvious tampering or abuse) over its full useful life, which would be enforced through the enhanced in-use
compliance recall program. 

As mentioned above, these standards apply to vehicles certified to operate on any fuel: Gasoline, diesel fuel or otherwise.
This should not be a problem for hydrocarbon fuels such as natural gas or propane, as NMHC is an appropriate measure
of their organic emissions vis-a-vis ozone production. However, organic emissions from alcohol fueled vehicles
are highly oxygenated and not included in NMHC. EPA proposes that alcohol fueled vehicles have the same numerical
standards for organics as shown in Table AI.A-1, but in terms of organic material hydrocarbon equivalent (OMHCE)
emissions. OMHCE consists of the mass of both non-oxygenated and oxygenated HCs, with the mass of oxygen excluded
(40 CFR 86.090-2). Such standards would apply to the same categories of vehicles to which the current EPA OMHCE
standards apply (40 CFR 86.090-8 through -11 and any versions of these sections which apply to later model
year vehicles). EPA requests comments on the use of OMHCE standards and the categories of those vehicles (i.e., fuel
types) to which they should apply. 

EPA also proposes to accept, for the purpose of certifying enhanced in-use compliance vehicles, the use of evaporative
emissions and running losses measured using CARB's test procedure. For recall testing, however (see Section A.(3)
below), due to lower cost, EPA proposes to use its own test procedures with the substitution of CARB's fuel specifications
and ambient temperatures.

In their certification application for the 1999 model year, manufacturers will also have to identify which engine
families are only meeting the somewhat less stringent transitional enhanced in-use standards. Manufacturers will
also have to monitor the sales of these models to ensure they represent no more than 25 percent of total sales. As mentioned
earlier, manufacturers would also have to certify that their vehicles would meet the enhanced in-use I/M standards
proposed in Section A.(4) below. However, as that standard is 0.20 g/mi exhaust HC over a test which excludes cold start
emissions, EPA expects this to be very easy to do relative to the certification and recall FTP standards. Natural gas
fueled vehicles will have the greatest difficulty meeting this I/M 240 standard relative to compliance with the enhanced
in-use FTP standards, because of these vehicles' relatively high emissions of methane relative to NMHC. The enhanced
in-use standards over the full FTP exclude methane, (i.e., are in terms of NMHC) and CARB's NMOG standards greatly
diminish methane's importance. However, the I/M 240 test includes methane (i.e., measures total HC). Overall, though,
natural gas vehicles have very low levels of NMHC emissions and, given the warmed up nature of the I/M 240 test, are still
expected to be able to meet this standard with little difficulty. EPA requests comments on how these vehicles should
be addressed in conventional and enhanced in-use compliance I/M.

EPA also proposes that all enhanced in-use compliance vehicles provide easy access for I/M pressure and purge testing.
Otherwise, the types of tests performed, the fuels used and other certification application details can continue
to be performed in accordance with CARB rules.



b. New medium-duty vehicles.

 CARB's MDV standards for 1995 and later model years apply to vehicles between 6,000 and 14,000 pounds GVWR, not otherwise
qualifying as LDTs. However, CARB allows, at the manufacturer's discretion, MDVs over 8500 pounds GVWR to be certified
as engines according to their requirements for heavy-duty engines. EPA proposes that all 1999 and later model vehicles
certified under CARB's LEV program as MDVs be subject to the enhanced in-use standards for MDVs. Engines certified
under CARB's requirements as heavy-duty engines would be subject to EPA's enhanced in-use compliance program for
heavy-duty engines described in Section B. below.

The table below (``Proposed Certification and In-Use Standards for MDVs under the Enhanced In-Use Compliance Program'')
contains the composite NMHC and NO

X

 emission standards being proposed for MDVs under the enhanced in-use compliance program. EPA is proposing a single
composite hydrocarbon recall standard (for each subclass of MDVs) that will apply throughout the useful life of a
MDV. Compliance with the composite NMHC standard would be performed in the same manner as that for LDVs and LDTs, using
the equation presented above in Appendix I.A.2.a. These standards are designed to provide generally the same stringency
of control as the enhanced in-use standards for the heavier LDTs presented in the previous section.

EPA believes that the technology being applied to heavier LDTs to meet the enhanced in-use standards can be applied
to MDVs as well. EPA requests comments on the applicability of standards equivalent to the enhanced in-use standards
for LDTs to MDVs.

As mentioned earlier, EPA is proposing to allow up to 25 percent of a manufacturer's 1999 model year MDV sales fleet
to comply with ``transitional'' standards that are less stringent than the enhanced in-use standards. The table
above also contains the proposed standards for such ``transitional'' vehicles. The proposed composite standards
for the transitional MDVs are roughly equivalent in stringency for MDVs as they are for LDTs. As with the enhanced in-use
compliance LDTs, EPA is proposing a single composite hydrocarbon standard (for each subclass of MDVs) that will apply
throughout the useful life of a transitional MDV.

California's definition of MDVs includes trucks which EPA includes in its definition of LDTs (i.e., those up to 8500
pounds GVWR), as well as trucks EPA considers heavy-duty trucks (i.e., those between 8501 and 14,000 pounds GVWR).
In its past rulemakings establishing HC, CO and NO

X

 standards for LDTs, EPA found no technological concerns that would limit the application of engine or catalyst technology
to only those trucks below 6000 pounds GVWR (50 FR 10651). EPA did find sufficient reason to limit catalyst technology
to only those heavy-duty trucks below 14,000 pounds GVWR, but this distinction coincides with CARB's split between
MDVs and heavy-duty vehicles. The primary means of meeting CARB's LEV standards will likely be an additional catalyst
which begins operation very quickly to reduce cold-start emissions (e.g., an electrically heated catalyst). EPA
is unaware of any evidence which would limit the use of this technology to only those vehicles up to 6000 pounds GVWR,
particularly given the fact that trucks up to 14,000 pounds GVWR already are catalyst equipped. EPA requests comments
on all of the proposed MDV standards, including the assumptions made regarding the levels of evaporative emissions
from MDVs.

As will be the case for LDVs and LDTs, manufacturers would continue to certify to CARB's certification MDV standards.
However, here, with regard to MDVs, the demonstration of compliance with the enhanced in-use standards would be more
significant, given CARB's standards for post-1998 MDVs. Manufacturers would be still be required to submit information
already required by CARB along with the calculation of composite NMHC emissions using the equation presented above
and a showing that composite NMHC and NO

X

 emissions comply with the enhanced in-use standards contained in the above table. The application would also include
such additional information as may be necessary to show that the vehicle engine family will meet these standards under
typical in-use conditions for its full useful life, which would be enforced through the enhanced in-use recall program.
Manufacturers would also have to demonstrate compliance with the enhanced in-use I/M standards. However, again,
this will be much easier than that with respect to the full-life certification and recall standards.

For the 1999 model year only, manufacturers will have to designate those engine families certifying to the less stringent
transitional enhanced in-use standards and monitor sales to ensure sales of these engine families stays at or below
25 percent of total sales. These standards would be applicable to all MDVs regardless of fuel type. As for LDVs and LDTs,
all post-1998 model year MDVs will be required to provide easy access for I/M pressure and purge checks. Comments are
requested on all these requirements and on the extent to which these requirements complement CARB's existing LEV
program for MDVs.

For flexibility, EPA is also proposing optional engine-based 
standards for diesel-powered and incomplete vehicle engines used 
in MDVs with GVWR between 8,501 and 14,000 pounds. (Under CARB's 
motor vehicle control program, such MDV engines have the option 
to certify to engine-based standards.) Manufacturers of such MDV 
engines may elect to comply with the chassis-based program 
discussed in this section or they may elect to certify to the 
engine-based standards described in Section B. of this appendix. 
The reader is directed to that section for more information on 
the proposed engine-based standards and other MDV/engine 
requirements under this program. 


c. Authority.

 As explained above in Section III.A.2.a of the preamble, in 
promulgating a FIP under section 110(c), EPA may take any actions 
that the state could take. As section 209 of the CAA provides 
that California is not preempted from adopting and implementing a 
motor vehicle emissions control program provided its program 
satisfies the criteria of section 209(b), EPA believes that it, 
acting on behalf of California in the context of a FIP, may adopt 
a motor vehicle program or supplement California's own motor 
vehicle program provided that EPA's actions would satisfy the 
criteria of section 209(b) for a waiver of federal preemption. 
That section provides that EPA is to grant California a waiver of 
preemption if the State determines that its standards ``will be, 
in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and 
welfare as applicable federal standards.'' 
Section 209(b) further provides that no waiver is to be 
granted if EPA finds that (A) the determination of the State that 
the standards are, in the aggregate, at least as protective of 
public health and welfare as the otherwise applicable federal 
standards is arbitrary and capricious, (B) State standards are 
not needed to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions, or 
(C) the State standards and accompanying enforcement procedures 
are not consistent with section 202(a). EPA has interpreted the 
consistency criterion as meaning that California motor vehicle 
standards and accompanying enforcement procedures must satisfy 
the leadtime requirements of section 202(a)_that they be 
technologically feasible within the leadtime provided, taking 
into account the cost of compliance_and not impose inconsistent 
certification test procedure requirements such that the same 
vehicle could not be used to comply with both state and federal 
certification requirements (see e.g., 43 FR 32182 (July 25, 
1978), 40 FR 30131 (July 18, 1975), 43 FR 1839 (January 12, 
1978)). 
EPA believes that the enhanced in-use compliance program for 
light and medium-duty vehicles that would be applicable to 
vehicles and engines in California under the proposed FIP would 
satisfy the section 209 waiver criteria. Thus, California could 
undertake the enhanced in-use compliance program described in 
this appendix, and, therefore, EPA has authority under section 
110(c) to undertake the proposed programs. 
With respect to the protectiveness of the standards, all of 
the proposed standards are at least as protective as the 
otherwise applicable federal standards (e.g., the Tier 1 NO

X

 and 
NMHC standards in the case of light-duty vehicles and the 
generally applicable NO

X

 and NMHC standards in the case of the 
vehicles and engines covered by the medium-duty and heavy-duty 
aspects of the enhanced in-use compliance program). Indeed, 
these standards are at least as stringent as the comparable 
standards that California has already adopted and for which 
waivers have already been granted. 
With respect to the need to meet compelling and 
extraordinary conditions, EPA has repeatedly found that 
California's air quality problems satisfy the need criterion of 
section 209(b) (see, e.g., 49 FR 18887 and 18890 (May 3, 1984), 
58 FR 4144 (January 13, 1993)). Moreover, the magnitude of the 
reductions in emissions needed to reach attainment in the FIP 
areas, including mobile source emissions (discussed above in 
Section III.H.2 of the preamble), provides ample evidence of the 
need for more stringent motor vehicle emission standards in 
California. 
Finally, with respect to the criterion of consistency with 
section 202(a), EPA believes that its proposed enhanced in-use 
compliance program is consistent with both the technological 
feasibility and certification elements of that criterion. For 
the reasons explained below, EPA believes that the enhanced in-use compliance program is technologically feasible
within the 
leadtime provided, taking into account the cost of compliance. 
Moreover, no aspect of the enhanced in-use compliance program 
establishes any new certification test procedures that are 
inconsistent with either existing federal or California test 
procedure requirements. Consequently, EPA believes that its 
proposed enhanced in-use compliance programs satisfy this prong 
of section 209 as well. 


3. Enhanced In-use Compliance Recall Program 


Historically, EPA has enforced emissions standards through 
an in-use testing program commonly referred to as the ``recall'' 
program (39 FR 44375, Dec. 23, 1974), as provided by section 
207(c) of the CAA. This section requires manufacturers to take 
remedial actions if EPA finds that a ``substantial'' number of 
vehicles, although properly maintained and used, fail to conform 
to an applicable emissions standard during their useful life. 
EPA is proposing a recall program under the enhanced in-use 
compliance program that is different in several aspects compared 
to the program established pursuant to CAA section 207(c) for 49 
state vehicles and engines. The differences and the rationale 
for them are described fully in the paragraphs below. The recall 
provisions described in this section apply to 1999 and later 
model year light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and medium-
duty vehicles certified to the chassis-based standards described 
in the previous section. These recall provisions also apply to 
on-highway HDEs and nonroad engines, except as noted in the 
recall provisions contained in section B for HDEs and section C 
for nonroad engines below. 
EPA has based the enhanced in-use compliance recall program 
on its current recall program, where possible. Thus, aspects of 
the program not specifically discussed here will be the same as 
in the current program (see 40 CFR part 85 subpart S). For 
example, all test procedures utilized will be current Federal 
procedures, with the exception of ambient temperatures used in 
the evaporative emission and running loss testing and the fuel 
used in all testing. EPA will utilize CARB's ambient 
temperatures and CARB Phase II reformulated gasoline in recall 
testing. 
If CARB decides to enforce the enhanced in-use compliance 
recall program and assume responsibility for the recall program, 
CARB will likely use its own detailed recall methodologies, for 
which it has received waivers under section 209 of the CAA, with 
appropriate changes to ensure compliance with the changes 
described below. EPA requests comments on the use of current 
recall practices where not modified below, as well as the 
possible performance of recall testing by CARB using their 
procedures. 
The proposed enhanced in-use compliance recall program is 
discussed in detail in the following sections: (a) Recall 
standards (b) consideration of maintenance, tampering, and abuse, 
(c) test vehicle selection, (d) testing throughout the vehicles' 
useful life, (e) vehicle family selection, (f) criteria for 
requiring recall, (g) mandatory owner participation in recall 
repairs, (h) geographic extent of recall, (i) technical 
feasibility, and (j) alternatives.

a. Recall standards.

 The key premise of the enhanced in-use compliance recall 
program is that vehicles meet their certified emission levels 
throughout their entire useful life. The standards which will 
apply under the enhanced in-use compliance recall program for 
LDVs, LDTs and MDVs will be those in the tables presented above 
in Section A.(2). Calculation of composite NMHC emissions will 
be according to the equation also presented in Appendix I.A.2.a. 
above. 


b. Consideration of maintenance, tampering, and abuse.

 For 49 state vehicles, CAA section 207(c) limits 
manufacturers' responsibility to those vehicles that have been 
``properly maintained and used.'' Manufacturers are able to 
exclude vehicles that do not receive such care or cannot be 
proven to have received such care from the recall testing pool 
or, if they believe that such vehicles have been included, 
challenge the validity of any findings made. Due to this 
limitation, EPA generally only tests vehicles that have been 
maintained and used in strict accordance to the owner's 
maintenance manual. It is particularly difficult to find older 
vehicles with sufficient documentation or to prove ``proper 
care.'' The current program, therefore, provides little incentive 
to the manufacturer to design and build vehicles with durable 
emissions performance under normal or typical maintenance and 
use. 
As mentioned in the introduction in Section 2.d of the 
preamble, the primary goal of the enhanced in-use compliance 
program is to ensure that vehicles remain in compliance with 
emissions standards in use over their full life under normal 
operating conditions. If motor vehicles are to cease to be a 
major source of ozone-related emissions and noncompliance with 
the NAAQS for ozone, manufacturers must make greater efforts to 
ensure continued in-use emissions performance. Therefore, EPA 
proposes not to exclude vehicles from recall testing unless they 
have been subject to obvious abuse or tampering. Obvious abuse 
or tampering includes: (1) Less than one half the recommended 
level of oil in the engine, (2) the deliberate removal of the 
catalyst or evaporative canister, (3) the turbocharging of a 
naturally aspirated engine, and (4) damage to the engine or 
emission controls resulting from a vehicular accident. EPA is 
proposing to exclude such vehicles from recall testing because 
such actions can severely affect vehicle emissions and the 
manufacturer has no reasonable way of controlling or limiting the 
impact of these items on emissions. EPA requests comments on 
other specific items that would meet these criteria. 
In addition, EPA will not perform a vehicle ``tune-up'' or 
perform other emission related repairs or maintenance before 
testing. EPA believes that pre-recall maintenance would defeat 
the purpose of the enhanced in-use compliance recall program, 
which is to further encourage durable designs. Even hoses whose 
proper connection is critical to acceptable emission performance 
can be designed to be unlikely to disconnect during normal 
maintenance and use. 
As with current recall testing, EPA will inspect vehicles 
prior to testing to determine if obvious abuse or tampering has 
occurred. As is current EPA practice, the vehicle manufacturer 
can be present at time of vehicle procurement and testing to help 
ensure that vehicles are appropriately screened for obvious abuse 
and tampering problems. 

It is also important to point out, as will be discussed in 
more detail in the next section, that only vehicles which are 
subject to the new enhanced I/M program are candidates for 
enhanced in-use recall testing. Participation in this 
I/M 
program should encourage owners to perform reasonable maintenance 
and deter emission related tampering. 
Again, EPA requests comments on the types of abuse or 
tampering which would allow for the exclusion of vehicles from 
the recall sample. Commenters should provide supporting 
rationale and data to the extent practicable so that EPA may 
ascertain the severity, likelihood, and possible mitigating 
actions. 


c. Test vehicle selection.

 EPA proposes to select vehicles for enhanced in-use 
compliance recall testing from the portion of the vehicle family 
population that is subject to the enhanced I/M testing program 
described above. This would essentially limit testing to only 
vehicles that are registered in one of the three FIP areas, 
unless the State of California opts to adopt enhanced I/M 
procedures in other areas of the state. EPA is proposing to 
limit the sampling in this way because recall testing resources 
are limited and the vehicles registered in the three FIP areas 
are the most relevant with regard to air quality in these areas. 
Furthermore, problems that cause noncompliance within this 
subpopulation of vehicles are very likely to exist in the 
population as a whole. The reverse may not be true because I/M 
will be insuring reasonable maintenance and catching and 
correcting emissions problems. EPA believes it would be 
inappropriate to require a recall campaign due to a problem found 
outside of a FIP area that enhanced I/M would have possibly 
already corrected. 
EPA requests comments on the above sampling methods. EPA 
also requests comments on other alternatives, including limiting 
the sampling to vehicles subject to basic I/M as well as enhanced 
I/M or sampling from the entire state's vehicle population. 


d. Testing throughout the vehicle's useful life.

 EPA proposes to conduct recall testing throughout the useful 
life of the vehicles specified in the applicable regulations. 
EPA would also require any necessary remedial actions to be 
performed on all vehicles in the vehicle family still within 
their useful life. EPA believes that conducting recall in this 
manner is consistent with the intent of the enhanced in-use 
compliance program, which is to hold the manufacturers 
responsible for in-use emissions compliance over the full useful 
life period.

<TEXT>
 



EPA recognizes that vehicles are often used for periods longer than the useful life period specified in the applicable
regulations. In California, over 40 percent of onroad light-duty vehicles have over 100,000 miles on their odometers.
EPA is concerned about the emissions of vehicles after the end of the vehicle's useful life because, although such
vehicles will still be subject to I/M testing, manufacturers will be no longer responsible for ensuring that the vehicles
remain in compliance with the in-use recall standards. Comments are requested on whether other in-use compliance
programs such an enhanced OBD, which remain effective beyond the vehicle's statutory useful life, are feasible and
may result in equal or greater emission reductions than the proposed enhanced in-use recall program. 

For heavy-duty engines (discussed in section B. below), which are rebuilt several times and are used significantly
longer than the useful life specified by the manufacturer on a regular basis, EPA is proposing rebuild regulations
(see section B.) for engines beyond their originally certified useful life. EPA requests comments on adopting comparable
rebuild provisions for light-duty and medium-duty vehicles that are certified to chassis-based standards in order
to ensure that these vehicles continue to meet in-use recall standards throughout their operating lives. 



e. Vehicle family selection. 

As with the 49 state recall program, EPA may select vehicle families for enhanced in-use compliance recall testing
at its discretion. For the 49 state recall program, EPA examines a variety of items when choosing a vehicle family for
recall testing including testing data from certification and production line audits, production volumes, and defect
reports. EPA is likely to also examine these items for the enhanced in-use compliance recall program. Additionally,
EPA is planning to examine enhanced I/M testing results for patterns of failure within exhaust engine families. 

EPA also plans to track the various technologies being used to meet enhanced in-use standards. If EPA believes that
a technology may be more susceptible to in-use emissions performance deterioration, EPA may choose to proceed with
recall testing of vehicle families using that particular technology. Special concerns may arise related to the use
of a particular fuel or, more likely, related to the complexity of a technology and therefore its additional areas
for failure. 



f. Criteria for requiring recall.

  EPA proposes to, at its discretion, require a manufacturer to recall vehicles and take remedial action if the average
emissions of the test vehicles for any regulated pollutant exceed the applicable emissions standard. EPA proposes
to retain the discretion not to order a recall if it determines that a recall action is not warranted. Manufacturers
would be able to present data and reasoning to EPA for the Agency to consider in making a final decision on whether or
not to proceed with a recall. However, EPA is concerned that the recall program may not be viewed as a strong enforcement
tool if its authority is too discretionary. EPA wishes to make clear its intent to hold manufacturers responsible
for in-use failures of essentially all vehicles except those that have been subject to obvious abuse or tampering.


EPA also recognizes that outlier vehicles in the recall sample could cause an inappropriate recall. The impact of
an outlier on the results of a recall test could be substantial because the recall test sample could be relatively small
(about 10 vehicles). EPA would allow manufacturers to provide additional test data showing that a vehicle is unrepresentative
(i.e., an outlier), and this data may then be considered by EPA in making a final determination. 

EPA is also concerned that vehicles representing a small percentage of the engine family population (e.g., 5 percent
or less) could exhibit such relatively high emissions as to cause the average emissions of the entire engine family
to greatly exceed the enhanced in-use standards. For example, if five vehicles per one hundred failed to their pre-control
levels of 7 or 8 g/mi NMHC and the remaining vehicles had zero emissions, the engine family would still exceed its standard
by 100 percent. EPA is concerned about the emissions impact of this engine family, but is also concerned about the cost,
inefficiency and vehicle owner inconvenience of a traditional recall where 95 out of 100 vehicles would be returned
to the dealer but require no repair. While the enhanced I/M program will reduce the likelihood of occurrence, such
situations may still be common. Comments are requested on alternatives to conventional recall in such cases. Comments
on innovative onboard diagnostic capabilities or other screening techniques are also requested. One such approach
is discussed in section (j). 

EPA requests comments on the recall criteria and authority described above for the enhanced in-use compliance recall
program. EPA encourages any recommendations for adopting different criteria be supported by data and detailed rationale.




g. Mandatory owner participation in recall repairs. 

Because of the potential large negative impact that vehicles exceeding the standards have on air quality, EPA believes
that owners should be required to bring their recalled vehicles in for repairs. While EPA's 49 state recall program
does not require owners of recalled vehicles to go to a dealership for needed repairs, California does require recall
repairs to be performed (see section 2129 of title 13 of the California Code of Regulations) and the requirement is
enforced by denying vehicle reregistration until the repairs have been made. (Driving unregistered vehicles is,
of course, unlawful and prohibited.) California currently begins to deny reregistrations six months after the manufacturer
begins its remedial action plan. EPA proposes that vehicles subject to the enhanced in-use compliance program also
be subject to the same mandatory repair requirements as other California vehicles.

h. Geographic extent of recall.

  EPA is proposing that the enhanced in-use compliance program apply to all vehicles sold in California for both enforceability
and environmental reasons. EPA therefore proposes that any required recalls also apply to all vehicles of the affected
engine family which have been sold throughout the state. This will also include vehicles from all model years that
are part of the same engine family. Engine families consist of vehicles with the same basic emissions design and performance
and problems with a single model year's vehicles should also exist on other model years' vehicles. EPA requests comments
on the extension of recalls to all vehicles statewide versus only those vehicles registered in the three FIP areas.



i. Technical feasibility.

 As discussed in Section A.(2) above, EPA does not expect manufacturers to have to reduce the low-mileage emissions
of properly operating vehicles in order to comply with the proposed recall provisions. The degree that vehicle design
changes are necessary to better ensure improved in-use emission performance under this program will depend on the
technologies and cost tradeoffs manufacturers will make in response to CARB's existing LEV and OBD programs and the
enhanced I/M program. If a manufacturer has sufficient confidence that its vehicles will comply with the enhanced
in-use standards, there will obviously be no technological or cost implications. 
However, if a manufacturer lacks such confidence, then vehicle designs could be improved. In general, the durability
of every aspect of a vehicles' current and future emission control system can always be improved. The primary issues
are cost and the level of reliability. EPA expects each manufacturer to review the durability of each of its emission
control system components and assess whether it is adequate given the additional financial disincentives of the
emissions in-use compliance program which would occur should it fail. The decision would then be made to further improve
design durability or accept the current durability as adequate. 
If a manufacturer decided that it needed to increase the probability that its vehicles would comply with the enhanced
in-use standards under typical conditions of maintenance and use, EPA believes that numerous methods exist with
which this can be done. For example, vehicular emission control can be divided into two basic components, efficient
combustion and catalytic conversion. Efficient combustion relies primarily on fuel management and sufficient
ignition spark, including its timing. Efficient catalytic conversion depends most heavily on fuel management and
sufficient active catalytic material. Fuel management in turn depends heavily on the onboard computer and the feedback
control mechanism (i.e., the oxygen sensor) and the fuel injector. 
EPA believes that CARB's existing fuel detergent program will help address manufacturers' concerns related to fuel
injector, intake valve and combustion chamber deposits and the possible associated degradation of emission control
performance. EPA also believes that fuel injection technology has reached a sufficient stage of development such
that maintenance free operation is possible (i.e., EPA is not aware of any required maintenance for fuel injectors
on LDVs, LDTs, or MDVs). Catastrophic failure of an individual injector can always occur, but this should be immediately
identified by the OBD system. Likewise, recent electronic ignition systems are also maintenance free, with the exception
of the spark plugs and possibly the ignition wires. If improvements were desired in these areas, gold and platinum
tipped spark plugs could be considered. These plugs are already in limited use and offer the advantage of improved
durability. Manufacturers have already utilized, to a varying degree, high voltage ignition to lessen the importance
of wire separation, as the higher ignition voltage will cross a sizable gap in the wire as well as across the spark plug
tip. Onboard computers have clearly generated a track record of proper operation over the life of the vehicle.

 emission control as well as efficient combustion also depends on the proper operation of exhaust gas recirculation
(EGR) valves. The primary in-use problem with EGR valves is plugging or sticking due to combustion products, particularly
unburned fuel which can solidify with prolonged heating. A manufacturer could decide to redesign its valves by smoothing
its channels, eliminating sharp bends, better lubricating valve axles, etc., as well as changing the valve location
to control temperature and deposit formation.

The two remaining emission controls, the oxygen sensor and 
catalysts (both under body and quick light-off) are widely 
recognized as key components in maintaining proper in-use 
emissions performance. A manufacturer could decide to improve 
the durability of the active surface of the oxygen sensor or 
change its placement in the exhaust to limit deposits and thermal 
degradation. Likewise, more durable catalyst washcoats exist 
relative to those commonly used and the overall loading of 
catalytic material can also be increased. 
 
Regarding evaporative emissions, its more basic operation 
should make a manufacturer's durability assessment much easier. 
The key components besides the onboard computer are the purge 
valve, the vapor lines and the charcoal canister. The design of 
a durable purge valve should be much easier to assess and improve 
if necessary, relative to an EGR valve, given the clean nature of 
the vapor flowing through the valve. Non-metal vapor lines can 
be replaced with metal lines if necessary to provide increased 
confidence of leak-free operation. With adequate purge, charcoal 
canister should not fall below their in-use design capacity with 
time or usage. 
 
While uncertainty exists as to exactly how manufacturers 
will choose to comply with this program, the main issue appears 
to be one of further improvements in durability versus cost 
tradeoffs. The program appears to be technologically feasible. 
As for the costs, estimates of which are contained in the draft 
RIA supporting this FIP, EPA believes them to be reasonable. 



j. Alternatives.

  The objective of the proposed enhanced in-use compliance 
recall program is to identify and correct systemic design defects 
or lack of durability within an engine family. However, as 
discussed in section A.(f)., the proposed enhanced in-use 
standards could be exceeded if just a few percent of the vehicles 
within an engine family had high emissions, even though the rest 
emitted at well below the standard. In this situation, recalling 
the entire engine family to correct random defects which result 
in a few high emitters is inefficient, inconvenient and costly. 
Hopefully, the enhanced I/M program will identify and correct 
these high emitters. However, in some situations such as a 
defect in the cold start emission control system, the I/M program 
will not identify the problem. On-board diagnostics could 
identify the problem, but it does not guarantee that the owner 
will seek repair of the defect in a timely manner. This may be 
especially a concern for older vehicles where the relative cost 
of repairs compared to the value of the car is high. 
 
An alternative to the proposed enhanced in-use recall 
program involves the use of remote sensing to quickly identify 
individual vehicles with excess emissions. Remote sensing of 
emissions is now required by federal law in all non-attainment 
areas subject to enhanced I/M, including the three FIP areas. A 
potentially more effective approach could utilize recent advances 
in electronics which allow communication between the vehicle's 
on-board diagnostic system and a roadside transmitter. This type 
of communication with moving vehicles has been developed to 
substitute for toll booths on highways and bridges, and for 
collecting use-fees for heavy trucks. CARB will soon be 
demonstrating the application of this technology to on-board 
diagnostics. Under this concept, when prompted, a small 
transmitter on the vehicle would communicate the VIN and if the 
on-board computer has sensed any emission control system defects. 
The owners of vehicles with defects would be notified by mail to 
repair the vehicle and report to a smog inspection station for 
verification. This is the same remedy that will soon be required 
of owners whose vehicles fail a remote or roadside emission test 
in an area with enhanced I/M. 
 
The advantages of such a system include assuring that 
vehicles with high emissions are repaired quickly, rather than up 
to two years later at the next 
I/M test. This would help lower 
average in-use emissions closer to the certification standard. 
In addition, this approach would remain effective throughout the 
vehicle's life, an important advantage over the proposed enhanced 
in-use compliance program, since over 40 percent of California's 
light-duty on-road vehicles have exceeded their 100,000 mile 
useful life. 
 
Like the I/M 240 test, the objective of CARB's OBD program is 
to identify nearly all problems causing excess emissions. Thus, 
this same remote detection system could also lower the cost of 
periodic inspections since the inspection could be performed by 
driving by an unmanned sensor at any time. The cost of such an 
inspection would be minimal, and could quickly offset the cost of 
equipping new vehicles with an on-board transmitter. 
 
The major disadvantage of this approach is that the remote 
sensing technology has not been fully demonstrated. Thus, EPA 
cannot yet propose the details of a regulation which would 
implement such a requirement as part of the FIP. However, EPA is 
seeking comments on whether this approach has sufficient merit to 
be considered as an alternative or complement to the proposed 
enhanced in-use compliance program.

4. I/M-Based Recall Program 
 


The I/M aspect of the enhanced in-use compliance program 
(also referred to as the I/M-based recall program) proposed today 
applies only if a significant portion of vehicles do not meet the 
enhanced in-use I/M standards. The enhanced I/M test equipment, 
test procedures, and other physical elements of the program will 
remain unchanged from that described in Section III.D.2.c. of 
this preamble or from any equivalent program adopted by 
California. All 1999 and later model year California LDVs, LDTs 
and MDVs covered by the enhanced in-use standards described in 
Section A.(2) above will be included in this program, regardless 
of fuel type. (See section III.D.2.c. of this preamble for a 
description of I/M for non-California vehicles.) 
 
Overall, the enhanced in-use I/M program does three things. 
First, it implements a more stringent set of I/M emission levels 
(hereafter referred to as the enhanced in-use I/M standards). 
Second, it creates a maximum fraction of any particular exhaust 
emission engine family which can fail the more stringent enhanced 
in-use I/M standards without consequence for the manufacturer 
(hereafter referred to as the liability threshold). Third, once 
the failure rate of the enhanced in-use I/M standards exceeds the 
liability threshold, it initiates a selective recall and makes 
the vehicle manufacturer liable for the repairs resulting from 
subsequent I/M failures. As described above, the purpose of this 
program is to encourage manufacturers to place a high design 
priority on in-use vehicle performance and ease of repair in 
order to ensure that vehicles comply with their certification 
standards in-use. 
 
The sequence of events at a typical enhanced I/M test 
facility will be as follows. Vehicles brought for testing will 
be measured against two sets of standards: the conventional 
enhanced 
I/M standards described in Section III.D.2.c. of this 
preamble and the lower enhanced in-use I/M standards described 
below. Unless a significant portion of vehicles in any engine 
family have failed the enhanced in-use I/M standards, vehicle 
owners will only be required to repair their vehicles if they 
fail the conventional enhanced I/M standards. However, the 
number of vehicles failing the more stringent enhanced in-use I/M 
standards will be tallied. If the percentage of a specific 
engine family failing the enhanced in-use I/M standards exceeds 
the liability thresholds described below, two events occur. 
First, future vehicles of this particular engine family failing 
the more stringent enhanced in-use I/M standards now must be 
repaired and retested. Second, the manufacturer, and not the 
vehicle owner, will be responsible for the repairs for vehicles 
still within their statutory useful life which have not obviously 
been abused or tampered with in a manner likely to affect 
emissions (i.e., an I/M-based selective recall). As described 
below, the enhanced in-use 
I/M standards are numerically higher 
than the enhanced in-use FTP emission levels. Thus, as long as 
vehicles are performing close to the standards to which they are 
certified, only the conventional enhanced I/M program will apply 
and there will be no post-manufacturing consequence for the 
manufacturer of the enhanced in-use 
I/M program. 
 
The sections below describe the nature of the proposed 
enhanced in-use I/M program including testing, enhanced in-use 
I/M standards, threshold for manufacturer liability, tracking of 
enhanced in-use I/M test results, repair responsibility, 
geographic coverage, and other administrative aspects of the 
program. 



a. Testing.

  As discussed in more detail in Section III.D.2.c. of this 
preamble, three types of I/M tests will be performed on light- 
and medium-duty vehicles. First, exhaust emissions will be 
measured using the I/M 240 test. Second, purge and pressure 
tests will be performed to establish the evaporative system's 
functionality and integrity. Finally, a visual inspection will 
be performed to check for missing canisters, catalysts, etc. 
which would indicate that obvious tampering or abuse has 
occurred. Vehicles with obvious tampering or abuse which fail 
the enhanced I/M 240, pressure, or purge tests will require 
repair at the owner's expense. 

EPA proposes to include post-1998 model year diesel- and 
alternative-fueled (CNG and LPG) vehicles in enhanced I/M 
testing, as well as gasoline vehicles. Evaporative system checks 
would be revised where appropriate for alternative-fueled 
vehicles, since some fuel types (e.g., diesel fuel and 
pressurized fuels) produce little or no evaporative emissions as 
long as their fuel tanks are not ruptured. Diesel-fueled 
vehicles are currently exempt from most I/M programs, because 
their HC emissions are inherently low and their historical 
control of NO

X

 emissions has not depended on technologies that 
deteriorate significantly over time. Alternative-fueled vehicles 
have been exempted because of their low numbers. However, as the 
emission standards applicable to post-1998 model year vehicles 
will be very stringent regardless of fuel type, EPA is proposing 
that every vehicle be tested under the enhanced I/M program, 
regardless of fuel type. EPA requests comment on the testing of 
diesel- and alternative-fueled vehicles in the proposed enhanced 
in-use I/M program.

b. Proposed enhanced in-use I/M standards.

 The table below (``Proposed Enhanced In-Use I/M Standards for 
LDVs and LDTs'') summarizes the enhanced in-use I/M standards 
proposed in this NPRM for 1999 and later model year LDVs and 
LDTs. Passage or failure of these standards will be used to 
determine compliance with the liability thresholds. These 
standards will also be used to determine the need for repairs and 
retesting after the liability threshold has been exceeded. 




As mentioned above, under enhanced I/M, exhaust emissions 
will be measured over the I/M 240 test procedure, a shortened 
version of the certification test procedure. Emissions measured 
over the I/M 240 test procedure and the certification test 
procedure are somewhat different for a number of reasons. First, 
different vehicles with the same overall FTP emissions will 
perform differently over each segment of the FTP. Because only 
part of the certification driving cycle is used in the I/M 240 
test, individual vehicles with the same FTP emissions may produce 
somewhat different I/M 240 emissions. Also, and most importantly 
for NMHC emissions, the absence of a cold start in the I/M test 
will tend to reduce variability and result in a lower g/mi value 
for the I/M test. Other factors contribute to greater 
variability between the full FTP      and I/M 240 testing. These 
factors include the type of driving a vehicle encountered 
immediately previous to the test, the specific fuel in its tank, 
and numerous other environmental factors which can be controlled 
in certification and recall testing, but which cannot be 
controlled in I/M testing, such as temperature and humidity. 
Therefore, an important objective of the enhanced in-use I/M 
standards is to provide an incentive for manufacturers to design 
vehicles which do not have significant emissions increases when 
operated under such typical in-use conditions as compared to the 
highly standardized FTP. If vehicles continue to be produced 
with a high degree of emissions sensitivity, their increased 
emissions under typical use (versus the FTP) would substantially 
add to the emissions burden caused by light- and medium-duty 
vehicles. 
Considering the factors just described and non-vehicle 
related test variability, the enhanced in-use I/M standards in 
the table above (``Proposed Enhanced In-Use I/M Standards for LDVs 
and LDTs'') are being proposed. EPA believes these levels 
represent a reasonable balance between granting a cushion between 
certification and I/M emissions levels, and in establishing 
manufacturer liability and the need to provide a greater 
incentive for the design of emission controls systems which 
maintain low emissions under variations in typical in-use 
conditions. (For example, the proposed enhanced in-use THC I/M 
standard is 0.20 g/mi, 2.2 times higher than CARB's 100,000 mile 
certification NMHC standard for LDV LEVs of 0.9 g/mi.) 
Due to the fact that the I/M 240 test only measures warmed-up 
exhaust emissions, compliance with these standards should not be 
any more technologically challenging or costly than compliance 
with the recall standards already discussed in Section A.(3) 
above. The only issue could be a vehicle's emissions variability 
over the IM240 test relative to the full FTP, as mentioned above. 
There is no inherent technical reason for exhibiting this 
variabiity, except a lack of concern that vehicles' emission 
controls operate fully over all types of normal driving and not 
only over the exact driving sequence embodied in the FTP. In 
fact, many if not most vehicles already exhibit similar control 
over both tests. 
The enhanced in-use I/M standards for LDTs were derived 
using the same factors and methodology described above for LDVs. 
As with LDVs, EPA is also proposing a single THC I/M standard for 
each subclass of LDTs that will apply throughout the useful life 
of a LDT. EPA believes that the technology and emissions 
performance of LDTs will be similar to that of LDVs and therefore 
the same factors can be used for establishing the enhanced in-use 
I/M standards for LDTs. EPA requests comments on the 
reasonableness of this assumption. 
Similar factors were used to derive the transitional 
enhanced in-use I/M standards. As described in Section A.(2) 
above, these standards will apply to up to 25 percent of each 
manufacturer's sales of 1999 model year vehicles. EPA requests 
comments on these levels, as well. 
The table below (``Proposed Enhanced In-Use I/M Standards for 
MDVs'') contains the proposed enhanced in-use I/M standards for 
MDVs. These standards will apply to all California MDVs 
certified to chassis-based standards. (Those MDV engines 
certified to the engine-based standards are not subject to the 
enhanced in-use I/M provisions, as described in Section B. 
below.) The enhanced in-use I/M standards for MDVs provide 
essentially the same cushion between themselves and the enhanced 
in-use standards for MDVs as described above for the enhanced in-
use I/M standards for LDVs and LDTs.

Similar to the light-duty enhanced in-use I/M standards, the 
enhanced in-use compliance I/M standards for MDVs should be more 
easily met relative to the enhanced in-use MDV FTP emission 
standards for composite NMHC and NO

X

 described in Section A.(3) 
above. As was the case for light-duty vehicles, the lack of a 
cold start in the IM240 test, generally higher numerical standard 
levels and the fact that evaporative emissions are not 
quantitatively included together should more than compensate for 
any variability resulting from the use of the shorter IM240 
cycle. This is particularly true given manufacturers will have 
the ability to design their vehicles for good emissions 
performance over the IM240 cycle as well as over the full FTP. 
EPA requests comments on the level of the proposed enhanced in-
use I/M standards for LDVs, LDTs and MDVs, as well as the 
proposed transitional enhanced in-use I/M standards. EPA also 
requests comments on the use of a single enhanced in-use I/M NMHC 
standard and on the option of applying a more stringent standard 
for the first five years or 50,000 miles. 


c. Threshold for manufacturers responsibility.

 Under enhanced I/M programs for conventional vehicles, 
owners are responsible for repairs of those vehicles which fail 
the enhanced I/M tests. EPA is proposing that manufacturers 
would become liable for repairs of a specific vehicle engine 
family (i.e., an I/M-based selective recall) if 5.0 percent of 
the tested vehicles of that engine family failed the enhanced in-
use I/M standards during the first half of the family's useful 
life or if 10.0 percent failed before the end of the family's 
full useful life. That is, if more than 5.0 percent of tested 
vehicles of any engine family/model year combination fail the 
enhanced in-use I/M standards before 50,001 miles or fifth year 
after the production year (whichever comes first), then the 
responsibility for repair of any future failures of vehicles 
belonging to that engine family/model year combination will shift 
to the manufacturer. This percentage rises to 10.0 percent for 
vehicles up to 100,000 miles or in their sixth through the tenth 
years of use. 
In staying below these thresholds, the manufacturer must 
consider the typical level of maintenance provided its vehicles 
in enhanced I/M areas. It is extremely difficult to identify the 
lowest level of maintenance short of abuse. It is also 
impossible to build vehicles such that none of the vehicles 
develop problems in-use. However, participation in the enhanced 
I/M programs will encourage individual vehicle owners to perform 
increased maintenance to reduce the likelihood of I/M failure and 
the subsequent burden of repair and re-test. Thus, a lower 
failure rate may be reasonable to expect from vehicles in 
enhanced I/M areas. EPA believes that the 5 and 10 percent 
failure rates proposed above balance the responsibilities of the 
manufacturer to build a vehicle which performs well under typical 
in-use conditions and those of the vehicle owner to properly care 
for the vehicle. EPA requests comment on the appropriateness of 
the two liability thresholds presented here. EPA also asks for 
comments on alternative liability thresholds, as well as 
appropriate justification for those alternatives. 
EPA proposes that the liability threshold for the enhanced 
in-use compliance I/M program apply separately to each affected 
exhaust emission family in each model year after 1998. Since 
several exhaust families can fall into a single evaporative 
family, but generally not vice versa, EPA believes that isolating 
I/M repair liability within an exhaust family is the most 
appropriate approach. In addition, EPA is proposing that the 
liability thresholds apply separately for HC and NO

X

 emissions. 
Thus, if the number of HC emission failures exceeded a threshold, 
but the number of NO

X

 emission failures did not, manufacturers 
would only be responsible for repairing those vehicles which 
failed the enhanced in-use I/M HC standards. A difficult 
question arises when one of the two pollutant thresholds have 
been exceeded and a vehicle fails both of the enhanced in-use I/M 
standards. EPA desires to limit manufacturer liability as much 
as possible to the repair of the problems related to that 
pollutant exceeding its threshold. However, it may not be 
practical to separate what repairs affect each pollutant and 
determining such a split could lead to frequent disagreement 
between manufacturer and owner. Thus, EPA proposes that 
manufacturers be responsible for performing all repairs to those 
vehicles which failed both the enhanced in-use I/M HC and NO

X

 
standards, but have exceeded only one (i.e, HC or NO

X

) threshold. 
However, EPA requests comments on requiring manufacturers to only 
be liable for repairing the vehicle in order to meet the I/M 
standard for the pollutant exceeding its threshold.

d. Tracking of vehicle failures.


 Compliance with the liability thresholds will be determined on a model year/engine family basis (i.e., I/M test results
will be segregated by engine family and model year). EPA proposes to segregate tracking by model year to prevent the

I/M test results of more recent model year vehicles within a given engine family from diluting the test results of earlier
model year vehicles. 
EPA requests comments on this approach. 
While EPA will receive actual I/M 240 emission results from 
the performers of enhanced I/M testing, only pass or fail results 
will be tallied against the 5 and 10 percent thresholds. A 
vehicle will enter the tracking system when it receives its first 
enhanced I/M test. As long as it passes that and any subsequent 
enhanced I/M test, it will be considered a ``pass'' vehicle. Once 
it fails any of the three HC related tests (i.e., the enhanced 
in-use I/M standard for exhaust HC or the pressure or purge 
tests), it will be considered an HC failure. Once it fails the 
enhanced in-use I/M NO

X

 standard, it will be considered a NO

X

 
failure. If a failure occurred while the vehicle is within its 
first half life (e.g., for a LDV, 5.0 years old and 50,001 miles 
or less), the failure will be included in the failure tally 
against both the 5 percent half-life and the 10 percent full-life 
thresholds. If the failure occurred while the vehicle is within 
its second half life (e.g., for a LDV, more than 5.0 years old 
and 50,000 miles but no more than 10.0 years old and 100,000 
miles), the failure will only be included in the failure tally 
against the 10 percent full-life threshold. The failure rate for 
each model year/engine family combination will consist of the 
number of vehicles failing the enhanced in-use I/M HC or NO

X

 
standards divided by the number of vehicles which have been 
tested in an enhanced I/M program. The I/M test results would 
cease to be counted after individual vehicles exceeded an age of 
10 years or 100,000 miles (120,000 miles for MDVs), respectively. 
For example, if 2.0 percent of an engine family's vehicles 
(from a single model year) fail the enhanced in-use 
I/M standards 
for a given pollutant over its first two years (i.e., a biennial 
program) and an additional 2.0 percent (i.e., different vehicles) 
fail over the next two years, the failure rate after 4 years is 
4.0 percent. Comments are requested on the use of only pass/fail 
information and the calculation procedure. 
Once a specific model year/engine family combination 
exceeded a liability threshold, EPA proposes that the 
manufacturer become liable for the selective recall and repair of 
vehicles not only from that model year, but for the repair of all 
vehicles which are part of that engine family. While this could 
significantly increase the potential liability faced by 
manufacturers, it will more equitably protect the consumer by 
treating all vehicles with essentially the same emission control 
design (and thus, performance) the same. EPA requests comments 
on this approach, as well as the option whereby manufacturers 
were only held liable for the repairs of vehicles from the 
specific model year which caused the exceedance of the enhanced 
in-use I/M liability threshold. 
If exceedance of the liability threshold appears likely, 
typical failure modes could be determined and efficient repair 
methods developed. A manufacturer could even go so far as to 
take preventative action (e.g., a voluntary recall) to reduce the 
number of I/M failures (and the triggering of the liability 
threshold) and avoid the negative publicity or market response 
that may otherwise result. 
EPA also proposes to exclude the I/M test results of 
vehicles if they have been obviously abused or tampered. (More 
discussion on what might constitute obvious abuse or tampering is 
included in Section A.(3) above addressing enhanced in-use 
compliance recall requirements.) EPA proposes to limit the 
definition of such abuse or tampering for the purpose of the 
enhanced in-use I/M program to a missing catalyst or evaporative 
canister. Tampering can be discouraged by the vehicle's design 
and performance. While EPA is aware that manufacturers cannot 
prevent all forms of less obvious tampering problems, the Agency 
wants to create incentives for manufacturers to design vehicles 
as tamper-resistant as is reasonable. EPA requests comments on 
the appropriate inclusion of specific determinations of obvious 
abuse and tampering which would be practical by I/M test 
personnel in an enhanced I/M test, while maintaining the 
integrity and purpose of the enhanced in-use I/M program. 


e. Repair responsibility.

  Under conventional enhanced I/M, individual vehicle owners are responsible for repairs based on failures of either
the enhanced I/M 240 cutpoints and the pressure/purge functional 
tests. Motorists are required to spend a maximum of $450 on 
repairs within a biennial test cycle related to the emission test 
failure before being eligible for a waiver of the requirement to 
comply.

<TEXT>
 



If the enhanced in-use I/M liability threshold is reached, 
EPA proposes that manufacturers become subject to a selective 
recall and be responsible for all subsequent vehicle repairs that 
are identified by the enhanced I/M emission test at the enhanced 
in-use I/M standards (described previously) and the 
purge/pressure tests. Manufacturers would thereafter be 
responsible for all vehicle repairs within that engine family 
model year until the end of the vehicle's useful life. A 
manufacturer's repair responsibility would begin after the 
liability threshold is reached, with no retroactive liability. 
EPA is not proposing reimbursement from the manufacturer to 
individual vehicle owners for repairs that occurred prior to 
exceeding the enhanced in-use I/M liability threshold. 
EPA is also concerned that some repairs to high mileage 
vehicles could cost more than the vehicle is worth. EPA is 
therefore proposing to allow a manufacturer to remedy an 
emissions failure by purchasing (or offering to purchase) the 
vehicle. The manufacturer could then remove the vehicle from 
service instead of making the necessary repairs. The actual 
value could be determined through a National Automobile Dealer's 
Association (NADA) publication (e.g., ``Blue Book value'') or via 
negotiation. The latter is always available, but, as the only 
option, could become quite involved and result in vastly 
different prices being paid for similar vehicles. EPA therefore 
proposes that the manufacturer be allowed to offer the average 
retail value for the vehicle in question as specified in the NADA 
``Official Used Car Guide,'' if the manufacturers elects this 
option. One option would utilize the national ``Blue Book'' to 
avoid the possible effects of this program on ``Blue Book'' levels 
in California. Another option would be to use the ``Blue Book'' 
applicable in the specific FIP area. EPA is also concerned that 
the ``Blue Book'' value may not fully compensate an owner for the 
time and energy needed to find a new vehicle and other intangibles. 
EPA requests comment on other methods of determining values that 
proximate the market value of the vehicle, as well as the value 
to its owner, but provide reasonable protection for the 
manufacturer. 
Under this proposal, the vehicle owner has the option of 
rejecting the manufacturer's offer to purchase their vehicle. 
Instead, the owner could repair the vehicle at his or her own 
expense or sell the vehicle in an area not subject to enhanced 
I/M and the enhanced in-use compliance program. The 
manufacturer's liability to repair the vehicle would end after 
the offer to purchase the vehicle was either consummated or 
rejected in writing. 
EPA is also concerned whether the manufacturer would 
exercise its responsibility to repair the vehicle in a way which 
minimized inconvenience to the owner. EPA therefore proposes 
that all required repairs be performed in an expeditious manner 
and requests comments on specific requirements that could be used 
to ensure this was in fact done. Specifically, EPA proposes, and 
requests comments on, requiring manufacturers to provide a rental 
vehicle of equivalent value and function free of charge if the 
repairs required more than two days in total. 


f. Geographic coverage

. 
EPA is proposing that enhanced I/M be used in the designated 
California FIP areas of Sacramento, Los Angeles, and Ventura. 
EPA is proposing to limit the geographic scope of the I/M-based 
recall program to the FIP areas. EPA does not believe it would 
be appropriate to apply the I/M-based recall program to areas not 
having full enhanced I/M based on the I/M 240 test. 
However, vehicles from outside the three FIP areas do impact 
air quality in the three FIP areas. Therefore, EPA requests 
comment on the option of including the vehicles tested in 
qualifying enhanced I/M 240 test programs in other nonattainment 
areas in California in the I/M-based recall program. The test 
results from such vehicles would then also be used to determine 
compliance with the liability threshold. Under this option, only 
a state enhanced I/M program which either duplicates the federal 
program or is approved by the Administrator as equivalent would 
be allowed to participate. 


g. Data collection from test-sites.


 The Agency proposes that enhanced I/M testing facilities 
submit the results of all I/M tests, as well as engine family 
data from the underhood label, on all vehicles tested, to EPA on 
a monthly basis. This information will be used to calculate 
failure rates. In addition, personnel at such facilities would 
be required to retain and maintain results from I/M tests for a 
period of one year. 


h. Manufacturer notification of liability.


 The Agency will provide manufacturers with cumulative test 
results on their engine families on a monthly basis. 
Additionally EPA will notify vehicle manufacturers, by letter, 
within thirty days after the rate of failure meets or exceeds the 
liability threshold. Manufacturers' responsibility for repairs 
begins 30 days after EPA sends notification. 
I/M personnel will notify owners of failing vehicles, when 
vehicles are brought in for emissions testing, with whom 
responsibility for repair lies. Vehicle owners must be informed 
when repair responsibility for vehicles has been shifted to the 
manufacturers. EPA requests comment on requiring manufacturers 
to inform all vehicle owners, by letter, if the failure rate for 
the enhanced in-use I/M standards has exceeded the liability 
threshold. Such a letter would state that vehicle owner repair 
responsibility has ended and that the manufacturer is thereafter 
responsible for vehicle emission repairs until the statutory 
useful life ends as long as the vehicle is participating in a 
qualifying enhanced I/M program and has not been abused or 
tampered. One negative aspect of such a requirement is that it 
may lead vehicle owners to care less carefully for their 
vehicles, given the knowledge that much maintenance would now be 
covered by the manufacturer. 


5. Fleets

As indicated by the Clean Air Act's fleet program, Congress believed it appropriate to place more stringent controls
on centrally fueled fleet vehicles due fleet operators' greater control over and flexibility in the fuel used by their
vehicles. Likewise, EPA believes it appropriate to propose similar actions here to obtain necessary additional
emission reductions.

Consequently, in addition to meeting the requirements of the enhanced in-use compliance program described above,
EPA proposes an enhanced ILEV fleet program. This program would require that a fraction of the post-1998 model year
vehicles purchased by fleets in the South Coast area having 10 of more vehicles which currently are, or are capable
of, being centrally fueled must also qualify as ILEVs. EPA established a special class of clean fuel vehicles called
Inherently Low Emission Vehicles (ILEVs) in regulations concerning exemptions from transportation control measures
for clean fuel fleet vehicles (40 CFR 88.311-93). ILEVs are required to have no significant evaporative emissions
even if their evaporative control systems malfunction. ILEVs therefore have an inherent emissions advantage over
other clean fuel vehicles since under any realistic enforcement program, some vehicles will be operating with dysfunctional
emission controls. Generally, ILEVs are alternative fueled vehicles since gasoline is a very volatile liquid; however,
high-technology diesel or low volatility gasoline vehicles might also be able to comply. Enhanced ILEVs would produce
all the emission benefits of other enhanced in-use compliance vehicles plus the benefits of no significant evaporative
emissions in-use.

EPA proposes that 50 percent of all LDVs, LDTs, and MDVs purchased in 1999 by covered fleet operators for their covered
fleet meet this requirement and 70 percent of LDVs, LDTs, and MDVs purchased in each calendar year thereafter.

EPA proposes to exempt from the enhanced ILEV fleet program the same types of vehicles which are exempt from the statutory
Clean Fuel Fleet program (section 241(5) of the Clean Air Act). The definitions promulgated by EPA for the Clean Fuel
Fleet program in 40 CFR 88.302-94 (i.e., for ``covered fleet operator'', ``centrally fueled'', and ``capable
of being centrally fueled'', as well as several others) are proposed to apply to the enhanced ILEV fleet program. In
addition, EPA proposes that the procedures laid out in the preamble for that final rule for determining how many vehicles
are to be considered capable of being centrally fueled (58 FR 64684) are to be applied by fleet operators in the enhanced
ILEV fleet program. EPA requests comment on whether this procedure should be converted to regulatory text and published
in the final rule on this FIP.

In addition, EPA is proposing an enhanced ILEV purchase credit program similar to the Clean Fuel Fleet credit program
(40 CFR 88.304-94). Each ILEV purchased early or in excess of a covered fleet operator's purchase requirement
could generate one purchase credit. EPA would issue a qualifying covered fleet operator a credit document which could
be held or sold. The original operator or any other covered fleet operator could redeem such credit documents in lieu
of enhanced ILEV purchases.

EPA proposes that violations of the enhanced ILEV fleet program be subject to civil penalties of not more than $25,000.
This proposed penalty is identical to that applied by the Clean Air Act (section 205(a)) to violations of the Clean
Fuel Fleet program required by Part C of Title II.

Since the enhanced in-use vehicle standards apply to composite NMHC, it is possible that enhanced ILEVs could have
higher exhaust NMHC emissions to compensate for their inherently low evaporative emissions. Therefore, EPA requests
comments on the likelihood of this occurring and on the option of establishing a numerically lower composite NMHC
standard for ILEVs. These more stringent enhanced in-use standards for ILEVs are shown in the table below. EPA is not
proposing to change the enhanced in-use NO

X

 standards for ILEVs from those proposed for all enhanced in-use compliance vehicles in Section A.(2) above.

EPA is proposing that the enhanced ILEV fleet program be applicable to only vehicles purchased by covered fleet operators
in the South Coast due to the fact that even with all the additional emission controls being proposed today, the South
Coast is still not projected to in compliance with the ozone NAAQS by 2010. EPA requests comment on extending the enhanced
ILEV fleet program to the other two FIP areas. EPA also requests comment on whether the program should be revised to
ensure that vehicle turnover does not become artificially low in response to the enhanced ILEV fleet program but rather
remains at or near current levels.



B. Enhanced In-Use Compliance Program for Heavy-duty Vehicles



1. Applicability



EPA is proposing that the enhanced heavy-duty vehicle program be applied to all new engines used in on-highway vehicles
over 14,000 pounds GVWR, beginning in model year 1999. All such heavy-duty vehicles offered for sale or registered
exclusively in California will need to comply with the enhanced vehicle standards described in the sections which
follow. (As described in the section on 49-state vehicles, importation of heavy-duty vehicles not complying with
the requirement of this program is prohibited after 1999.) Requirements that apply to multi-state registered vehicles
are discussed later, in section B(7). The enhanced vehicle program would, as an option, allow manufacturers to certify
engines for use in MDVs of GVWR between 8,500 and 14,000 pounds to engine-based standards, similar to the approach
taken in California's program. However, such vehicles would need to meet all of the requirements of the enhanced heavy-duty
vehicle program described in the sections below.

The application of the enhanced heavy-duty vehicle program on a statewide basis is considered necessary because
of the large volume of heavy-duty vehicle traffic flow into and out of the areas covered by the FIP. Any program requiring
usage of enhanced vehicles only in the FIP areas would be extremely difficult to implement and enforce. Also, EPA is
concerned about the emissions from HDVs from other states operating in the FIP areas, and about the potential for an
increase in this interstate traffic due to higher costs associated with enhanced HDVs. This issue is addressed in
section B(6).

As with light-duty vehicles, EPA is interested in the possibility of achieving earlier inventory reductions by phasing
in new vehicle emission standards sooner. The inventory reduction achieved by earlier implementation could reduce
the rate at which heavy-duty vehicle turnover would have to occur. Therefore, in addition to requesting comment on
the program proposed below, EPA requests comment on an earlier phase-in, requiring a portion of the 1998 model year
heavy-duty vehicles sold to meet the enhanced vehicle requirements.



2. Authority



As explained above, in promulgating a FIP under section 110(c) of the Act, EPA may take any actions that the state could
take and EPA believes that it, acting on behalf of California in the context of a FIP, may adopt a motor vehicle program
or supplement California's own motor vehicle program provided that EPA's actions would satisfy the criteria of section
209(b) for a waiver of federal preemption. These criteria are discussed above in the context of the enhanced light-duty
vehicle program. 

</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940505-1-00222 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



EPA believes that the enhanced heavy-duty vehicle program 
that would be applicable to vehicles and engines in California 
under the proposed FIP would satisfy the section 209 waiver 
criteria. Thus, California could undertake the enhanced vehicle 
program described below, and, therefore, EPA has authority under 
section 110(c) to undertake the proposed programs. 

With respect to the protectiveness of the standards, all of 
the proposed standards are at least as protective as the 
otherwise applicable federal standards (e.g., the generally 
applicable NO

X

 and NMHC standards in the case of the vehicles and 
engines covered by the enhanced heavy-duty vehicle program). 
Indeed, these standards are at least as stringent as the 
comparable standards that California has already adopted and for 
which waivers have already been granted. 

With respect to the need to meet compelling and 
extraordinary conditions, EPA has repeatedly found that 
California's air quality problems satisfy the need criterion of 
section 209(b) (see, e.g., 49 FR 18887 and 18890 (May 3, 1984), 
58 FR 4144 (January 13, 1993)). Moreover, the magnitude of the 
reductions in emissions needed to reach attainment in the FIP 
areas, including mobile source emissions (discussed in Preamble 
section III.H), provides ample evidence of the need for more 
stringent motor vehicle emission standards in California. 

Finally, with respect to the criterion of consistency with 
section 202(a), EPA believes that its proposed enhanced vehicle 
program is consistent with both the technological feasibility and 
certification elements of that criterion. For the reasons 
explained below, EPA believes that the various elements of the 
enhanced vehicle program are technologically feasible within the 
leadtime provided, taking into account the cost of compliance. 
Moreover, no aspect of the enhanced vehicle program establishes 
any new certification test procedures that are inconsistent with 
either existing federal or California test procedure 
requirements. Consequently, EPA believes that its proposed 
enhanced vehicle programs satisfy this prong of section 209 as 
well. 

EPA also notes that its proposed rebuild requirements for 
heavy-duty vehicles and its use restrictions on heavy-duty 
vehicles need not satisfy the section 209(b) criteria since those 
requirements, being in-use regulation of vehicles directed at 
vehicle owners, and not the original manufacturers, are not 
preempted by section 209(a). Thus, EPA has the authority to 
promulgate those requirements just as any other requirements not 
subject to preemption under section 209. 



3. Emissions Standards 





a. Oxides of Nitrogen Standard. 

As mentioned earlier, heavy-duty engines are a major source 
of NO

X

 emissions in the FIP areas. Because of this, EPA proposes 
to establish lower exhaust emission standards for heavy-duty 
engines in California vehicles beginning with the 1999 model 
year. The emission standard for NO

X

 is proposed to be 
1.5 g/bhp-hr for all heavy-duty engines used in vehicles of GVWR 
above 8,500 pounds, except those optionally certified to chassis-
based standards as discussed in previous sections. 

The Agency is proposing this standard because this level of 
control is necessary in order to meet the FIP air quality goals 
and because this level represents a comparable reduction relative 
to other vehicle classes. As discussed further below, EPA 
recognizes that this standard presents a significant feasibility 
challenge for diesel engines. However, other fuel technologies 
such as natural gas and alcohol fuels have demonstrated the 
potential to achieve these stringent levels, as well as other 
engine designs. Given this, the Agency believes that the 
1.5 g/bhp-hr standard is appropriate. 

At the same time, EPA recognizes that implementing a 
1.5 g/bhp-hr standard may present limitations that may be 
unacceptable for some unique heavy-duty vehicle applications. 
Therefore, the Agency is considering an additional, economic 
incentive program that allows the sale of higher emitting 
engines. The Agency solicits comments on a plan that would allow 
engines to be sold at a relaxed level of 2.5 g/bhp-hr NO

X

, if a 
new vehicle emissions surcharge is paid. The program would begin 
with the 1999 model year and would apply to all engines subject 
to the 1.5 g/bhp-hr standard and their associated vehicles. The 
surcharge would be assessed also for an engine bought separately 
to be installed in an existing chassis.

<DOCNO> FR940505-1-00223 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



The proposed surcharge, shown in the table below (``New-
Vehicle Emission Surcharges for Heavy-Duty Vehicles'') for the different classes of heavy-duty vehicles and urban
buses, is based on a cost of $10,000 per ton of increased NO

X

 emissions at a 2.5 g/bhp-hr level compared to the 1.5 g/bhp-hr standard. In computing the surcharge, estimated lifetime
emissions were discounted to the year of sale using a seven percent discount rate. Urban buses, as defined under existing
EPA regulations, are treated separately for surcharge purposes because of their unique operating characteristics;
all other buses are considered heavy-duty vehicles in the table below. Details of the individual values can be found
in the docket.
 






As described in the sections addressing nonroad engines and the fleet averaging program, the surcharges being proposed
today are all based on a value of $10,000 per ton of emissions reduced. The Agency intends this level to represent an
appropriate level for valuing incremental NO

X

 control in California as well as to provide a strong incentive for manufacturers to develop, and customers to buy,
engines meeting the 1.5 g/bhp-hr standard rather than pay the emissions surcharge. At the same time, it will provide
an option for those few applications in which complying engines are unavailable. Comments are requested on the appropriateness
of the surcharge levels, as well as on the 2.5 g/bhp-hr standard proposed for engines subject to the surcharge. Interested
readers should review the docket for further information regarding the surcharge value (``Technical Support_Surcharge
Evaluation'' memo from Joann Jackson-Stephens to docket dated March 1994). 
The projected impact of these more stringent NO

X

 standards on engine technology is discussed below. The impacts are presented separately for each major fuel type.
The Agency recognizes that this discussion is based on information from technology development programs that are,
in some cases, in their very early stages. More complete information may exist and the Agency solicits a full range
of comments on this issue. Any information submitted confidentially will be treated appropriately, in accordance
with the Code of Federal Regulations requirements. 
Diesel-fueled engines. Manufacturers attempting to develop diesel-fueled engines that comply with the 1.5 g/bhp-hr
standard must consider a variety of areas. These include: (1) improvements in fuel injection systems, such as very
high pressure injection, electronic unit injectors with minimized sac volumes, improved fuel injection nozzles,
and significant advances in fuel injection rate shaping, (2) improvements in intake air management, focusing on
optimized intake air pressurization systems such as variable geometry turbochargers or wastegate turbochargers
and more extensive use of air-to-air intercooling, (3) continued progress in lubricating oil control (to minimize
any NO

X

/particulate trade-offs), (4) major advances in exhaust gas recirculation using variable flow and variable temperature
control mechanisms, and (5) more sophisticated, integrated electronic control of all engine systems. 
Advances in oxidation catalysts (e.g., additional progress in catalytic materials and washcoating processes)
may also be needed to control particulate emissions from diesel-fueled engines, while permitting further optimization
of NO

X

 emission variables. Also, fuels improvements such as higher cetane levels may need to be considered. 
While these changes will enable diesel-fueled engines to meet NO

X

 emission standards significantly lower than the current 5.0 g/bhp-hr standard, further advances may be necessary
to reach 1.5 g/bhp-hr. One technology that is being actively researched to meet this challenge is a catalyst designed
to reduce NO

X

 in the lean operating environment of the diesel engine. The current research into these devices has yielded NO

X

 reductions of about 10 to 20 percent, and researchers project that 50 percent NO

X

 reduction efficiencies under transient conditions may be possible. Research in Japan has shown 50 to 70 percent efficiencies
under steady state conditions with a 5 percent fuel penalty. The work done to date has been performed on engines that
have NO

X

 emissions higher than about 4.0 g/bhp-hr. It is not known if the efficiencies that have been reported will also apply
to engines in the 2.5 g/bhp-hr range. The Agency also has no clear information on the fuel consumption impact, cost
or durability of lean NO

X

 catalysts. This technology holds promise for significantly reducing NO

X

 from diesels. EPA requests comments on ongoing research activity related to NO

X

 control for diesels and the focus of such work.

EPA recognizes that numerous issues must be addressed before 
many of these technologies can be commercialized for diesel-fueled engines; such issues include durability, fuel
consumption 
impacts, cost and availability of improved fuels, if they are 
needed. The Agency solicits input on these issues as well as the 
overall feasibility of the 1.5 g/bhp-hr NO

X

 standard for diesels. 
The Agency has received information that certain on-highway 
heavy-duty diesel engines are using ``transient sensing 
algorithms'' that have the effect of retarding the timing during 
transient engine operating conditions and advancing the timing 
during certain steady state operating conditions.
 Since 
injection timing has a very significant impact on NO

X

 emission 
rates, with advanced timing settings being associated with higher 
NO

X

, the continued use of these algorithms could result in 
engines that appear to be very low NO

X

 emitters for certification 
purposes but would not be nearly so low when operated in-use. 
The Agency would consider such algorithms used to meet the 
1.5 g/bhp-hr standard to be defeat devices. They would not be an 
acceptable strategy. The Agency solicits comments on appropriate 
means of discouraging use of such design approaches. 





Gasoline-fueled engines. Heavy-duty gasoline-fueled engines currently control NO

X

 
emissions to levels between 3 and 3.5 g/bhp-hr (in response to a 
5.0 g/bhp-hr standard). The Agency sees no reason why these 
engines could not meet an exhaust emissions standard of 
1.5 g/bhp-hr with the application of three-way catalysts and 
other technologies that are currently in use with light-duty 
vehicles and light-duty trucks. Improvements may be needed in 
the area of high temperature three-way catalyst materials to 
withstand the broader range of exhaust temperatures that are 
typical of heavy-duty gasoline-fueled engines. Also, careful 
application and integration of exhaust gas recirculation, port 
fuel injection, more sophisticated ignition systems and increased 
emphasis on optimized air management may also be needed. 
Alternative-fueled engines.
 A methanol-fueled heavy-duty engine is currently certified 
at 1.7 g/bhp-hr NO

X

 and the Agency believes that with additional 
development this engine could achieve a NO

X

 emission level of 
1.5 g/bhp-hr. The engine is a two-stroke engine. It is likely 
that with better fuel injection systems (for example, higher 
pressure injection), better air management (such as improvements 
in the blower by-pass control system), and other such 
optimization advances, this engine could achieve 1.5 g/bhp-hr or 
lower. Four-stroke engines using methanol have not yet been 
developed to the same extent, but it is likely that these engines 
could also show very low emissions. Methanol-fueled engines used 
in light-duty vehicle applications have already demonstrated the 
potential for achieving very low NO

X

 levels. 
Ethanol-fueled engines can also produce low emissions. A 
limited amount of work has been done to optimize engines to 
operate at low emissions on ethanol, but there is the potential 
for much more improvement. The same two-stroke engine mentioned 
above was certified on denatured ethanol (95 percent ethanol, 5 
percent gasoline) at 4.2 g/bhp-hr NO

X

. Whereas the injection 
system was calibrated for the higher energy density of ethanol, 
it was not optimized for ethanol use and thus there is room for 
significant improvement in NO

X

 emissions performance. These 
improvements could result in achieving very low NO

X

 levels. 
However, if gasoline is used as a denaturant (as it commonly is), 
flame temperature tends to increase and more NO

X

 is produced. 
Thus, a different denaturant may have to be investigated. This 
same engine using a mixture of 80 percent ethanol, 20 percent 
distilled water (and no denaturant) produced NO

X

 emissions 
results of 1.4 g/bhp-hr.
 There are long-term injector 
durability concerns with such a fuel that would have to be 
resolved before the engine could be commercialized. Many of the 
issues mentioned above in the methanol discussion apply to 
ethanol use as well. 





Natural gas engines using either compressed or liquified gas 
can also achieve very low emission levels. Even though the 
emission optimization of natural gas engines has been focused on 
only recently, they are already being shown to be low-emission 
power sources. Lean-burn, homogeneous-charge engines operating 
on natural gas (including engines made by Cummins, Caterpillar 
and General Motors) are already achieving NO

X

 emissions less than 
2.5 
g/bhp-hr. With additional optimization, it is projected that 
these engines could achieve a level of 1.5 
g/bhp-hr. 
Homogeneous-charge stoichiometric engines with three-way 
catalysts (including engines made by General Motors and Scania) 
are achieving emission levels lower than 1.5 g/bhp-hr NO

X

. 
However, as with the alcohol engines discussed above, extensive 
opportunities remain for further improvement and optimization for 
both of these engine types. As with heavy-duty gasoline engines, 
the natural gas engines operate with high exhaust gas 
temperatures that need to be accommodated to ensure three-way 
catalyst durability.

EPA requests comment on the feasibility of meeting an NO

X

 standard of 1.5 g/bhp-hr for all engine applications, as well as on the need for the surcharge-based 2.5 g/bhp-hr standard.
EPA also requests comment on the possibility of adopting an NO

X

 standard of 2.5 g/bhp-hr for all California on-highway heavy-duty engines without a new vehicle emissions surcharge.


The Agency also notes that in the longer term, significant potential exists for low NO

X

 emissions from different engine designs. Other possibilities include such engines as turbines and stirling engines,
or fuel cell based designs. While such approaches may eventually offer attractive means of lowering NO

X

 emissions, EPA requests comment on the possibility of commercialization of any of these designs by 1999. 



b. Hydrocarbon standard. 

 Heavy-duty vehicles contribute hydrocarbon emissions from both exhaust and evaporative sources. To deal with exhaust
emissions, EPA is proposing an exhaust HC standard of between 0.2 and 0.6 g/bhp-hr NMHC. The 0.6 g/bhp-hr level represents
what is currently being achieved by most diesel engines. Most 1993 model year diesel-fueled engines are certified
at levels less than 0.6 


g/bhp-hr total HC without aftertreatment. Also, two of the three natural gas engines certified by CARB emit no more
than 0.6 g/bhp-hr NMHC. The 0.2 g/bhp-hr NMHC standard represents the current performance of methanol-fueled engines
and diesel-fueled engines equipped with catalysts; for the 1994 model year, such engines have been certified at levels
less than 0.2 g/bhp-hr total HC. On the other hand, most heavy-duty gasoline engines are certified in the 1 g/bhp-hr
range. However, with the application of optimized three-way feedback controlled catalyst systems these engines
should be able to reach levels in the proposed range. EPA requests comments on the appropriate level for this standard.




With regard to evaporative emissions, EPA is planning to extend the concept of inherently low-emitting vehicles
(ILEVs) to the FIP enhanced heavy-duty vehicle control program. EPA's rulemaking for Clean Fuel Fleets established
the ILEV concept of a vehicle that maintains low evaporative emissions without an active control system (58 FR 11888,
March 1, 1993). EPA proposes to adopt an ``evaporative-free'' requirement for all heavy-duty vehicles over 14,000
pounds GVWR to avoid a trade-off of increased evaporative emissions for reduced NO

X

 emissions as would likely occur with the use of gasoline fueled engines in this vehicle class. Engines in vehicles
under 14,000 lbs GVWR certified to the optional engine-based standards also would need to demonstrate evaporative-free
performance. This assurance is needed because vehicles equipped with these engines would not be subject to any in-use
I/M testing of the evaporative control systems. The in-use effectiveness of evaporative control systems consequently
could not be assured as it would be for vehicles subject to enhanced I/M and associated standards. 

Qualifying as an evaporative-free vehicle would require a demonstration that the vehicle does not have the potential
for significant evaporative emissions when operating in high temperature conditions. The demonstration would
have to show a maximum emission level of 5 grams for combined diurnal (adjusted to a nominal 20 gallon fuel tank volume),
hot soak, running loss, and resting loss emissions, without an active evaporative control system. Diurnal emissions
would be based on the engine and fuel system being exposed to ambient heating from 72
  to 96 
 F using 9 psi RVP fuel (or the parallel California requirements of 65
  to 105 
 F using 7 psi RVP fuel). Also, the evaporative-free requirement only supplements existing evaporative emissions
testing procedures; vehicles currently subject to evaporative emission testing would still have to comply with
all applicable requirements. 

For heavy-duty vehicles over 26,000 pounds GVWR, which already operate almost exclusively on diesel fuel, an evaporative-free
requirement would prevent a potential market shift to fuels (such as gasoline) that may be able to meet the proposed
NO

X

 standards but have the potential of high evaporative emission levels. Further, the requirement would decrease the
HC contribution from this class of engines as a whole by eliminating any current evaporative emissions. The heavy-duty
vehicles between 14,000 and 26,000 pounds GVWR, while relatively small in number, do consist of about two-thirds
gasoline vehicles. EPA recognizes that the evaporative-free requirement may discourage the sale of these engines,
however bladders and low volatility fuels could be explored as means of demonstrating evaporative-free performance.
EPA requests comments on other options that could provide assurances that market shifts could not occur and that in-use
evaporative systems for the gasoline vehicles in this class maintain their performance in use. 

EPA specifically requests comment on an option that would establish a chassis-based certification option similar
to that for heavy-duty vehicles less than 14,000 lbs. GVWR. Under this option, vehicles would be subject to enhanced
I/M and other aspects of the enhanced light-duty vehicle program, including the fleets hydrocarbon standard (see
the discussion of the fleet program under the enhanced light-duty vehicle portions of this appendix). Commenters
supporting this alternative should comment on the appropriate numerical standards for certification, recall,
and inspection-and-maintenance testing. 



c. Test requirements.

 Under the proposed enhanced heavy-duty vehicle program, certification and enforcement testing of on-highway heavy-duty
engines and vehicles subject to the new NO

X

 and hydrocarbon standards, including those medium-duty vehicles certified to engine-based standards, would be
subject to EPA requirements. Exhaust emission testing would be conducted following standard Federal test procedures,
with two exceptions. First, test fuels would be based on California specifications. Second, exhaust hydrocarbon
measurements would be quantified as nonmethane hydrocarbons, or other fuel-specific equivalent. Assembly-line
testing would be performed under EPA's Selective Enforcement Audit testing program as described in 40 CFR part 86
subpart K.

Manufacturers of engines subject to the inherently low 
evaporative emissions requirement would submit test results or an 
engineering evaluation to demonstrate that the certified vehicles 
have inherently low evaporative emissions. Test procedures are 
described in EPA Clean Fuel Fleet program regulations (58 FR 
11888, March 1, 1993). 
For vehicles certified under chassis-based requirements, EPA 
also proposes to require evaporative emission testing using the 
Federal test procedure and standards. CARB adopted a new 
evaporative emission test in August 1990 and is now in the 
process of making improvements to its test procedure before 
requesting a waiver from Federal requirements. It is unclear at 
this point how closely aligned the two test procedures will be. 
If CARB receives a waiver, EPA will consider the appropriateness 
of allowing manufacturers to certify vehicles using CARB's 
evaporative emission test. EPA and CARB specify standards of 4 
and 2 grams per test, respectively, for vehicles between 14,000 
and 26,000 pounds GVWR. EPA proposes to retain the 2 
g/test 
standard for California vehicles. The numerical emission 
standards proposed for heavy-duty vehicles apply equally to 
certification and recall testing. 
Other California standards and procedures would be 
unaffected by the FIP, as described above for light-duty 
vehicles. Applicable Federal or California regulations would 
continue to apply in all aspects of control programs for these 
emission sources, including certification, assembly line testing, 
and recall. 


4. Heavy-Duty Engine Rebuild Program 




a. Introduction.

 Heavy-duty engines are generally operated over mileages far 
exceeding the useful life specified when the engines are 
certified. This is due to their high mileage accumulation rates, 
high replacement costs, and overall durable designs. 
Additionally, the engine life is often extended by one or more 
engine rebuilds. Larger diesel engines, for example those used 
in line-haul trucks and transit bus applications, are 
manufactured with replaceable cylinder liners to facilitate 
engine rebuilding. Engines with replaceable cylinder liners can 
be readily rebuilt numerous times. It is not uncommon for such 
engines used in line-haul applications to continue operating for 
many times longer than their statutory useful life. Rebuilds are 
typically performed by a variety of parties including fleet 
operators, small independent garages, the original engine 
manufacturer, and large independent assembly line operations. 
Additionally, there are many independent rebuilders of engine 
components.






Testing conducted on rebuilt engines by EPA has indicated 
that engine rebuilding is generally well done and emissions 
control does not usually suffer. However, EPA is concerned about 
whether this will continue to be the case in the future. Given 
the very stringent enhanced in-use compliance program emissions 
standards for HDEs being proposed and the new control technology 
which will be applied, the in-use emissions performance of 
rebuilt HDEs is unclear. There may be cost incentives to rebuild 
these engines to a non-OEM configuration which could 
substantially increase emissions. Given that most of the actual 
life of some larger engines is beyond the traditional statutory 
useful life, it is important to ensure that engines continue to 
meet standards even after rebuilds. Therefore, EPA is proposing 
to require rebuilt engines to be subject to the standards 
proposed today for new engines. 
These requirements will apply to any 1999 and later model 
year heavy-duty vehicle subject to the enhanced standards that 
is registered in California and is equipped with an engine that 
has been certified to engine-based standards as opposed to 
chassis-based standards. Vehicles certified to chassis-based 
standards in these classes would be subject to full life I/M, 
similar to light-duty enhanced vehicles. Both requirements 
ensure that enhanced vehicles continue to meet applicable 
standards. 


b. Program description

. 
EPA's primary concern is that HDEs meet applicable standards 
in use throughout their life cycle, including after engine 
rebuilding. To do this requires ensuring that, if vehicles are 
found not to comply at any time, someone is responsible for 
remedying the nonconformity. EPA proposes to require vehicle 
owners to be able to demonstrate at all times that their engine 
is certified to meet the emissions standards it originally met. 
If the engine is within its original useful life, nothing more 
would be required. After the end of the engine's original useful 
life, the owner would be required to obtain a useful life renewal 
certificate showing that the engine still met its original 
standards. Such a certificate must be issued by a party that has 
brought the owner's engine to a configuration that has been 
previously certified by EPA (certification requirements are 
discussed below). The certifier would specify a useful life 
renewal period on the certificate over which the certifier is 
responsible for emissions performance of the engine. Once the 
specified period expires, the vehicle owner would be required to 
acquire another useful life renewal certificate before 
reregistering their vehicle in California.

<DOCNO> FR940505-1-00227 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



The certifier would perform all actions necessary to bring 
the engine to the certified configuration before issuing a useful 
life renewal certificate. Necessary actions may range from 
replacement of selected emission control and other hardware to 
major engine overhaul. Anyone able to meet the requirements of 
the program may certify an engine configuration and issue useful 
life renewal certificates. EPA would anticipate that candidates 
for certifiers would most likely be the original engine 
manufacturers, parts suppliers, and engine rebuilders. Once a 
useful life renewal certificate is issued to the vehicle owner, 
the certifier assumes all of the manufacturer's liability for the 
emissions performance of the engine as described in the proposal 
for new engines. 
The marketplace, rather than EPA, should develop the most 
cost effective methods of ensuring effective emissions control 
for each engine. Engine rebuilding may not be necessary in all 
cases. Some engine manufacturers may elect to provide a longer 
original useful life. By extending the useful life, the 
manufacturer would allow owners to use their vehicles for a 
longer period of time without incurring the additional cost of an 
engine rebuild. The Agency believes that there will be 
significant market demand for longer useful life periods, that 
more closely match actual in-use engine rebuild practices. 
The original engine manufacturer or another party may be 
able to provide a useful life renewal certificate upon the 
performance of some specified maintenance on the vehicle. Such 
maintenance would include anything that was needed to bring the 
engine to a certified configuration and ensure emissions control 
for the specified useful life renewal period, possibly including 
the replacement of emissions control devices. There are likely 
to be other possible options for the vehicle owner that EPA has 
not considered. 
As previously mentioned, the vehicle owner must be in 
compliance with these requirements at all times. Enhanced 
engines without valid useful life certificates may not be 
registered in California. At time of registration, the owner 
would be required to show either that the engine was still within 
its original useful life or a useful life renewal period. The 
certifier would be required to provide a certificate to the 
vehicle owner (as described above) and label the engine, allowing 
such a demonstration to be made easily. The label must include 
information identifying the certificate, and the effective and 
expiration dates (mileages and/or hours as applicable) of the 
useful life renewal certificate as applied to the labeled engine. 
Furthermore, if the vehicle owner is found to be out of 
compliance through a roadside check or other means, EPA would 
consider the owner to be in violation of federal tampering 
provisions (see section 203(a) of the Clean Air Act) and the 
owner would be fined for every engine out of compliance. EPA 
requests comments on other ways to enhance its ability to enforce 
these owner requirements. 
EPA recognizes that lighter HDEs are not usually rebuilt 
because their operating life is comparable to that of the 
chassis. Also, their lifetime mileage is generally lower than 
that of larger vehicles. For these reasons, there may not be as 
much incentive for the marketplace to offer as many options for 
lighter heavy-duty vehicles. If an engine reaches the end of its 
statutory useful life and there is no way to renew its useful 
life, the owner would no longer be able to register the vehicle 
with that engine in California. Operators of heavy-duty engines 
would be expected to purchase vehicles equipped with engines with 
a useful life comparable to their needs or purchase vehicles with 
engines that are designed to be rebuilt. It should be noted that 
these requirements only apply to vehicles certified on an engine 
test; many smaller trucks would be certified on a chassis test. 


c. Certification requirements and liability.

 
To help ensure continuous emissions control effectiveness, 
EPA proposes that anyone offering a useful life renewal 
certificate must certify the engine configuration that will 
result from the actions they will perform on the in-use engines. 
EPA also proposes to require that emissions durability be 
demonstrated for the useful life renewal period being provided by 
the certifier. 
The resultant engine configuration must be certified in the 
same manner that a new engine is certified. A full emissions 
test would be required showing that in-use HDEs, after being 
restored to the engine configuration being certified, will meet 
all applicable HDE in-use recall emissions standards to which the 
engine was originally certified. EPA proposes that the test 
engine be representative of actual in-use engines and therefore, 
be an engine at or beyond its statutory useful life. EPA 
recognizes that this may be burdensome for the certifier in the 
early years of the program because available engines will 
generally be at low mileages. However, EPA believes that it is 
necessary to know how high mileage engines will perform after 
being brought to the configuration being certified. EPA requests 
comments on these and any other aspect of the certification 
testing requirements. EPA is especially interested in comments 
on effective but less burdensome test engine requirements.

<DOCNO> FR940505-1-00228 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


In addition to the normally required engine certification information and data, the certification application
would also be required to include: (1) Rationale for test engine selection, (2) a description of all actions necessary
to bring an in-use engine to the configuration being certified, including a description of parts being replaced,
(3) a description of any emissions related components not being replaced and rationale as to why their replacement
is unnecessary, (4) a copy of all installation instructions and warranty, and (5) a copy of the engine label and useful
life renewal certificate to be provided to the engine owner. EPA requests comments on these certification procedures
and the items that are being required to be provided for certification.


d. Recall testing. 

EPA is proposing to apply the enhanced recall program for the light-duty enhanced vehicles, described in detail in
section A.(5) of this appendix, and heavy-duty vehicles as described in more detail below. At the time an engine is
restored to a certified configuration, the certifier, for purposes of this program, becomes the engine manufacturer
for purposes of determining responsibility for the in-use emissions performance of the engine. The certifier may
elect to have outside agents conduct installations. However, EPA proposes to hold the certifier solely liable for
any failure of an engine to meet the enhanced HDE in-use standards during the useful life renewal period. EPA would
have the authority to enforce in-use standards over the useful life renewal period by performing recall testing on
engines within their useful life renewal period in the same manner that EPA would for engines still within the original
useful life. EPA requests comments on the above approach for assessing liability for the emissions performance of
rebuilt engines.
As mentioned above, EPA proposes to conduct recall testing throughout the operating life of engines. EPA believes
that this is the most appropriate way to ensure that engines are meeting the enhanced HDE in-use standards. For recall
testing after the end of the original useful life, EPA will group engines by the certified configuration. Any subsequent
recall orders will hold the certifier of that engine configuration responsible for failure to comply with applicable
emissions standards. Remedial actions would be solely the responsibility of the certifier.
EPA recognizes that the high cost of engine testing may present an impediment to enforcement of these rebuild requirements
through recall testing alone. EPA requests comments on additional methods of enforcing the above rebuild provisions
which may or may not include actual emissions testing. Additionally, EPA requests comments on all aspects of the enhanced
recall provisions.


5. Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) Program


As discussed in Section III.D.2.c. of the Preamble, covering the enhanced      I/M program,
EPA is proposing to include pre-1999 model year heavy-duty vehicles of GVWR 8,500-19,500 pounds in the enhanced
I/M program. Furthermore, as discussed in Section A(4) covering the enhanced vehicle I/M program for new light-duty
vehicles, EPA is proposing to include new heavy-duty vehicles of GVWR 8,500-14,000 pounds in the LDV/LDT enhanced
vehicle program for 1999 and later model years, including I/M. EPA also requests comment on the desirability and feasibility
of extending the enhanced I/M and enhanced vehicle I/M programs to other heavy-duty vehicles, particularly those
in the weight classes up to 26,000 pounds GVWR (or any portion thereof). If this were done, the need to require these
vehicles to be evaporative emission free, as discussed in Section B(3), and the need for these vehicles to be rebuilt,
as discussed in Section B(4), could be reconsidered.
In considering this issue, commenters should refer to the detailed discussion of enhanced light-duty vehicle inspection
and maintenance program requirements which would be applicable to these heavier vehicles as well except as noted
below. These requirements address such issues as geographic scope, testing, enhanced I/M threshold, manufacturer
liability, tracking of enhanced I/M test results, threshold calculation, data collection, and manufacturer notification
of liability.
In addition, EPA would like to note several issues for which an enhanced     I/M program
for heavy-duty vehicles above 14,000 pounds GVWR would differ from the light-duty vehicle and light-duty truck program.
First, the regulatory useful life for heavy-duty vehicles is 110,000 miles, 185,000 miles, or 290,000 miles, depending
on the vehicle class. Therefore, in a manner similar to that described for the light-duty vehicle I/M program, after
the threshold level was exceeded, the engine manufacturer would be responsible for repairing vehicles failing a
enhanced vehicle I/M standard during the useful life period, or prior to engine rebuild, whichever came first. After
the useful life period or after the engine was rebuilt, the responsibility for I/M repairs would depend on whether
these vehicles were included in the enhanced vehicle rebuild program. Second, an     I/M
program for heavy-duty trucks would require the addition of I/M testing capacity for these heavier vehicles. EPA
requests comment on all aspects of this proposal and encourages commenters to suggest options that would facilitate
the achievement of the program's objectives as well as implementation.

6. Recall Program


The enhanced recall program for light-duty vehicles has already been described in Section A(5). The heavy-duty program
will be the same as the light-duty program except for a change related to vehicle selection described below. Like the
light-duty program, it is intended to ensure that vehicles and engines meet applicable standards throughout their
life. Its provisions also apply to medium-duty vehicles that are equipped with engines certified to engine standards
rather than being certified to the medium-duty vehicle chassis-based standards. Medium-duty vehicles certified
to chassis-based standards will be subject to the light-duty recall program requirements. Rather than repeat the
detailed provisions of the enhanced recall program for light-duty vehicles, the reader is referred to the light-duty
discussion for more information. Both programs are based on the current recall program which interested readers
should also review (39 FR 44375, December 23, 1974).
There is one difference between the heavy-duty and light-duty recall programs. For light-duty enhanced vehicles,
EPA is proposing to draw recall test samples from only those vehicles subject to EPA's enhanced I/M program, generally
corresponding to vehicles registered in the FIP areas. This would focus testing on identifying problems which were
not being corrected by the I/M program. Because there is no I/M program for HDEs, this approach is not appropriate for
heavy-duty. Therefore, EPA proposes to draw HDE recall test samples from vehicle families registered throughout
California although the FIP areas would clearly be an important focus.


7. Multiple-State High-Emitting Engines


Many trucks operating in California are engaged in interstate commerce. CARB data show that more than 20 percent of
the mileage accumulated by heavy-duty vehicles in California is from trucks registered to operate in at least one
other state.
 Even if new emission standards are adopted for California trucks, some interstate trucks would continue to be certified
to less stringent federal emission standards. In that case, a significant amount of the potential benefit of the California
standards would be lost. Given the cost impact expected for the California standards, there would also be an incentive
to circumvent the intent of the standards by registering trucks in other states and operating them in California.
EPA wants to avoid such a competitive disadvantage for trucking firms based in California.




To engage in commerce in multiple states, state law requires that trucks must be registered to operate in each state.
The registration requirements allow each state to enforce its traffic laws and engage in some taxing. There are therefore
three types of trucks operating in California: Those operating exclusively in California, those based in California
but also operating in other states, and those based in other states but operating in California. Emissions control
for engines operated exclusively in California is handled through the fleet averaging and importation requirements
of the FIP. This section affects the two categories of trucks operating in other states in addition to California.
It affects both categories equally.
Except as described below, EPA is proposing that owners of trucks registered in multiple states be required to participate
in the fleet averaging program. Only that portion of an interstate trucking fleet registered in California would
be involved in the program, including the calculation and assessment of surcharges. Trucks that never enter California
would not be included.
EPA is concerned about the burden that the fleet averaging program may place on interstate trucking firms, especially
if engine manufacturers choose to base their compliance with the proposed enhanced engine standards on alternative
fuel technologies. The declining fleet average emissions requirement will eventually force owners of all trucks
entering California to meet these standards or to pay increasingly stiff surcharges. Further, to the extent different
fuels are used, interstate truckers may have difficulty finding adequate fuel supplies for their low-emitting trucks
when they are traveling outside California. As a result, they may be forced to maintain dedicated California fleets
or to comply with the program requirements through the payment of surcharges, with little benefit to FIP area air quality.

<DOCNO> FR940505-1-00230 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



As an alternative to requiring all interstate truck fleets to participate in the fleet averaging program, EPA is proposing
to allow fleet owners, at their option, to comply with a use restriction on higher emitting engines. Beginning in 2001,
any time a non-fleet averaged truck which does not meet the enhanced vehicle heavy-duty engine standards and has multiple-state
registrations operates in the state, it would be allowed to make no more than one stop in either the South Coast, Ventura,
or Sacramento FIP areas. This requirement would apply to all such trucks, regardless of whether or not the base of operation
is in California. Any pickup or delivery would be considered a stop. Also, such trucks making a stop in one of the FIP
areas would not be permitted to make more than a total of two stops statewide including any stop in a FIP area. An operator
who could show that a trip into California will involve no driving in the South Coast, Ventura, or Sacramento FIP areas
would be allowed to operate freely throughout the rest of the state. Of course, any vehicle which meets the enhanced
heavy-duty engine standards or is part of a fleet complying with the averaging requirements would be able to operate
throughout the state without restriction. 
EPA would enforce the delivery restrictions by random vehicle checks and inspection of driving logs. EPA could inspect
papers at weigh stations and at pickup and delivery points. Any evidence that the restrictions had been violated would
subject the operator to a maximum fine of $25,000 for every day in violation. EPA is requesting comment on a further
penalty of revocation of the right to register in California if multiple violations are recorded. 
EPA also requests comment on an option under which, beginning in 2005, only engines certified at or below the 1998 federal
4.0 g/bhp-hr NO

X

 standard would be allowed in trucks with multiple-state registrations operating in California. This requirement
would also apply to all trucks, notwithstanding the base of operations. Preventing earlier models from operating
in California is intended to reduce the emission contribution from the interstate portion of the heavy-duty vehicle
fleet. It would ensure that the cleanest national trucks are used in California. 
EPA would begin the two-stop limitation in 2001 and the clean multi-state truck requirement in 2005. The Agency believes
that this would allow sufficient time for them to be implemented without overly disrupting trucking operations in
California. 
EPA requests comment on the proposal to require trucks operating in multiple states to participate in the fleet averaging
program (with and without the option of choosing usage restrictions). EPA also requests comment on whether or not
owners of such fleets should also be required to have their 1999 and later model year trucks meet the enhanced vehicle
standards, similar to requirements for in-state fleet owners. Comments are also requested on all aspects of the discretion
to limit stops of higher-emitting trucks in the FIP areas, and on the alternative of limiting entry of older high-emitting
trucks into the state. 


8. Alternative Fuel Availability 


As discussed earlier, the proposed enhanced heavy-duty vehicle standards will present significant feasibility
challenges for diesel-fueled and gasoline-fueled heavy-duty vehicles. At this time compliance with the standards
is more certain through use of alternative-fueled vehicles. As described above, such fuels could include methanol,
ethanol, compressed or liquified natural gas and possibly others. These fuels are not widely available for vehicle
use at this time. Thus, to the extent that fuels other than diesel and gasoline are chosen for compliance, the availability
of fuel for these vehicles could be of concern. California regulators have also faced this concern during development
of the LEV program and have addressed it through regulation, as described below. 
California's existing fuel availability rules require major fuel suppliers to provide alternative fuels at a minimum
number of their retail outlets. The minimum number of fuel outlets for each alternative fuel depends on the number
of in-use vehicles requiring that fuel (20,000 is the current minimum trigger for fuel availability) and on how many
years the fuel has been required under the fuel availability program. For 1994-96, the requirements apply only
within the SCAQMD, while for 1997 and beyond, they apply throughout the entire state. For example, the first year an
alternative fuel is designated a required clean fuel (i.e., the number of vehicles on the road requiring that fuel
exceeds 20,000), at least a total of 90 fuel outlets must provide the fuel. In the second year, the minimum number would
increase to 200. The required number of retail outlets could be greater if more than 20,000 vehicles required that
alternative fuel. These outlets would be allocated to each of the major fuel producers in the region according to the
amount of motor vehicle fuel they supplied. The fuel outlets would have to be geographically dispersed throughout
the applicable region. 
It is uncertain at this time how many enhanced heavy-duty engines will be alternative-fueled since technologies
which will meet the standards are still being developed. Most of the heavy- duty vehicles are found in fleets, where
fuel availability is easier to control. Therefore, California's fuel availability requirements appear to be sufficient.
Therefore, EPA is not proposing any additional alternative fuel availability requirements. However, EPA requests
comments on this issue and what, if any, additional actions may be appropriate to insure fuel availability. 


9. Fleet Averaging Program 


The enhanced program for heavy-duty vehicles will reduce emissions as planned only if people continue to purchase
new vehicles and retire old ones at past rates. If people keep their old trucks longer than they have in the past or buy
used vehicles from out of state, the emissions reductions would be substantially less. Because these reductions
are critical for achieving attainment, EPA needs to ensure that vehicle turnover continues to occur at historical
rates.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940505-1-00231 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



EPA is proposing to ensure that turnover is maintained by implementing a declining fleet average NO

X

 emissions program. Under the proposed fleet average program, if a fleet's turnover rate falls behind the historical
California fleet average turnover rate for heavy-duty vehicles, then an emissions surcharge will be assessed on
the additional NO

X

 emissions caused by the higher emitting engines. The fleet average NO

X

 emissions level allowed is reduced each registration cycle to reflect the appropriate turnover rates. 
A fleet owner would determine the total NO

X

 emissions from his or her fleet by adding up the annual amount of NO

X

 emitted by each vehicle in the fleet and computing an average value for their heavy-duty vehicles between 19,500 and
33,000 pounds GVWR and their heavy-duty vehicles above 33,000 pounds GVWR. These average values would then be compared
to the fleet average standards for those classes in that calendar year. If the actual emission rate exceeded the standard,
an emissions surcharge would be applied to the excess amount. 
The table below shows the calculation of the fleet average emission rates for the two classes of heavy-duty vehicles
covered by the program. Besides the two vehicle classes, entries are provided for model year groupings which have
different applicable NO

X

 emission standards. The factors represent annual emissions of NO

X

 in tons for a vehicle in any given category. Adding each column and dividing by the number of vehicles in that class will
yield the fleet's average per-vehicle NO

X

 emissions for the fleet owner's heavy-duty vehicles. 






The table below lists the average NO

X

 emissions allowed for each calendar year. These numbers are derived from the expected model year makeup of the California
fleet as older vehicles are retired and replaced with enhanced heavy-duty vehicles.

<TEXT>
 




Compliance with the fleet average standard would be 
determined by comparing the values in the second table with those 
calculated in the first. If the actual values are below the 
standard, no emission surcharge is due. If either of the actual 
values exceed the standard for that year, a surcharge would be 
due based on the difference. It would be determined by 
multiplying the difference by the number of vehicles affected (in 
the specific vehicle category) and then by the surcharge rate of 
$10,000 per ton. It is important to note that so long as a fleet 
continues to replace vehicles at historical rates, no surcharge 
would be required. 
In order to assure the maximum flexibility, EPA is also 
proposing to allow individual fleets to join together into larger 
fleets for determining compliance with the fleet standard. This 
provision should accommodate those fleets which may turn over 
slower or more quickly than the average, notwithstanding any 
effects of the enhanced vehicle program. Additionally, it could 
benefit very small fleets, such as independently owned trucks. 
The flexibility to join together should ease the impact of the 
steady reduction in the fleet average emissions allowed on any 
fleets with special compliance problems. 
The annual emission rates developed in the above two tables 
are based on diesel engine values, even though the program 
applies to all heavy-duty vehicles above 19,500 pounds GVWR. 
This is consistent with the fact that diesels make up the 
dominant fraction of the affected fleets. It also could serve to 
encourage turnover of gasoline fueled engines faster than they 
otherwise would. This is because, even though they are generally 
less expensive than diesel engines, they would provide the same 
credit in the fleet average as turning over a diesel engine. 
Given the high evaporative emissions from gasoline engines, this 
is a desirable result. Comments are invited on this approach. 
It should also be noted that the declining fleet average 
standards described above are proposed to apply only to heavy-duty 
vehicles above 19,500 pounds. Lighter HDVs are not included 
because EPA is proposing to include these vehicles in its 
enhanced 
I/M program. Because this group has a large number of 
gasoline fueled vehicles (which would particularly benefit from 
an I/M program) and a large number of small fleets (which would 
find the declining fleet average program particularly 
burdensome), the Agency believes this to be the best approach for 
these vehicles. Exclusion of LHDVs from the averaging program 
would not affect the role of 1999 and later LHDV engines in the 
other enhanced heavy-duty vehicle requirements already described. 
Comments are invited on the alternative of including LHDVs in the 
declining fleet average program. 
As discussed earlier, EPA is considering allowing enhanced 
HDVs to be equipped with engines certified to a 2.5 g/bhp-hr 
standard rather than a 1.5 g/bhp-hr standard as long as an 
appropriate new vehicle surcharge is paid by the purchaser. 
Because the surcharge is based on the excess NO

X

 emitted over the 
entire life of the vehicle, EPA believes that it would be 
appropriate to count these vehicles in the fleet average as 
emitting at 
1.5 g/bhp-hr rather than 2.5 g/bhp-hr. Otherwise, 
the fleet owner would be required to pay twice for the same 
incremental emissions.

As described more fully below in the nonroad fleet averaging 
program, EPA is concerned that engine and truck dealers may be 
significantly hurt if fleet owners prebuy 4.0 g/bhp-hr NO

X

 
engines to reduce the need for purchases of 1.5 g/bhp-hr NO

X

 
engines in the initial years of the program. Dealers are 
generally local, unlike all manufacturers and some fleet owners. 
They therefore may have trouble surviving more than a year of 
slow movement in the California market. Therefore, EPA is 
requesting comment on a manufacturer sales mandate for heavy-duty 
onhighway similar to that for nonroad engines. Interested 
readers should review section C.(7)(b) of this appendix for more 
information. 
EPA requests comments on all aspects of the heavy-duty 
declining fleet average proposal. 


10. Fleets 


As described in the enhanced light-duty vehicle section 
(A(6)), EPA is proposing a revised Clean Fuel Fleet program in 
the South Coast and requesting comment on expanding it into the 
other two FIP areas. As described in the Clean Air Act Title II, 
Part C and in EPA's Clean Fuel Fleet program regulations (see 58 
FR 32474, June 10, 1993 and 58 FR 64679, December 9, 1993) the 
national Clean Fuel Fleet program would require certain centrally 
fueled fleets to make a certain percentage of their new vehicle 
purchases clean fuel vehicles. The CAA HD fleet program applies 
to fleets up to 26,000 pounds GVWR and requires that 50 percent 
of all purchased be Clean Fuel Vehicles. 
As described in the light-duty enhanced vehicle program, EPA 
is proposing to require that the affected fleets purchase ILEVs 
which meet a composite NMHC standard set to reflect their low 
evaporative emission potential, rather than merely clean fuel 
vehicles. This requirement ensures that the fleet program will 
achieve significant hydrocarbon reductions beyond what is 
required by the general enhanced vehicle program. The 
application of this program is straightforward for most vehicles 
up to 14,000 lbs. GVWR. On the other hand, for vehicles 
certified to engine based standards (all vehicles above 14,000 
lbs GVWR and some under that threshold), an ILEV requirement is 
already in place and therefore no composite is necessary. EPA 
therefore is proposing to apply the fleet program only to 
vehicles certified to a chassis-based standard, currently to 
vehicles up to 14,000 lbs GVWR. If EPA extends the chassis-based 
certification option to vehicles between 14,000 and 26,000 lbs. 
GVWR, the fleet program will extend to these vehicles as well. 


11. General Enforcement 


It would be a violation of federal law for any engine 
manufacturers or owners to fail to comply with the specific 
requirements and prohibitions described above. In addition, 
under the enhanced heavy-duty vehicle program, it would be a 
violation of federal law for the California Department of Motor 
Vehicles (DMV) or any other department of the State of California 
(or any political subdivision thereof) to register any vehicle 
subject to any requirement for which a valid certificate of 
compliance or waiver (either paper-based or electronic) has not 
been presented. Any person providing fraudulent certification or 
otherwise aiding or abetting in the violation of this section, 
would also be violating federal law. 
That is, it is a violation to permit registration or 
facilitate reregistration of a model year 1999 or later engine 
for which there is not in force a valid certificate of conformity 
from EPA (either for the engine or for the rebuild). Further it 
is a violation to register any model year 1998 or previous 
vehicle or engine after 2001 without EPA confirmation that the 
appropriate fleet average fee, if any, has been paid. Violations 
could result in civil penalties under federal law of up to 
$25,000 per violation. Each instance of unlawful registration 
would be considered a separate offense. 


C. Enhanced In-Use Compliance Program for Nonroad Engines Over 37 kw 


1. Applicability 


EPA intends the enhanced in-use compliance program for 
nonroad engines to apply to most nonroad engines at or above 37 
kw, with the exceptions described above. This means that the 
Agency is adding two categories of nonroad engines not covered 
under the nationwide federal rulemaking. The first category is 
spark-ignition engines for all categories except recreational 
marine engines. The second is high speed Diesel marine engines 
which are at or above 37 kw; these engines are not included in 
other FIP regulations. 
 The enhanced nonroad engine program is proposed to include 
both CI and SI engines. EPA is concerned that applying more 
stringent emission standards only to CI engines would create an 
incentive to replace diesel (CI) engines with gasoline (SI) 
engines, because if left unregulated these engines could have a 
cost advantage. This shift would increase emissions because the 
unregulated gasoline engines would have higher exhaust levels and 
significantly higher evaporative emissions than diesel engines. 
EPA is therefore proposing exhaust emission regulations for both 
CI and SI engines (i.e., all engine types in the size range 
described) and adding a requirement to prevent evaporative 
emission increases. This strategy should level the playing field 
from an emissions perspective and avoid introducing an 
inappropriate encouragement to shift to gasoline and higher HC 
emissions.

<TEXT>
 



The enhanced nonroad engine program is also proposed to include CI marine engines over 37 kw which have rated speeds
at maximum torque of over 1200 revolutions per minute. These engines are generally used in non-oceangoing commercial
vessels; oceangoing ships are dealt with in other portions of this FIP. 

The Agency notes that the proposal would include generators at or above 37 kw used on oil platforms, if they fit the mobility
requirements defining nonroad engines in EPA's nationwide rule. If not, they are regulated as part of the platform
under EPA's Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) rules if they are permanently placed at the OCS site. 

The provisions of this section apply only to engines sold for use in the FIP areas (although, as discussed later, EPA
is considering options extending beyond the FIP areas). Nonroad engines are significantly less mobile than onhighway
engines. Thus EPA has tailored its program to apply only to engines in the FIP areas. Any equipment with an applicable
engine sold for use in a FIP area will be required to have a prominent exterior sticker showing that it meets the standards
and other provisions of this program. A fleet averaging program, similar to that for on-highway, will also be applied
to engines used in the FIP area to ensure continued turnover to cleaner engines. The enforcement of these two requirements
is discussed further in the nonroad fleets section below. 

EPA proposes that after the inception of the nonroad engine program described in this Appendix, only engines complying
with the provisions of this program may be imported for use into the FIP areas. Use of older engines, not previously
used in the areas, is prohibited. Additionally, use of new engines which do not comply with the program is also prohibited.




2. Authority 



EPA is proposing this enhanced in-use compliance program for nonroad engines using its broad remedial authority
under section 110(c). Section 213 of the Clean Air Act provides EPA with specific authority to regulate nonroad engines.
Moreover, no provision of section 213, or any other section of the Clean Air Act, prohibits EPA from exercising its
section 110(c) authority in the manner proposed herein. EPA's data indicate that the engines regulated herein, nonroad
engines at or above 37 kw including SI engines and diesel marine engines with speeds greater than 1200 RPM, contribute
to ozone pollution in the FIP areas. 



3. Emissions Standards 





a. Oxides of Nitrogen Standard.

 Parallel to the onhighway requirements, EPA proposes that 1999 and later model year nonroad engines for use in the
Ventura and South Coast nonattainment areas must meet a NO

X

 standard of 1.5 g/bhp-hr. For Sacramento, EPA proposes a 2.5 g/bhp-hr standard, reflecting a somewhat lesser need
for control in that area, but is considering a 1.5 g/bhp-hr standard for reasons discussed below. EPA requests comment
on these proposed standards and their areas of application. 

As with onhighway engines, EPA is also considering an option to allow use of engines emitting up to 2.5 g/bhp-hr NO

X

 in the South Coast or Ventura areas, subject to an emissions surcharge which would be paid at the time of equipment purchase.
This option is intended to cover unique applications where the 1.5 g/bhp-hr standard might present unacceptable
limitations. The surcharge, shown in the table below for applicable nonroad categories, is based on a cost of $10,000
per ton of increased NO

X

 emissions over the life of the engine. The calculations are based on usage data supplied by manufacturers, as presented
in EPA's ``Draft Regulatory Support Document for Control of NO

X

 and Smoke Emissions from Nonroad Compression-Ignition Engines Greater than or Equal to 50 Horsepower'' (April 1993).
EPA assumed that each category of engines would be operated at its average annual rate (hours per year) for sixteen
years. Lifetime emissions are discounted at a seven percent annual rate. 

In computing the emissions surcharges, the Agency combined equipment types with similar surcharges into 7 different
groups and assigned a surcharge value to each based on information from manufacturers. EPA is proposing that manufacturers
of nonroad equipment containing an engine of over 37 kw must classify each type of equipment into one of these categories.
Any equipment fitting possibly into two categories will be presumed to fit into the higher surcharge category unless
further information is provided. Details of the individual values can be found in the docket.
 EPA requests comment on the categories listed in the table below, especially whether any engine applications may
be missing from the list, or whether the categories need further definition to distinguish between similar applications.
EPA also requests comment on the possible need to further divide categories, perhaps by engine size, to avoid inappropriate
fees for some engines. Any comments should reflect the need to keep the set of surcharges simple enough to maintain
a manageable program.

With respect to the feasibility of the enhanced nonroad 
engine standards, the reader is referred to the discussion of the 
onhighway standards feasibility question. EPA believes that the 
technological approaches expected to be used for onhighway 
engines will also find application for nonroad engines. More 
specifically, diesel engine manufacturers make engines for both 
onhighway and nonroad applications and some individual engine 
families have been used for both. The Agency therefore projects 
that the diesel engine developments applied to onhighway engines 
will also need to be applied to nonroad engines. Although at 
this time there are very few gasoline or alternative fuel (mainly 
LPG) engines in these categories, such engines may find it easier 
to meet the nonroad NO

X

 standards than the onhighway standards 
because of the steady-state nature of the in-use test. (Gasoline 
may have difficulty with the evaporative hydrocarbon requirements 
described below.) Optimization of these engines may be less 
complex because transient fuel/air mixture control is less of a 
concern. Alternative fuel related technology and longer-term 
engine changes described for onhighway engines are also 
candidates for use in the nonroad market. 
EPA is aware that packaging concerns can be an issue for 
nonroad equipment, as they are for onhighway vehicles. Many 
manufacturers of nonroad equipment will have to make changes to 
their equipment designs if the profile of the engine is altered 
substantially or there are other, new, requirements such as fuel 
system changes. Moreover, there are also differences in use 
between nonroad and onhighway engines which lead to different 
load requirements. EPA believes that the four-year lead time 
provided in the FIP will be sufficient for such issues to be 
resolved but requests comment from equipment manufacturers on 
unique packaging and use issues for nonroad equipment. 


b. Hydrocarbon standard.

 EPA proposes to set the exhaust NMHC standard at 1.2 g/bhp-hr, the current onhighway heavy-duty diesel engine 
standard. If EPA, in the national rule for CI nonroad engines at 
or above 37 kw, finalizes a different standard for these engines, 
EPA will consider that standard for FIP engines as well. 
Additionally, since these engines are a small but significant 
contributor to HC inventories in the areas, EPA requests comment 
on lower HC standards such as those described in the proposal for 
onhighway heavy-duty vehicles (section B.(3)(b) of this 
appendix). 

Once again paralleling the onhighway heavy-duty vehicle 
provisions, EPA proposes to require nonroad equipment using 
engines over 37 kw to have inherently low evaporative emissions. 
Qualifying as low evaporative would require a demonstration that 
the equipment does not have the potential for significant 
evaporative emissions when operating in high temperature 
conditions. The demonstration (via testing or engineering 
analysis) would be based on a maximum emission level of 5 grams 
for combined diurnal (adjusted to a nominal 20 gallon fuel tank 
volume), hot soak, running loss, and resting loss emissions, 
without an evaporative control system. Diurnal emissions would 
be based on the engine and fuel system being exposed to ambient 
heating from 72
  to 96
  F with a 40 percent fill of 9 psi RVP 
fuel, or the parallel California requirements of 65
  to 105
  F 
using 7 psi RVP fuel (if gasoline is used). EPA would have the 
option of testing to confirm the results. This requirement will 
ensure that evaporative emissions remain low in use, which is 
especially important given there is no inspection and maintenance 
program for these engines. 

EPA data show most heavy-duty nonroad applications at or 
above 37 kw use diesel fuel or liquefied petroleum gas (propane). 
Engines operating on these fuels are likely to be able to comply 
with the low evaporative requirement without modification. The 
low evaporative requirement, therefore, would affect the small 
portion of the nonroad fleet operating on gasoline and would 
prevent other changes in the makeup of the existing fleet that 
could increase the potential for evaporative emissions. In 
applications where gasoline-fueled engines are used, new engines 
in this size range would have to be redesigned to operate low 
evaporative. Very low volatility gasoline could be investigated 
as an option to use of diesel or other fuels. 
EPA seeks comment on other options that could provide 
assurance that hydrocarbon emissions would not increase from 
these engines and that a shift to high volatility gasoline 
engines would not occur. Commenters should review the treatment 
of light-duty vehicles under the enhanced in-use compliance 
program (section A. of this appendix).

c. Test requirements.

 EPA is proposing to conduct certification and enforcement 
testing of nonroad heavy-duty engines regulated under this 
program using the federal nonroad procedures for NO

X

 and 
hydrocarbon emission measurement expected to be finalized by May 
30, 1994, except that test fuels would be based on applicable 
California specifications. The eight mode steady state duty-cycle and other test procedures that will be finalized
in the 
national rule for CI engines are proposed here to apply to both 
compression-ignition and spark-ignition engines, regardless of 
fuel type. Exhaust hydrocarbon measurements would be quantified 
as nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHC), or other fuel specific 
equivalents. Assembly-line testing would be performed under EPA's 
Selective Enforcement Audit testing program as described in 40 
CFR part 89 subpart F. 

Since the test procedure being proposed today is a steady-state procedure, it may not result in control designs for
nonroad 
engines that produce the degree of in-use emissions reductions 
expected. For example, spark-ignition engines can exhibit very 
different emissions characteristics on different test cycles, 
such as cycles with transient operating conditions. The Agency is 
also concerned that the 8-mode test may be inadequate for 
verifying the compliance of CI engines with the NMHC and NO

X

 
standards proposed here, as discussed in the May 17, 1993 
nationwide nonroad proposal. 

Because of these concerns, the Agency will monitor engines 
produced and certified very carefully to be assured that engines 
do, in fact, yield proportional in-use emissions reductions. The 
Agency will also remain alert to the possible use of defeat 
devices or design approaches that result in non-proportional 
emissions reductions under operating conditions that are outside 
the test procedure operating conditions. 

Additionally, the Agency is engaged in a program to 
characterize the in-use operation of nonroad engines. This 
program will allow EPA to develop representative duty cycles, 
evaluate the emissions impact of those cycles and determine which 
cycle will best ensure engine designs that will yield the 
expected level of in-use control. The Agency may change the duty 
cycle used to test nonroad engines in a subsequent rulemaking if 
the Agency determines that such a change is needed to assure that 
projected emission reductions actually occur in use. 

Manufacturers of engines subject to the inherently low 
evaporative emissions requirement would submit test results or an 
engineering evaluation to demonstrate that the certified vehicles 
have inherently low evaporative emissions. Test procedures are 
described in EPA Clean Fuel Fleet program regulations (58 FR 
11888, March 1, 1993). 

The standards and procedures proposed for enhanced nonroad 
heavy-duty engines would apply equally to certification and 
vehicle recall testing. EPA requests comment on these test 
procedures, especially on the use of the steady-state test for 
spark ignition engines. 



4. Inspection & Maintenance (I/M) Program 



As mentioned earlier, EPA is not proposing I/M requirements 
for nonroad engines. Developing a new I/M program for the 
diverse set of applications involved would be a very difficult 
and complex undertaking and would present significant testing and 
administrative burdens. However, an in-use testing program (such 
as I/M) would allow EPA to reconsider the need to require nonroad 
engines to be low evaporative and the need for the nonroad engine 
rebuild requirements. EPA therefore requests comment on the 
feasibility and desirability of adopting an I/M program for 
heavy-duty nonroad engines covered under the enhanced in-use 
compliance program. The I/M program could apply to any or all 
nonroad engines over 50 hp sold for use in California's 
designated FIP areas. The reader is referred to the light-duty 
vehicle I/M discussion (section A.(4) of this appendix) for a 
detailed discussion of such enhanced vehicle requirements as 
geographic scope, testing, enhanced I/M threshold, manufacturer 
liability, tracking of enhanced I/M test results, threshold 
calculation, data collection, and manufacturer notification of 
liability. 

Commenters recommending a nonroad I/M program should comment 
on the proper I/M test for heavy-duty nonroad engines and whether 
the capabilities for such tests would be needed at every 
facility. They should also comment on what the specifications 
for such a facility would be and whether any such facility could 
handle all types of nonroad equipment. An I/M program for 
nonroad engines would apply for the full operating life of the 
engine.

5. Nonroad Engine Rebuild Requirements



As with onhighway engines, nonroad engines are used for periods of time greatly exceeding the proposed useful life
for nonroad engines (10 years, or 8000 hours, whichever comes first). For this reason, EPA proposes to apply the full
rebuild program described for onhighway heavy-duty vehicles (section B.(4) of this appendix) to enhanced nonroad
engines. As with onhighway engines, nonroad engines will not be subject to an I/M program and EPA is concerned about
the possible adverse effect of engine rebuilding on the emissions from engines certified to the enhanced nonroad
engine standards. If these engines are rebuilt improperly, they may have very high emissions which could outweigh
many of the emissions benefits of the FIP programs. 
EPA requests comments on all aspects of this proposal, especially on any aspects of the onhighway heavy-duty engine
rebuild program which are inappropriate for nonroad engines. 


6. Recall Program



EPA proposes to conduct all aspects of the enhanced nonroad engine recall program in the same manner as the enhanced
onhighway recall program, as highlighted below. Interested readers should review the light-duty vehicle recall
provisions (section A.(5) of this appendix) and the heavy-duty vehicle recall provisions (section B.(6) of this
appendix) for additional details regarding this program. 
Nonroad engines will be recall tested using certification test procedures and fuels discussed above in section C.(3)(c).
As for the other enhanced vehicle programs, EPA proposes to test nonroad engines unless they have been subject to obvious
abuse or tampering. If there are particular usage characteristics that could contribute to in-use emissions failures,
manufacturers must consider them in the design of their products. For example, nonroad engines are likely to be used
in environmental conditions that may include rough terrain, high levels of dust, and exposure to water. EPA would
not consider exposure to such conditions grounds for excluding engines from the recall test sample. The Agency believes
that addressing these challenges is appropriate and necessary to provide assurance that applicable emissions standards
continue to be met in actual use throughout the life of the engine. 
In connection with the engine rebuilding requirements described above, EPA also proposes to conduct recall testing
throughout the operating life of engines. EPA believes that this is the most appropriate way to ensure that engines
are meeting the enhanced nonroad engine standards in use. For recall testing after the end of the original useful life,
EPA will group engines by the certified configuration. Any subsequent recall orders will hold the certifier of that
engine configuration responsible for failure to comply with applicable emissions standards. Remedial actions
would be solely the responsibility of the certifier. 
EPA requests comments on all aspects of the enhanced in-use compliance recall program for nonroad engines, including
the recall provisions that have been proposed for onhighway heavy- duty vehicles and light-duty vehicles. 


7. Fleet Averaging Program 


Like the heavy-duty onhighway program, the enhanced in-use compliance program for nonroad equipment will reduce
emissions as projected only if new equipment is purchased and old equipment is retired at historical rates. Additionally,
the use requirements which apply in the FIP areas must be obeyed to be effective. If old equipment is kept longer than
in the past, the emissions reductions could be substantially less. These reductions are critical for achieving attainment;
therefore, EPA is proposing fleet average and sticker programs to ensure traditional turnover rates and usage patterns
continue. Due to the inherent complexities of such a program, among other things, EPA is also considering and requesting
comment on a statewide nonroad program with sales requirements. Details of this alternative program are provided
at the end of this fleet averaging section. 
Just as with heavy-duty onhighway engines, EPA is proposing to ensure that turnover is maintained by implementing
a declining fleet average NO

X

 emissions program. Under the proposed fleet average program, if a fleet's turnover rate falls behind the historic
average turnover rate for nonroad equipment, then an emissions surcharge will be assessed on the additional NO

X

 emissions caused by the higher emitting engines. The fleet average NO

X

 emissions level allowed is reduced each calendar year to reflect the appropriate turnover rates.

<DOCNO> FR940505-1-00239 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Owners of any nonroad equipment (hereafter fleet owners) 
would determine the total NO

X

 emissions from their equipment by 
adding up the annual amount of NO

X

 emitted by each piece of 
equipment. The annual amount of NO

X

 emitted by a piece of 
equipment is determined by reference to its expected emissions 
based on the equipment class and model year, as delineated in the 
table below. An average would be computed by dividing by the 
number of pieces of equipment. These averages would then be 
compared to the average which would occur if normal turnover was 
maintained (see the table below). EPA is proposing to determine 
the emissions levels and averages required using the same seven 
classes of nonroad equipment described above in section C.(3)(a). 
These classes are based on total emissions from equipment and 
were developed to ensure that any tradeoff between equipment due 
to averaging which occurs is emissions neutral. The target 
average emissions level would be reduced each calendar year. If 
the actual emission rate exceeded the fleet average standard in 
any year, an emissions surcharge would be applied to the excess 
amount of emissions for that year. As with the heavy-duty 
onhighway engine program the surcharge is based on $10,000 per 
ton of NO

X

 emissions. 

The table below shows how to calculate the fleet average 
emission rates for the first two classes of nonroad equipment. 
(The reader is directed to the regulations or the docket for 
similar information for the remaining classes of nonroad 
equipment.) For each equipment class, annual emission levels are 
provided for model year groups which have different applicable 
NO

X

 emission standards. The numbers represent annual emissions 
of NO

X

 in tons for equipment in each category and must be 
multiplied by the number of engines in that category in a fleet 
to get total emissions. Adding each column and dividing by the 
total number of engines in each class will yield the fleet's 
average per-engine NO

X

 emissions for that category.

The numbers in the table above (and the similar numbers 
contained in the regulations for the other classes of nonroad 
equipment) reflect usage patterns for nonroad engines as 
described in EPA's draft Regulatory Support Document for the 
national nonroad rule. They reflect typical annual hours of use 
and load for each equipment type and applicable emissions 
standards. Further information regarding the calculation of 
these estimates is available in the Docket for this FIP.
 EPA 
did not incorporate any seasonal adjustment for nonroad equipment 
that may only be used in the non-ozone season. EPA invites 
comment on whether there are any types of equipment affected that 
are used in FIP areas only under conditions that preclude ozone 
violations (for example, snow grooming equipment). 




The table below (``Average NO

X

 Emissions Allowed by Calendar 
Year for Class I Nonroad Engines'') lists the allowable average 
NO

X

 emissions for the first class of nonroad equipment during 
each calendar year for the South Coast and Ventura. The charts 
for Sacramento (which reflect turnover to 2.5 g/bhp-hr engines 
rather than to 1.5 g/bhp-hr engines) and those for the other 
classes of equipment are included in the regulations and are 
calculated in the same manner. These numbers are derived from 
the same average activity levels, load factors (as an average 
percent of rated horsepower), and uncontrolled emission levels 
described above. In addition, historical fleet turnover rates 
are incorporated in the fleet averages. Once the average actual 
emissions is determined for a fleet, it would be compared to the 
number in this chart corresponding to the appropriate class and 
year. That number represents the average that would occur if 
normal turnover of nonroad engines was maintained. These 
estimates are based on average 50 percent survival rates 
calculated for the EPA Nonroad Study and the documents associated 
with the national nonroad program NPRM benefits analysis.
 
Further information regarding the calculation of these numbers 
may be found in the Docket for this FIP. EPA invites comment on 
the use of these estimates.

<TEXT>
 






Compliance with the fleet average standard would be 
determined by comparing the values in the second table with those 
calculated using the first. If the actual values are below the 
standard for that year, no emission surcharge is due. If the 
emissions level for any class of nonroad engines exceeds the 
standard for that year, a surcharge would be due based on the 
difference. The surcharge would be determined by multiplying the 
difference by the number of pieces of equipment in the class for 
the fleet and then by the surcharge rate of $10,000 per ton. It 
is important to note that so long as a fleet continues to replace 
equipment at historical rates, no surcharge would be charged. 
In most other ways the declining average NO

X

 program for 
nonroad engines is similar to that for onhighway engines. They 
will both begin in 2000. In order to provide flexibility, EPA is 
proposing to allow individual fleets to join together into larger 
fleets for determining compliance with the fleet standard. 
(Because of the different NO

X

 standards for the Sacramento 
nonattainment area, individual fleets in Sacramento may only join 
with other fleets in Sacramento. Likewise, individual fleets in 
the South Coast Air Basin and Ventura County may only join 
together with fleets in the South Coast Air Basin and Ventura 
County.) This provision should accommodate those fleets which 
may turn over slower or more quickly than the average, 
notwithstanding any effects of the enhanced vehicle program. 
Additionally, it could benefit very small fleets. The 
flexibility to join together should ease the impact of the steady 
reduction in the fleet average emissions allowed on any fleets 
with special compliance problems. However, EPA is not proposing 
to allow averaging between different nonroad equipment classes 
because, due to the very different uses, there are few benefits 
to outweigh the complications an averaging scheme could create. 
For the purpose of calculating surcharges, EPA will assume 
that all engines certifying at or below 1.5 g/bhp-hr NO

X

 have 
emission factors of 1.5 g/bhp-hr and that all engines certifying 
above 1.5 g/bhp-hr NO

X

 but at or below 2.5 g/bhp-hr NO

X

 have 
emission factors of 2.5 g/bhp-hr. However, if EPA permits use of 
engines certified at or below 2.5 g/bhp-hr NO

X

 in the South Coast 
or Ventura after payment of a lifetime emissions surcharge, as 
described above in section C.(3)(a), such engines will be treated 
as if they were 1.5 g/bhp-hr engines for the purpose of in-use 
fleet average emissions calculations.

a. 

Administration of the fleet average nonroad program. 

The fleet average requirement would be enforced through a program very similar to annual registration for onhighway
vehicles. Nonroad registration is proposed to occur every January beginning in 1999. At that time, owners would bring
documents representing their equipment to EPA along with a preliminary calculation of the surcharge due, if any.
EPA would issue stickers for the equipment in the fleet as well as a certification that the fleet complies for that year.


Each piece of equipment that falls under the provisions of this section would be required to have an EPA sticker prominently
displayed on it to be used or stored (except under certain conditions) in the FIP areas. EPA's regulations describe
the size and color of the sticker and its placement. Individual stickers would be issued for each engine document (as
described below) that has been reviewed by EPA. The engine documents would be designed to be marked each year in such
a way that a fleet owner would be unable to use the same document to obtain two stickers. Documents would also show the
name of the equipment owner, and only EPA could reissue documents when ownership is transferred. This system would
be set up to limit the potential market for stolen documentation. 

The documentation required must include the serial number of the engine, the equipment type, the horsepower rating,
and the certified emission standard. For equipment produced after the effective date of this FIP, EPA proposes to
require manufacturers to supply the documentation to purchasers just as do vehicle manufacturers. In the case of
existing equipment, documentation would be created by EPA based on sworn statements by the owner. The documentation
must also include the useful life renewal certificates as described in the rebuild program (for 1999 and later model
year nonroad engines that are beyond their original useful life period) and proof that any necessary repairs have
been performed by an authorized party for any nonroad engine subject to a recall action. Owners would be required to
have documented all engines in their fleet by or during the first year of registration cycle in January 1999. Only those
pre-1999 nonroad engines shown in a California fleet in that first year may be re-registered to be used in the FIP areas
at any time after 1999. EPA retains the right to conduct physical inspections of the engines or deputize local government
agencies to do so. 

As with onhighway registration programs, stickers will be applied by owners since the equipment could not be brought
into the surcharge office. To prevent cheating through the placement of stickers on improper equipment, stickers
would be serially numbered and the sticker number recorded on the engine document and on a separate card with all fleet
engine serial numbers which would be given to the owner. Stickers would also describe the engine type and serial number.
EPA proposes that it or its deputies be able to inspect any site where affected engines are used or stored in the FIP areas
and require surrender of such documentation. 

EPA is proposing a system based on paper documents. However, a computerized registration data system, similar to
the types of registration systems used for onhighway vehicles is possible. Such a system has the potential to minimize
transaction problems, assist in title transfers, and reduce problems associated with sole reliance on physical
documents. It would also require more resources. EPA is open to working with the California Department of Motor Vehicles
to develop such a system and invites comments on its benefits and feasibility. 

This sticker system will apply only to engines operated in the FIP areas. However, the system is proposed to be accessible
statewide to accommodate leasing companies which own a significant portion of the nonroad equipment used in the state.
New nonroad equipment not meeting the enhanced in-use compliance program requirements will be allowed to be sold
even in the FIP areas to accommodate distributors and such leasing companies. EPA plans to monitor sales and will target
audits on any FIP area purchaser of significant numbers of non-FIP area equipment. EPA is proposing to require use
of only stickered equipment in FIP areas year round. Such a program eases enforcement and is necessary, at least in
Los Angeles, to prevent ozone exceedances. Nonstickered equipment will be allowed only if it is being transported
through, or out of, the FIP area (and remains in a loaded condition while in the FIP area) or is being stored on an equipment
leasing or distributor's lot for later use outside the FIP area. Such lots should not be on or adjacent to any job site
in the FIP area. 

EPA will have the authority to enter premises to inspect equipment, stickers, and other documentation. The unauthorized
presence or operation of equipment without an appropriate sticker, the application of a sticker to any engine except
the one for which it was designated, the use of false documents to obtain an EPA sticker, or the falsification of any
documentation required under this section is strictly prohibited and will be punishable by fines of up to $25,000.

b. Optional state-wide program. 

EPA is concerned that the FIP areas may be too small to create sufficient market incentive for equipment manufacturers
to develop and offer for sale equipment meeting the proposed 
standards and that therefore, little equipment would be provided 
meeting the requirements of this program. EPA is further 
concerned that even if there are such engines, that the 
availability of more traditional equipment in areas adjacent to 
the FIP areas will create incentives for people to attempt to 
avoid the fleet average requirements. Finally, EPA is concerned 
that FIP residents may choose to comply with the first years of 
the fleet average requirements by purchasing extra nationally-regulated engines right before the start of the program.
While 
such a strategy does not impact air quality, provided full 
compliance occurs, it could be extremely destabilizing for the 
equipment dealers and could put the viability of dealers' 
businesses at risk. 

To address these concerns, EPA is requesting comment on 
various revisions to the enhanced in-use compliance program for 
nonroad engines. First, as described in the standards discussion 
(section C.(3)), the Agency is requesting comment on a 
1.5 g/bhp-hr NO

X

 standard for all three FIP areas. This revision 
would eliminate any problems that a Sacramento-only standard 
would create for manufacturers. Unfortunately, it would not 
address most of the other concerns. 

Another option is to apply the enhanced nonroad emission 
standards statewide (including the 1.5 g/bhp-hr NO

X

 standard, the 
exhaust NMHC standard and the low evaporative requirements 
described in section C.(3)). Under this approach, only equipment 
certified to the enhanced nonroad engine standards would be 
available in California beginning in 1999. The statewide 
requirement expands the market available for engine and equipment 
manufacturers and should provide them sufficient incentive to 
offer all types of nonroad equipment. Further, in a statewide 
program, the size of the state and the location of the FIP areas 
should counteract any incentive to cheat by using higher emitting 
equipment available in neighboring areas. 

Unfortunately, statewide application will not eliminate the 
possibility of significant pre-FIP purchasing and corresponding 
lack of purchasing in the early years of the program and the 
destabilizing effect on the economy both could have. EPA is 
therefore asking for comment on a requirement that engine 
manufacturers sell a similar fraction of their engines in the 
state in the FIP years as they did on average for the three years 
preceding the FIP. Fractional requirements would be converted 
into numerical requirements to facilitate averaging and trading 
among engine types and manufacturers. No banking would be 
allowed, since banking would create the destabilizing problems 
the program was designed to avoid. Trading and averaging 
permitted would be modeled on the current averaging, and trading 
program for heavy-duty on-highway engines (55 FR 30584, July 26, 
1990). EPA is proposing to apply this requirement to engine 
manufacturers, rather than equipment manufacturers, because the 
equipment manufacturers cannot control the emissions level of 
their equipment without the cooperation of the engine 
manufacturers. 

EPA is also considering a more flexible sales requirement to 
ensure that natural economic fluctuations do not affect 
compliance. Such a program would require that in the first year 
of the program manufacturers sell at least eighty percent of the 
number of engines they sold in the previous year. In the 
following several years the sales requirement could be reduced to 
seventy, sixty and fifty percent of the sales in the 1998 model 
year. Finally, once the transition to FIP engines was complete 
and market fluctuations were unlikely, the sales requirement 
could be dropped entirely. 

Either form of the option would diminish somewhat the 
importance of the requirements for registration, fleet average 
determination, stickers and other enforcement programs directed 
towards the equipment user. Presumably, if manufacturers are 
selling the new equipment at historical rates, it is getting used 
and is replacing the old equipment at historical rates. EPA 
would consider, therefore, if it adopted a strict sales 
requirement, dropping the fleet average program and sticker 
enforcement. The Agency almost certainly would need to maintain 
a nonroad registration program as a check on the efficacy of the 
sales requirement. If the requirements proved to be ineffective 
in maintaining historical turnover, then EPA would have to 
implement a fleet average requirement in order to ensure the 
attainment targets were met. 

While EPA acknowledges that sales requirements can force 
manufacturers to offer discounts and otherwise subsidize their 
engines, they are in a better position to accommodate the impacts 
of the program than fleets or dealers. Manufacturers sell 
throughout the nation and can recover costs by spreading small 
cost increases across a larger market than can fleets or 
dealers. On the other hand, lack of business in one area for a 
few years could put many dealers, which operate in much smaller 
areas, out of business. It is important to note that so long as 
the turnover rates stay at historical levels through the 
implementation of the FIP, both programs would be transparent to 
the regulated parties.

Capture System Efficiency Test Protocols. 
(A) Applicability. 

The requirements of paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(B) of this section shall apply to all VOC emitting processes employing
a capture system except those cases noted below. 
(

1

) If a source installs a permanent total enclosure (PTE) that meets U.S.EPA specifications, and which directs all
VOC to a control device, then the source is exempted from the requirements described in paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(B)
of this section. The U.S.EPA specifications to determine whether a structure is considered a PTE are given in Procedure
T of appendix B of 40 CFR 52.742. In this instance, the capture efficiency is assumed to be 100 percent and the source
is still required to measure control efficiency using appropriate test methods as specified in paragraph (a)(4)(iv)
of this section. 
(

2

) If a source uses a control device designed to collect and recover VOC (e.g., carbon adsorber), an explicit measurement
of capture efficiency is not necessary provided that the conditions given below are met. The overall control of the
system can be determined by directly comparing the input liquid VOC to the recovered liquid VOC. The general procedure
for use in this situation is given in  60.433 of this chapter, with the following additional restrictions: 
(

i

) The source must be able to equate solvent usage with solvent recovery on a 24-hour (daily) basis, rather than a 30-day
weighted average, within 72 hours following the 24-hour period. In addition, one of the following two criteria must
be met: 
(

ii

) The solvent recovery system (i.e., capture and control system) must be dedicated to a single process, or 
(

iii

) If the solvent recovery system controls multiple processes, then the source must be able to demonstrate that the
overall control (i.e., the total recovered solvent VOC divided by the sum of liquid VOC input to all processes venting
to the control system) meets or exceeds the most stringent standard applicable for any process venting to the control
system. 
(

3

) The following facilities are exempted from the requirements described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(B) of this section:

(

i

) Automobile-related assembly facilities subject to the ``Automobile or Light-Duty Truck Test Protocol'' described
in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section. 
(

ii

) Heatset-web-offset lithographic printing units as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section. 
(B) 

Specific Requirements. 

The capture efficiency of a process shall be measured using one of the four protocols given below. Any error margin
associated with a test protocol may not be incorporated into the results of a capture efficiency test. If these techniques
are not suitable for a particular process, then the source must present an alternative capture efficiency protocol
and obtain approval for it by the Administrator as a SIP or FIP revision. 
(

1

) Gas/gas method using temporary total enclosure (TTE). The U.S. EPA specifications to determine whether a temporary
enclosure is considered a TTE are given in Procedure T of appendix B of 40 CFR 52.741. The capture efficiency equation
to be used for this protocol is:

of a federally enforceable permit which restricted operating times during the two-year period, 




(2) 

The average number of days that the emissions source was operated or used over the two-year period if documentation
is available to support the number, or

 If a source installs a permanent total enclosure (PTE) that meets U.S.EPA specifications, and which directs all VOC
to a control device, then the source is exempted from the requirements described in paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(B) of this
section. The U.S.EPA specifications to determine whether a structure is considered a PTE are given in Procedure T
of appendix B of 40 CFR 52.742. In this instance, the capture efficiency is assumed to be 100 percent and the source is
still required to measure control efficiency using appropriate test methods as specified in paragraph (a)(4)(iv)
of this section. 



(2)

 If a source uses a control device designed to collect and recover VOC (e.g., carbon adsorber), an explicit measurement
of capture efficiency is not necessary provided that the conditions given below are met. The overall control of the
system can be determined by directly comparing the input liquid VOC to the recovered liquid VOC. The general procedure
for use in this situation is given in  60.433 of this chapter, with the following additional restrictions: 



(i)

 The source must be able to equate solvent usage with solvent recovery on a 24-hour (daily) basis, rather than a 30-day
weighted average, within 72 hours following the 24-hour period. In addition, one of the following two criteria must
be met: 



(ii)

 The solvent recovery system (i.e., capture and control system) must be dedicated to a single process, or 



(iii)

 If the solvent recovery system controls multiple processes, then the source must be able to demonstrate that the overall
control (i.e., the total recovered solvent VOC divided by the sum of liquid VOC input to all processes venting to the
control system) meets or exceeds the most stringent standard applicable for any process venting to the control system.




(3)

 The following facilities are exempted from the requirements described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(B) of this section:




(i)

 Automobile-related assembly facilities subject to the ``Automobile or Light-Duty Truck Test Protocol'' described
in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section. 



(ii)

 Heatset-web-offset lithographic printing units as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section.

(A) 

Applicability.

 The requirements of paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(B) of this section shall apply to all VOC emitting processes employing
a capture system except those cases noted below. 


(1)

 If a source installs a permanent total enclosure (PTE) that meets USEPA specifications, and which directs all VOC
to a control device, then the source is exempted from the requirements described in paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(B) of this
section. The USEPA specifications to determine whether a structure is considered a PTE are given in Procedure T of
appendix B of 40 CFR 52.742. In this instance, the capture efficiency is assumed to be 100 percent and the source is still
required to measure control efficiency using appropriate test methods as specified in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this
section. 


(2)

 If a source uses a control device designed to collect and recover VOC (e.g., carbon adsorber), an explicit measurement
of capture efficiency is not necessary provided that the conditions given below are met. The overall control of the
system can be determined by directly comparing the input liquid VOC to the recovered liquid VOC. The general procedure
for use in this situation is given in  60.433 of this chapter, with the following additional restrictions: 


(i)

 The source must be able to equate solvent usage with solvent recovery on a 24-hour (daily) basis, rather than a 30-day
weighted average, within 72 hours following the 24-hour period. In addition, one of the following two criteria must
be met: 


(ii)

 The solvent recovery system (i.e., capture and control system) must be dedicated to a single process, or 


(iii)

 If the solvent recovery system controls multiple processes, then the source must be able to demonstrate that the overall
control (i.e., the total recovered solvent VOC divided by the sum of liquid VOC input to all processes venting to the
control system) meets or exceeds the most stringent standard applicable for any process venting to the control system.



(3)

 The following facilities are exempted from the requirements described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(B) of this section:



(i)

 Automobile-related assembly facilities subject to the ``Automobile or Light-Duty Truck Test Protocol'' described
in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section. 


(ii)

 Heatset-web-offset lithographic printing units as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section. 
(B) 

Specific Requirements.

 The capture efficiency of a process shall be measured using one of the four protocols given below. Any error margin
associated with a test protocol may not be incorporated into the results of a capture efficiency test. If these techniques
are not suitable for a particular process, then the source must present an alternative capture efficiency protocol
and obtain approval for it by the Administrator as a SIP or FIP revision. 


(1)

 Gas/gas method using temporary total enclosure (TTE). The USEPA specifications to determine whether a temporary
enclosure is considered a TTE are given in Procedure T of appendix B of 40 CFR 52.741. The capture efficiency equation
to be used for this protocol is:

enclosure and in which ``F'' and ``G'' are measured while operating only the affected facility. All fans and blowers
in the building or room must be operated as they would under normal production. The capture efficiency equation to
be used for this protocol is:

inventory data submitted by the State for the control area on November 15, 1992 or were not submitted, baseline emissions
shall be based on the average daily emissions value calculated for the two-year period. The average daily emissions
value shall be calculated by dividing emissions for the two-year period by the operating or usage time for the two-year
period. If emissions data are not available, emissions associated with fuel usage may be estimated from purchase
records. The operating or usage time for the two-year period shall be based on one of the criteria specified as follows:



(1) 

The number of days specified in a federally enforceable permit if the emissions source operated under the conditions
of a federally enforceable permit which restricted operating times during the two-year period, 


(2) 

The average number of days that the emissions source was operated or used over the two-year period if documentation

(iii) 

Implementation Year Monthly Baseline Emissions. 

Baseline emissions as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section shall be adjusted prior to the implementation
year (2001) of the FIP cap program in the control area as follows: 
(A) The reductions that are projected to occur as a result of both SIP and FIP measures between 1990 and 2001 shall be
subtracted from the baseline emissions. This value shall be defined as the reduced daily baseline emissions and is
denoted in pounds of NO

X

/day. 
(B) The reduced daily baseline emissions shall be annualized by multiplying the daily value by 365. This value shall
be defined as the reduced annual baseline emissions and is denoted in pounds of NO

X

/year. 
(C) The reduced annual baseline emissions shall be converted into a monthly value by dividing by 12. This value shall
be defined as the implementation year monthly baseline.

(i) The Administrator shall exempt a consumer product from the requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section
if a manufacturer demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that, due to some characteristic of the product formulation,
design, delivery systems or other factors, the use of the product will result in less VOC emissions as compared to:


(A) The VOC emissions from a representative consumer product which complies with the VOC standards specified in paragraph
(a)(3)(i) of this section, or 

(B) The calculated VOC emissions from a noncomplying representative product, if the product had been reformulated
to comply with the VOC standards specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section. VOC emissions shall be calculated
using the following equation: 




E

R

 = E

NC

  x  VOC

STD

 
 VOC

NC






Where: 



E

R

=the VOC emissions from the noncomplying representative product, had it been reformulated. 

E

NC

=the VOC emissions from the noncomplying representative product in its current formulation. 

VOC

STD

=the VOC standard specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section. 

VOC

NC

=the VOC content of the noncomplying product in its 
current formulation. 




If a manufacturer demonstrates that this equation yields inaccurate results due to some characteristic of the product
formulation or other factors, an alternative method which accurately calculates emissions may be used upon approval
of the Administrator. 



(ii) For the purposes of this section, representative consumer product means a consumer product which meets all of
the following criteria: 

(A) The representative product shall be subject to the same VOC limit in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section as the
innovative product. 

(B) The representative product shall be of the same product form as the innovative product, unless the innovative
product uses a new form which does not exist in the product category at the time the application is made. 

(C) The representative product shall have at least similar efficacy as other consumer products in the same product
category based on tests generally accepted for that product category by the consumer products industry. 

(iii) A manufacturer shall apply in writing to the Administrator for any exemption claimed under paragraph (a)(5)(i)
of this section. The application shall include the supporting documentation that demonstrates the emissions from
the innovative product, including the actual physical test methods used to generate the data and, if necessary, the
consumer testing undertaken to document product usage. In addition, the applicant must provide any information
necessary to enable the Administrator to establish enforceable conditions for granting the exemption including
the VOC content for the innovative product and test methods for determining the VOC content. 

(iv) Within 30 days of receipt of the exemption application the Administrator shall determine whether an application
is complete. 

(v) Within 90 days after an application has been deemed complete, the Administrator shall determine whether, under
what conditions, and to what extent, an exemption from the requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section will
be permitted. The applicant and the Administrator may mutually agree to a longer time period for reaching a decision,
and additional supporting documentation may be submitted by the applicant before a decision has been reached. The
Administrator shall notify the applicant of the decision in writing and specify such terms and conditions that are
necessary to insure that emissions from the product will meet the emissions reductions specified in paragraph (a)(5)(i)
of this section, and that such emissions reductions can be enforced. 

(vi) In granting an exemption for a product the Administrator shall establish conditions that are enforceable. These
conditions shall include the VOC content of the innovative product, dispensing rates, application rates and any
other parameters determined by the Administrator to be necessary. The Administrator shall also specify the test
methods for determining conformance to the conditions established. The test methods shall include criteria for
reproducibility, accuracy, sampling and laboratory procedures. 

(vii) For any product for which an exemption has been granted pursuant to this section, the manufacturer shall notify
the Administrator in writing within 30 days of any change in the product formulation or recommended product usage
directions, and shall also notify the Administrator within 30 days if the manufacturer learns of any information
which would alter the emissions estimates submitted to the Administrator in support of the exemption application.


(viii) If VOC standards are lowered for a product category through any subsequent rulemaking, all innovative product
exemptions granted for products in the product category, except as provided in this paragraph, shall have no force
and effect as of the effective date of the modified VOC standard. This paragraph shall not apply to those innovative
products which have VOC emissions less than the appropriate lowered VOC standard and for which a written notification
of the product's emissions status versus the lowered VOC standard has been submitted to and approved by the Administrator
at least 60 days before the effective date of such standard. 

(ix) If the Administrator believes that a consumer product for which an exemption has been granted no longer meets
the criteria for an innovative product specified in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, the Administrator may modify
or revoke the exemption as necessary to assure that the product will meet these criteria.

(c) 

Specific provisions. (1) Required submission of data. 

(i) By June 1, 1996 or 120 (one hundred and twenty) days after the effective date of this section, whichever is later,
all persons who produce agricultural and/or structural pesticides that are registered in California must submit
reports in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section that identify the VOC content of each pesticide. The VOC content

pesticide. 

(2) Establish VOC limit. 

Upon compilation of the data received pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, EPA will determine a pesticide
VOC limit based on the following criteria: 

(i) EPA will establish a base-year inventory for each registered pesticide. This inventory will be based on the amount
of each pesticide used in the affected area. These amounts will be based on data from the 1990 pesticide use report (PUR)
and the inerts database, which are both maintained by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR), unless
EPA determines that another year or years of PUR data or other information provides a more appropriate basis for the

<DOCNO> FR940505-1-00360 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 




(iii) EPA will multiply the VOC contents (as determined by paragraph (c)(1) of this section) by the inventory (as determined
in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section) to determine ``individual base-year VOC emissions'' for each individual
pesticide. 

(iv) EPA will add the individual base-year VOC emissions for all pesticides to determine the ``total base-year VOC
emissions'' from all pesticides combined. 

(v) Starting with the pesticide or pesticides ranked ``1'' according to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, EPA
will add the individual base-year VOC emissions for pesticides ranked 2, 3, 4 * * * etc, until the sum
equals forty to seventy percent (40%-70%)
 of the total base-year VOC emissions. The VOC content of the last pesticide needed to achieve 40%-70% of the total
base-year VOC emissions becomes the ``VOC limit.'' 





(vi) EPA will promulgate the VOC limit with a summary of the assumptions and results from paragraphs (c)(2) (i) through
(v) of this section. 

(3) 

Restrictions on pesticides. 

(i) On and after 1 (one) year after EPA publishes the VOC limit, all persons are prohibited from distribution within
the affected area of pesticides with VOC contents in excess of the VOC limit. 

(ii) On and after 2 (two) years after EPA publishes the VOC limit, all persons are prohibited from application and/or
storage within the affected area of pesticides with VOC contents in excess of the VOC limit. 

(4) Revisions to the VOC limit. 

(i) EPA may, at any time, require producer(s) to reanalyze their pesticides according to the methodology described
in paragraph (f) of this section and to submit the new data according to paragraph (d) of this section. 

(ii) EPA may, at any time, revise the VOC limit consistent with the methodology described in paragraph (c)(2) of this
section and based on information submitted pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section or elsewhere.

(D) The owner shall monitor the total gas collection flowrate for the landfill at least once every 15 minutes and keep
records at least once per hour. A chart recorder may be used for this purpose. 

(E) Within two weeks after the end of each quarter the owner shall determine the overall effectiveness of the gas collection
system for the past quarter. To make such a determination, the owner shall meet the following requirements. 

(

1

) The owner shall establish a quarterly target for the volume of landfill gas to be collected. The target volume shall
be the time-weighted average of all baseline collection flowrates (SCFM) established pursuant to paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)
of this section during the quarter, multiplied by the number of minutes in the quarter. The volume is calculated as
follows: 

Quarterly target volume=




 





or simply,




 





(

2

) Each hourly flowrate record during which the measured oxygen concentration (established in paragraph (g)(3)(i)(C)
of this section) exceeds the current baseline oxygen concentration (established in paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)(

2

) of this section) by a measured value greater than 2% oxygen, shall be corrected using the following equation: 






 






(

3

) The owner shall use this corrected flowrate data to calculate the total volume of gas collected for the quarter. 

(F) If the volume of gas collected in any quarter is less than 90% of the target volume established for that quarter,
the owner shall be in violation of this section and shall re-establish baseline conditions pursuant to paragraph
(g)(3)(i)(B) of this section within the first two weeks of the following quarter. 

(G) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (g)(3)(i)(F) of this section, the owner of any active landfill
shall re-establish baseline conditions pursuant to paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B) of this section at least once every six
months. 

(H) The owner shall install and operate a gas collection system that effectively captures the gas that is generated
within the landfill. The collection system shall: 

(

1

) Be designed to handle the maximum expected gas flowrate over the lifetime of the gas control or treatment system equipment

(

2

) Collect gas from each area, cell, or group of cells in the landfill in which refuse has been placed for a period of two
years or more. For the purposes of calculating the area of influence of the gas collection system to determine compliance,
the owner shall use the EPA method.






(

3

) Collect gas at a sufficient extraction rate. For the purpose of demonstrating whether the gas collection system
flowrate is sufficient to determine compliance, the owner shall measure gauge pressure in the gas collection header.
If a positive pressure exists, the gas collection system flowrate shall be increased until a negative pressure is
measured. If the gauge pressure at a wellhead is positive, the valve shall be opened to restore negative pressure.
If negative pressure cannot be achieved, an additional well shall be added. 

(I) The owner shall: 

(

1

) Maintain, monitor, operate, and improve as necessary 
the gas collection system and landfill cover to prevent 
leaks from: 

(

i

) All locations on the surface of the landfill 
covered by final cover; 

(

ii

) All locations on the surface of the landfill which have been covered by intermediate cover for over six months; and


(

iii

) All locations along the gas transfer path of the gas collection system. 




When a leak is identified, it shall be conspicuously tagged with a marker which displays the date of identification.
The marker shall not be removed until the leak is repaired. (Markers placed by EPA personnel may be removed only by EPA
personnel, except as necessary during the repair of leaks.) Within 15 calendar days of identification, each leak
shall be repaired to a leak-free state unless such repair requires excavation. Where repair requires excavation,
the owner shall submit an excavation plan for approval by EPA which shows that repairs will be made promptly and which
specifies the expected date of completion. The owner is in violation of this section if the leak is not repaired within
15 calendar days of identification, or if an excavation plan is not submitted to EPA within 15 calendar days after the
date of identification. 



(

2

) Repair leaks to a leak-free state using at least one 
of the following methods: 

(

i

) Increasing the collection rate of existing wells. 
(

ii

) Repairing the landfill cover. 
(

iii

) Installing additional collection wells. 
(

iv

) Repairing the gas transfer path. 

(J) Whenever previously buried waste is brought to the surface during installation or preparation of wells, trenches,
piping, or other equipment, or when solid waste is to be excavated and moved, the owner shall cover the excavated waste
using fresh soil, plastic sheeting, vapor retarding foam, or other California Integrated Waste Management Board
approved ``Alternate Daily Cover,'' by the end of the working day or as necessary to prevent a public nuisance. 

(ii) 

Control equipment. 

All landfill gases collected pursuant to this section shall be processed using control devices that meet the following
requirements: 

(A) All control devices shall meet either of the following requirements: 

(

1

) Have a non-methane organic compound (NMOC) destruction/treatment efficiency of at least 98% by weight; or 

(

2

) Reduce the NMOC concentration at the outlet of the 
control device to 30 ppm measured as methane and corrected 
to 3% oxygen. 

(B) Open flares used as control devices shall be designed and operated in accordance with  60.18. 

(C) The owner shall demonstrate that each control device meets the requirements of this section using the source testing
procedures in paragraphs (g)(6) (iv) and (vi) of this section. Source testing shall be performed when the device begins
operation. Flares shall be source tested to demonstrate continuing compliance every two years thereafter. All other
control devices shall be source tested annually to demonstrate continuing compliance. 

(iii)

(5) 

Reporting and Recordkeeping. 

The following reporting 
requirements shall each apply independently: 
(i) Each owner of an MSW landfill having a maximum design 
capacity greater than 100,000 megagrams (Mg) (111,000 tons) shall 
submit an initial design capacity report to EPA. 
(A) The initial design capacity report shall contain the 
following information: 
(

1

) A map or plot of the landfill, providing the size 
and location of the landfill, and identifying all areas 
where refuse may be landfilled according to the provisions 
of the state or county permit; 
(

2

) The maximum design capacity of the landfill. Where 
the maximum design capacity is specified in the state or 
county construction or Resource Conservation and Recovery 
Act (RCRA) permit, a copy of the permit specifying the 
maximum design capacity may be submitted. If the maximum 
design capacity of the landfill is not specified in the 
permit, the maximum design capacity must be calculated using 
good engineering principles. The calculations must be 
provided, along with such parameters as depth of refuse, 
refuse acceptance rate, and compaction practices. The 
state, county, or EPA may request other reasonable 
information as may be necessary to verify the maximum design 
capacity of the landfill. 
(B) An amended design capacity report must be submitted to 
EPA providing notification of any increase in the size of the 
landfill, whether the increase results from an increase in the 
permitted area or depth of the landfill, a change in the 
operating procedures, or any other means which results in an 
increase in the maximum design capacity of the landfill. The 
amended design capacity report must be submitted within 90 days 
of the issuance of an amended construction or operating permit, 
or the actual use of additional land, or the change in operating 
procedures which will result in an increase in maximum design 
capacity, whichever comes first. 
(ii) Each owner who installs a gas collection system and/or 
control system described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, 
shall perform an initial performance test as described in  60.8. 
The initial performance test report shall include, but not be 
limited to, the following: 
(A) A diagram of the collection system showing vertical 
extraction well spacing, including the locations of any areas 
excluded from collection and the proposed sites for the future 
addition of wells; 
(B) The documentation of the presence of asbestos for each 
area from which collection wells have been excluded based on the 
presence of asbestos; 
(C) The sum of the gas generation rates for all areas from 
which collection wells have been excluded based on the presence 
of nondegradable materials and the calculations of the gas 
generation rate for each excluded area; and 
(D) The provisions for increasing gas mover capacity with 
increased gas generation rate, if the present gas mover is 
inadequate to move the maximum flowrate expected over the life of 
the landfill. 
(iii) Each owner of a controlled landfill shall, within 48 
hours, report to EPA by telephone any malfunction, shutdown, or 
other event causing a reduction in the gas collection rate. 
(iv) If any portion of the gas collection system is shut 
down which results in a gas collection flowrate of less than 80% 
of the target volume for longer than 24 hours due to scheduled or 
unscheduled maintenance activities, equipment breakdown, or any 
other reason, the owner shall notify EPA by telephone within 48 
hours of the detection of such shutdown. A written follow-up 
report shall be forwarded to EPA within 15 calendar days 
describing the duration and reason for the shut down. 
(v) Each owner of a controlled landfill shall submit a 
closure report to EPA. For the purposes of this section, closure 
means that refuse is no longer being placed in the landfill, and 
that no additional wastes will be placed into the landfill 
without filing a notification of modification. EPA may request 
such additional information as may be reasonably necessary to 
verify that permanent closure has taken place. 
(vi) Each owner of a controlled landfill shall submit an 
equipment removal report to EPA prior to removal or cessation of 
operation of the control equipment. 
(A) The equipment removal report shall contain the 
following items:

demonstrating that the 15-year minimum control period has 
expired; and 
(

3

) Dated copies of the three successive NMOC emission 
rate reports demonstrating that the landfill is no longer 
emitting above the level of the standard. 
(B) EPA may request such additional information as may be 
reasonably necessary to verify that all of the conditions for 
removal have been met. 
(vii) The following records shall be maintained in written 
form at the MSW landfill for a period of five years from the date 
of each entry and shall be made available to EPA upon request: 
(A) Records of the gas collection flowrate, in SCFM, and 
the oxygen concentration, for each time that baseline conditions 
are established. 
(B) Records of continuous measurements (at least hourly 
records or a chart record) of the total gas collection flowrate, 
in SCFM, including notes describing the reasons for down-time.

Test Methods. 

(i) The following procedures shall be used to establish baseline conditions pursuant to paragraph (g)(3)(i)(B)
of this section: 

(A) The gas collection rate and landfill surface integrity shall be evaluated and brought to baseline conditions
by testing for leaks and repairing all such leaks using the repair methods listed in paragraph (g)(3)(i)(H)(1

) of this section. Surface leak testing shall be performed using an instrument which meets the apparatus specifications
of EPA Method 21 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A). The instrument shall be calibrated before and after each test using zero
air and an approximate 500 ppm methane standard calibration gas in accordance with the instrument manufacturer's
recommendations. 

(B) Surface leak testing shall be performed by holding the detector probe 2 inches from the landfill surface while
walking a pattern of parallel paths not more than 50 feet apart over all surface areas specified in paragraph (g)(3)(i)(H)(

1

) of this section. Cracks, holes, and other breaches in the surface as well as areas where buried waste interfaces with
undisturbed, native soil shall also be evaluated. The owner is not required to monitor surfaces on steep slopes and
other areas posing a hazard to testing personnel; however, leaks identified in such areas are not exempt from the provisions
of paragraph (g)(3)(i)(H) of this section. 

(C) Surface leak testing shall be performed only when the average wind speed is less than 5 miles per hour and instantaneous
wind speed is less than 10 miles per hour, unless EPA approves alternate wind speed limits based on demonstrated recurrent
site-specific conditions. Average wind speed shall be determined on a 10 minute average using an on-site anemometer
with a continuous recorder. Surface testing shall not be conducted when the surface is wet or when there has been rain
during the preceding 72 hours. Surface testing of landfill surfaces that are normally wet (i.e., a golf course) may
be performed when the surface is wet. EPA personnel may randomly identify leaks without regard to the above wind speed
and surface condition requirements. 

(D) EPA Method 21 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) shall be used to determine leaks along the gas transfer path. 

(ii) EPA Method 2D (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) shall be used for the flowrate measurements required by paragraphs (g)(3)(i)(B)(

1

) and (g)(3)(i)(D) of this section. 

(iii) EPA Method 3A (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) shall be used for the oxygen concentration measurements required by
paragraphs (g)(3)(i)(B)(

2

) and (g)(3)(i)(C) of this section. 

(iv) The non-methane organic compound destruction/treatment efficiency of a control device shall be determined
using the following equation: 








where: 

NMOC

out

 = the measured concentration as methane of non-methane organic compounds in the exhaust, and 

NMOC

in

For the purposes of paragraph (u)(1) through (u)(7) of this section, the following definitions shall apply. All terms
not defined herein shall have the meaning given them in  52.2950.



Annual heat input

 means the actual amount of heat released by fuels burned in a unit during a 12 calendar month rolling period, based on
the fuel's higher heating value. The annual heat input shall be calculated as the sum of the previous 12 monthly fuel
use rates multiplied by the fuel's higher heating value.



Boiler or steam generator 

means any combustion equipment used in any institutional, commercial, or industrial operation that is designed
to burn gaseous and/or liquid fuel and used to produce steam, heat water and/or other fluids, and/or generate electricity.
A boiler or steam generator does not include any waste heat recovery unit that is used to recover sensible heat from
the exhaust of a combustion turbine or any unfired waste heat recovery boiler that is used to recover sensible heat
from the exhaust of any combustion equipment.



British thermal unit (Btu)

 means the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water from 59
 F to 60
 F at one atmosphere.



Heat input

 means the chemical heat released due to fuel combustion in a unit, using the higher heating value of the fuel. This does
not include the sensible heat of incoming combustion air.



Higher heating value (HHV)

 means the total heat liberated per mass of fuel burned (Btu per pound), when fuel and dry air at standard conditions
undergo complete combustion and all resultant products are brought to their standard states at standard conditions.
If certification of the HHV is not provided by the third party fuel supplier, it shall be determined by one of the following
test methods: ASTM D2015-85 for solid fuels; ASTM D240-87 or ASTM D2382-88 for liquid hydrocarbon
fuels; or ASTM D1826-88 or ASTM D1945-81 in conjunction with ASTM D3588-89 for gaseous fuels.



Non-gaseous fuel

 means any fuel which is not a gas at 68 
 F and one atmosphere.



NO

X



 emissions

 means the sum of nitric oxides and nitrogen dioxide in the flue gas, collectively expressed as nitrogen dioxide.



Process heater

 means any combustion equipment used in any institutional, commercial, or industrial operation that is designed
to burn gaseous and/or liquid fuel and which transfers heat from combustion gases to water, heat transfer medium,
or process streams. Process heater does not include any kiln or oven used for drying, baking, cooking, calcining or
vitrifying; any unfired waste heat recovery heater that is used to recover sensible heat from the exhaust of any combustion
equipment; or any fuel-fired degreasing or metal finishing equipment.



Rated heat input capacity

or modified such that its maximum heat input is different than the heat input capacity specified on the nameplate,
the new maximum heat input shall be considered as the rated heat input capacity. 



Shutdown 

means the period of time a unit is cooled from its normal operating temperature to cold or ambient temperature.



Stack gas oxygen trim system 

means the system of monitors that is used to measure stack excess combustion air, typically consisting of flue gas
oxygen and/or carbon monoxide monitors that automatically provide a feedback signal to the combustion air controller
that maintains the stack excess air at the desired level.



Startup 

means the period of time a unit is heated from cold or ambient temperature to its normal operating temperature as specified
by the manufacturer.



Unit 

means any boiler, steam generator, or process heater as defined in this definition.

(ii) Any owner or operator that chooses to comply with the 
requirements of paragraph (u)(3)(ii) of this section by the 
compliance method specified in paragraph (u)(3)(ii)(A) of this 
section shall tune the unit using the equipment tuning procedure 
specified in this paragraph.
 Nothing in the equipment tuning 
procedure shall be construed to require any act or omission that 
would result in unsafe conditions or would be in violation of any 
regulation or requirement established by Factory Mutual, 
Industrial Risk Insurers, National Fire Prevention Association, 
California Department of Industrial Relations (Occupational 
Safety and Health Division), Federal Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration, or other relevant regulations and 
requirements. 





(A) 

Step 1. 

Operate the unit at the firing rate most 
typical of normal operation. If the unit experiences significant 
load variations during normal operation, operate it at its 
average firing rate. 

(B) 

Step 2. 

At this firing rate, record stack gas 
temperature, oxygen concentration, and CO concentration (for 
gaseous fuels) or smoke-spot
 number (for liquid fuels), and 
observe flame conditions after unit operation stabilizes at the 
firing rate selected. If the excess oxygen in the stack gas is 
at the lower end of the range of typical minimum values,
 and 
if the CO emissions are low and there is no smoke, the unit is 
probably operating at near optimum efficiency at this particular 
firing rate. However, complete the remaining portion of this 
procedure to determine whether still lower oxygen levels are 
practical. 






(C) 

Step 3.

 Increase combustion air flow to the furnace 
until stack gas oxygen levels increase by 1 to 2 percent over the 
level measured in Step 2. As in Step 2, record the stack gas 
temperature, CO concentration (for gaseous fuels) or smoke-spot 
number (for liquid fuels), and observe flame conditions for these 
higher oxygen levels after boiler operation stabilizes. 

(D) 

Step 4. 

Decrease combustion air flow until the stack 
gas oxygen concentration is at the level measured in Step 2. 
From this level gradually reduce the combustion air flow, in 
small increments. After each increment, record the stack gas 
temperature, oxygen concentration, CO concentration (for gaseous 
fuels) and smoke-spot number (for liquid fuels). Also, observe 
the flame and record any changes in its condition. 

(E) 

Step 5. 

Continue to reduce combustion air flow 
stepwise, until one of these limits is reached: 

(

1

) Unacceptable flame conditions_such as flame impingement on furnace walls or burner parts, excessive flame 
carryover, or flame instability. 

(

2

) Stack gas CO concentrations greater than 400 ppm. 
(

3

) Smoking at the stack. 
(

4

) Equipment-related limitations_such as low windbox/furnace pressure differential, built in air-flow limits,
etc. 

(F) 

Step 6. 

Develop an O

2

/CO curve (for gaseous fuels) or 
O

2

/smoke curve (for liquid fuels) similar to those shown in 
Figures 1 and 2 using the excess oxygen and CO or smoke-spot 
number data obtained at each combustion air flow setting. 

 (G) 

Step 7. 

From the curves prepared in Step 6, find the 
stack gas oxygen levels where the CO emissions or smoke-spot 
number equal the following values: 






The above conditions are referred to as CO or smoke threshold, or as the minimum excess oxygen level. Compare this minimum
value of excess oxygen to the expected value provided by the combustion unit manufacturer. If the minimum level found
is substantially higher than the value provided by the combustion unit manufacturer, burner adjustments can probably
be made to improve fuel and air mixing, thereby allowing operation with less air. 

(H) 

Step 8. 

Add 0.5 to 2.0 percent to the minimum excess 
oxygen level found in Step 7 and reset burner controls to operate 
automatically at this higher stack gas oxygen level. This margin 
above the minimum oxygen level accounts for fuel variations, 
variations in atmospheric conditions, load changes, and 
nonrepeatability or play in automatic controls. 

(I) 

Step 9. 

If the load of the combustion unit varies 
significantly during normal operation, repeat Steps 1-8 for 
firing rates that represent the upper and lower limits of the 
range of the load. Because control adjustments at one firing 
rate may affect conditions at other firing rates, it may not be 
possible to establish the optimum excess oxygen level at all 
firing rates. If this is the case, choose the burner control 
settings that give best performance over the range of firing 
rates. If one firing rate predominates, settings should optimize 
conditions at that rate. 

(J) 

Step 10. 

Verify that the new settings can accommodate 
the sudden load changes that may occur in daily operation without 
adverse effects. Do this by increasing and decreasing load 
rapidly while observing the flame and stack. If any of the 
conditions in Step 5 result, reset the combustion controls to 
provide a slightly higher level of excess oxygen at the affected 
firing rates. Next, verify these new settings in a similar 
fashion. Then make sure that the final control settings are 
recorded at steady-state operating conditions.

Annual heat input

 means the actual amount of heat released 
by fuels burned in a unit during a 12 calendar month rolling 
period, based on the fuel's higher heating value. The annual 
heat input shall be calculated as the sum of the previous 12 
monthly fuel use rates multiplied by the fuel's higher heating 
value. 
 

Boiler or steam generator

 means any combustion equipment 
used in any institutional, commercial, or industrial operation 
that is designed to burn gaseous and/or liquid fuel and used to 
produce steam, heat water and/or other fluids, and/or generate 
electricity. A boiler or steam generator does not include any 
waste heat recovery unit that is used to recover sensible heat 
from the exhaust of a combustion turbine or any unfired waste 
heat recovery boiler that is used to recover sensible heat from 
the exhaust of any combustion equipment. 
 

British thermal unit (Btu)

 means the amount of heat required 
to raise the temperature of one pound of water from 59
 F to 60
 F 
at one atmosphere. 
 

Heat input

 means the chemical heat released due to fuel 
combustion in a unit, using the higher heating value of the fuel. 
This does not include the sensible heat of incoming combustion 
air. 
 

Higher heating value (HHV)

 means the total heat liberated 
per mass of fuel burned (Btu per pound), when fuel and dry air at 
standard conditions undergo complete combustion and all resultant 
products are brought to their standard states at standard 
conditions. If certification of the HHV is not provided by the 
third party fuel supplier, it shall be determined by one of the 
following test methods: ASTM D2015-85 for solid fuels; ASTM 
D240-87 or ASTM D2382-88 for liquid hydrocarbon fuels; or ASTM 
D1826-88 or ASTM D1945-81 in conjunction with ASTM D3588-89 for 
gaseous fuels. 
 

Non-gaseous

 fuel means any fuel which is not a gas at 68 
 F 
and one atmosphere. 
 

NO

X

 emissions means the sum of nitric oxides and nitrogen dioxide in the flue gas, collectively expressed as nitrogen

dioxide. 
 

Process heater

 means any combustion equipment used in any 
institutional, commercial, or industrial operation that is 
designed to burn gaseous and/or liquid fuel and which transfers 
heat from combustion gases to water, heat transfer medium, or 
process streams. Process heater does not include any kiln or 
oven used for drying, baking, cooking, calcining or vitrifying; 
any unfired waste heat recovery heater that is used to recover 
sensible heat from the exhaust of any combustion equipment; or 
any fuel-fired degreasing or metal finishing equipment. 
 

Rated heat input capacity

 means the heat input capacity 
specified on the nameplate of the combustion unit. If the 
combustion unit has been altered or modified such that its 
maximum heat input is different than the heat input capacity 
specified on the nameplate, the new maximum heat input shall be 
considered as the rated heat input capacity. This alteration or 
modification can be through either burner alteration or 
modification or installation of a fixed orifice. The new maximum 
heat input must be certified, in writing, by the manufacturer or 
installer and engineering calculations supporting the new maximum 
heat input rating must be submitted to the Administrator.

Test methods.
(i) Any owner or operator of a unit that is required to perform a compliance test to demonstrate compliance with the
standards specified in paragraph (v)(3)(i) of this section, or chooses to perform a compliance test to demonstrate
compliance with the requirements of paragraph (v)(3)(ii) of this section, shall comply with the requirements of
 60.8 (c), (d), and (e). The test shall be performed and data reduced and reported as follows:
(A) Each emission test shall be conducted while the unit is operated at maximum capacity and operating under representative
operating conditions.
(B) Each emission test shall be conducted in accordance with the appropriate test methods in 40 CFR part 60, appendix
A. Except for the modifications in this paragraph and unless otherwise approved by the Administrator: NO

X

 shall be measured in accordance with 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 7E; CO shall be measured in accordance with 40
CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 10; and the diluent shall be measured using 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 3A. Testing
shall be conducted for four 15 minute testing periods. Compliance shall be evaluated for each 15 minute period. Data
recorded during testing to determine the 15 minute average shall either be continuously integrated by the testing
instrument and data recorder, or recorded manually at 30 second intervals during each 15 minute test period. Zero
and calibration checks shall be conducted after each 15 minute test period.
(C) The ppm CO emission limit required by paragraph (v)(3)(i)(B) of this section shall be established during the initial
compliance test for NO

X

 emissions to establish a ppm CO emission limit that represents good operating and combustion practices for fuel(s)
burned in the unit. The CO emission limit established for determining subsequent compliance shall be documented
in the applicable certification report required under paragraph (v)(6)(i)(C) of this section.
(ii) Any owner or operator that chooses to comply with the requirements of paragraph (v)(3)(ii)(A) of this section
shall tune the unit using the equipment tuning procedure specified in this paragraph.
 Nothing in these equipment tuning procedure shall be construed to require any act or omission that would result in
unsafe conditions or would be in violation of any regulation or requirement established by Factory Mutual, Industrial
Risk Insurers, National Fire Prevention Association, California Department of Industrial Relations (Occupational
Safety and Health Division), Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or other relevant regulations
and requirements.




(A) 

Step 1. 

Operate the unit at the firing rate most typical of normal operation. If the unit experiences significant load variations
during normal operation, operate it at its average firing rate.
(B) 

Step 2. 

At this firing rate, record stack gas temperature, oxygen concentration, and CO concentration (for gaseous fuels)
or smoke-spot
 number (for liquid fuels), and observe flame conditions after unit operation stabilizes at the firing rate selected.
If the excess oxygen in the stack gas is at the lower end of the range of typical minimum values,
 and if the CO emissions are low and there is no smoke, the unit is probably operating at near optimum efficiency at this
particular firing rate. However, complete the remaining portion of this procedure to determine whether still lower
oxygen levels are practical.





(C) 

Step 3. 

Increase combustion air flow to the furnace until stack gas oxygen levels increase by 1 to 2 percent over the level measured
in Step 2. As in Step 2, record the stack gas temperature, CO concentration (for gaseous fuels) or smoke-spot number
(for liquid fuels), and observe flame conditions for these higher oxygen levels after boiler operation stabilizes.
(D) 

Step 4. 

Decrease combustion air flow until the stack gas oxygen concentration is at the level measured in Step 2. From this
level gradually reduce the combustion air flow, in small increments. After each increment, record the stack gas temperature,
oxygen concentration, CO concentration (for gaseous fuels) and smoke-spot number (for liquid fuels). Also, observe
the flame and record any changes in its condition.

(E) 

Step 5

. Continue to reduce combustion air flow 
stepwise, until one of these limits is reached: 

(

1

) Unacceptable flame conditions_such as flame 
impingement on furnace walls or burner parts, excessive flame 
carryover, or flame instability. 

(

2

) Stack gas CO concentrations greater than 400 ppm. 

(

3

) Smoking at the stack. 

(

4

) Equipment-related limitations_such as low 
windbox/furnace pressure differential, built in air-flow limits, 
etc. 

(F) 

Step 6

. Develop an O

2

/CO curve (for gaseous fuels) or 
O

2

/smoke curve (for liquid fuels) similar to those shown in 
Figures 1 and 2 using the excess oxygen and CO or smoke-spot 
number data obtained at each combustion air flow setting. 

(G) 

Step 7

. From the curves prepared in Step 6, find the 
stack gas oxygen levels where the CO emissions or smoke-spot 
number equal the following values: 






The above conditions are referred to as CO or smoke threshold, or 
as the minimum excess oxygen level. Compare this minimum value 
of excess oxygen to the expected value provided by the combustion 
unit manufacturer. If the minimum level found is substantially 
higher than the value provided by the combustion unit 
manufacturer, burner adjustments can probably be made to improve 
fuel and air mixing, thereby allowing operation with less air. 

(H) 

Step 8. 

Add 0.5 to 2.0 percent to the minimum excess 
oxygen level found in Step 7 and reset burner controls to operate 
automatically at this higher stack gas oxygen level. This margin 
above the minimum oxygen level accounts for fuel variations, 
variations in atmospheric conditions, load changes, and 
nonrepeatability or play in automatic controls. 

(I) 

Step 9. 

If the load of the combustion unit varies 
significantly during normal operation, repeat Steps 1-8 for 
firing rates that represent the upper and lower limits of the 
range of the load. Because control adjustments at one firing 
rate may affect conditions at other firing rates, it may not be 
possible to establish the optimum excess oxygen level at all 
firing rates. If this is the case, choose the burner control 
settings that give best performance over the range of firing 
rates. If one firing rate predominates, settings should optimize 
conditions at that rate. 

(J) 

Step 10. 

Verify that the new settings can accommodate 
the sudden load changes that may occur in daily operation without 
adverse effects. Do this by increasing and decreasing load 
rapidly while observing the flame and stack. If any of the 
conditions in Step 5 result, reset the combustion controls to 
provide a slightly higher level of excess oxygen at the affected 
firing rates. Next, verify these new settings in a similar 
fashion. Then make sure that the final control settings are 
recorded at steady-state operating conditions.

unless otherwise provided in the California application specified 
in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. 

(2) The application shall contain a copy of the application 
for certification specified in  1960.1 of title 13 of the 
California Code of Regulations. 

(3) The application shall also demonstrate that throughout 
all testing conducted by the manufacturer in fulfilling the 
application for certification specified in  1960.1 of 
title 13 of the California Code of Regulations, and such 
additional testing as may be necessary, that the vehicle(s) for 
which certification is being requested meet all the applicable 
emission standards and design specifications specified in 
paragraph (c) of this section. 

(4) The applications shall also contain a statement by the 
manufacturer that the vehicle(s) for which certification is being 
requested will meet the emission standards specified in paragraph 
of this section over its full useful life (or half life, as 
applicable) in the absence of obvious abuse or tampering, as 
defined in paragraph (e)(iii)(B) of this section. Vehicles found 
to not do so under the provisions of paragraph (e) of this 
section will be subject to recall per the provisions of paragraph 
(e) of this section. 

(e) 

Enhanced in-use recall provisions. 

(1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e) of this 
section, the provisions of subpart S or 40 CFR part 85, and the 
associated established practices of EPA, shall apply to the 
recall of vehicles subject to the requirements of this section. 

(2) Vehicle selection. 

Vehicles shall be selected by EPA 
for purposes of recall testing from the portion of the vehicle 
population subject to enhanced inspection and maintenance testing 
described in  52.2963. EPA may test vehicles at any time or 
mileage within their applicable useful life. 

(3) 

Vehicle testing. 

(i) Selected vehicles will be tested 
unless EPA determines that a selected vehicle(s) has been 
subjected to obvious abuse or tampering. 

(ii) For purposes of paragraph (e) of this section, obvious 
abuse or tampering includes the following conditions:

canister; 

(C) The addition of a turbocharger to a naturally aspirated 
engine; 

(D) The presence of damage to the engine or emission 
controls resulting from a vehicular accident; and 

(E) Other factors which the Administrator may consider 
appropriate for determining the presence of obvious abuse or 
tampering. 

(iii) The manufacturer may be present at the time of vehicle 
procurement and testing and request that a vehicle not be tested 
due to obvious abuse or tampering. The Administrator may request 
that such a request from a manufacturer be supported by 
appropriate documentation, though the final determination rests 
with the Administrator. 

(iv) Vehicles that EPA determines have been subject to 
obvious abuse or tampering will be removed from the test sample. 

(v) EPA will test vehicles in the condition in which the 
vehicles are received from the owner. No repair or maintenance 
will be conducted on the vehicle prior to testing. 

(vi) Vehicles shall be tested according to the same test 
procedures prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section. 

(4) (i) 

Discretionary recall authority. 

Based on the 
criteria contained in 40 CFR 85.1802, the Administrator may 
determine that a nonconformity with an applicable standard under 
paragraph (c) of this section exists for a vehicle engine family. 
In addition, the Administrator may make such a determination of 
nonconformity when the average emissions of the test vehicles for 
any pollutant exceeds the applicable recall emission standard 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section. 

(ii) Any vehicle recall conducted by a manufacturer under 
paragraph (e) of this section shall apply to all vehicles of the 
affected engine family which have been sold in the State of 
California.

notification of exceedance of a liability threshold from the 
Administrator. 
(iii) (A) The vehicle manufacturer shall be liable to remedy 
the defects and for the repairs necessary for the vehicle to pass 
all aspects of an emission inspection which is part of a FIP I/M 
program applicable to that vehicle at the time of the failure of 
the I/M emission inspection referred to in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(A) 
of this section, regardless of whether the liability threshold 
for only one of the two pollutants was exceeded or both were 
exceeded. 
(B) At minimum, manufacturers must allow the repairs 
required under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section to be 
performed at any of its manufacturer authorized repair 
facilities. Nothing here shall be construed to limit the 
performance of such repairs to only manufacturer dealerships. 
(iv) In performing the repairs conducted under this section, 
the manufacturer shall promptly schedule and expeditiously repair 
the vehicle. In doing so, the manufacturer shall provide a 
loaner vehicle of equivalent or better quality free of charge to 
the owner of the vehicle being repaired:

this section and determined by the FIP I/M program test provider. 
(B) Manufacturers are not responsible for repairs of 
vehicles that have exceeded their useful life. 
(2) 

Applicable enhanced in-use I/M standards. 
(i) (A) The enhanced in-use I/M standards for exhaust HC 
emissions specified in paragraph (c) of this section shall be 
substituted for the exhaust HC emission standards specified in 
appendix 2 of  52.2963 for all vehicles of an exhaust engine

one model year's sales of that exhaust engine family has exceeded 
a liability threshold for NO

X

 emissions, as defined in paragraph 
(f)(4) of this section. 
(ii) This substitution shall begin 30 days after the date 
on which notification from the Administrator of the exceedance of 
the liability threshold is received by the manager of the 
affected I/M test facility. 
(3) 

Notification to Vehicle Owners.

 Immediately following 
the failure of an emission inspection for a pollutant (i.e., HC 
or NO

X

) by a vehicle for which the FIP I/M program test provider 
has received notification of exceedance of a liability threshold 
per paragraph (f)(2) of this section for that pollutant, the 
certifed emission inspector shall: 
(i) Determine whether or not the vehicle has been obviously 
abused or tampered with, per paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this 
section, 
(ii) If the vehicle was not obviously abused or tampered 
with, inform the vehicle owner (or the vehicle operator present 
at the test) that the vehicle manufacturer is responsible for 
remedial repairs, and

(iii) Provide the vehicle owner with a written copy of the 
test results and the determination that the vehicle was not 
obviously abused or tampered with. This document shall be signed 
by the certified emission inspector and the manager or an 
assistant manager of the FIP I/M test facility. 
(4) 

Exceedance of an I/M-based selective recall liability 
threshold. 
(i) The liability threshold is 5.0 percent for vehicles 
that have not exceeded 50.0 percent of their useful life and 10.0 
percent for vehicles that have not exceeded 100.0 percent of 
their full useful life. 
(ii) An exhaust engine family is deemed to have exceeded the 
liability threshold for NO

X

 or HC if the NO

X

 or HC failure rate for any model year of that exhaust engine family, per paragraph 
(f)(5) of this section, exceeds the half- or full-life liability 
threshold at any time, after three months of data have been 
submitted for that model year's vehicles. Exceedance of the 
liability thresholds for HC and NO

X

 are determined independently. 
(5) 

Calculation of failure rates. 
(i) The failure rate (in percent) for a specific pollutant 
for each model year of each exhaust engine family will consist of 
the total number of failing vehicles for that pollutant divided 
by the total number of vehicles multiplied by 100, where: 
(A) The total number of vehicles refers to the sum of all 
vehicles from a specific model year and exhaust engine family 
which have been tested in a FIP I/M program, 
(B) The total number of failing vehicles includes those 
vehicles included under paragraph (f)(5)(i)(A) of this section 
which: 
(1

) At any time exceeded the applicable IM240 exhaust NO

X

 
standard specified in paragraph (c)(1)(vi) or (c)(2)(iv) of this 
section, as applicable, (considered a failure for NO

X

); or 
(

2

) At any time exceeded the applicable IM240 exhaust HC 
standard specified in paragraph (c)(1)(vi) or (c)(2)(iv) of this 
section, as applicable, or failed either the purge or pressure 
functional tests described in  52.2963(t) and (u), respectively 
(considered a failure for HC). 
(C) Separate failure rates for each pollutant will be 
calculated for vehicles which have not exceeded 50.0 percent of 
their full useful life and for vehicles which have not exceeded 
100.0 percent of their full useful life. 
(D) Failure rates shall be expressed as a percentage, 
rounded to one figure after the decimal. 
(ii) On a monthly basis, the Administrator will calculate 
the HC and NO

X

 failure rates for each exhaust engine family and 
notify each vehicle manufacturer, as applicable, of the results 
for their engine families. 
(iii) Within thirty days after a liability threshold for an 
exhaust family has been determined to be exceeded, the 
Administrator shall, by registered mail, notify the manufacturer 
of the affected vehicles and managers of enhanced I/M test 
facilities required to meet the requirements of  52.2963. 
(g) 

Enhanced ILEV fleet program. 
(1) Fleet operators which control 10 or more vehicles which 
operate at any time in the South Coast Air Basin Nonattainment 
Area for Ozone as defined in 40 CFR 81.305 shall determine 
whether they are a covered fleet operator. This determination is 
to be made as follows: 
(i) The fleet operator shall not count the following types 
of vehicles: 
(A) Vehicles with a GVWR greater than 26,000 pounds; 
(B) Law enforcement and other emergency vehicles; 
(C) Nonroad vehicles; 
(D) Vehicles garaged at a private residence that are not

demonstrations and tests. 
(ii) Fleet operators shall determine the number of vehicles 
not exempted in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section that can be 
centrally fueled (as defined in 40 CFR 88.302-94). 
(iii) If a fleet operator determines under paragraph 
(g)(1)(ii) of this section that 10 or more non-exempt vehicles 
can be centrally fueled, then the fleet operator shall be 
considered to be a covered fleet operator. 
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, 
covered fleet operators acquiring vehicles to replace vehicles 
meeting the provisions of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, or 
acquiring additional vehicles which meet the same provisions, 
shall acquire a number of enhanced ILEVs equal to the number of 
such vehicles acquired multiplied by the appropriate percentage 
as follows: 
(i) For model year 1999 light-duty vehicles, light-duty 
trucks, and medium-duty vehicles, 50 percent; 
(ii) For model year 2000 and later light-duty vehicles, 
light-duty trucks, and medium-duty vehicles, 70 percent. 
(3) Enhanced ILEV purchase credits. 

Covered fleet 
operators may satisfy the enhanced ILEV purchase requirements 
provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section wholly or in part by 
redeeming an appropriate number of enhanced ILEV purchase 
credits. Enhanced ILEV purchase credits may be generated as 
follows: 
(i) A covered fleet operator which purchases enhanced ILEVs 
in excess of the enhanced ILEV purchase requirement may receive 
one enhanced ILEV purchase credit for each excess vehicle; and 
(ii) A covered fleet operator which purchases enhanced 
ILEVs earlier than required may receive one enhanced ILEV 
purchase credit for each such vehicle. 
(iii) The Administrator shall issue a credit document or 
documents to a covered fleet operator which requests enhanced 
ILEV credit or credits and which provides evidence of the 
appropriate purchases. 
(iv) The Administrator shall approve the reduction of any 
covered fleet operator's enhanced ILEV purchase requirement by a 
number equal to the number of credits presented to the 
Administrator for redemption, subject to confirmation of the 
legitimacy of the credit documents so presented.

repair facility. 



Oversight contractor(s)

 means a contractor or contractors who have been awarded a contract by the Administrator to conduct and report the results
of overt and covert audits of the test provider(s) sites and personnel. The information generated by the oversight
contractor shall be used by the Administrator to substantiate enforcement actions taken by EPA against the test provider
and its employees. 



Qualifying repairs

 means those vehicle repairs necessary to correct the deficiencies which resulted in a vehicle's failure of an emissions
inspection and which count toward the minimum dollar amount required before a waiver may be issued. For those repairs
where repair or replacement of emission-related parts requires replacement of other non-emission related equipment

Test provider(s)

 means one or more entities with whom the Administrator has entered into a legal agreement, for the purposes of providing
vehicle emission testing and other FIP I/M program activities except those activities which would clearly constitute
a conflict of interest or are otherwise impractical, such as overt and covert auditing of the testing element, program
effectiveness evaluation, and enforcement. As part of this legal agreement, the test provider(s) would be reimbursed
for operating expenses and allowed a reasonable profit by way of a test fee to be collected directly from motorists
at the time of testing. 



Transient test

 means a vehicle emission test in which exhaust emissions are sampled and analyzed under conditions simulating actual
on-road driving conditions, including the use of loaded operation simulation, and a standardized driving cycle.

(1) Biennial inspection.

 Vehicles subject to the current 
California I/M program which are registered in the FIP 
 I/M areas 
shall be subject to the FIP I/M program and will be tested on the 
same biennial schedule as is currently used, with the exception 
that such vehicles shall go to official FIP I/M program test 
provider(s) for valid testing. New vehicles which are registered 
in the FIP I/M areas shall be tested in the next even numbered 
calendar year after the initial titling if the model year is 
even, or in the next odd numbered calendar year after the initial 
titling if the model year is odd, and shall be subject to regular 
FIP I/M testing every two years thereafter. Once a vehicle has 
been tested as part of the FIP I/M program, it will remain on the 
same biennial testing schedule until such time as the FIP I/M 
program is discontinued. The sale of a vehicle shall not change 
that vehicle's regularly scheduled testing date. Vehicles 
previously registered in California but outside the FIP I/M areas 
which move into a FIP I/M area shall be tested in time to meet 
the I/M requirement for their first registration as residents of 
a FIP I/M area, and shall be tested every two years thereafter. 
(2) 

Out-of-cycle inspection.

 Vehicles otherwise subject to 
the FIP I/M program's requirements which are targeted as 
potential high emitters as a result of RSD detection must be 
presented for an enhanced I/M inspection within 30 days of 
notification of the failure (or sooner, if the regularly 
scheduled inspection deadline occurs first). If the vehicle 
fails this confirmatory test, it shall be subject at that time to 
the same repair, retest, and waiver requirements as apply to 
vehicles which fail the regularly scheduled biennial inspection. 
Failure to comply with this out-of-cycle testing requirement 
shall result in the assessment of a late fee to be collected 
prior to testing whenever the vehicle is next presented for 
regular testing. A late fee of $10 will be assessed for each 
full week past the testing deadline. Being subject to an out-of-cycle inspection does not change the deadline for
the vehicle's 
regularly scheduled biennial inspection, unless it occurs within 
30 days of the out-of-cycle test. 
(h) 

Notification of requirement for emission inspection.

 A 
letter of notification shall be sent to subject vehicle owners or 
lessees such that the letter shall have been received by the 
individual owner or lessee no later than 45 days prior to the 
regularly scheduled test deadline and no later than 30 days prior 
to an out-of-cycle confirmatory test deadline. In the case of 
the out-of-cycle inspection requirement, the notification shall 
be sent by registered mail to ensure documentation of the owner 
or lessee's receipt of notification. 
(i) 

Emission inspection period.

 The period during which a 
subject vehicle may be presented for an I/M inspection shall be 
stated on the emission inspection notification form along with 
the deadline for completing the inspection process. Subject 
vehicles presented for an initial inspection or reinspection 
after the time period shown on the emission inspection 
notification shall be charged a late fee of $10 for each full 
week that a vehicle is late. This late fee shall be collected 
prior to the initiation of testing.

(j) 

Inspection failure. 
(1) If a subject vehicle fails any phase of the enhanced 
emission inspection, the vehicle owner shall have the vehicle 
repaired and submit the vehicle for retesting along with a repair 
form supplied by the test provider (to be completed by the 
vehicle repair provider). No reinspection shall occur without a 
completed repair form. 
(2) If the subject vehicle fails the retest, and it 
otherwise meets the waiver requirements for enhanced I/M programs 
addressed under 40 CFR 51.360(a), the vehicle owner may apply for 
a waiver. 
(k) Enhanced I/M program requirements.

 The FIP I/M program 
design shall include the following program elements: 
(1) 

Network type.

 Testing shall be performed through a 
centralized system of official emission inspection stations which 
shall be operated by one or more test provider(s) under agreement 
with the Administrator. 
(2) 

Test-only.

 Official emission inspection stations shall 
conduct vehicle emission testing only and shall not perform 
vehicle repairs, except to restore the vehicle to the as-received 
condition after testing (including the reattachment of hoses 
disconnected for the evaporative system check). Official 
emission inspection stations shall meet all the requirements for 
test-only stations established in 40 CFR 51.353. 
(3) 

Geographic coverage.

 The FIP I/M program shall cover 
the same geographic areas within the Sacramento, Ventura and 
South Coast FIP areas as are covered by the existing California 
Smog Check program as of [

Insert date of publication of the final 
rule

]. (See 40 CFR part 52, subpart GGG, appendix A for a 
detailed listing of I/M FIP area coverage by zip code.) 
(4) 

Exhaust emission test type.

 All 1966 and newer subject 
vehicles shall be tested using the IM240 transient mass emission 
test as specified by EPA guidance and regulation. 
(5) 

Emission control device visual inspection.

 All 1971 
and newer subject vehicles shall be visually inspected for the 
presence and proper connection of the air pump and positive 
crankcase ventilation (PCV) systems. The visual inspection of 
these components shall be conducted in compliance with procedures 
established by EPA guidance and regulation. 
(6) 

Evaporative system tests.

 All 1971 and newer subject 
vehicles shall be subject to an evaporative system pressure test 
and an evaporative system purge test conducted as specified by 
EPA guidance and regulation. 
(7) 

Onroad testing.

 Onroad testing shall be conducted on 
approximately 10 percent of the subject fleet using RSD on an 
annual basis. Subject vehicles have been targeted by RSD as 
potential high-emitters shall be subject to out-of-cycle testing 
requirements as specified in paragraph (t) of this section. 
(l) 

Documentation of compliance for vehicles operated on 
Federal installations.

 Federal installations located within the 
FIP I/M program area shall provide annual documentation of proof 
of compliance with paragraphs (c)(5) and (c)(6) of this section 
to EPA. This documentation shall be updated periodically, but at 
least once per inspection cycle. The installation shall use one 
of the following methods to establish proof of compliance: 
(1) Presentation of a valid certificate of compliance with 
or waiver from the FIP I/M program or a comparable I/M program 
(i.e., one meeting the enhanced I/M performance standard as set 
forth in 40 CFR 51.351). In the event the FIP 
I/M program adopts 
an electronic-based instrument for certifying vehicle compliance, 
the test provider(s) shall make arrangements for issuing a 
special ``Federal vehicle,'' paper-based certificate of compliance. 
Such a certificate of compliance shall clearly read ``Not Valid 
for Vehicle Registration in the State of California'' in a point

(5) Vehicles shall not be tested if the exhaust system is 
missing or leaking, or if the vehicle is in an unsafe condition. 
(6) The vehicle owner or driver shall have access to an 
area in the inspection station which permits observation of the 
entire official inspection procedure. This access may be limited 
but it may not prevent full observation. 
(7) In the inspection process, vehicles that have been 
altered from their original certified configuration shall be 
tested in the same manner as other subject vehicles, in 
accordance with the following: 
(i) Vehicles with engines other than the engine originally 
installed by the manufacturer, or an identical replacement 
engine, shall be subject to the test procedures and standards for 
the chassis type and model year, regardless of the engine 
replacement, including visual equipment inspections for parts 
that are part of the original certified configuration and part of 
the normal inspection for such configuration. An exception may 
be made if the vehicle meets new certification standards for that 
chassis and model year. 
(ii) Vehicles which are switched to a fuel type for which 
there is no certified configuration shall be tested according to 
the emission standards established for that vehicle type and 
model year. Emission control device requirements may be waived 
if the Administrator determines that the alternatively fueled 
vehicle configuration would meet the new vehicle standards for 
that model year without these devices. 
(p)

(a) Applicability. 
 This section applies to all employers in the Sacramento ECO 
program area as defined in paragraph (c) of this section who 
employ 100 or more employees at a work location unless exempted 
under the provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section. 
 (b) 

Purpose. 

The purpose of this section is to reduce work 
trips by requiring employers of 100 or more employees to 
implement work trip reduction plans designed to attain an average 
passenger occupancy (APO) target which is 25% over the average 
occupancy for all peak period work trips in the area. This 
section will increase the average vehicle occupancy (AVO) of 
work-related trips and reduce the number of work-related trips 
and miles traveled. 
 (c) 

Definitions. 
 For the purposes of this section, the following definitions 
shall apply: 
 
Administrator 

means the Administrator of the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency or a designated and delegated 
representative. 
 


Average passenger occupancy (APO)

 means the average 
passenger occupancy of commuting vehicles arriving at an 
employer's work location during the peak travel period. The APO 
is equal to the number of employees arriving at the location 
during the peak travel period divided by the number of vehicles 
in which employees arrive at the same location during the peak 
travel period. 

 

Average passenger occupancy survey (APO survey) 

means the survey of employees' commute patterns 
required to be conducted at a work location by employers in 
accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.
 
 

Average vehicle occupancy 

or 

AVO 

means the average occupancy 
of all commuting vehicles arriving at all work locations within 
the Sacramento ECO Program Area during the peak travel period.
  

Carpool 

means a group of two to eight employees commuting to 
and from work by means of a vehicle. 

 

Clean Air Act 

means the Federal Clean Air Act, as amended

Commute alternative 

means the mode of travel between a 
person's place of residence and place of employment, which is 
other than in a motor vehicle occupied by one person. Commute 
alternatives include, but are not limited to, public 
transportation, carpools, vanpools, buspools, ferries, bicycling, 
and walking, which may be used independent of or in conjunction 
with compressed work week schedules, telecommuting and like 
measures. For purposes of this section, telecommuting is 
considered a commuting alternative. 

 

Compliance plan 

means the specific plan an employer is 
required to submit before March 1, 1997 and subsequently 
implement demonstrating that the employer will reach the APO 
target before March 1, 1999.

means a schedule in which employees 
work 35 or more hours in fewer than five work days or more than 
70 hours in fewer than ten work days. Compressed work week 
refers to schedules that include but are not limited to: ``4 
day-40 hour'', ``3 day-36 hour'', 9 day-80 hour'', ``9 day-72 hour'' 
schedules, and other work schedules that reduce the number or 
frequency of required commute trips. 
 


Employee 

means a partner or limited partner in a 
partnership, or any person employed by an employer, in a 
full-time or part-time, permanent, temporary or contract 
position, excluding volunteers, who either reports to work or is 
assigned primarily to a work location 80 or more hours per 28-day

(i) Each employer who is subject to this section or who 
receives by certified mail a standard registration form shall 
complete a standard registration form for each work location in 
the Sacramento ECO Program Area. The form must be signed by the 
highest ranking responsible officer at the location who shall 
attest to the accuracy of the information reported. An employer 
shall provide the following information on the form: 
 (A) The name of the employer and address of the work 
location; 
 (B) The name and telephone of the highest ranking 
responsible officer at the location; 
 (C) Designation of the location as a single site, 
headquarters, or branch; 
 (D) The total number of employees at the location and the 
number assigned to report to the work location during the peak 
travel period; and 
 (E) The name, telephone number, and address (if different 
from that named in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) (A) and (B) of this 
section) of the employee transportation coordinator (ETC) at the 
location to receive APO survey and compliance plan forms and who 
will serve as the employer's contact with the EPA. 
 (ii) An employer with more than one location in the 
Sacramento ECO Program Area shall complete a separate 
registration form for each work location, but individual 
registration forms may be submitted together. The employer shall 
designate an ETC for EPA to contact at each location. 
Notwithstanding this provision, an employer may designate a 
single contact person to receive APO survey and compliance plan 
forms for all work locations. 
 (g) Average Passenger Occupancy (APO) target. 
 (1) Designation of target APO. 

The CAA has established 
average passenger occupancy (APO) at a work location as the 
performance measure for determining an employer's compliance. 
The APO performance target is 125 percent of the average vehicle 
occupancy (AVO) for the Sacramento ECO Program Area. Given a 
baseline AVO of 1.11, the target APO for the Sacramento ECO 
Program Area is 1.38. 
 (2) 

Deadline for compliance with the target APO. 

Not later 
than March 1, 1999, each employer is required to increase the APO 
at the employer's work location during the peak travel period to 
the target APO. An employer that has achieved the target APO is 
required to maintain the location APO at a level at least as high 
as the target APO, but is not required to increase its APO beyond 
the target APO. Each employer shall annually document 
achievement of the target APO at each work location through the 
APO survey described in paragraph (h) of this section, and report 
the location's compliance with the target APO to the 
Administrator in the maintenance plan, as required by paragraph 
(i) of this section. 
 (h) 

Average Passenger Occupancy (APO) survey requirements. 
 (1) Notice of requirement to survey. 

Within 180 days of 
receiving completed registration forms from employers, but not 
later than March 1, 1996, the Administrator shall notify each 
employer of the requirement to conduct an APO survey and to 
develop and implement a compliance plan in accordance with the 
requirements of paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section. The notice 
shall include copies of the required APO survey and compliance 
plan forms. Failure of an employer to receive such notification 
shall not relieve any employer of the obligation to comply with 
all applicable obligations of this section. Employers not 
receiving such forms may request them from EPA by contacting the 
Region IX office. 
 (2) 

Requirement to survey. 

For the purpose of documenting 
the work location APO, each employer shall conduct annual APO 
surveys of the commute patterns of the employees who arrive at 
its work location during the peak travel period. An employer 
with more than one location in the Sacramento ECO Program Area 
shall conduct a survey at each location. 
 (3) 

Survey procedure. 

An employer shall conduct an APO 
survey of all employees assigned to report to the work location 
during the peak travel period using the following procedure, 
except as provided in paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section: 
 (i) Except as provided below, an employer shall use the 
standard APO survey form provided by the EPA. The APO survey 
form is designed to collect information on the commute patterns 
of employees and to allow the employer to calculate the work 
location APO as described in this paragraph. The standard form 
shall be used without alteration. If the employer's individual 
survey form has been submitted to and approved by the 
Administrator prior to administration of the survey, the 
Administrator may permit the employer to use this pre-approved 
form as a substitute for the standard APO survey form. The 
Administrator shall not approve any survey form that could be 
expected, in the Administrator's judgement, to produce different 
survey results than if the standard form had been used. An 
employer is permitted to attach additional survey forms to the 
standard form if desired, without prior approval of the 
Administrator. 
 (ii) Employers shall choose a typical week in which to 
conduct the APO survey. A week shall not be considered typical 
if it: 
 (A) Includes a holiday observed by the employer; 
 (B) Immediately follows a week in which a holiday was 
observed on Friday or precedes a week in which a holiday will be 
observed on Monday; 
 (C) Is a week during which the employer holds a rideshare 
fair or other intensive information promotion related to the ECO 
program;

<TEXT>
 



(D) Is a week in which the location has a partial or complete shutdown of its operation; or 

(E) Is a week with any other anomalous change or fluctuation in the number of employees reporting to the work location.


(iii) An employer shall survey all employees arriving at or scheduled to report to the work location during the peak
travel period in the survey week. An employer with 400 or more employees arriving at a single location during the peak
travel period may survey a random sample of those employees if approved by the Administrator. All employees selected
for the random sample must be accounted for either by the survey data, or a documented leave of absence. Any employee
designated for the random sample that does not respond to the survey must be counted as arriving in a single occupancy
vehicle. Employers desiring to conduct a random sample survey shall submit the following information to the Administrator:
a sampling process and statistical methodology that will produce reliable and valid results consistent with a 95
percent confidence level; and, documentation that the person or persons conducting the survey have the qualifications
to ensure the survey will be conducted in a statistically valid manner. The Administrator shall grant or deny approval
for the random sample survey within 30 days of receipt of the methodology. 

(iv) An employer shall achieve an APO survey response rate of at least 75 percent of all employees assigned to report
to the work location during the peak travel period. An employer that fails to achieve at least a 75 percent response
rate on any APO survey shall repeat the survey until the required response rate is achieved. If the response rate is
less than 90% but 75% or greater, all non-respondents shall be treated as single occupant vehicle commuters. If the
response rate is 90% or greater, non-respondents shall be treated as having the same commute behavior as that of the
average of the respondents. 

(v) An employer may use its own staff to conduct the APO survey or arrange with a market research or transportation consultant,
local government, TMA, or other entity outside the employer to conduct the survey. 

(4) 

Calculating work location APO

. An employer shall demonstrate its compliance with this section by documenting achievement of the target APO specified
in paragraph (g) of this section. 

(i)(A) An employer shall calculate the APO for its work location from the results of the APO survey as follows: 














where: 





Employees arriving is:

 total number of employees arriving at the location between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m., Monday through Friday of the survey week,
and 



Vehicles arriving is:

 total number of vehicles in which employees arrive at the location between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m., Monday through Friday
of the survey week. 

(B) To illustrate the calculation of APO, the following example is provided:

(ii) Calculation of location APO shall count employees arriving at the location during the peak travel periods, Monday
through Friday of the survey week as follows: 

(A) Each employee that arrives at the location during the peak travel period shall be counted as one employee arriving

of this section. The certifier may contact the employer to clarify questions related to the plan or to request reasonable
additional documentation from the employer. 

(ii) If the certifier deems the plan to meet the certification criteria, the certifier shall certify the plan and return
it to the employer for submittal to the Administrator. Plans not meeting the certification criteria shall be returned
to the employer with an explanation of the reasons the plan was returned, indication of the sections of the plan that
are unacceptable, and an indication of where corrections are necessary in order to make the plan meet certification
requirements. The employer shall revise its plan as appropriate and re-submit the revised plan to the certifying
agency. 

(iii) It is the responsibility of an employer to allow adequate time for certification. Failure of the certifier to
certify the employer's plan in time to allow submittal of the plan to the Administrator prior to the deadline shall
not excuse the employer from this obligation. Notwithstanding this provision, however, an employer that submits
a certifiable plan to a certifier at least 90 days prior to the plan submittal deadline shall not be considered in violation
of the plan submittal deadline until 60 days after the scheduled submittal date to the Administrator. 

(k) Plan review and approval. 

(1) Plan review and approval schedule. The Administrator will strive to approve or disapprove plans within 90 days
of receipt of a plan. An employer whose plan is returned shall have 60 days from the date of return to revise and resubmit
the plan to the Administrator. The employer shall not be required to have the plan recertified prior to re-submittal
to the Administrator. 

(2) Plan review guidelines. The Administrator shall review and approve plans based on the following criteria: 

(i) The presence of all required plan sections and minimum plan requirements, as described in paragraph (i) of this
section;

and, 

(iii) A demonstration of plan certification, in accordance with the procedures defined in paragraph (j) of this section.


(iv) The appropriateness of the commute alternatives proposed in the plan to the location and employee population;


(v) The appropriateness of the ECO program services and incentives selected by the employer to the commute alternatives;


(vi) The likely effectiveness of the ECO strategies in producing the target APO by the scheduled deadline; 

(vii) The ability of the proposed implementation schedule to ensure ECO strategies included in the plan are implemented
in a timely and thorough manner; and 

(viii) The ability of the proposed monitoring process to allow a timely and effective review of the employer's progress
toward the target APO. 

(l) Enforcement and penalties. 

(1) Noncompliance.

 An employer shall be subject to civil or criminal penalties according to 42 U.S.C. 7413 (section 113 of the Clean Air
Act) for violations of any provisions of this section. Upon determining that a violation has occurred, the Administrator
shall issue the employer a notice of violation. Penalties for continued noncompliance may accrue from the date of
the notice of violation. 

(2) 

Penalties.

 The Administrator may assess civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day of violation. Penalties under this section will
be assessed according to criteria in 42 U.S.C. 7413(e). These criteria include:

pertaining to the development, implementation, and administration of the ECO program described in the employer's
plan, and access to employees at the location. 

(4) 

Good faith effort.

 A good faith effort will be taken into account when penalties are determined. The Administrator may consider any or
all of the following criteria in assessing an employer's good faith effort: 

(i) Did management at the location demonstrate significant commitment to implementation of the program and institute
written employee policies that encouraged the use of commute alternatives?; 

(ii) Did the employer assess the transportation needs and interests of employees through employee surveys or other
techniques?; 

(iii) Did the employer periodically review its progress toward the target APO, at a minimum through conduct of an APO
survey of its employees in the second program year (1996-1997), and through other actions designed to assess
the continuing appropriateness of the employer's ECO program services and incentives?; 

(iv) If the employer's 1997-1998 APO survey showed the APO increase was less than 50 percent of that needed to
achieve the target APO, did the employer increase and or modify its program to include appropriate contingency strategies?;

amines with no unsaturations; and sulfur-containing 
perfluorocarbons with no unsaturations and with sulfur bonds only 
to carbon and fluorine. Perfluorocarbon compounds will be 
assumed to be absent from a product or process unless a 
manufacturer or facility operator identifies the specific 
individual compounds (from the broad classes of perfluorocarbon 
compounds) and the amounts present in the product or process and 
provides a validated test method which can be used to quantify 
the specific compounds.





Hazardous air pollutant (HAP) 

means any air pollutant listed 
pursuant to section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act as amended (42 
U.S.C. 7401 

et seq.

). 


Historic actual emissions 

means: 
(1) The actual emissions for the existing emissions unit 
averaged over the consecutive two-year period immediately 
preceding the date of application for authorized emission 
reduction credits. If the last two years are unrepresentative of 
normal source operations as determined by the EPA, then any two 
consecutive years of the last five years that represent normal 
source operation may be used. 
(2) If, at any time during the two-year period, actual 
emissions exceeded the allowed or permitted emission levels, then 
actual emissions shall be reduced to reflect emission levels that 
would have occurred if the unit were in compliance with all 
applicable limitations and rules. 
(3) Where an emissions unit has been in operation for less 
than two years, a shorter averaging period of at least one year 
may be used, provided that the averaging period is representative 
of the full operational history of the emissions unit. If an 
emissions unit has been in operation for less than one year, then 
the historic actual emissions shall be zero. 


Historic potential emissions 

means emissions based on the 
potential to emit of the emissions unit prior to modification. 
In determining the potential to emit, daily emissions limitations 
shall be treated as part of an emissions unit's design only if 
the limitations are representative of normal operations, of in 
the facility has provided offsets form previous permitting 
actions. If there are no enforceable limiting conditions, an 
emissions unit's potential to emit shall be limited to the unit's 
historic actual emissions. For a new emissions unit, historic 
potential emissions are equal to zero. For the purposes of the 
above determination, ``normal operations'' is defined as the usual 
or typical daily operating of an emissions unit resulting in 
actual emissions which are at least 80% of the specific limits 
contained in the emission unit's authority to construct or permit 
to operate.

part of the design only if the limitation, or the effect it would 
have on emissions, is incorporated into the Authority to 
Construct as an enforceable permit condition as daily emissions 
limitations. Fugitive emissions associated with the emissions 
unit or stationary source shall be included in the potential to 
emit of the emissions unit or stationary source.

contrivance, the use of which may cause, eliminate, reduce, or 
control the issuance ROC or NO

X

, shall obtain authorization for 
such construction from the EPA as specified in paragraph (e)(3) 
of this section, prior to beginning actual construction. An 
Authority to Construct shall remain in effect until it expires or 
the application is cancelled. An Authority to Construct shall 
expire no later than two years following the date of permit 
issuance, unless the applicant has commenced construction prior 
to that date. If the applicant has commenced construction, the 
Authority to Construct shall remain in effect for the life of the 
emissions unit(s), unless the EPA has taken action to modify or 
revoke it. 

(i) An Authority to Construct shall be valid beyond two 
years if: 

(A) Commencement of construction has occurred; and 

(B) Construction is completed in a reasonable period of 
time, as determined by the EPA. 

(ii) If a written request to extend the Authority to 
Construct is received by the EPA prior to the expiration of the 
Authority to Construct, an extension may be granted for up to two 
years at the discretion of the EPA. 

(iii) The EPA shall be notified of the anticipated date of 
initial startup or operation of any permitted article, machine, 
equipment or other contrivance. Such notice shall be made no less 
than 30 days prior to the startup date. 

(iv) The EPA shall be notified of the actual date of 
initial startup within five days after such date. 

(2) 

Standards for granting applications

. 

(i) The EPA shall deny an Authority to Construct except as 
provided in  52.3001, New Source Review, if the applicant does 
not show that every article, machine, equipment or other 
contrivance, the use of which may cause, eliminate, reduce, or 
control the issuance of air contaminants, is so designed, 
controlled, equipped, and operated with such air pollution 
control equipment that it may be shown to operate without 
emitting or without causing to be emitted air contaminants in 
violation of these rules and regulations or of such state or 
federal statutes as may be enforceable by the EPA on the date the 
application is deemed complete. 

(ii) The EPA shall require enforceable emission limitations 
as permit conditions in Authorities to Construct to assure 
compliance with all analyses performed for the issuance of the 
permit, including the permanence of surplus actual emissions 
reductions applied for use as internal reductions or authorized 
emission reduction credits in accordance with  52.3001, New 
Source Review, and  52.3002, Emissions Reduction Credit 
Authorization. 

(iii) Approval to construct shall not relieve any owner or 
operator of the responsibility to comply fully with applicable 
requirements, including applicable provisions of the California 
State Implementation Plan or any applicable Federal 
Implementation Plan, district rules and regulations, or state or 
federal law. 

(3) 

Provision of sampling and testing facilities

. In 
addition to the monitoring and testing required to comply with 
state or federal laws or regulations, the EPA may, upon 
reasonable written notice or before an Authority to Construct is 
granted, require the applicant or the owner or operator of any 
article, machine, equipment, or other contrivance, the use of 
which may cause the issuance of air contaminants, or the use of 
which may eliminate, reduce, or control the issuance of air 
contaminants to:

(i) Provide and maintain such facilities as are necessary 
for sampling and testing purposes in order to secure information 
that will disclose the nature, extent, quantity or degree of air 
contaminants discharged into the atmosphere from the equipment in 
question. In the event of such a requirement, the EPA shall 
notify the applicant in writing of the required size, number and 
location of sampling holes; the size and location of the sampling 
platform; the access to the sampling platform; and the utilities 
for operating the sampling, testing, and air monitoring 
equipment. Such platform and access shall be constructed in 
accordance with the applicable General Industry Safety Orders of 
the State of California. 

(ii) Provide and maintain sampling and monitoring apparatus 
to measure emissions of air contaminants when the EPA has determined that such apparatus is available and should be
installed.

time as may be required by any permit issued pursuant to this 
section. 

(C) In the event of a breakdown of monitoring equipment, 
the owner or operator shall notify the EPA within 48 hours and 
shall initiate repairs. The owner or operator shall inform the 
EPA of the intent to shutdown any monitoring equipment at least 
24 hours prior to the event. 

(iii) If the EPA determines that technological or economic 
limitations on the application of measurement methodology to a 
particular class of sources would make the imposition of a 
numerical emission standard infeasible, the EPA may instead 
prescribe a design, operational, or equipment standard. In such 
cases, the EPA may require the installation or modification of 
process monitoring devices such that the design characteristics 
or equipment will be properly maintained, or that the operational 
conditions will be properly performed, so as to continuously 
achieve the assumed degree of control. To the extent applicable, 
reporting requirements for process monitors shall be the same as 
for continuous emission monitoring systems. 

(iv) A person operating or using a stack monitoring system 
shall, upon written notice from the EPA, provide a summary of 
the data obtained from such systems. This summary of the data 
shall be in the form and manner prescribed by the EPA. The 
summary of data shall be available for public inspection at the 
office of the Air Pollution Control District. Records from the 
monitoring equipment shall be kept by the owner or operator for a 
period of five years, during which time they shall be available 
to the EPA in such form as directed. 

(5) 

Transfer

. An Authority to Construct shall not be 
transferable, whether by operation of law or otherwise, either 
from one location to another, from one piece of equipment to 
another, or from one person to another. In the event any person 
contemplates or desires to make any such transfer as herein above 
described, said person shall make an application for 
authorization in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section. 

(6) 

Performance testing

. Within 60 days after achieving 
the maximum production rate or the maximum rate of emissions to 
which the source is limited by enforceable conditions, but not 
later than 180 days after initial startup of such source, or as 
otherwise required by the EPA to determine continuous compliance 
with emission limitations or to confirm emission reductions 
claimed, the owner or operator of such source shall conduct 
performance test(s) in accordance with methods and under 
operating conditions as are approved by the EPA and furnish the 
EPA a written report of the results of such performance test(s). 

(i) Such test(s) shall be at the expense of the owner or 
operator. 

(ii) Testing shall be conducted with the source(s) of 
emissions operating at maximum capacity or other rate conforming 
to the maximum rate of emissions to which the source(s) are 
limited by enforceable condition(s). 

(iii) The EPA may monitor such tests and may also conduct 
performance tests. 

(iv) The owner or operator of a source shall provide the 
EPA 15 days prior notice of the performance test to afford the 
EPA the opportunity to have an observer present. 

(v) The EPA may waive the requirement for performance tests 
if the owner or operator of a source has demonstrated by other 
means to the EPA's satisfaction that the source is being operated 
in compliance with all local, state and federal regulations which 
are part of the California State Implementation Plan or any 
applicable Federal Implementation Plan.

 52.3001 

New source review (Sacramento). 



(a) 

Purpose.

 The purpose of this section is to provide for 
the review of new and modified stationary air pollution sources 
and to provide requirements, including emission offsets, for 
issuing Authority to Construct permits for such sources without 
interfering with the attainment or maintenance of ambient air 
quality standards. 

(b) 

Applicability and exemptions.

 This section shall apply 
to all new stationary sources and emissions units and all 
modifications to existing stationary sources and emissions units 
which, after construction, emit or have the potential to emit 
nitrogen oxides (NO

X

) or reactive organic compounds (ROC). This 
section shall not apply to prescribed burning of forest, 
agriculture or range land; road construction or any non-point 
source common to timber harvesting or agricultural practices; 
open burning in accordance with the following district 
regulations:

Exemptions allowed in this section shall not be used to 
exempt from permit requirements any stationary source or 
modification which would be subject to review under U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations or review 
pursuant to the operating permit requirements of Title V of the 
Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (42 U.S.C. 7401 

et seq.

) The 
regulations in effect at the time any application for an 
Authority to Construct is deemed complete shall apply. 



 (1) 

Exemptions for emergency electrical generating 
equipment.

 Except as otherwise required for sources subject to 
the requirements of Title V of the Clean Air Act as amended in 
1990 (42 U.S.C. 7401 

et seq.

) the EPA shall exempt an application 
from the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this 
section if the emissions unit would provide emergency electrical 
power or emergency water pumping for flood control or emergency 
fire fighting and is not a major source or major modification, 
provided the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) 
of this section are met. This exemption shall not apply to 
emissions units supplying power to a serving utility for 
distribution on the electric transmission grid nor the operation 
of standby power sources due to a voluntary reduction in power by 
the serving utility. 

(i) Operation for maintenance purposes of internal 
combustion engines used solely as a source of emergency 
electrical power, not otherwise exempt, shall be limited to 100 
hours per year, and such maintenance shall be scheduled in 
cooperation with the district so as to have no adverse air 
quality impact or shall be mitigated by emission offsets or on-site reductions so that there is no net increase in emissions;

and 

(ii) Operation for other than maintenance purposes shall be 
limited to actual interruptions of electrical power by the 
serving utility. Operation shall not exceed 24 hours without 
prior authorization by the EPA. 

(2) 

Exemptions to notification requirements.

 Except as 
otherwise required for sources subject to the requirements of 
Title V of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (42 U.S.C. 7401 


et seq.

) the requirements of paragraphs (d)(3) through (6) of 
this section relating to notification, publication, and public 
inspection of preliminary decisions; and notification, 
publication, and public inspection of final action shall not 
apply if the application is for a new or modified stationary 
source whose emissions, calculated pursuant to paragraph (d)(12) 
or (13) of this section, are less than 2500 pounds per quarter 
of nitrogen oxides or reactive organic compounds. 

(3) 

Exemptions for relocated equipment.

 The requirements 
of paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section shall only apply 
once to relocation of emission units solely within the district 
and within the air basin of which the district is part, and the 
relocation does not result in an increase in emissions. This 
exemption requires the performance of an air quality analysis 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this section.

(4) 

Exemptions for replacement equipment. 

The requirements of paragraphs (c) (2) and (3) of this section shall not apply to replacement equipment, as defined
in paragraph (b) of  52.3000 General Permit Requirements, providing the replacement does not result in any
emissions increase.

(5) 

Exemptions for temporary sources.

 The requirements of paragraphs (c) (2) and (3) of this section shall not apply to temporary stationary emission sources,
emission units, and portable equipment which will be operated on a temporary basis. This exemption requires the performance
of an air quality analysis pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this section.

(c) 

Standards.

(1) Best Available Control Technology.

 An applicant shall apply Best Available Control Technology to a new emissions unit or modification of an existing
emissions unit, except cargo carriers, for each emissions change of NO

X

 or ROC which would create an increase in emissions, according to procedures specified in paragraph (d)(10) of this
section, and the potential to emit of the new or modified emissions unit would equal or exceed the levels specified
in this paragraph. In addition, BACT shall be applied to each source that applies for a major modification as defined
and calculated in  52.3000(b). A condition which reflects BACT in a manner consistent with testing procedures,
such as ppmv NO

X

, g/liter VOC, or lbs/hr, shall be contained in the latest Authority to Construct and Permit to Operate.






(2) 

General offset requirements.

(i) Applicants for major modifications to major sources of NO

X

 or ROC shall provide offsets for the affected pollutant, obtained pursuant to  52.3002 Emissions Reduction
Credit Authorization, in the amount calculated pursuant to paragraphs (d) (12) and (13) of this section.

(ii) An applicant shall provide offsets for the affected pollutant, obtained pursuant to  52.3002 Emissions
Reduction Credit Authorization, for new and modified sources where the cumulative emission changes of ROCs or NO

X

 calculated pursuant to paragraph (d)(11) of this section exceed the level specified in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this
section. Sufficient offsets shall be provided, from the same calendar quarter as the emissions, to offset positive
emissions changes of ROCs or NO

X

 calculated according to procedures specified in paragraph (d)(13) of this section. Facilities shall be required
to curtail operations if sufficient offsets are not obtained as required by permit conditions. Offsets used to mitigate
emission increases must be of the same pollutant. The facility is ultimately responsible for ensuring offsets.






(iii) In no case shall halogenated hydrocarbons be used as offsets for ROCs, nor shall exempt compounds or other compounds
excluded from the definition of ROCs be used as offsets for ROCs.

(iv) Portable equipment shall be evaluated for offsets at the initial location only. In the event such portable equipment
is shutdown, emission reduction credits shall be granted based on the emissions calculated at the initially permitted
location. If operated a cumulative total of less than 90 days within a continuous 12-month period, at all locations
within the same non- attainment designated area and in any air basin of which the district is a part, the portable equipment
is considered a temporary source.

(v) Offsets can only come from regions with air quality classifications that are the same as or worse than those in which
the emissions unit or stationary source that requires the offsets is located.

(3) 

Location of offsets and offset ratios.

(i) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(3) (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) of this section, an applicant shall provide offsets
for emissions from a proposed stationary source subject to the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section according
to the following ratios and requirements as a minimum:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940505-1-00502 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 







(ii) Offsets obtained from locations not satisfying the location criteria of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section
shall be subject to an offset ratio of at least 1.3 to 1.0. An air quality analysis pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this
section shall be performed. The EPA may impose, based on the air quality analysis, a higher offset ratio such that the
new or modified stationary source will not prevent or interfere with the attainment or maintenance of any ambient
air quality standard. 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940505-1-00503 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940505-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



(iii) Offsets which are obtained pursuant to paragraphs 
(c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section and pursuant to permitting 
actions in a district other than that in which the proposed 
source is located may be used only if the EPA has reviewed the 
permit conditions issued by the other district in which the 
proposed offsets are obtained and certifies that the impacts of 
using such offsets meet the requirements of all applicable rules 
and regulations. Emission reduction credits used to offset 
project emissions in another district shall be implemented 
through an interdistrict agreement to ensure their enforceability 
and permanence. 
(iv) Applicants providing internal offsets for major 
modifications at major sources of NO

X

 or ROCs must provide them 
at a 1.3 to 1 offset ratio. 
(v) Offsets which are achieved from mobile emission 
reduction credits shall be subject to an offset ratio of 2.0 to 
1.0. 
(4) 

Emission reductions, shutdowns, and curtailments. 


Actual emission reductions from a shutdown or curtailment of 
permitted emission units may be credited for the purposes of 
banking and offsets pursuant to  52.3002, Emissions Reduction 
Credit Authorization, provided: 
(i) Application is made for emission reduction credits; and 
(ii) The crediting and disbursement of emission reductions 
from source shutdowns and curtailments are in accordance with the 
most current EPA emissions trading policy and applicable federal 
regulations; and 
(iii) Emissions decreases are ensured and documented by 
enforceable emission limitations contained in the Authority to 
Construct; or 
(iv) Emissions decreases are ensured by the permanent 
surrender or cancellation of the Authority to Construct. 
(5) 

Ambient air quality standards.

 In no case shall 
emissions from the new or modified stationary source prevent or 
interfere with the attainment or maintenance of any applicable 
ambient air quality standard. The EPA may require the use of an 
air quality model to estimate the effects of a new or modified 
stationary source. The analysis shall estimate the effects of a 
new or modified stationary source, and verify that the new or 
modified stationary source will not prevent or interfere with the 
attainment or maintenance of any ambient air quality standard. 
In making this determination, the EPA shall take into account the 
mitigation of emissions through offsets pursuant to this section 
and the impacts of transported pollutants on downwind pollutant 
concentrations. The EPA may impose, based on an air quality 
analysis, offset ratios greater than the requirements of 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section. 
(6) 

Denial, failure to meet standards.

 The EPA shall deny 
any Authority to Construct if the EPA finds that the subject of 
the application would not comply with the standards set forth in 
federal rules or regulations. Stationary sources and emission 
units are required to curtail operations corresponding to the 
extent that required offsets are not obtained, or are not 
permanently maintainable. The owner or operator of the 
stationary source or emissions unit requiring offsets has the 
ultimate responsibility for ensuring that offsets are real, 
surplus, permanent, and quantifiable. 
(7) 

Alternative siting analysis.

 By means of an analysis 
of alternative sites, sizes, production processes, and 
environmental control techniques for a new or modified stationary 
source, the owner or operator of the proposed stationary source 
or modification shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the EPA 
that the benefits of the proposed source significantly outweigh 
the environmental and social costs incurred as a result of its 
location, construction, or modification. Whenever any proposed 
source or modification is subject to action by a state or federal 
agency that might necessitate the preparation of an environmental 
impact statement, which includes an alternative siting analysis, 
the EPA may accept the alternative sitings analysis prepared 
pursuant to that action to meet this requirement to the extent 
appropriate. 
(d) 

Administrative requirements.

 The following 
administrative requirements shall apply to any activities 
regulated by this section. 
(1) 

Complete application.

 The EPA shall determine whether 
the application is complete no later than 30 days after receipt 
of the application, or after such longer time period that the 
applicant and the EPA have agreed to in writing. If the EPA 
determines that the application is not complete, the applicant 
shall be notified in writing of the decision specifying the 
information required. Upon receipt of any re-submittal of the 
application, a new 30-day period to determine completeness shall 
begin. Completeness of an application or a re-submitted 
application shall be evaluated on the basis of the information 
requirements set forth in 40 CFR 70.5(c), Federal Operating 
Permit Program and the information required by this section. The 
EPA may, at any time during the processing of the application, 
request an applicant to clarify, amplify, correct, or otherwise 
supplement the information submitted in the application. 
(2) 

Air quality models.

 All air quality models used for 
the purposes of this section shall be consistent with the 
requirements provided in the most recent edition of the EPA's 
``Guidelines on Air Quality Models, OAQPS 1.2-080,'' unless the EPA 
finds that such model is inappropriate for use. After making 
such a finding, the EPA may designate an alternate model only 
after allowing for public comment. Credit shall not be given for 
stacks higher than dictated by good engineering practice. All 
modeling costs associated with the siting of a stationary source 
shall be borne by the applicant. 
(3) 

Preliminary decision.

 Except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, following acceptance of an application as 
complete, the EPA shall perform the evaluations required to 
determine compliance with all applicable requirements of this 
section and make a preliminary written decision as to whether an 
Authority to Construct should be approved, conditionally 
approved, or denied. The decision shall be supported by a 
succinct written analysis. 
(4) 

Publication, public comment, and requests for public 
hearings.

 Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, within 10 calendar days following a preliminary decision 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the EPA shall publish, 
in at least one newspaper of general circulation in the district, 
a notice stating the preliminary decision of the EPA noting how 
the pertinent information can be obtained, and inviting written 
public comment for a 30-day period following the date of 
publication. The notice shall also provide that any interested 
person may submit a written request for a public hearing, and 
that such request must include a statement of the issues proposed 
to be raised in the hearing. If a written request for a public 
hearing is received during the public comment period, the EPA 
shall use the procedures given at 40 CFR 124.12, Public Hearings, 
applicable to PSD permits, to grant or deny the request and to 
hold a public hearing.

inspection, at the district's office and the Regional Office of 
the EPA, the information submitted by the applicant and the EPA's 
analysis no later than the date the notice of the preliminary 
decision is published pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this 
section. Information submitted that contains trade secrets shall 
be handled in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 2. 
(6) 

Authority to Construct, final action.

 Except as 
provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the EPA shall 
provide written notice of the final action to the applicant, and 
shall make the notice and all supporting documents available for 
public inspection at the district's office and Regional Office of 
the EPA. Within 30 days after the final decision has been made 
on the authority to construct, the applicant or any person who 
filed comments of the preliminary determination, may petition the 
EPA to review any condition of the permit. Any person who failed 
to file comments on the preliminary decision, may petition for 
administrative review only on the changes from the preliminary to 
the final determination. 
(7) 

Requirements, authority to construct. 
(i) General conditions.

 As a condition for the issuance of 
an Authority to Construct, the EPA shall require that the 
emissions unit and stationary source, and any emissions units 
which provide offsets, be operated in the manner stated in the 
application in making the analysis required to determine 
compliance with this section, and as conditioned in the Authority 
to Construct. 
(ii) 

Emissions limitations.

 All of the following emissions 
limitations shall be included in the Authority to Construct, if 
applicable: 
(A) The Authority to Construct shall include emission 
limitations which reflect Best Available Control Technology. 
Such condition(s) shall be expressed in a manner consistent with 
testing procedures, such as ppmv NO

(iii) 

Design, operational, or equipment standards. 

If the EPA determines that technological or economic limitations on the application of measurement methodology
to a particular class of sources would make the imposition of a numerical emission standard infeasible, the EPA may
instead prescribe a design, operational, or equipment standard. In such cases, the EPA shall make a best estimate
as to the emission rate that will be achieved. Any permits issued without an enforceable numerical emission standard
must contain enforceable conditions that assure that the design characteristics or equipment will be properly maintained,
or that the operational conditions will be properly performed, so as to continuously achieve the assumed degree of
control.
(iv) 

Offsets.
(A) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the operation of any emissions unit or stationary source which
provides offsets shall be subject to enforceable permit conditions, containing specific emissions and operational
limitations, to ensure that the emission reductions shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of this section
and shall continue for the reasonably expected life of the proposed emissions unit or stationary source.
(B) Where the source of offsets is not required to obtain an Authority to Construct pursuant to  52.3000, General
Permit Requirements, and  52.3002(c)(2), a legally binding contract shall be required between the applicant
and the owner or operator of such source. Such contract, by its terms, shall be enforceable by the EPA. For such non-permitted
sources, a source-specific SIP revision is required.
(C) An internal emission offset will be considered federally enforceable if it is made a SIP requirement by inclusion
as a condition of the authority to construct.
(D) External offsets must be made enforceable either by revision of an offsetting source's Authority to Construct
or by a SIP revision prior to the operation of the emissions unit.
(E) A violation of the emission limitation provisions of any contract pursuant to the above stipulations shall be
a violation of this section by the applicant.
(F) The operation of any emissions unit or stationary source which uses offsets provided by another emissions unit
or stationary source shall be subject to enforceable permit conditions, containing specific emissions and operational
limits, to ensure that the emission reductions are used in accordance with the provisions of all applicable rules
and shall continue for the reasonably expected life of the proposed emissions unit or stationary source.
(G) The permanence of emissions reductions may be demonstrated by federally enforceable changes in source permits
to reflect a reduced level of allowable emissions.
(8) Issuance, replacement unit. 

Where a new or modified stationary source is, in whole or in part, a replacement for an existing stationary source on
the same property, the EPA may allow a maximum of 90 days as a startup period for simultaneous operation of the existing
stationary source and the new source or replacement.
(9) 

Regulations in force. 

An Authority to Construct shall be granted or denied based on Best Available Control Technology requirements and
offset requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section in force on the date the application is deemed
complete as defined in  52.3000(b). In addition, the EPA shall deny an Authority to Construct for any new stationary
source or modification, or any portion thereof, unless:
(i) The new source or modification, or applicable portion thereof, complies with the provisions of this section and
all other applicable district rules and regulations; and
(ii) The owner or operator of the proposed new or modified source has certified that all existing major stationary
