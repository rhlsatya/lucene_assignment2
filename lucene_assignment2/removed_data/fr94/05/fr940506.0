ACTION:

 Final rule.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On January 6, 1993, the Food and Drug Administration announced in a final rule that, effective May 8, 1994, the current
food label reference values, the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowances (U.S.RDAs), will be identified as the Reference
Daily Intakes, or RDIs. This change is to be one of designation only and the reference values are not being modified.
The purpose of this rule is to replace the term ``U.S.RDA'' wherever used in Food and Nutrition Service program regulations
with ``RDI''. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Classification 


Executive Order 12866 


This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore has
not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 through
612). The Acting Administrator of FNS has certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities. The actual values used in the regulation are not being changed, only the name
for the values is changing. Therefore, this change will have no effect on small entities. 


Executive Order 12778 


This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have
preemptive effect with respect to any state or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions
or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless
so specified in the ``Effective Date'' section of this preamble. There are no administrative procedures which must
be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of its provisions. 


Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance 


The National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program are listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance
under No. 10.555 and 10.553 respectively. Both programs are subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which
requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (7 CFR part 3015, subpart V and final rule-related
notice at 48 FR 29112, June 24, 1983).

Paperwork Reduction Act 



No new data collection or recordkeeping requiring Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 through 3502) are included in this rule. 

The Administrator of FNS has determined pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B) that prior notice and comment on this rule
prior to implementation is unnecessary and contrary to public interest, and therefore good cause exists for making
this rule effective without prior public comment. This document makes technical changes and imposes no new requirements.
This rule updates 7 CFR parts 210 and 220 to incorporate a change made in the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) nutrition
labeling regulations. There is no need for public comment because the change from the U.S.RDA reference to the RDI
reference does not effect the basis of the regulation. In addition, FDA has already made this change in the nutrition
labeling regulations the competitive foods rule must make the change in order to refer to an accepted reference. 



Background 



The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that certain food products be labeled with information sufficient
to apprise consumers of the nutritional content and value of the products. Food product labels are required to indicate
on a per serving basis the percentage contribution of the product to the recommended daily consumption of certain
vitamins and minerals considered essential for human nutrition. The amounts of these vitamins and minerals recommended
for daily consumption are known as the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowances or U.S.RDAs. The U.S.RDAs are derived by
FDA from the ``Recommended Daily Allowances,'' published by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy
of Sciences-National Research Council (NAS-NRC). The Department employs the U.S.RDAs in the National School
Lunch, 7 CFR 210.11(b); Appendix B, and School Breakfast, 7 CFR 220.12(b)(1); appendix B, program regulations in
describing foods of minimal nutritional value which are prohibited from being sold in school food service areas during
regular meal service. The NAS-NRC Recommended Daily Allowances are referenced by the Department in the National
School Lunch and Food Stamp Program regulations to describe nutritional goals of the programs. 

In part to eliminate the public's confusion from the widespread use of both the U.S.RDAs and the NAS-NRC Recommended
Daily Allowances, and in part to reflect recent increases in the scientific knowledge concerning human nutrition
requirements, FDA is discontinuing use of the U.S.RDAs as of May 8, 1994. On that date, the U.S.RDAs will be replaced
by the Reference Daily Intakes, or RDIs, and the Daily Reference Values or DRVs. RDIs will be used to describe recommended
vitamin, mineral and protein consumption and DRVs in discussing fats and carbohydrates. RDI and DRV information
will not be used on food product labels. Rather, FDA is adopting a new nutrition labeling reference, known as the Daily
Value, which will combine RDI and DRV information and will be required on most packaged food products. 

To coincide with FDA's replacement of the U.S.RDAs with RDIs and DRVs, the Department is updating its references to
the U.S.RDAs in the regulations it administers. Effective May 8, 1994, the National School Lunch and School Breakfast
Program regulations will be amended by substituting the term RDI in place of U.S.RDA. The Department's current references
to the U.S.RDAs involve only vitamin and mineral content of food products. Therefore, no reference need be made by
the Department to the DRVs as that term will refer only to the fats and carbohydrates. References to the NAS-NRC
Recommended Daily Allowances in 7 CFR 210.10(b) and 272.5(b) will be unaffected by this regulatory change.

Discussion of the Rule 


Business and Industry Disaster (BID) loans guaranteed under the authority of the Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations
Act cover costs arising from 
the consequences of natural disasters, such as Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki and Typhoon Omar, that occur after August
23, 1992, and receive a Presidential declaration. Since the legislative authority to issue guarantees under BID
expired on September 30, 1993, a deadline of July 31, 1993, to file applications was placed in the regulation. This
was intended to give RDA staff time to process any applications before the guarantee authority expired. Due to additional
disasters that occurred in 1993, the application deadline is removed to allow additional time to apply for assistance.

This action was published as an interim rule in the 

Federal Register

 on August 3, 1993 (58 FR 41171), with a comment period ending September 2, 1993. No comments were received.

Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11 and MD-11F Series 
Airplanes Equipped With Honeywell Flight Management Computers 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11
and MD-11F series airplanes. This action requires deactivation of the Visual Omnidirectional Receiver/Localizer
(VOR/LOC) option by revising the program pin wiring for the Flight Management Computer/Flight Control Computer
(FMC/FCC). This amendment is prompted by reports of uncommanded roll mode changes on these airplanes during takeoff
and landing due to incorrect initialization of VOR/LOC logic within the FMC. The actions specified in this AD are intended
to prevent the airplane from deviating from its intended flight path due to an uncommanded change in the course of direction.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The FAA has received reports of uncommanded roll mode changes that have occurred on McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11
series airplanes during takeoff and landing. The airplanes involved in these incidents have been equipped with Honeywell
Flight Management Computers (FMC) having part numbers 4059050-907 and 4059050-908. The incidents occurred
when these FMC's were operating with the Visual Omnidirectional Receiver/Localizer (VOR/LOC) option selected.




Investigation revealed that these incidents of uncommanded roll mode changes were caused by one of the two FMC's not
automatically resetting or clearing all VOR mode logic upon landing. If the VOR mode was selected on the previous inbound
flight, and if this VOR mode is not automatically cleared after the airplane lands, the VOR logic may remain valid (in
operation) in one of the two FMC's onboard the airplane. If, during a subsequent flight, the autoflight system is engaged
to the FMC that still has the valid VOR 
logic [either by disconnecting the autopilot (AP) or by swapping autopilots (AP1 to AP2, or vice versa) with the ``AUTOFLIGHT''
switch], that FMC will automatically command the airplane into a VOR roll mode. The airplane will then follow this
VOR mode logic guidance and fly in a direction not planned by the flight crew. Such an uncommanded change in course direction,
if not corrected, could result in the airplane deviating from its intended flight path. 

The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas MD-11 Alert Service 
Bulletin A34-55, dated April 22, 1994, that describes procedures for deactivating the VOR/LOC option on the
subject Honeywell FMC's by removing the VOR/LOC pin from the Flight Management Computer/Flight Control Computer
(FMC/FCC) configuration plug on the main avionics rack. This procedure will minimize the possibility of uncommanded
roll mode changes. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Model MD-11 and MD-11F
series airplanes of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent the airplane from deviating from its intended
flight path due to an uncommanded change in the course of direction. This AD requires deactivating the VOR/LOC option
on certain Honeywell FMC's by removing the VOR/LOC pin from the FMC/FCC configuration plug on the main avionics rack.
The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 

Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.
 


Comments Invited 



Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption 

ADDRESSES.

 All communications received on 
or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received.
Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the
effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed. 
 
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, 
environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted
will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested
persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in
the Rules Docket. 

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments 
submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement
is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-57-AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned
to the commenter.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final 
regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the
Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Alteration of Jet Routes; FL 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action alters the descriptions of several jet routes in Florida. Alteration of the current jet route structure
between Charleston, SC, Ormond Beach, FL, Savannah, GA, and Craig, FL, will enhance safety by increasing separation
between Jet Routes J-79, J-121, J-174, and J-103 and the western boundary of Warning Areas
W-157, W-158, and W-159. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
History 


On April 5, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to alter the descriptions
of several jet routes in Florida (58 FR 17541). An increase in the separation of the current jet route structure between
Charleston, SC, Ormond Beach, FL, Savannah, GA, and Craig, FL, from the western boundary of Warning Areas W-157,
W-158, and W-159 will enhance safety. 
Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. One comment objecting to the proposal was received from the Air Transport Association (ATA).
The ATA believes that readjusting the boundaries of the warning areas is a better option for increasing the airspace
clearance between the jet routes and the warning areas rather than creating doglegs. ATA contends that these changes
will increase route mileage approximately .7 nautical miles, which translates into increased flight times, and
increased operating costs to the airline industry. 
In order to ensure adequate airspace separation between the warning areas' western boundaries and Jet Routes J-79,
J-121, J-174, and J-103, it is necessary to realign these jet routes. Experience has shown that during
the winter months, very strong westerly winds exist at the jet route altitudes which can cause aircraft to rapidly
drift east of course toward the western boundaries of the warning areas. By moving the jet routes further to the west,
this action will enhance safety by increasing the distance from the warning areas. 
Adjusting the boundaries of the warning areas is not a feasible alternative at this time. Radar, telemetry equipment,
and other range resources are strategically located based on existing warning area boundaries in order to support
the essential military activity. Relocation of these resources would be a costly and lengthy process. Therefore,
the FAA has determined that the most expeditious and cost-effective alternative is to alter the current jet route
structure. Except for editorial changes, and the previous amendments to Jet Routes J-79 and J-174 (contained
in Airspace Docket No. 92-ANE-45; effective May 27, 1993), this amendment is the same as that proposed
in the notice. Jet routes are published in paragraph 2004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September
16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The jet routes listed in this
document will be published subsequently in the Order. 


The Rule 


This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations alters the descriptions of several jet routes in Florida.
Alteration of the current jet route structures between Charleston, SC, Ormond Beach, FL, Savannah, GA, and Craig,
FL, will increase separation from the western boundary of Warning Areas W-157, W-158, and W-159
and the jet routes. 
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore (1) is not a ``significant

Establishment of Class E Airspace; Saint George Island, AK


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action establishes Class E airspace at Saint George Island, AK. A Non-Directional Beacon/Distance Measuring
Equipment (NDB/DME) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) has been developed for the new St. George Airport
at Saint George Island Controlled airspace extending from 700 and 1200 feet above ground level (AGL) is needed for
aircraft executing the approach and departure procedures. The area will be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide
a reference for pilots operating in the area.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
History


On February 23, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 10 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
Class E airspace at Saint George Island, AK. (59 FR 12874.) A SIAP was being developed for the New St. George Airport
at Saint George Island. The proposal was to add controlled airspace extending from 700 feet and 1200 feet AGL for Instrument
Flight Rules (IFR) operations during portions of the terminal operation and while transiting between the enroute
and terminal environments. 
Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No objections to the proposal were received. 
Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition
area,'' and controlled airspace extending upward from 700 or 1200 feet above ground level is now Class E airspace.
Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700/1200 feet or more above ground level are
published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). 
The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. 


The Rule 


This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Saint George Island,
AK, to provide controlled airspace from 700/1200 feet AGL for aircraft executing the NDB/DME SIAP and departure procedures
into and out of the New St. George Airport at Saint George Island. 
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action amends the Class E airspace at the Portland International Airport, Portland, OR. Establishment of a new

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

History 



On February 23, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend
the Class E airspace for the Portland International Airport, Portland, OR (59 FR 8568). Except for a typographical
omission of one line in the description, and reconsideration and deletion of another line in the description, this
rule is the same. No additional airspace, except that required for the new procedure, is required to compensate for
those omissions and deletions. Interested parties were invited to participate in the rulemaking process by submitting
such written data, views, or arguments as they desired. No comments were received. 

Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued use of the terms ``control zone extension''
and ``transition area,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class E airspace.'' Class E airspace designations
for airspace areas extending upward from the surface of the earth, and Class E airspace designations for airspace
areas extending upward from 700 feet above ground level, are published in Paragraphs 6003 and 6005 respectively,
of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14
CFR 71.1 as of September 16, 1993 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designations listed in this document
will be published subsequently in the Order. The coordinates in this final rule are in North American Datum 83. 



The Rule 



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends Class E airspace at Portland, Oregon. It will
provide controlled airspace for a new instrument approach procedure at the Portland International Airport. Amendment
of the Class E airspace will result in greater safety and efficiency at, and in the vicinity of, the airport. The FAA
has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent
and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Modification of Class D Airspace and Establishment of Class E Airspace



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action modifies the Class D airspace areas at Adak, Anchorage Merrill Field, Bethel, Juneau, Kenai, King Salmon,
and Kodiak, AK, by amending the areas' effective hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours of operation.
This action also establishes Class E airspace at these areas when the associated control tower is closed. The intended
effect of this action is to clarify when two-way radio communication with these air traffic control towers is required
and to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument approach procedures when these control towers are closed.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Request for Comments on the Rule



Although this action is in the form of a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are
invited on the rule. When the comment period ends, the FAA will use the comments submitted, together with other available
information, to review the regulation. If the FAA receives no adverse comments in response to this action, this rule
will become effective on the date specified in the ``DATES

'' section. After the review, if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will initiate rulemaking proceedings
to amend the regulation.

Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful
in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are
specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects
of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule.



The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace areas at
Adak, Anchorage Merrill Field, Bethel, Juneau, Kenai, King Salmon, and Kodiak, AK, by amending the areas' effective
hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours of operation. This action also establishes Class E airspace
at these areas when the associated control tower is closed. Prior to Airspace Reclassification, an airport traffic
area (ATA) and a control zone (CZ) existed at these airports. However, Airspace Reclassification, effective September
16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zone,'' replacing them with the
designation ``Class D airspace.'' The former CZ was continuous, while the former ATA was contingent upon the operation
of the air traffic control tower. The consolidation of the ATA and CZ into a single Class D airspace designation makes
it necessary to modify the effective hours of the Class D airspace to coincide with the control tower's hours of operation.
The action also establishes Class E airspace during the hours the control tower is closed. The intended effect of this
action is to clarify when two-way radio communication with these air traffic control towers is required and to provide
adequate Class E airspace for instrument approach procedures when these control towers are closed.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and E airspace designations
are published in Paragraphs 5000 and 6002, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September
16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D and E airspace designations
listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes
that there is an immediate need to modify these Class D and establish these Class E airspace areas in order to promote
the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures
under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Rule Concerning Disclosures of Energy Consumption and Water Use Information About Certain Home Appliances and Other
Products Required Under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act; Range of Comparability for Clothes Washers




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Trade Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Trade Commission announces that the present ranges of comparability for clothes washers will remain
in effect until new ranges are published. Under the Appliance Labeling Rule, each required label on a covered appliance
must show a range, or scale, indicating the range of energy costs or efficiencies for all models of a size or capacity
comparable to the labeled model. The Commission publishes the ranges annually in the 

Federal Register 

if the upper or lower limits of the range change by 15% or more from the previously published range. If the Commission
does not publish a revised range, it must publish a notice that the prior range will be applicable until new ranges are
published. The Commission is today announcing that the ranges published on April 16, 1991, will remain in effect until
new ranges are published.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On November 19, 1979, the Commission issued a final rule,
 pursuant to section 324 of the Energy Policy an Conservation Act of 1975,
 covering certain appliance categories, including clothes washers. The rule requires that energy costs and related
information be disclosed on labels and in retail sales catalogs for all clothes washers presently manufactured.
Certain point-of-sale promotional materials must disclose the availability of energy usage information. If a clothes
washer is advertised in a catalog from which it may be purchased by cash, charge account or credit terms, then the range
of estimated annual energy costs for the product must be included on each page of the catalog that lists the product.
The required disclosures and all claims concerning energy consumption made in writing or in broadcast advertisements
must be based on the results of test procedures developed by the Department of Energy, which are referenced in the rule.






Section 305.8(b) of the rule requires manufacturers to report the energy usage of their models annually by specified
dates for each product type.
 Because the costs for the various types of energy change yearly, and because manufacturers regularly add new models
to their lines, improve existing models and drop others, the data base from which the ranges of comparability are calculated
is constantly changing.




To keep the required information in line with these changes, under  305.10 of the rule, the Commission publishes
new ranges (but not more often than annually) if an analysis of the new data indicates that the upper or lower limits
of the ranges have changed by more than 15% Otherwise, the Commission publishes a statement that the prior range or
ranges remain in effect for the next year.


The annual reports for clothes washers have been received and analyzed and it has been determined to retain the ranges
that were published on April 16, 1991.
 In consideration of the foregoing, the present ranges for clothes washers, which were based on a national average
electric rate of 8.24 cents per kilowatt hour and a national average natural gas rate of 60.54 cents per therm, will
remain in effect until the Commission publishes new ranges for these products.

Order No. 563-A 
Order on Rehearing


Issued May 2, 1994.



I. Introduction 



In Order No. 563,
 the Commission adopted a final rule requiring the standardization of information relating to transportation of
natural gas across the interstate pipeline grid. The standards adopted by the Commission reflected the consensus
agreements reached by the natural gas industry through a series of informal conferences established by the Commission.
Under these standards, pipelines will have to provide access to the required information both on their Electronic
Bulletin Boards (EBBS) and through files which users can download from the pipelines' computers to their own computers.
Pipelines are required to implement the requirements of this rule by June 1, 1994, except for the requirements regarding
a common code for gas transaction points which are to be implemented by November 1, 1994.

Nineteen parties have sought rehearing or clarification regarding some of the requirements of the rule and the standards
and communication protocols.

2

 The Commission grants rehearing on one issue, downloads in a standardized ASCII flat file format. The Commission
had required pipelines to provide for file downloads in two formats: The first complied with established communication
standards and protocols for Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and the second would have required that downloads
be made available in a standardized ASCII flat file specified by the Commission. The Commission agrees with those
seeking rehearing that the future of communications in the industry will be enhanced by the development of one industry
standard based on established communication standards and protocols, rather than by promulgation of a second non-standardized
methodology that has significant disadvantages compared with EDI. The Commission also clarifies the requirements
of the rule and the protocols as discussed below.





II. Background and Summary of Order No. 563



In Order No. 636,

3

 the Commission required pipelines to establish EBBs to provide shippers with equal and timely access to relevant
information about the availability of service on their systems, including service available through capacity release
transactions and firm and interruptible capacity available directly from the pipeline.

4

 The Commission recognized that the efficiency of capacity allocation would be enhanced by standardizing both the
content of capacity release information and the methods by which shippers could access that information.

5









To facilitate the development of industry standards, the Commission established informal conferences between
the staff and all interested members of the gas industry. The participants at these conferences divided their efforts
into five Working Groups.

6

 The Working Groups submitted a series of reports to the Commission summarizing their deliberations and the agreements
reached. The Commission noticed these reports and provided an opportunity for public comment.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940506-0-00021 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940506-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The final rule adopted the consensus agreements reached by the industry in the Working Groups, with only slight modifications.
Sections 284.8(b)(5) and 284.9(b)(4) require pipelines to provide standardized information relating to firm and
interruptible service on their EBBs and to provide users with the ability to download the standardized information
in compliance with standardized procedures and protocols. The rule provides that the details of the required information,
procedures, and protocols will be made available in a document entitled ``Standardized Data Sets and Communication
Protocols,'' which will be available at the Commission's Public Reference and Files Maintenance Branch.

The standardized data sets specify the information concerning capacity availability that pipelines must provide
both on their on-line EBBs and through downloadable files.

7

 This information includes offers to sell firm capacity (either by the pipeline or releasing shippers), bids for capacity,
awards of capacity, withdrawals of capacity offers and bids, operationally available (

i.e.,

 interruptible) and unsubscribed firm capacity, and system-wide notices. In addition, the Commission established
a mechanism for creating a common code data base for identifying pipeline transaction points, such as receipt and
delivery points.





The communication protocols establish principles and procedures relating to the operation of pipeline EBBs and
the provision of downloadable files to users. The most important of these protocols is the requirement that the pipelines
provide downloadable files that conform to the standards for Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) promulgated by the
American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X12.

8

 In addition to EDI, the Commission had required the pipelines to provide for file downloads in a standardized ASCII
flat file format,

9

 but the Commission is deleting this requirement on rehearing.






In the rule, the Commission recognized that as pipelines began the process of implementing the data sets, they could
discover problems requiring modifications. The Commission stated that pipelines should communicate any problems
to the Working Groups, which should make the necessary modifications to the data set and submit them to the Commission
in sufficient time to permit implementation of the requirements by June 1, 1994.

On March 4, 1994, Working Groups 1 & 2 filed revised capacity release data sets and an implementation guide for
downloading these data sets using EDI. Public notice was given of the filing with an opportunity for comments. By order
dated April 1, 1994, the Commission accepted the revised data sets and implementation guide.

10







The initial Working Group reports included a number of issues on which the Working Groups had not yet reached agreement.
In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR), the Commission concluded that the Working Groups should take more time
to consider these issues and try to reach consensus. The Commission provided that the Working Groups submit reports
on these matters to the Commission by February 1, 1994. In Order No. 563, the Commission found that resolution of these
issues should await the February 1, 1994 reports. Nevertheless, many of the requests for rehearing and clarification
address the same issues.

The Commission has received a number of reports from the Working Groups, which were publicly noticed with an opportunity
for comments.

11

 When appropriate, the Commission will address these issues in this order to provide the Working Groups with guidance
as to how to proceed.





The Commission will address the issues raised by the rehearing requests in the following areas: data set implementation
and maintenance; specific information included, or proposed to be included, in the data sets (operationally available
capacity, unsubscribed firm capacity, and firm and interruptible flowing volume); electronic communication issues
(ASCII flat file downloads, file uploads, and subset downloads); common codes for companies and gas transaction
points; additional standards for an Index of Purchasers and non-capacity business transactions; and proposals
relating to the method for recovering the costs for implementing standards.

III. Issues Relating to Data Set Implementation And Maintenance 


A. Implementation Date 


AER/MRT contend that the June 1, 1994 implementation date places too great a burden on the pipelines, because they
are still in the midst of refining their restructured services and the compliance burden falls during the critical
shoulder months between January and March. They suggest a December 1, 1994 date. In particular, they contend that
they require the implementation guide for the ASC X12 data sets by February 1, 1994, and suggest that, if that date is
not met, the June 1, 1994 date should be relaxed. 
The Commission will not change the implementation date. In Order No. 563, the Commission agreed to extend the implementation
date from the April 1, 1994 date proposed in the NOPR until June 1, 1994. But, with this extension, the Commission expected
a fully operational set of standards to be in place by June 1. Working Groups 1 and 2 stated in their comments that the
June 1 date can be met if the ASC X12 implementation guide is available by March 1, 1994, and the Working Groups substantially
met this deadline, filing the data sets and implementation guide with the Commission on March 4, 1994, with public
notice given on March 7, 1994. AER/MRT is the only party alleging that the June 1 date cannot be met, and they have not
provided sufficient justification for extending the date further. 


B. Periodic Reports 


In Order No. 563, the Commission found no need for requiring pipelines to file tariffs specifying how they would comply
with the rule or to file periodic reports of their implementation progress. UDC/AGD renew their request that pipelines
be required to file periodic reports. Without such reports, they maintain no formal procedure would exist to provide
information on implementation progress or problems. They further claim such reports would provide useful information
about the development of the secondary market and the interplay between interruptible and released capacity. 
The Commission denies the request for rehearing. As stated in Order No. 563, the Commission will monitor implementation
of the rule by accessing the pipelines' EBBs, continuing to hold industry conferences, and by examining complaints.
These mechanisms provide a far more flexible method of oversight than attempting to specify particular items of information
for inclusion in periodic reports. As stated earlier, the Commission is committed to monitoring the EBBs and the implementation
of the standards, and to making revisions when needed. 


C. Mechanism for Making Revisions to the Data Sets 


In Order No. 563, the Commission recognized that the standardization process was an ongoing one, which would require
revisions and modifications to the data sets and protocols as the industry obtains experience with operations under
the standards. The Commission stated it would continue the informal conferences and the Working Groups as the best
means for monitoring the standards, but did not adopt a specific mechanism for implementing proposed changes. The
Commission found that its determination of the proper method for making revisions may depend on the type of change
contemplated. The Commission stated, however, that in considering proposed changes, it would comply with the Administrative
Procedure Act (APA) and ensure parties have notice and an opportunity to comment on proposed changes. 
Tenneco Gas asserts that providing a mechanism for addressing changes to the standards is critical and requests the
Commission to adopt a specific mechanism for making changes, which is both flexible and responsive. KGPC contends
many participants are unable to commit the resources to remain actively involved in the Working Group process and
urges the Commission to ensure adequate communication to the industry of proposed changes with an opportunity for
comment. AER/MRT similarly request clarification that the Commission will comply with the APA and provide notice
and an opportunity for comment. 
The Commission recognizes that the standards and protocols will have to be revised and that a flexible mechanism is
needed for effectuating such changes. To provide the needed flexibility, the Commission adopted only a general regulation
referencing the separate standards and protocols and did not include those standards and protocols in the Code of
Federal Regulations. However, as explained in Order No. 563, the Commission cannot commit to one method for making
revisions because different circumstances may demand different procedural mechanisms; for example, maintenance
of the existing data sets may be treated differently than implementation of new requirements. As stated in Order No.
563, in making changes, the Commission will adhere to the APA and provide notice and an opportunity for public comment
before implementing changes.

The Commission will clarify that the process for maintenance of the data sets promulgated in the rule will be generally
the same as the process used previously to adopt the revised data sets and implementation guide. The Working Groups
will file their suggested changes, which will be noticed with an opportunity provided for comment. To facilitate
discussion or improve understanding of proposed changes, Commission staff may convene a technical conference to
review the changes with the industry. The Commission will then issue an order adopting the data sets. This process
will enable the Commission to make changes in a timely fashion while still preserving the industry's ability to comment
on the changes. The Commission also encourages the Working Groups to consider other methods of informing non-participants
of impending changes prior to filing with the Commission so that the Working Groups themselves will be able to avail
themselves of a broad spectrum of input. 
While the Commission recognizes the need to revise the data sets, it also recognizes that making revisions and changes
on a piecemeal basis may be cumbersome and create added programming costs for both the pipelines and those obtaining
information either from the EBBs or through downloadable files. The Commission encourages the Working Groups to
consider an appropriate schedule for accumulating and submitting revisions. 
Tenneco Gas states it did not understand that the Working Groups would continue indefinitely. AER/MRT contend that
the Working Groups provide only a temporary solution and urge the Commission to recognize the contemplated Gas Industry
Standards Board (GISB) as the appropriate group to handle standards development. Although GISB is still in its formative
stage, AER/MRT recommend the Commission endorse GISB and charge it with the mission of further standards development.
Columbia Distribution suggests that one Working Group would be more efficient than the current five, because the
participants in the five Working Groups are essentially the same and one Working Group would streamline the process.

The Commission finds that some mechanism for consideration and modification of the standards, whether GISB or the
Working Groups, must continue into the future. At this point, reliance on the GISB concept is premature, and the Commission
will continue the Working Group process which has worked very well in developing standards. As stated in Order No.
563, the Commission will consider the GISB concept when a final proposal has been developed and the Commission can
consider its impact on all facets of the gas industry. Meanwhile, the Working Groups should not delay or defer development
of standards in anticipation of the implementation of GISB. The Commission will leave the structure of the Working
Groups to be resolved by the industry at the informal conferences.

D. Operation of the Data Sets 



1. Mandatory, Optional, and Conditional Nature of the Fields 



In the consensus data sets adopted by Order No. 563, data fields were denominated as mandatory, optional, and conditional.

13

 The Commission found that the rule required all pipelines to support the mandatory data fields. Pipelines would choose
whether to support the optional fields, unless they were required to support these fields by their tariff. The Commission
also stated that pipelines were required to display all information, whether mandatory or optional, on their on-line
EBBs. 





AER/MRT seek clarification that the Commission was standardizing only the information to be provided on the on-line
EBBs, not the format in which the information is to be displayed. Others seek clarification about the display of all
the mandatory data fields on the on-line EBBs.

14

 They contend certain mandatory fields in the downloadable data sets are required only for file transfers, but not
for interactive, on-line transactions. They assert users of on-line EBBs will know some of the information in the
mandatory fields without having it displayed, so that required posting of the information is unnecessary and will
only clutter the EBB screens.

15

 They maintain that the only requirement should be that the on-line EBB contain information comparable to the data
sets. 






KGPC, PEC Pipeline Group, and AER/MRT also request clarification that pipelines are not required to display optional
information on their on-line EBBs unless they choose to do so or their tariffs require the display of that information.
NGC requests clarification that pipelines must support the conditional fields. 

The Commission will clarify its requirements. The Commission required all pipelines to support the mandatory fields
because Order No. 563 included certain substantive requirements that pipelines may not previously have been required
by their restructuring orders to disclose on their EBBs. For example, not all pipelines may be providing the information
found in the operationally available capacity and critical notice data sets on their EBBs. The intent of the requirement
was only to ensure that the downloadable data sets and the on-line EBBs conveyed comparable information. Accordingly,
the Commission agrees that fields not required for on-line EBB use need not be displayed, so long as the on-line EBB
and the downloadable data set convey comparable information.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940506-0-00025 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940506-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Display of optional fields on the on-line EBB must take place when such fields are included in the downloadable data
sets (unless, as stated above, they are not necessary for on-line use). Conditional fields must be supported by the
pipelines when the conditional field is dependent on information in a mandatory field.

16

 If the conditional field is predicated on the response to an optional field, the conditional field will have to be supported
only if the pipeline supports the optional field. 





2. Pipeline Modification of the Data Sets 



In Order No. 563, the Commission stated that pipelines could not add fields to, or delete fields from, the data sets,
finding that standardization required that all pipelines use the same structure for downloading. ASC X12 software
is keyed to specific fields on the implementation guide, and the Commission was concerned that if pipelines could
add or delete fields, shippers' software could not interpret the information. The Commission pointed out that the
data sets were designed flexibly to accommodate special release offers or unique circumstances by including fields
for special terms and miscellaneous notes. 

KGPC contends EDI permits the addition of fields without inhibiting communication with parties not using the additional
fields. It asserts the Commission should not unnecessarily inhibit the ability of the pipelines to customize their
EDI transactions with trading partners. 

Although KGPC is correct that fields can be added to the ASC X12 data sets without affecting the ability of others to
use the original version, the Commission is concerned that if pipelines routinely add fields, the result would be
a plethora of non-standard data bases, and users of multiple pipeline data bases could have difficulty accessing
information that others could obtain.

17

 The Commission, therefore, will not permit pipelines to add additional fields. 





Working Groups 1 & 2 are concerned about situations in which the circumstances facing a particular pipeline do
not fit the standardized format. They cite, as an example, a mandatory data field denominated a yes/no (Y/N) field
and a pipeline needing a third category (U) for unknown. They suggest the following working principle for dealing
with these problems: the pipeline will make a good faith effort to comply with the data sets, but if it cannot, it must
explain any discrepancies and seek a correction through the Working Group process. 

The Commission is concerned about pipelines changing the meaning of data set items. While the addition of an unknown
element for a field, as Working Group 1 & 2 suggest, would seem unlikely to cause major communication difficulties,
the Commission cannot determine whether other changes in meaning might adversely affect those seeking to obtain
information from multiple pipelines.

18

 Thus, pipelines should make every effort to use the data sets as promulgated, for instance, using a ``no'' indicator
or the miscellaneous note field even if these are not optimum solutions. When pipelines encounter difficulties in
using the standardized data sets, they should inform the Working Groups so that revisions can be considered. Once
changes are received from the Working Groups, the Commission is committed to reviewing them as quickly as possible,
but the Working Group changes may not be implemented unilaterally without Commission approval. 





IV. Issues Relating to Specific Information Included in the Data Sets 



A. Operationally Available (Unscheduled) Capacity 



The Commission adopted the Working Groups' consensus agreement to require the pipelines to provide information
on the amount of unscheduled capacity available at specific locations, such as receipt and delivery points, mainline,
or mainline segments. The Commission found that this information satisfied the pipelines' obligation to post the
capacity available for interruptible service.

19

<DOCNO> FR940506-0-00026 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940506-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

1. Objection To Posting the Amount of Operationally Available Capacity 



TGPL requests rehearing of the requirement to post the actual quantity of unscheduled capacity. It contends the posting
of detailed information on unscheduled capacity will serve only to reduce the value of interruptible and firm service,
because potential shippers can use the unscheduled capacity information to demand the lowest price for the capacity.
It asserts the regulatory obligation to post interruptible capacity could be satisfied by the pipelines simply indicating
that interruptible capacity is available. 

The Commission denies TGPL's rehearing request. The Working Groups reached a consensus agreement to provide unscheduled
capacity, and TGPL is the only party raising an objection. Moreover, a marker indicating that interruptible capacity
is available is not sufficient to comport with the regulatory requirement to post available capacity. Under the Commission's
open access regulations, pipelines cannot withhold available capacity, and shippers, therefore, have the right
to know the amount of capacity available. Moreover, shippers need to know the amount of interruptible capacity available
in order to make a reasonable determination of whether interruptible service is sufficient for their needs or whether
they need to seek released firm service. 



2. Derivation of the Estimates of Operationally Available Capacity 



In Order No. 563, the Commission stated that the data for operationally available capacity could be estimates, and
left to the Working Groups the issue of whether an additional field would be needed to describe how the estimates were
derived. Working Groups 1 & 2 reached agreement that a new field was not needed. They suggest a good faith effort
by each pipeline to provide a commercially reasonable estimate using internally consistent methods is sufficient.
The Commission, therefore, will not require the additional field at this time. 



B. Unsubscribed Firm Capacity 



KGPC requests clarification that the Commission's reference in Order No. 563 to pipelines' posting their available
firm capacity in the offer data set does not require any change in its current practices for posting its available firm
capacity. KGPC states that, because it is a grid system with thousands of receipt and delivery points, it cannot post
in the offer data set the myriad configurations of firm capacity paths that might be available.

20

 Instead, it states that it posts on its EBB the capacity available at each point and the subscribed capacity at each
point. Potential shippers then request possible combinations of capacity paths, and if KGPC determines firm capacity
is available along these paths, the resulting firm service will be posted in the capacity offer section of the EBB.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940506-0-00027 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940506-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The revised data sets submitted by Working Groups 1 & 2, and adopted by the Commission have accommodated KGPC's
concern. The operationally available capacity data set includes fields permitting pipelines to post unsubscribed
capacity available at receipt and delivery points, as KGPC states it does now. Once a potential shipper submits a request
for a capacity path that is available, the pipeline would then post the offer for that path in the offer data set. 



C. Information on Firm and Interruptible Flowing Volume 



NGSA and NGC contend the Commission needs to require additional information to satisfy the pipelines' obligations
to post available firm and interruptible service.

21

 NGSA asserts the firm capacity available through capacity release is only a piece of the total picture of firm capacity
needed by potential shippers. NGSA contends the Commission also should require pipelines to post the total amount
of unscheduled (potentially available) firm capacity. NGC contends potential shippers cannot make reasonable
pricing decisions unless they know flowing primary firm volumes, flowing secondary firm volumes, flowing interruptible
volumes, and unscheduled volumes. KGPC, on the other hand, maintains that the Commission should not require the posting
of any information in addition to the unscheduled capacity already required. 





Working Groups 1 & 2 were unable to reach consensus on whether to require additional information about firm and
interruptible volumes or nominations at each point. Their February 24, 1994 report contained papers from three groups
on this issue. One group

22

 supported the arguments of NGSA and NGC that detailed information about flowing firm and interruptible volumes is
needed for shippers to make informed decisions about the capacity to purchase. 





A second group

23

 opposes providing any additional data. They contend the information is not readily available, the costs of providing
it would be high, and the information is not related to capacity release. They also assert the information would tilt
the capacity release market to favor capacity seekers at the expense of capacity holders. Whenever the information
showed that significant interruptible volumes are scheduled to flow, they maintain the value of released firm capacity
would be devalued. They further contend the now devalued released capacity will displace interruptible pipeline
capacity, thereby reducing the interruptible revenue credits provided to firm shippers. 





A third group

24

 submitted a compromise seeking to balance the need for information about flowing volumes with the costs of providing
that information. Under their proposal, the pipelines would provide a ``flag'' indicating that interruptible volumes
are flowing at a point which would otherwise have no operationally available capacity. They assert that this flag
would alert both buyers and sellers that firm capacity at the point is available and could be valuable: if interruptible
volumes are flowing at a point that is operationally full, a purchaser of firm capacity could bump the interruptible
shippers.

25

 They assert the cost of providing this flag is less than the cost of providing the estimated quantities. 






Public notice of these filings was given on March 3, 1994, and the PEC Pipeline Group submitted a comment supporting
the interruptible flag proposal. It contends the flag provides a reliable indicator of the availability of firm capacity
(by showing that interruptible gas is flowing), but at a fraction of the cost of the proposal to post flowing volumes.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940506-0-00028 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940506-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission finds that the flag proposal identifying when interruptible capacity is flowing at constraint points
provides a reasonable compromise between informing users that firm capacity may be available at certain locations
and the costs of providing that information. With the addition of information on interruptible capacity provided
by the ``flag,'' shippers will have a sufficiently broad range of information about capacity availability. They
will know the amount of capacity available at points (operationally available capacity), whether firm capacity
is available at constraint points (interruptible flag), the firm capacity available through posted release transactions,
and the unsubscribed firm capacity available from the pipeline. This information should be sufficient for shippers
to make reasonable decisions about the transportation option to select. The Working Groups must include the interruptible
flag in the next iteration of the data sets. 



V. Electronic Data Interchange 



A. ASCII Flat File Downloads 



In addition to adopting the consensus agreement to require EBB operators to provide for electronic file downloading
using EDI, the Commission also required pipelines to make the data sets available in a standardized ASCII flat file
format in an effort to ease the transition to EDI for those not familiar with this technology. The Gas*Flow group, which
was to develop the EDI implementation guide, also was to provide the ASCII flat file formats. 

A number of parties seek rehearing or modification of the requirement to provide downloads in a standardized ASCII
flat file format.

26

 They contend the requirement for ASCII flat file downloads goes beyond the consensus agreement of Working Group 4,
which left the provision of ASCII flat file downloads up to the pipeline. They assert that imposing a redundant download
capability is costly and provides little benefit. Natural and INGAA contend the requirement is unjustified since
only two comments on the NOPR requested ASCII flat file downloads and the Commission failed to make an effort to estimate
the number of customers wanting to use ASCII flat files. Tenneco Gas maintains ASCII flat file downloads pose a risk
to the receiver of information, because they do not contain the safeguards inherent in the ASC X12 process. AER/MRT
assert the Commission should limit the requirement to provide ASCII flat file downloads to seven months, which will
provide a sufficient transition period while reducing the burden on the pipeline to maintain two formats indefinitely.
A number of parties also argue that Gas*Flow will not be supporting ASCII flat file standards because such an effort
goes beyond its charter.

27

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940506-0-00029 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940506-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Working Groups 1 & 2, PEC Pipeline Group, TGPL, and Tenneco Gas suggest that, if the ASCII flat file requirement
is not eliminated, the Commission modify the requirement that the pipelines provide ASCII flat file downloads according
to a standardized format. Instead, they recommend the pipelines be free to develop their own ASCII flat file format.

28

 TGPL believes standardization is not needed because customers wanting to use ASCII flat files in place of ASC X12 are
most likely to be small customers transacting business primarily, if not exclusively, on a single pipeline. 





The Commission also has received filings from Working Group 3 and other parties arguing that while ASCII flat file
downloads are easy to document and import into spreadsheet programs, communication using ASCII flat files has significant
disadvantages when compared with ASC X12 communication.

29

 The cited disadvantages of ASCII flat file downloads are: the ASCII flat file format itself is inefficient and inflexible,
because it relies on sequential data display; ASCII flat files are less reliable because validation programs are
available for ASC X12, but not for ASCII flat files; the lack of validation also makes using ASCII flat files more labor
intensive and expensive; and ASCII flat files do not provide a foundation for further standardization in the industry
as does ASC X12. 




Although Enron Gas Services Corporation created an ASCII flat file format should the Commission wish to use it, neither
Enron nor Gas*Flow supports the use of ASCII downloads. Enron further states that requiring pipelines to provide
ASCII flat file downloads is not necessary even for users wanting to use a flat file format. It maintains that these
users can obtain commercially available software at low cost which will translate the ASC X12 information into an
ASCII flat file format. 
The Commission will grant rehearing and eliminate the requirement that pipelines provide an ASCII flat file download.

30

 Working Group 4 reached consensus on using only EDI as the industry standard for file downloading.

31

 Both Working Groups 1 & 2 and Working Group 3 oppose the ASCII flat file requirement as not being in the long term
interest of the industry. Moreover in response to the NOPR's request for comment on this issue, only two commenters
favored a requirement that pipelines provide a flat ASCII download. 





On reconsideration, the Commission agrees with those requesting rehearing that the future of electronic communications
in this industry will be better served by establishing one industry standard based on already established communication
protocols, such as ASC X12 EDI, rather than by developing a second system which is not based on recognized communication
standards and which would provide a less reliable method of communication. The provision of a transition period to
EDI does not warrant the expense of establishing a standardized ASCII download capability. Users that are not currently
EDI capable will still be able to use the EBBs to conduct capacity release transactions while they are learning EDI.

32

 In addition, ASCII flat files may be designed in different configurations depending on the customer's use for that
data. The Commission's specification of a particular format, therefore, would not necessarily have met customers'
needs. 




Moreover, the Commission's adoption of ASC X12 EDI standards for communication has created the foundation for software
vendors to develop specific software or other services which will convert the standardized ASC X12 EDI data into the
file structures needed by users, whether large or small. For example, in other industries, software vendors have
developed low-cost desktop EDI translators for personal computers that convert from EDI to a flat ASCII file structure
(a ``canned'' file structure) without the user having to understand EDI or learn how to program or operate the translator.

33

 The Commission is confident that all customers will be able to acquire software or other services that meet their individual
data communication needs at reasonable prices. Relying on the market to develop such services is preferable to the
Commission mandating a second file download structure that may not even provide a good fit with customers' needs.

B. Uploading and Subset Downloading 


In Order No. 563, the Commission stated that the ability of users to transmit (upload) capacity release files to the
pipelines' computers and to download subsets of files would enhance communication efficiency for capacity release
transactions. File upload capability would permit users to submit offers to release and bids without using the pipelines'
EBBs, while subset downloads would permit users to obtain only the capacity release files they need. 
KGPC contends the development of file uploads and subset downloads should be driven by market demand, so the pipeline
has some assurance its customers want the service before being compelled to provide it. Tenneco Gas suggests the development
of file uploads for capacity be delayed until after the upload capability being developed by the Working Groups for
nominations and confirmations is underway. It contends most industry participants at the Commission's conference
gave first priority to the development of upload capability for nominations and that upload capability for capacity
release, particularly for bids, is more difficult to develop. It also states upload capability should be market driven,
because the parties supplying the upload information are not pipelines. NGSA supports the development of file upload
and subset download capability and suggests this task is within the purview of Working Group 1, not Working Group 4
(as stated by the Commission). 
In their March 4, 1994, filing, Working Groups 1 & 2 provided data sets that would enable users to download subsets
of capacity release information and these have been adopted by the Commission. Working Groups 1 & 2 have agreed
to report by June 1, 1994 on capacity release uploading and ask the Commission not to prejudge the issue. 
The Commission still is interested in the use of file uploads to facilitate capacity release by eliminating the need
for shippers and bidders to go through the process of signing-on to EBBs to submit offers and bids. But the Commission
will not require the Working Groups to go forward with this approach until Working Groups 1 & 2 have the opportunity
to make their June 1, 1994 filing on this issue. 


VI. Common Codes 


A. Common Company Codes 


In the NOPR, the Commission stated that it expected Working Group 5 to finalize its proposal for identifying companies
by use of a common code by February 1, 1994. In its March 24, 1994 report, the Working Group stated it has reached consensus
on a procedure for assigning company codes. The Working Group states that use of company names alone is unreliable
because different abbreviations and aliases would render electronic posting ineffective. The Working Group, therefore,
selected the D-U-N-S Number assigned to companies by the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation as the common code number.
The Working Group states that Dun & Bradstreet will assign a D-U-N-S number free of charge to any company that can
establish that it is a business entity located at a specific address and engaged in a legitimate business. Dun &
Bradstreet also allows trading partners to exchange D-U-N-S numbers without charge and will provide the company
name and address corresponding to a D-U-N-S number to any other party requesting the information for internal use.

The Working Group proposes that pipelines provide a means by which capacity release participants can provide common
code numbers to be used in EDI transactions involving the capacity release data sets. The participants would be solely
responsible for obtaining the common code numbers from Dun & Bradstreet and providing them to the pipeline. Those
participants that do not have a D-U-N-S number would so inform the pipeline and only their company name would be included
in the data sets. The Working Group asserts this process would be self-implementing by the participants and would
not require any new institutional arrangements to implement.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940506-0-00031 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940506-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The National Registry submitted comments stating that its understanding of the Working Group 5 agreement was that
any company having one or more D-U-N-S numbers would supply at least one valid D-U-N-S number to the pipeline. According
to the National Registry, the only exception to the requirement is when a company does not have a D-U-N-S number. The
National Registry further contends that D-U-N-S numbers should be included in any of the data sets when releaser or
bidder company name information is supplied. Great Lakes Gas Transmission Limited Partnership (Great Lakes) supports
the Working Group 5 proposal because parties can acquire D-U-N-S numbers at no charge and the use of D-U-N-S numbers
is self-implementing by capacity release participants. 


The Commission already has adopted the revised data sets submitted by Working Groups 1 & 2 which contain fields
for display of D-U-N-S numbers. No further Commission action on this proposal seems required at this time. Those using
the EBB should provide the pipelines with their D-U-N-S numbers (if they have them) and the pipelines will display
those numbers on their EBBs and the downloadable data sets. 



B. Common Transaction Point Codes 



In Order No. 563, the Commission accepted the consensus approach proposed by Working Group 5 for identifying common
pipeline transaction points. Under this approach, a third-party code assignor, the Petroleum Information Corporation
(PI-GRID), will prepare a computerized cross-reference table correlating pipelines' proprietary codes (as verified
and updated by the pipelines) to a common code. Those wanting to use the common code will maintain the cross-reference
table on their computers and can convert proprietary pipeline codes to the common code, and 

vice versa.

 All transactions with the pipeline will take place using the pipelines' proprietary codes. 

In the communication protocols, the Commission required the pipelines to provide the validated computerized data
base by November 1, 1994. Pipelines were required to verify the required information about their transaction points
to the code assignor. The Commission also required each pipeline to provide the code assignor with sufficient information
to enable users to locate the position of each common code point on that pipeline in relation to other points, such as
by using geographic coordinates, line numbers, or line markers. In line with the Working Group proposal, the Commission
required the pipelines to ensure that users can obtain the common code data base from PI-GRID, and any updates, without
charge, except for reasonable distribution and handling fees. 



1. Pipeline Responsibility To Provide the Data Base and Ensure Reasonable Fees 



Columbia Distribution contends the use of the common code translation table is an inefficient method of communicating
common codes. Instead, it maintains the Commission should require the pipelines to adopt the common code. 

Several parties object to the Commission's requirement that the pipelines be responsible for ensuring that a validated
computerized base is available by November 1, 1994, and that the fees charged by PI-GRID are reasonable.

34

 They contend the Commission's requirements are at odds with the Working Group 5 process in which an industry consortium
would be negotiating and signing the contract with PI-GRID. TGPL argues that placing the compliance burden on the
pipelines gives PI-GRID unreasonable leverage in negotiating its duties as code assignor. TGPL asserts the Commission
should do nothing more than accept the Working Group 5 proposal and require the pipelines to validate their proprietary
point information to PI-GRID. KGPC suggests that the Commission set up a process to monitor the provision of services
by PI-GRID, rather than placing that burden on the pipelines. AER/MRT argues that instead of placing the burden on
the pipelines to ensure a November 1, 1994 implementation date, the Commission should set a compliance date for PI-GRID
and, if this deadline is not met, should give the pipelines additional time to comply with the common code requirements.






TGPL, Tenneco Gas, Natural, and KGPC contend that pipelines should not be responsible for ensuring the reasonableness
of fees because they will not be signatories to the contract with PI-GRID and, therefore, can have only an indirect
influence on the contracts. Natural further contends the requirement to ensure reasonable fees is unduly vague and
establishes no basis for determining when such costs are reasonable. INGAA maintains the industry consortium approach
of Working Group 5 provides a competitive market mechanism for controlling fees that is superior to imposing a requirement
on only one segment of the industry. INGAA points out that the contract with PI-GRID requires that PI-GRID make the
codes available at a cost covering only shipping and handling. 

On the other hand, NGSA contends the Commission did not place sufficient requirements on the pipelines to ensure that
the November 1, 1994 implementation date is met. It suggests the Commission require the pipelines to cooperate with
the code assignor by designating, prior to a specified date, a pipeline liaison who will work with the code assignor
to establish and validate the transaction points. 

The Commission denies the request by Columbia Distribution to require the pipelines to adopt the common code. Such
a requirement goes beyond the consensus reached by the Working Group. The translation table provides users with the
benefits of common codes within a reasonable time frame, while, at the same time, pipelines need not incur the burden
and expense of making an immediate conversion of their computer systems and operations to accommodate the common
codes. However, as pipelines review and update their financial systems to accommodate the new business conditions
created by Order No. 636, the Commission fully expects them to incorporate the use of common codes.

The Commission will clarify its position on pipeline responsibility. The Commission is accepting the code assignor
approach put forward by the Working Group. While the Commission recognizes that other parties have been involved
in developing the concept and will be signing the contract with PI-GRID, the pipelines are the only jurisdictional
entity involved in the transaction. The pipelines can fulfill their obligation by either individually, or through
their trade association INGAA, entering into the contract with PI-GRID as developed and presented by the Working
Groups. The Commission understands that this contract will specify that the charges for obtaining the common code
data base cannot exceed reasonable shipping and handling costs. The Commission, at this point, will leave the monitoring
of these costs to the signatories to the contract. 

The Commission has required the pipelines to confirm their proprietary point information to PI-GRID, and the Commission
expects no problems in pipeline cooperation with PI-GRID. However, to facilitate PI-GRID's development of the common
code data base, each pipeline must designate a liaison to work with PI-GRID and must cooperate with the schedule set
up by PI-GRID so that the data base will be available by the November 1, 1994 date. 



2. Point Locator Information 



TGPL and INGAA seek rehearing of the Commission's requirement that pipelines provide PI-GRID with information sufficient
to locate pipeline points in relation to other points. They argue the two comments to the NOPR requesting such information
do not provide a sufficient basis for the Commission to reject the consensus agreement of Working Group 5 under which
pipelines would provide this information only if they have it readily available. They maintain Working Group 5 treated
this information as optional to avoid imposing additional burdens on pipelines that do not maintain this information
in electronic form, while providing useful data when the information is readily available and accessible. 

The Commission denies the request to make point locator information optional. Shippers considering capacity release
offers need information about point location to determine whether a particular offer fits their needs. Point locator
information provides shippers with the ability to determine electronically whether the transportation path they
desire is encapsuled within the transportation path of the posted release. For instance, without such information,
the shipper cannot determine whether the delivery point it wants to use is upstream or downstream of the delivery point
on the capacity release offer. 

Nevertheless, the Commission recognizes that some pipelines may have a large number of receipt points and may not
maintain the geographic location of these points in an easily accessible form. The Commission also considers the
geographic location of delivery points to be more important to evaluating capacity release offers than receipt point
information, because the potential bidder generally needs only to determine whether the path of the capacity release
offer extends to its desired delivery point. To ease the burden on those pipelines without easily accessible information,
the Commission will require that they confirm to PI-GRID the geographic location of their delivery points and most
important receipt points in time to meet the November 1, 1994 deadline. Those pipelines would then be responsible
for completing the confirmation process for all their receipt points as soon as possible, but no later than May 1, 1995.
Pipelines desiring to take advantage of this exception should file a request for an extension of time, explaining
their system for maintaining geographic information and justifying their inability to make full compliance by November
1, 1994. Such extensions will be granted only upon good cause shown.

35

 





KGPC requests clarification that the Commission's reference to geographic coordinates referred to latitude and
longitude. The Commission agrees. Natural states that its paper pooling and storage points used for nominations
have no identifiable location on the pipeline and it presumes that for such points, it need only include an identifier
showing the points have no geographical location. Pipelines should consult with PI-GRID to determine how to report
points without identifiable geographic locations. 

The National Registry states that most pipelines appear to be cooperating with the requirement to provide point locator
information in a form that will enable users to locate points in relation to each other. It requests clarification
that the Commission's complaint process is the appropriate means of dealing with possible situations in which pipelines
do not provide the point locator information in usable form. The Commission does not anticipate that any problems
will develop, but, if they do, an attempt should be made to resolve the problem through the Working Group, and, if that
fails, the Commission's complaint procedure or enforcement hotline would be appropriate vehicles for pursuing
a problem.

3. Establishment of New Receipt and Delivery Points 


In the final rule, the Commission adopted the agreement reached by Working Group 5 that information concerning new
receipt and delivery points, or modifications to existing points, must be provided to the code assignor 10 days before
any business will be transacted using the new or modified point. Natural requests clarification that shippers may
utilize a new receipt or delivery point prior to the expiration of the 10-day period. It contends situations arise
in which a shipper has an immediate need for a new receipt or delivery point and a 10-day delay would pose an unnecessary
hardship. It also argues pipelines sometimes need to add a point immediately, for example, to identify a second proprietary
code for an existing point or create a paper point for accounting purposes. It suggests that no more than a one day delay
in implementing points should be mandated. 
The requirement for a delay in implementing points was intended to ensure that parties using the common code data base
would not be at a disadvantage to those using the pipelines' proprietary points as listed on the EBB. Except in emergency
situations, pipelines should give 
PI-GRID at least 10 days advance notice of new points or modifications to point information so that those using the
common code data base will not be disadvantaged relative to those using the pipeline's EBB. 


VII. Additional Standards 


Parties had requested that the Commission require an electronic Index of Purchasers, which would disclose information
about capacity rights, and require the development of standards for non-capacity release business transactions.
The Working Groups were continuing their deliberations in these areas, and, in Order No. 563, the Commission stated
that it would await the Working Group reports before making decisions on these issues. The Working Groups have submitted
reports on these issues. Several rehearing petitions address these issues as do comments received on the Working
Group reports, and the Commission will address these issues below. 


A. Index Of Purchasers 


The National Registry and Gaslantic support the so-called Tennessee compromise being developed by the Working Groups,
but, in the event the compromise falls through, the National Registry requests the Commission to grant rehearing
and require the pipelines to implement the limited Index the National Registry proposes. KGPC suggests that, if an
electronic Index of Purchasers is required, the Commission should eliminate or modify its current regulations that
require pipelines to file similar information with the Commission. 
Working Groups 1 & 2 failed to reach consensus on an Index. One group, consisting of 44 participants drawn from
a cross-section of the industry (Group 1),
 support a compromise proposal under which the Commission would eliminate the paper reporting requirements relating
to firm and interruptible transportation, including the initial and subsequent reports (but not the annual reports
or the reports on bypasses) and the requirement to include an Index of Purchasers in a pipeline's tariff. These reports
would be replaced by an electronic Index provided in downloadable form consisting of the following nine data elements
for each firm transportation and storage shipper: shipper's name, contract identifier, rate schedule, contract
start date, contract end date, contract quantity, receipt points (and associated maximum daily quantities (MDQs)),
delivery points (and associated MDQs), and conjunctive restrictions, if any.
 The information would be updated whenever a new contract for firm capacity was written or a pipeline filed a section
4(e) rate case. 





A smaller number of participants (11) (Group 2)
 support a more limited Index which essentially excludes the receipt and delivery point information contained in
the first group's proposal. The parties supporting this proposal state that they do not believe any Index is truly
necessary, but that, in the spirit of compromise, their proposal would provide a reasonably cost effective Index.
 They are concerned that disclosing specific receipt and delivery points potentially could place firm shippers at
a disadvantage with respect to future gas purchase options.

<TEXT>
 

The Arkla Companies
 oppose any Index. They assert the justification given for the Index (that it is needed so capacity buyers can locate
available capacity) is unsupported. They argue that this function is satisfied by the firm shipper's incentive to
release capacity and potential buyers' ability to place ``want ads'' advertising their interest in acquiring capacity.
If firm shippers, not already posting firm capacity, fail to respond to a ``want ad,'' the Arkla Companies maintain
the capacity holder is unlikely to be interested in releasing capacity. Further, they assert that small users (who
are alleged to be at an information disadvantage to large users) would not likely be sophisticated enough to manipulate
the data on the thousands of contracts electronically available through the Index. If the Commission does require
an Index, they maintain the Commission should eliminate its Part 284 reporting requirements and permit the pipelines
to charge a fee for the use of the Index. 




Public notice of these filings was given on March 3, 1994, and the National Registry and PEC Pipeline Group filed comments
supporting Group 1's proposal containing the nine data elements. The National Registry contends the information
on receipt and delivery point MDQs is needed so the market can be aware of receipt and delivery point capacity that can
be acquired through capacity release. It points out that many pipelines allocate greater firm receipt and delivery
point capacity than they do mainline capacity and shippers may want to acquire the receipt or delivery point capacity
independently of mainline capacity.
 In response to those opposing disclosure of receipt and delivery point information, the National Registry contends
that capacity information should not be considered proprietary. It also argues that disclosure of receipt points
is unlikely to reveal a purchaser's gas purchase strategy, since it does not disclose pricing, duration, or delivery
conditions and, in most cases, even the supplier could not be divined from the information. 




The PEC Pipeline Group supports the Group 1 proposal because this option actually will reduce costs by eliminating
the duplicate reporting requirements for firm transportation contracts. It points out that the information required
by the Index is essentially the same as is now required to be filed in the initial and subsequent reports under Part 284,
so no additional costs for gathering the information are created by the proposal. 
The Commission finds that the Group 1, more inclusive, proposal has significant merit, and the Commission is very
interested in pursuing this proposal further. The proposal provides useful information to the market about capacity,
while also setting the stage for reducing filing burdens on pipelines and streamlining the Commission's reporting
requirements. The Group 2, more limited, proposal is not as attractive because, without receipt and delivery point
information, it would not reduce filing burdens. Moreover, information on receipt and delivery points would be of
value to those seeking releasable capacity and disclosure of such capacity information is not confidential, since
it presently is disclosed publicly through the initial and subsequent reports. 
The Commission, however, is unsure about some details of the proposal. For example, as framed, it would eliminate
the initial and subsequent reports for firm and interruptible transportation, but would provide only information
about firm transportation in the electronic Index. The proposed Index would be updated only when a new contract was
written or upon the filing of a section 4 rate case, whereas the subsequent reports now must be filed whenever a material
change in the contract occurs. The proposal states that the Index would be available in downloadable form, but does
not specify the format for the download (EDI or another format) nor whether shippers will have access to the information
in other forms. In addition, the proposal does not discuss how the information will be archived in the event access
to historical data is needed. The Commission staff and the Working Group, therefore, should work to develop a final
proposal to be provided to the Commission by September 30, 1994. 


B. Business Practice Standards 


In Order No. 563, the Commission concluded that standardization of business transactions unrelated to capacity
release should be the next step in the standardization process. Working Group 3 had been considering such standards
and had identified 33 high priority items, of which ten were considered most critical.
 The Commission found that standardization of these ten, or most of them, provided a good departure point for this effort.
The Commission stated that the Working Group should propose an appropriate implementation schedule for the ten identified
data elements. The Working Group also was to continue its efforts to identify which of the remaining 23 high priority
data elements, as well as any others, require standardization and propose a schedule for implementation of standards
for these elements as well.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940506-0-00035 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940506-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

PEC Pipeline Group contends the Commission should not be issuing mandatory standards for non-capacity release transactions.
It asserts mandatory standards for such transactions would be inconsistent with the Commission's position in restructuring
orders that Order No. 636 required only the posting of information related to available capacity and not information
on nominations, scheduling, and gas flow. PEC Pipeline Group and Tenneco Gas assert that implementation of non-capacity
release standards should be determined by the market, not regulation. Tenneco Gas also states that the industry is
working on standardization related to nominations and that these standards should be reviewed first before additional
standardization is attempted. Natural seeks clarification that the Commission is not prejudging or dictating the
items to be standardized, but is relying on Working Group 3 to make this determination. 
On the other side, NGC and NGSA contend the Working Groups are deadlocked on whether pipelines should be required to
implement the high priority data elements. They contend the Commission should direct the pipelines, in conjunction
with Working Group 3, to develop an implementation schedule for all 33 high priority data elements. NGC suggests that
the schedule for the ten high priority items should be submitted by April 1, 1994 and for the remaining 23 by June 1, 1994.

On March 25, 1994, Working Group 3 filed a consensus agreement regarding the development of standards for non-capacity
release business transactions. They anticipate completion of 12 upload and download data sets relating to confirmations
and nominations by June 1, 1994.

43

 At the time of the filing, 55 trading partners, including a number of pipelines, have committed to begin implementation
of these data sets in June 1994, with pilot testing by December 31, 1994. Several pipelines and their trading partners
are expected to be in full implementation by January 1995. The Working Group encourages other industry participants
that are EDI capable to support these data sets by September 1995. 




Working Group 3 anticipates it will complete its consideration of the other high priority data sets by January 1, 1995,
with development of data sets by January 1, 1996 and implementation within the 6 month period from January to June,
1996. The Group states this schedule may be affected by the Group's analysis of the transactions involved and its evaluation
of the use of EDI for capacity release and for nominations and confirmations. 
The consensus of Working Group 3 was that significant and sufficient progress can be made in developing and implementing
these standards without the Commission mandating implementation. It, therefore, recommends that the Commission
accept the consensus agreement without mandating compliance with the data sets by the pipelines.

44

 The Working Group commits to making quarterly progress reports, starting July 1, 1994, which will be made available
to the Commission and other interested parties.

45

 







Although the Commission began the standardization process with capacity release, the Commission recognizes that
the process now needs to be expanded to include other business practices in order to facilitate the movement of gas
across multiple pipelines. In addition to standards governing electronic communication, such standards could
include other business practices, such as standardization of gas days and nomination times to help shippers schedule
deliveries across multiple pipelines. The Working Group's use of a pilot program, implemented as quickly as possible,
appears to be a worthwhile approach for assessing the value of proposed standards and approaches, so that lessons
learned can be applied to other areas and the process can move forward quickly. 
At this point, the Commission will honor the consensus agreement of Working Group 3 and allow the industry to proceed
in developing such standards, without Commission mandate. The Commission applauds the progress of the industry
to date and hopes that a consensus can be achieved on implementing the nomination/confirmation standards on schedule
as well as implementing the additional proposed standards by the targeted dates if not earlier. The Commission also
recognizes that other efforts are underway in the industry to standardize business practices. The Working Group
should keep abreast of these developments and coordinate these efforts. The Commission staff will continue to actively
monitor the Working Group's progress in developing these standards. Depending on the progress made by the industry
in this endeavor, the Commission will evaluate the need for mandating compliance with such standards either in this
docket or in another appropriate forum. 


VIII. Recovery Of EBB Costs 


In Order No. 563, the Commission responded to comments addressing the mechanism for recovering the costs of standardization.
As a general matter, the Commission stated that its policy of permitting recovery of fixed costs through a reservation
charge and variable costs through a usage charge was appropriate for the basic EBB service, which would include the
downloadable data sets and communication protocols of this rule. The Commission stated that these services should
be included in the basic EBB package because they were needed to provide a viable capacity release market and would
provide system-wide benefits to all users. For enhancements to the basic EBB package, the Commission stated it was
open to cost recovery approaches that would recover fixed costs from the limited number of users deriving benefit
from the service.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940506-0-00036 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940506-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

KGPC states that EBB implementation and development costs should be recovered as fixed costs. Columbia Distribution
and UDC/AGD, on the other hand, object to the Commission's statement that the fixed costs of the basic EBB package should
be recovered through reservation charges. They assert the Commission's statement is at odds with its statement in
the NOPR that it would be open to cost recovery methods that would spread costs across all those benefitting from the
standards. Edison similarly contends that ``data aggregators'' (companies which are not shippers on pipelines,
but which will be downloading data from multiple EBBs to provide electronic services) should pay their share of the
costs for additional services provided at their request. All three contend the Commission should adopt a policy on
cost recovery under which the costs would be equitably shared among all users of EBBs with the precise method of cost
allocation determined in section 4 rate proceedings. 
UDC/AGD also request clarification of the criteria the Commission will use to determine which enhancements are not
to be included in the basic EBB package. They state, for example, that some of the non-capacity release standards which
the Working Groups are developing may not be of general benefit. KGPC suggests that any standards imposed by the Commission
should be treated as part of the standard EBB service. 
Columbia Distribution and UDC/AGD further assert the Commission's statement on cost recovery could interfere with
the development of alternative cost recovery approaches by the Working Groups, and UDC/AGD contend that if the Commission
does not revisit this issue, it should, at least, refer the issue to the Working Groups for further consideration.
In contrast, NGSA contends that the method of cost recovery is a policy issue outside the scope of this proceeding and
that the Working Groups should not be asked to resolve this issue since they are set up to deal with technical issues.

NGC requests clarification that all cost recovery related to EBBs will take place in full section 4 rate cases so that
savings as well as costs can be taken into account. NGC further argues that variable costs should not be recovered through
usage charges because a usage charge ignores the system-wide benefits of EBBs and other forms of electronic nominations.
If the Commission does permit a separate charge for EBB use, NGC contends the Commission should not permit EDI users
to be singled out for separate charges. NGC maintains that some in the industry have argued for a separate charge for
EDI users because not all users find EDI suitable. NGC responds that some users find on-line EBBs equally unsuitable.

As part of the Working Groups 1 & 2 report, position papers were filed reiterating the points made above. One group

46

 contends the interminable debate over the cost issue is impeding the ability of the Working Groups to complete their
work.

47

 They urge the Commission to resolve this issue by stating that the cost issue should be left to section 4 proceedings,
and not be considered by the Working Groups. 






Another group

48

 supports an equitable sharing of costs by all EBB users. They assert that if firm capacity holders are required to pay
all EBB costs through a reservation charge, the firm holders will be subsidizing other users of the system. They further
assert that having to absorb all EBB costs will place firm users at a competitive disadvantage compared with brokers
and marketers that can obtain the EBB services at no cost. This group asserts the Commission state that its policy is
to equitably share costs, with the mechanics of the cost sharing approach to be developed in section 4 cases, in which
the parties could consider a number of options, such as annual user fees or on-line usage charges. 




The Commission will clarify its position on cost recovery. As provided in Order No. 636, the recovery of all EBB costs
must take place in a full section 4 rate filing.

49

 Parties are free in these proceedings to propose alternative methods of cost recovery.

The Commission recognizes that those supporting cost sharing raise a legitimate concern that users should be responsible
for paying the costs that their use imposes on the system. On the other hand, in Order No. 636-A, the Commission
rejected a user fee approach to EBB cost recovery in favor of a reservation charge approach out of concern about potential
consequences of user fees. The Commission intended EBBs to provide for wide dispersion of information about capacity
availability as well as information concerning market and system operational information. In fact, to further the
secondary capacity market, the Commission has sought to remove impediments to the development of services by third
parties that would aggregate information from multiple pipeline EBBs, thereby improving access to information.

50

 The Commission, therefore, rejected user fees for EBBs because high user fees can work to the disadvantage of firm
shippers by discouraging the use of EBBs for capacity release transactions and by providing advantages to the pipelines'
sale of interruptible transportation at the expense of capacity release.

51

 Without more detail about how cost sharing would work, the Commission cannot endorse a policy of equitable cost sharing
at this point. The Commission, however, is not ruling out adoption of a fully supported and justified proposal of this
nature. At this point, these issues are best examined in the context of an individual rate case. 






Similarly, the Commission does not have sufficient basis to establish a generic standard for cost recovery for enhancements
to the basic EBB package. All the standards the Commission has adopted are of sufficient system-wide benefit to be
included in the basic EBB package. Also, as discussed above, the Commission will not be mandating implementation
of the non-capacity release standards proposed by Working Group 3 at this time. The Working Group is proposing a pilot
program to evaluate its efforts, so an attempt to develop a generic cost recovery approach for these standards is premature.
At this point, cost recovery for implementation of the standards is best addressed in individual rate cases. 

The Commission agrees with NGSA that cost recovery is a policy issue that need not be resolved by the Working Groups,
and the Working Groups should not permit debates over cost recovery to side-track them from their work on developing
standards. If parties have developed concrete proposals for alternate methods of cost recovery for particular standards,
they can submit the proposals in comments on the Working Group reports or address the issue in individual section 4
cases in which EBB cost recovery is an issue.

AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule; technical amendments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the biologics regulations to correct certain omissions from the
designators for blood specificities and make other minor, technical amendments. This action is being taken to clarify
and improve the accuracy of the regulations.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FDA is correcting certain errors that have been incorporated into the biologics regulations in parts 606 and 660 (21
CFR parts 606 and 660). The errors in the regulations are as follows:



1. In the 

Federal Register

 of April 19, 1988 (53 FR 12760), FDA changed the name of ``Blood Grouping Serum'' to ``Blood Grouping Reagent'' to more
accurately describe the product's derivation and intended use. However, in    606.65(c) and 606.121(c)(12)(i),
(c)(12)(ii), and (c)(12)(iii), the name change was inadvertently omitted. The agency is correcting these errors.

2. In the 

Federal Register

 of February 11, 1985 (50 FR 5574), FDA changed the name of ``Anti-Human Serum'' to ``Anti-Human Globulin'' to reflect
that this product may be produced from immunoglobulin-secreting cell lines as well as from serum. However, in  606.65(c),
the name change was inadvertently omitted. The agency is correcting this error. 

3. Further, in  660.28(a), the agency is revising the blood group antibody designations ``Anti-c,'' and ``Anti-k,''
as ``Anti-,'' and ``Anti-,''respectively.

Publication of this document constitutes final action on these changes under the Administrative Procedure Act (5
U.S.C. 553). Notice and public procedure and delayed effective date on this final rule are unnecessary because the
changes are editorial in nature and nonsubstantive (5 U.S.C. 553(b) and (d)).

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</USDEPT>







Redelegation of Functions; Delegation of Authority to Drug Enforcement Administration Official



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Under delegated authority, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Department of Justice,
is amending the appendix to the Justice Department regulations to redelegate certain functions and authority which
were vested in the Attorney General by the Controlled Substances Act and subsequently delegated to the Administrator.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) (21 U.S.C. 801 set seq.) establishes a detailed regulatory scheme governing
the manufacture and distribution of controlled substances and listed chemicals. The CSA requires that every person
who manufactures, distributes, or dispenses a controlled substance or who manufactures, distributes, exports
or imports certain listed chemicals must obtain a registration from DEA. An application for such registration may
be denied or a registration revoked pursuant to specific provisions of the CSA.




The Attorney General has delegated her functions under the CSA to the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration.
See 21 U.S.C. 871(a) and 28 CFR 0.100(b). Regulations implementing the CSA empower the Administrator, for example,
to issue final orders to deny applications for registration or revoke registrations, to schedule controlled substances,
to designate chemicals as listed chemicals and to establish quotas.

The Attorney General has also authorized the Administrator to redelegate any of his functions under the CSA to any
of his subordinates. See 28 CFR 0.104. To further enhance the administration of the CSA and its attendant regulations,
the Administrator is redelegating to the Deputy Administrator the authority to exercise all necessary functions
under 21 CFR part 1300 which have not already been redelegated in subpart R of 28 CFR 0.104. This redelegation will empower
the Deputy Administrator, among other things, to issue final orders relating to the suspension, denial or revocation
of registration, scheduling actions, designation of chemicals as listed chemicals, establishment of production
quotas for certain controlled substances, and to grant or deny waivers of CSA regulations relating to registrants.
This redelegation will include the authority to exercise all regulatory functions which may be delegated to the Administrator
in the future pursuant to subsequent amendments to 21 CFR part 1300 and not otherwise specifically assigned or reserved
by the Administrator.

The Administrator certifies that this action will have no impact upon entities whose interests must be considered
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). Pursuant to Executive Order 12866, this is not a significant
regulatory action since it relates only to the organization of functions within DEA. Accordingly, it has not been
reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget and does not require certification under Executive Order 12778. This
action has been analyzed in accordance with Executive Order 12616. It has been determined that this matter has no federalism
implications which would warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment.



List of Sections in 28 CFR Part 0



Authority delegations (Government Agencies), Organization and functions (Government Agencies).

 


For the reasons set forth above, and pursuant to the authority vested in the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement
Administration by 28 CFR 0.100 and 0.104, and 21 U.S.C. 871, title 28, of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 0, appendix
to subpart R, Redelegation of Functions, is amended as follows:



PART 0_ORGANIZATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE



1. The authority citation for part 0 continues to read as follows:






Authority:

 5 U.S.C. 301; 28 U.S.C. 509, 510, 515-519.




2. The Appendix to subpart R is amended as follows:

a. Sec. 12 is added to read as follows:



Appendix to Subpart R_Redelegation of Functions



* * * * *



Sec. 12. 

All other functions

. The Deputy Adminstrator is authorized to exercise all necessary functions under 21 CFR Part 1300, except those functions
otherwise delegated within this subpart. This will include functions which may be vested in the Administrator in
subsequent amendments to 21 CFR Part 1300 and not otherwise specifically assigned or reserved by him. 


Appendix to Subpart R_[Amended] 



b. Sec. 7. (a), (g), (i), and (j) shall be amended by inserting the word ``Deputy'' before the word ``Administrator''
each place it appears.

 The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is adopting as a final rule the interim final rule providing

The effective date of the interim final rule was March 16, 1994. No comments were received during the 60-day comment

not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is hereby
certified that this rule will not have a significant impact on small entities.
