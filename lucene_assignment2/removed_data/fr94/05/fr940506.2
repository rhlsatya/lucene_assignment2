Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service and Commodity Credit Corporation

Feed Grain Donations; Fort Totten Indian Reservation of North Dakota



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, and Commodity Credit Corporation, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Executive Vice President, Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) and the Administrator, Agricultural Stabilization
and Conservation Service, is announcing that the reservation and grazing land of the Fort Totten Indian Reservation
of North Dakota is an acute distress area and that CCC-owned feed grain will be donated to needy livestock owners on
the reservation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to the authority set forth in section 407 of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1427), and Executive
Order 11336, notice is being given that I have determined that:



1. The chronic economic distress of the needy members of the Devils Lake Sioux Tribe (the Tribe) of the Fort Totten Indian
Reservation of North Dakota has been materially increased and become acute because of excessive rains in the summer
of 1993, thereby creating a serious shortage of feed and causing increased economic distress. This reservation is
designated for Indian use and is utilized by members of the Tribe for grazing purposes.

2. The use of feed grain or products thereof made available by CCC for livestock feed for such needy members of the Tribe
will not displace or interfere with normal marketing of agricultural commodities.

3. Based on the above determinations, I hereby declare the reservation and grazing land of the Tribe to be an acute distress
area and authorize the donation of feed grain owned by the CCC to livestock owners who are determined by the Bureau of
Indian Affairs, United States Department of the Interior, to be needy members of the Tribe utilizing such lands. These
donations by the CCC may commence upon May 1, 1994, and shall be made available through May 31, 1994, or such other date
as may be stated in a notice issued by the Administrator, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service.

of reasonable alternatives for the agency's Animal Damage Control program.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Background



Animal Damage Control (ADC) of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
in cooperation with the Bureau of Land Management of the U.S. Department of the Interior, and the Forest Service of
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, has prepared a final environmental impact statement (EIS) for the ADC program.
Copies of this document were filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on April 26, 1994, pursuant to section
102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(c)), and the EPA Notice of Availability
appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on May 6, 1994.

On January 14, 1993 (58 FR 4404-4405, Docket No. 92-190-1), we published a notice of intent to make
available a supplement to the draft EIS for the ADC program. The draft EIS, made available on June 18, 1990 (55 FR 24597-24598,
Docket No. 90-099), evaluated environmental impacts associated with wildlife damage control activities.
On February 12, 1993, we




published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 8252, Docket No. 92-190-2) a notice advising the public that the supplement to the draft EIS for the
ADC program was available for public review and comment. Comments were due on or before March 29, 1993.



Because of the size and complexity of the supplement to the draft EIS, and in response to a number of requests, on March
29, 1993, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 16520, Docket No. 92-190-3) a notice advising the public that we were extending the comment period
until April 28, 1993.

By close of business April 28, 1993, we had received 1,493 comments on the draft EIS and its supplement. Based on suggestions
and information offered in the comments, we have revised the draft EIS and its supplement, and have produced a final
EIS.

This notice is issued in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321


et seq.

), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40
CFR Parts 1500-1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing
NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274, August 31, 1979).

Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Aramid Fiber Formed of Poly-Phenylene Terephthalamide
From the Netherlands

Finally, at the request of the U.S. International Trade Commission, we have replaced the words ``this includes''
with the words ``these consist of'' to further clarify the products covered by this investigation.



Class or Kind



Prior to our preliminary determination, Akzo argued that this investigation should involve at least three classes
or kinds of merchandise: Yarn, staple fiber and pulp. After considering extensive comments from both parties, we
preliminarily determined that the products covered by this investigation constitute a single class or kind of merchandise,
and three such or similar categories. (See Preliminary Concurrence Memorandum, dated December 9, 1993, on file in
room B-099 of the main building of the Department of Commerce). In our preliminary determination, we invited additional
comments from interested parties on this issue. However, no additional evidence supporting a finding of three classes
or kinds has been submitted. In addition, no comments in opposition to our preliminary determination have been filed.
We therefore continue to find that the products covered by this investigation constitute a single class or kind of
merchandise.



Period of Investigation



The period of investigation (POI) is January 1, 1993, through June 30, 1993. 



Such or Similar Comparisons 



We made fair value comparisons using the following such or similar categories: (1) Yarn; (2) staple fiber; and (3)
pulp. Where we were not able to compare U.S. sales to sales of identical merchandise, we made similar merchandise comparisons
on the basis of the criteria defined in Appendix V to the antidumping duty questionnaire, on file in room B-099 of the
main building of the Department of Commerce. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.58, we made comparisons at the same level
of trade, where possible.



Fair Value Comparisons



To determine whether Akzo's sales to the United States of PPD-T aramid fiber were made at less than fair value, we compared
the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign
Market Value'' sections of this notice.



United States Price



We calculated USP according to the methodology described in our preliminary determination, with the following exceptions:

1. We included certain sales in our calculation of USP which Akzo contends were pursuant to a long-term contract negotiated
prior to the POI. (For a further discussion of these sales, see comment 1 below.) 

2. We increased U.S. indirect selling expenses by the amount of G&A expenses allocated to the aramid fibers business
unit of Akzo Fibers Inc. by its parent company, Akzo America Inc. (see comment 6 below).

3. We recalculated inventory carrying costs incurred in the Netherlands on U.S. sales to reflect the short-term borrowing
rate of Arami, (

i.e.

, the actual producer and seller of subject merchandise), (see comment 8 below).

<DOCNO> FR940506-2-00007 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940506-2-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

4. We used the date of the start of the Dutch sales verification for all missing payment dates.



Foreign Market Value 



As stated in our preliminary determination, we determined that the home market was not viable for any of the three such
or similar categories. We selected Germany as the third country market for sales of yarn and staple fiber, and Japan
as the third country market for sales of pulp. We calculated FMV as noted in the ``Price-to-Price'' and ``Price to Constructed
Value (CV)'' sections of this notice.



Cost of Production



Petitioner alleged that Akzo's third country sales were made at prices below the cost of production (COP). On the basis
of petitioners' allegations, we gathered and verified data on production costs. 

 We compared Akzo's third country prices to the COP as explained in our preliminary determination. 

 In order to determine whether third country prices were above the COP, we calculated the COP based on the sum of Arami's
(i.e., the actual producer and seller of subject merchandise) submitted costs of materials, fabrication, general
expenses, and packing, except in the following instances where the costs were not appropriately quantified or valued:

1. We recalculated interest expense based solely on Arami's financial statements (see DOC position for comment 12);


2. We included certain non-operating expenses in general and administrative (G&A) expenses (see DOC position
for comment 17); and 

3. We disallowed Arami's claimed reduction in fixed overhead for certain intercompany charges (see DOC position
for comments 14 and 15). 

 Accordingly, we increased its submitted cost of manufacturing.



Price-to-Price Comparisons



For those products for which we had an adequate number of sales at prices equal to or greater than the COP, we based FMV
on third country prices. We calculated FMV using the methodology described in our notice of preliminary determination,
with the following exceptions:

1. We recalculated inventory carrying costs incurred in the Netherlands on German and Japanese sales and German credit
expenses to reflect the short-term borrowing rate of Arami (see comment 7 below).

2. We used the average credit days of all transactions with a reported shipment and payment date for sales missing both
a shipment and payment date. We have inserted the date of the start of the Dutch sales verification for those sales with
missing payment dates only.

3. We corrected a clerical error in the calculation of third country indirect selling expenses.



Price to CV Comparisons



For those products without an adequate number of sales at prices above the COP, we based FMV on CV. We calculated CV based
on the sum of the cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, and U.S. packing cost. In accordance with section
773(e)(1)(B) (i) and (ii) of the Act we: (1) Included the greater of Arami's reported general expenses or the statutory
minimum of ten percent of the cost of manufacture (COM), as appropriate and; (2) for profit, we used the higher of the
statutory minimum of eight percent of the sum of COM and general expenses or the actual profit incurred as calculated
on a market specific basis (see Comment 18). As a result, for the German market we used actual profit and for the Japanese
market we used the statutory minimum of eight percent. We calculated CV based on the methodology described in the calculation
of COP above, with the following exceptions:

1. In the financing calculation, we included additional interest expense based on market value (See Comment 13).

2. We corrected a clerical error in the calculation of third country profit.

 In instances where we compared Akzo's U.S. prices to CV, we made deductions, where appropriate, for the weighted-average
third country direct selling expenses. We also deducted the weighted-average third country indirect selling expenses.
We limited this adjustment by the amount of indirect selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales, in accordance with 19
CFR 353.56(b)(2).



Final Determination of Critical Circumstances 



Petitioner alleged that ``critical circumstances'' exist with respect to imports of PPD-T aramid fiber from the
Netherlands. Pursuant to section 733(e)(1) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.16, we have analyzed the allegations using the
Department's standard methodology as discussed in our preliminary determination, except that for purposes of determining
whether there have been massive imports we compared imports in five-month periods rather than four-month periods
(see DOC position for comment 4). Accordingly, we find that critical circumstances do not exist.



Currency Conversion



We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified
by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.



Verification



As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we verified information provided by Akzo by using standard verification
procedures, including the examination of relevant sales and financial records, and selection of original source
documentation containing relevant information.

Interested Party Comments



Certain comments cannot be discussed in this notice due to their business proprietary nature. The comments which
have been excluded do not lend themselves to public summarization, and therefore have been discussed in the business
proprietary version of the Final Concurrence Memorandum dated May 2, 1994 (Final Concurrence Memorandum), on file
in room B-099 of the main building of the Department of Commerce.



Comment 1: 

Petitioner argues that the Department of Commerce (the Department) should include in its calculation of U.S. price
Akzo's shipments during the POI made pursuant to a long-term agreement negotiated prior to the POI. Petitioner contends
that the particular terms and circumstances of Akzo's agreement with this customer do not create a binding commitment
on the part of either the buyer or seller and therefore do not create an enforceable sales contract. 

 Akzo argues that these shipments were pursuant to a long-term contract established prior to the POI and therefore
are properly excluded from the U.S. database. Akzo further argues that certain terms and circumstances of the agreement
should not prevent it from being considered a contract with a date of sale prior to the POI because the two parties acted
upon and adhered to the contract. Finally, respondent points out that the Department confirmed at verification that
all sales to this customer during the period of the contract were at the contract price.



DOC Position: 

In order for this agreement to be considered a long-term contract established prior to the POI, the agreement must
fix both the price and quantity. At verification we examined all invoices to the customer for sales pursuant to the
agreement during its effective period. Although we found that all sales were made at the specified price, we also found
that the quantity purchased was substantially less than the amount specified in the contract.

Therefore, we conclude that the quantity was not fixed by the terms of the agreement because the quantities actually
purchased over the period of the agreement were unrelated to those specified by the agreement. For this reason, we
determine that the date of the agreement does not constitute the date of sale. Accordingly, we have used the date of
shipment as the date of sale and have included all shipments to this customer during the POI in our calculation of U.S.
price.



Comment 2: 

Petitioner argues that the Department should include in its calculation of U.S. price Akzo's shipments during the
POI pursuant to a supply agreement which was signed prior to the POI but modified during the POI. Petitioner asserts
that the modification to the agreement, in effect, created a new agreement with a date of sale within the POI.

 Akzo argues that the contract modification did not alter the essential terms of the contract. Therefore, according
to Akzo, all POI shipments pursuant to this agreement have a date of sale prior to the POI and thus are properly excluded
from the U.S. sales database.



DOC Position: 

We agree with Akzo. We verified that the essential terms of the contract, the price and quantity, were not altered as
a result of the modification. Therefore, we consider Akzo's agreement with this customer to be a long-term contract
with a date of sale prior to the POI. Consequently, the shipments in question were properly not reported.



Comment 3: 

Petitioner argues that Akzo's shipments made pursuant to supply contracts with two customers during the POI should
be reported as U.S. sales, if not already reported.

 Akzo contends that these sales have been reported.



DOC Position: 

The sales in question were reported.



Comment 4: 

Petitioner argues that the Department should find that imports of subject merchandise were massive over a relatively
short period of time and that consequently, critical circumstances exist in this investigation under 735 (a)(3)(B)
of the Act. In its analysis, petitioner compared shipments to the United States with a base period prior to the filing
of the petition of May-July, 1993, with shipments to the United States in the post-petition comparison period of August-October,
1993. Using this comparison, petitioner found that imports had increased during the comparison period by more than
15 percent, the Department's benchmark.

 Akzo argued that imports were not massive, and that the petitioner's methodology was not consistent with the practice
of the Department.



DOC Position: 

We agree with Akzo. In this case, the petition was filed on July 2, 1993. It is the Department's standard policy, in cases
where the petition is filed during the first half of the month, to include the month of filing in the post-petition comparison
period, not the base period, as petitioner suggests (See, e.g., Certain Portable Electronic Typewriters from Singapore,
58 FR 43337 (1993)). Additionally, although 19 CFR 353.16(g) requires that we examine at least three months, it is
the Department's practice to examine the longest period for which information is available up until the preliminary
determination (See, e.g., Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate from the United Kingdom, 58 FR 37216 (1993)).
When the five month period subsequent to and including the month that the petition was filed is compared to the previous
five months, we find that imports were not at levels we consider massive.



Comment 5: 

Petitioner argues that certain sales of scrap (which were excluded from our analysis in the preliminary determination
because the quantity involved was insignificant) should be included in the calculation of U.S. price for the following
reasons: (1) The fact that the quantities are small is irrelevant; (2) other sales of the merchandise in question are
included in the cost of production calculations; and (3) according to product specifications in Akzo's invoices,
the merchandise in question is clearly a form of PPD-T aramid fiber which is subject to investigation.

<DOCNO> FR940506-2-00009 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940506-2-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Akzo argues that the Department properly excluded sales of scrap from its preliminary determination because the
quantities sold in the United States were small and there were no similar sales of scrap in the comparison third country
markets. Additionally, Akzo asserts that exclusion of scrap sales is consistent with the treatment of non-prime
material in the recent carbon flat steel cases, where the Department disregarded sales of second quality merchandise
in the U.S. market where there were no similar sales in the home market and they constituted an insignificant portion
(less than five percent) of the respondent's total U.S. sales, (Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value:
Certain Hot-Rolled and Certain Cold-Rolled Steel from the Netherlands, 58 FR 37199, 37201 (July 9, 1993)). 

Akzo further argues that petitioner's reliance on the product designations on the invoices is misplaced because
scrap is generated as part of the beaming (

i.e.,

 repacking) process in the United States. 



DOC Position:

 We agree with Akzo. The volume of scrap sales is insignificant and there are no comparable third country sales. Therefore,
we have continued to exclude these sales from our calculations. In addition, at verification we verified that most
of the scrap is tailings generated by the U.S. repacking operation and that, invoice descriptions notwithstanding,
the product is sold as waste and the customer has no recourse to quality claims.



Comment 6: 

Petitioner argues that we should not exclude certain (G&A) expenses incurred by Akzo America, Inc. in the calculation
of indirect selling expenses for purposes of the ESP deduction from U.S. price. Petitioner further argues that it
is long-standing Department practice to consider G&A expenses incurred by the U.S. selling arms of a foreign
producer to be indirect ``selling expenses'' for purposes of this deduction. 

Akzo argues that it has captured all expenses of the selling affiliate, Akzo Fibers, in its calculation of indirect
selling expenses. In addition, Akzo asserts that it has captured all selling-related expenses which were allocated
to the aramid fiber business unit of Akzo Fibers by Akzo America. Akzo contends that all remaining G&A expenses
carried on the books of Akzo America are not associated with the selling function at Akzo Fibers and therefore are properly
not included in the calculation of U.S. indirect selling expenses.



DOC Position: 

We agree with petitioner. Akzo America is the parent company that provides administrative, accounting and finance
services for all of Akzo's North American subsidiaries. In addition, there is no evidence that it provides any services
for Akzo N.V. (its parent company in the Netherlands) other than to facilitate the activities of the subsidiaries
in the United States. Therefore, all expenses incurred by Akzo America, including those classified on its books as
G&A, are indirectly related to the selling activities of the subsidiaries. Consequently, we have included in
the calculation of U.S. indirect selling expenses the amount of Akzo America's G&A expenses which have been allocated
to the aramid fibers business unit of Akzo Fibers.



Comment 7: 

Petitioner argues that certain other G&A expenses listed on the June 1993 financial statement of Akzo America
have not been allocated to any of the North American subsidiaries and that the representative portion attributable
to the aramid fiber business unit should be included in the calculation of indirect selling expenses for purposes
of the ESP deduction from U.S. price.

Akzo argues that these G&A costs are the same G&A expenses which are the subject of Comment 6 above. 



DOC Position: 

We agree with petitioner that the G&A expenses of Akzo America should be included in the calculation of indirect
selling expenses for purposes of the ESP deduction from U.S. price (see comment 6). However, we agree with Akzo that
these G&A costs are the same G&A expenses which are the subject of Comment 6 (see memorandum to the file, dated
April 22, 1994). Therefore, no additional increase to U.S. indirect selling expenses is necessary.



Comment 8: 

Petitioner argues that in calculating the Dutch portion of U.S. inventory carrying costs, the Department should
use the short-term borrowing rate of Arami (

i.e.,

 the actual producer and seller of the subject merchandise), rather than the rate of Akzo N.V., the parent company.
Petitioner asserts that Arami's borrowing rate is appropriate because Arami is the company which actually financed
the inventory and is a separate corporate entity from Akzo N.V.

Akzo argues that Akzo N.V.'s short-term borrowing rate should be used in calculating the Dutch portion of the inventory
carrying cost for the same reasons it argues that Akzo N.V. and Arami should be consolidated for determining a financial
expense ratio for CV and COP. (See the discussion below at Comment 11). Respondent also argues, in the event that the
Department decides not to collapse the two companies and uses Arami's short-term borrowing rate in calculating U.S.
inventory carrying cost, that the Department should also use Arami's short-term borrowing rate in the calculation
of inventory carrying costs incurred in the Netherlands on sales made in Japan and Germany and in the calculation of
German credit.



DOC Position: 

As noted in our response to Comment 11 below, we have determined that it is not appropriate to collapse Arami and Akzo
N.V. Therefore, we agree with petitioner and have used the short-term borrowing rate of Arami in calculating the inventory
carrying costs incurred in the Netherlands on U.S., German and Japanese sales. We have also applied Arami's rate in
the calculation of German credit expense, as suggested by Akzo.



Comment 9: 

Petitioner argues that Akzo's U.S. customs duty calculation may be incorrect because there are discrepancies between
the list of customs entries for subject merchandise entering Akzo's warehouses in the United States during the POI
and the list of all shipments to the United States provided by Akzo in connection with the critical circumstances allegation.

Akzo argues that petitioner has erroneously assumed that the entries included in the two lists should correspond
exactly. In fact, respondent argues, the list of shipments includes additional entries that did not enter Akzo's
warehouse but were transferred directly to U.S. customers, entries made after the POI, and invoices that were cancelled.

<PARENT> FR940506-2-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



DOC Position: 

We agree with Akzo. The two lists will not correspond exactly. One list represents the volume of subject merchandise
entering Akzo's U.S. warehouses during the POI, while the other represents the volume of subject merchandise shipped
from the Netherlands during the POI. In addition, at verification we determined that the list of entries used for Akzo's
U.S. duty calculation was complete and accurate.



Comment 10: 

Akzo argues that the Department made clerical errors in its calculation of the ESP offset and difference in merchandise
adjustment in its preliminary determination.



DOC Position: 

We agree with respondent. We have corrected these errors in our final determination. Also, see our response to Comment
18.



Comment 11: 

Petitioner argues that Arami and Akzo N.V. should not be consolidated for COP or CV calculations. Petitioner states
that while they were clearly related, Akzo N.V. held only a 50 percent equity interest in Arami and their operations
were never consolidated for financial reporting or any other purposes. According to both Dutch and U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP), consolidation is required when one company holds more than a 50 percent equity
interest in another company. Petitioner asserts that the reorganization of the Arami joint venture should not be
factored into the Department's cost analysis because this development occurred after the POI. Petitioner claims
that if the Department departed from its practice of investigating costs and prices during the POI, it would constitute
an arbitrary departure from established practice as well as an invitation for post-POI cost and price manipulation
by foreign producers. 

Petitioner maintains that the Department's reason for collapsing transactions between related parties which do
not reflect ``arm's length'' costs is to eliminate any substantial risk of price and cost manipulation between those
companies. Petitioner states that the legal and operational structure of Arami was designed so that its operations
would not be consolidated under Dutch law. Additionally, petitioner asserts that the actual cost of producing aramid
fiber is more accurately reflected by Arami's own books and records instead of its records consolidated with the Akzo
Group. Petitioner contends that the companies in the cases cited by Arami do not relate to this case because the companies
met the requirements for consolidation and should have been consolidated under GAAP (

i.e.,

 equity ownership was greater than 50 percent).

Arami claims that Akzo N.V. exerted significant control over its operation not only in 1993, but in all preceding years.
Arami states evidence of this close interrelationship is illustrated by its financing transactions as well as evidence
of organizational and operational control. Arami argues that it is the Department's practice to combine financing
activities of companies where one company exerts significant control over the other company. It also claims that
this is in keeping with the Department's position on fungibility of capital. Arami has informed the Department that
Akzo Fibers Aramide B.V., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Akzo N.V., increased its equity interest in Arami to 95 percent
effective December 31, 1993. Arami concludes that, based on the fungibility of capital, increased equity ownership
and significant control, the Department should consolidate Arami with Akzo N.V. for cost of production and constructed
value purposes. Arami states that it was consolidated with Akzo N.V. for balance sheet reporting purposes as of December
31, 1993, and would be fully consolidated on both the income statement and balance sheet in the fiscal year 1994. 

Additionally, Arami claims that in previous cases, the Department has combined the parent and subsidiary's costs
even though consolidation did not occur in the normal course of business. In citing the Final Determination of Sales
at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Carbon Steel Butt-weld Pipe Fittings from Thailand (pipe fittings), 57 FR 21065 (1992),
respondent quotes the Department as saying: ``* * * it is the Department's policy to combine the financing
activities of a parent and subsidiary when the parent exercises control over the subsidiary (

i.e.

 meets the requirements for consolidation).'' Respondent also cites the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than
Fair Value: Ferrosilicon from Brazil (Ferrosilicon), 59 FR 732 (1994), to further support its claim. 



DOC Position: 

We agree with petitioner, and have not consolidated Arami and Akzo N.V. for purposes of this antidumping investigation.
The corporate reorganization which was effective December 31, 1993, was not considered by the Department because
it occurred subsequent to the POI. 

Each of the joint venture partners had equal control over decisions involving Arami's operations until the new agreement
was signed in 1994. Under Dutch GAAP, if a company does not have equity ownership of greater than 50 percent, but still
has control over another company, it is required to consolidate. Since Arami was not consolidated with Akzo prior
to reorganization, we can reasonably conclude that Akzo did not have sufficient control over Arami to warrant consolidation
under Dutch GAAP. Therefore, consolidation of Arami and the Akzo N.V. for antidumping purposes based on a significant
control argument is unwarranted.

In the two cases cited by Arami, the GAAP of those countries required consolidation when one company owned more than
50 percent of another. In the Pipe Fittings case, the Japanese parent company, Awaji Sangyo K.K. Company Ltd. (ASK)
owned more than 50 percent of Awaji Sangyo Co. Ltd., (AST) of Thailand. Although ASK and AST did not prepare consolidated
financial statements, the Department in its cost verification report (April 4, 1992, pg.3) noted ``* * *
the operations should have been consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.'' In
Ferrosilicon, the parent company owned greater than 50 percent of Minasligas, its subsidiary under investigation.
Brazilian and U.S. GAAP require consolidation when the equity interests exceed 50 percent. In each of those cases,
control was indicated by equity ownership and GAAP required consolidation. In contrast to the above cases, Arami
did not meet the requirements for consolidation. For further analysis of this issue, see the Final Concurrence Memorandum.





Comment 12:

 
Since Arami was not consolidated with Akzo N.V. during the POI, petitioner asserts interest expense should be calculated
based solely on Arami's 1992 audited financial statements. Petitioner argues that the Department must disregard
the reorganization finalized subsequent to the POI which resulted in Arami being consolidated with Akzo N.V. for
balance sheet purposes. In addition, petitioner states this consolidation did not affect the income statement encompassing
the POI.



Arami argues that the combined 1992 financial statement data of Arami and Akzo N.V. is the correct basis for computing
interest expense because Akzo N.V. exerts significant control over Arami's operations and capital is fungible.
Arami argues that the consolidation for balance sheet purposes as of December 31, 1993, affects the entire fiscal
year 1993. 





DOC Position:

 
We disagree with respondent. A company's balance sheet presents a snapshot of its assets and claims on those assets
(liabilities and equity) as of a specific point in time (

i.e.,

 12/31/93). An income statement reports a company's performance over a specified period of time (

i.e.,

 1/1/93-12/31/93). Arami's operating results were not consolidated with the results of the Akzo N.V. Group in 1993.
Based on the Department's decision not to consolidate Arami with Akzo N.V., we calculated interest expense for COP
and CV based solely on Arami's financial statements. For further analysis of this issue, see the Final Concurrence
Memorandum.





Comment 13:

 Petitioner asserts that interest on loans provided by a related party should be included in the calculation of Arami's
financing costs for COP and CV purposes. Petitioner states that according to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
in 

IPSCO, Inc. 

v.

 U.S.,

 965 F.2d 1056 (1992), cost of production is linked to constructed value. Thus, the petitioner states that the constructed
value provision authorizing the Department to disregard related party transactions which are not arms-length in
nature can be applied to cost of production calculations. Petitioner asserts that Arami's argument for consolidation
does not eliminate the costs associated with these loans. Furthermore, the year end reorganization does not modify
costs incurred during the POI. Petitioner contends that consolidation did not affect the income statement for the
period January 1 through December 31, 1993.



 Arami claims that as a result of the new joint venture agreement signed in 1994, Arami's balance sheet was consolidated
with that of Akzo N.V., eliminating all related party loans. Therefore, the Department cannot impute an interest
cost to loans that do not exist as of December 31, 1993. Arami claims its 1992
 audited financial statement data should be used in calculating interest expense, but adds that the significant change
in Arami's corporate structure must be considered. Arami continues that if the Department determines consolidation
is unwarranted, and decides imputation of interest expense is necessary for CV, it should not impute interest for
COP. Arami argues that the Department's long standing policy is to compute COP based on a company's actual costs, thus,
there is no basis on which to impute interest for COP.





DOC Position:

 According to section 773(e)(2) of the Act, for CV, if a transaction between related companies does not fairly reflect
the market value, the Department may determine that element of value using the best evidence available. In this case,
we found that the loans in question were at below-market interest rates. Thus, we included the interest incurred on
the loans provided by Arami's related party in the calculation of financing costs for CV purposes.



We determined that no related party financing adjustment is necessary for COP purposes. In determining actual costs
of production, the Department normally adheres to the GAAP of the respondent's home country. Under Dutch GAAP, economic
activities are normally consolidated for all companies that have direct or indirect ownership greater than 50 percent.
In accordance with ITA's standard practice, the supplier's actual costs of production should be used to value inputs
acquired from companies that are directly or indirectly related by more than 50 percent. Inputs acquired from companies
that have direct or indirect ownership of 50 percent or less, should normally be valued using transfer prices (i.e.,
purchaser's actual cost). Accordingly, for COP purposes, we used Arami's transfer prices.
For further analysis of these issues, see the Final Concurrence Memorandum.





Comment 14:

 Petitioner states that certain charges were paid by Arami for services rendered by related Akzo companies. Since
certain of these charges are used to approximate the price charged in an arm's length transaction and were actual costs
incurred, Petitioner states it is appropriate to include these costs in the cost of manufacturing.



Arami claims certain of these charges are intracompany transactions which do not represent true costs and will be
discontinued in 1994, therefore, these costs should be excluded from the cost of manufacturing for both COP and CV
purposes.





DOC Position: 

We disagree with respondent. These charges relate to intercompany transactions between Arami and another company,
which represent actual costs incurred by Arami and recorded on its books during the POI. Arami incorrectly categorized
these costs as intracompany transactions which relates to transactions between divisions within a company. The
fact that this charge may be discontinued in 1994 does not mean the costs should be excluded for 1993. Accordingly,
we included these charges in Arami's COP and CV calculations.

Comment 15:

 Petitioner states that certain costs incurred by Akzo N.V. prior to the POI and recorded in Arami's 1992 audited financial
statements in accordance with GAAP should be included in the COP. Petitioner states that this expense should be either
charged to U.S. sales as a selling expense or to all sales as a general and administrative expense.
 

Akzo argues that these costs incurred by Akzo N.V. do not represent true costs for Arami during the POI. The accrual
on Arami's books for this cost has not been paid to Akzo N.V. and the expense will no longer be charged in 1994. Therefore,
this intercompany transaction should be excluded from the submitted cost of manufacturing.





DOC Position:

 Since this expense relates to the general production activity of Arami, we included it in Arami's general and administrative
expense calculation for COP and CV purposes. This expense represents an actual cost recorded on Arami's books during
the POI and the fact that the expense will no longer be charged in 1994 is not relevant.





Comment 16: 

Petitioner asserts that the Department should disallow a certain adjustment to Arami's fixed overhead costs for
grants because it is not recorded in Arami's cost accounting system and the reduction in costs attributed to this adjustment
distorts Arami's true cost of manufacturing. Petitioner notes that if the Department allows this reduction, we should
self-initiate a countervailing duty investigation.



Arami claims that it properly adjusted its fixed overhead costs by a certain amount because this adjustment is recorded
in Arami's financial accounting system, and is included in its audited financial statements. Arami notes that inclusion
of this adjustment in no way distorts Arami's costs, because it reflects amounts actually incurred. Additionally,
Akzo notes that because not all grants are countervailable, the Department should resist petitioner's statements
requesting self-initiation of a countervailing duty investigation.





DOC Position:

 This adjustment reflects actual costs incurred by Arami as recorded on its books in accordance with GAAP, and was properly
included in its submitted COP and CV. We believe subsidies are more properly handled in the context of the countervailing
duty law. Petitioner is free to submit a countervailing duty petition. Should such a petition be submitted and meet
the requirements of the countervailing duty regulations (19 CFR 355.12), the Department would initiate such an investigation.
However, no justification has been presented here for a departure from the Department's general policy of not self-initiating
countervailing duty investigations.





Comment 17:

 
Petitioner claims that several other non-operating expense items should be included in G&A costs because each
of these expenses relate to the aramid fibers business. Petitioner asserts all G&A expenses related to the subject
merchandise should be included in cost of production and constructed value.



Arami claims that no additional adjustment to G&A expense for non-operating expenses is warranted. Arami asserts
that two of the expenses noted by petitioner are already included in the submitted G&A calculation. Additionally,
Arami contends that the related party provision included in other non-operating expenses is an intracompany payment
and has no relevance in the context of this dumping investigation.





DOC Position:

 We adjusted the G&A calculation to include the related party payment and two other non-operating expense items
noted in the cost verification report which were associated with the general operations of Arami. The related party
payment is an actual cost incurred by Arami and recorded on its books in accordance with GAAP. Two of the other non-operating
expenses mentioned by the petitioner are already included in submitted G&A costs, thus no adjustment is necessary.






Comment 18:

 Arami contends that for purposes of constructed value, the Department should calculate a weighted-average profit
figure for pulp sales in Japan and yarn and staple sales in Germany.





DOC Position:

 We disagree with Arami. We believe that it is appropriate to calculate all selling expenses and profit specific to
the market in which the products in question were sold rather than average profit across two or more countries. Consequently,
we calculated one average profit for pulp sold in Japan and another for yarn and staple sold in Germany.



However, we corrected a clerical error in the calculation of profit noted by Arami which resulted in double counting.




Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation




We are directing the Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidation of all entries of PPD-T aramid fiber
from the Netherlands that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after December 16, 1993,
the date of publication of our preliminary determination in the 

Federal Register.

 The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated amount by which the FMV of
the merchandise subject to this investigation exceeds the U.S. price, as shown below. This suspension of liquidation
will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average dumping margins are as follows:







ITC Notification





In accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, we have notified the U.S. International Trade Commission of our determination.




Notification to Interested Parties





This notice also serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their
responsibility concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance
with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Failure to comply is a violation of the APO. This determination is published pursuant to section
735(d) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.20(a)(4).

<DOCTITLE>Electroluminescent High Information Content Flat Panel Displays and Display Glass Therefor From Japan; Court Decision
and Suspension of Liquidation</DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of court decision.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On April 14, 1994, the United States Court of International Trade (CIT) affirmed the International Trade Commission's
amended determination on remand that there is no material injury to the U.S. industry from imports of electroluminescent
(EL) flat panel displays and display glass therefor (FPDs) from Japan. If the case is not appealed, or is affirmed on
appeal, then the antidumping duty orders on El FPDs will be revoked.



In accordance with the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 

Timken Co. 

v. 

United States, 

893 F. 2d.337 (Fed. Cir. 1990), Commerce will continue to order the suspension of liquidation of the subject merchandise.






</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background



On April 26, 1991, the International Trade Commission (ITC) determined that a U.S. industry was being materially
injured by reason of imports of FPDs from the Japan (56 FR 43937, Sept. 5, 1991). On September 4, 1991, the Department
published an antidumping duty order on EL FPDs (56 FR 43741).

The ITC decision was appealed, and the CIT remanded the determination to the ITC to reconsider its injury determination.
On March 8, 1993, the ITC determined on remand that no U.S. industry was being materially injured by reason of imports
of El FPDs. This remand was affirmed by the CIT on April 14, 1994, 

Hosiden Corporation 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 94-60 (CIT April 14, 1994).


Accordingly, absent an appeal, or , if appealed, upon a final decision by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(CAFC) affirming the CIT, the antidumping duty order will be revoked. Plaintiffs in the proceedings obtained an injunction
enjoining liquidation of entries of EL FPDs that remain unliquidated as of 5 p.m., January 24, 1994. Therefore, revocation
of the order will be effective for all entries that remain unliquidated as of the date of revocation.


Suspension of Liquidation


In its decision in 

Timken Co. 

v. 

United States,

 893 F.2d 337 (Fed. Cir. 1990), the CAFC held that the Department must publish notice of a decision of the CIT or the CAFC
which is not in harmony with the Department's or the ITC's respective determinations. Publication of this notice
fulfills that obligation. The CAFC also held that in such a case, the Department must suspend liquidation until there
is a final decision in the action. Therefore, the Department is continuing to suspend liquidation at the current cash
deposit rate pending the expiration of the period of appeal of, if appealed, pending a final decision of the CAFC.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of preliminary results of antidumping duty administrative review.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In response to a request by the respondent, the New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board, the Department of Commerce
has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on fresh kiwifruit from New Zealand. The review
covers one exporter and the period November 27, 1991, through May 31, 1993. The review indicates the existence of margins
for the exporter. 


As a result of this review, we preliminarily determine to assess antidumping duties equal to the difference between
the United States price and foreign market value. 
Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.

In general, the Department relies on monthly weighted-average prices in the calculation of FMV. In consideration
of the significant volume of third-country sales involved in this review, we decided to test respondents' third-country
sales to determine whether we could use annual FMVs as a basis of comparison to U.S. sales. To determine whether a period
of review (POR) weighted-average price was representative of the transactions under consideration, we performed
a three-step test. See 

Antifriction Bearings from Japan, et al.; Final Results of Review, 

58 FR 42289 (1993). 
We first compared the monthly weighted-average third-country price for each model with the weighted-average POR
price of that model. We calculated the proportion of each model's sales whose POR weighted-average price did not vary
more than plus or minus 10 percent from the monthly weighted-average prices. We did this test for each model of kiwifruit.
We then compared the volume of sales of all models of kiwifruit whose POR weighted-average price did not vary more than
plus or minus 10 percent from the monthly weighted-average price with the total volume of sales of kiwifruit. If the
POR weighted-average price of at least 90 percent of sales of kiwifruit did not vary more than plus or minus 10 percent
from the monthly weighted-average price, we considered the POR weighted-average price to be representative of the
transactions under consideration. Finally, we tested whether there was any correlation between fluctuations in
price and time for each model. We found that no significant correlation existed between price and time (See analysis
memorandum to the file, 4/25/94). That is, prices did not consistently rise or fall so as to make annual weighted-average
prices unrepresentative of home market prices. 
Because many of the NZKMB's sales were determined to be at prices below the cost of production (COP) during the investigation,
the Department initiated a COP investigation for the purposes of this administrative review. Just as the Department
found in the investigation, we find that in comparing third-country sales to COP, the reseller/exporter's acquisition
prices are irrelevant because section 773(b) of the Tariff Act requires that the Department look at the actual COP
of the subject merchandise. Thus, we used the cost incurred by kiwifruit farmers, the actual producers of the subject
merchandise, to calculate the COP benchmark. 
Due to the large number of growers from which the NZKMB purchased kiwifruit during the POR, the Department determined
that sampling was both administratively necessary and methodologically appropriate to calculate a representative
cost of producing the subject merchandise for purposes of this administrative review (See section 777A of the Tariff
Act). Based on comments submitted by the petitioner and the respondent, we decided to select kiwifruit growers on
a stratified basis across the categories of regional location. Farms were stratified by geographic regions into
either the Bay of Plenty region or non-Bay of Plenty regions. This division was made because 70 percent of the New Zealand
kiwifruit is produced in the Bay of Plenty region and it is considered to be the most cost-effective area in which to
grow kiwifruit. Once farms were categorized into two geographic regions, a random sample of 20 growers was selected.
Since 70 percent of the New Zealand kiwifruit production originates in the Bay of Plenty region, we selected 14 growers
representing this region. An additional six growers were selected from the non-Bay of Plenty regions. 
We sent COP questionnaires through the NZKMB to the 20 kiwifruit growers, all of which responded to the Department's
questionnaire. These 20 responses, along with supplemental responses and verification results, were analyzed
and relied upon, where appropriate, in reaching the preliminary results of the review. 
We calculated the cost of cultivation for each grower by summing all costs for the 1992 kiwifruit season. These costs
included the cost of materials, farm labor, farm overhead, and packing. We allocated the cost on a per tray-equivalent
basis over the total number of tray-equivalents submitted by each grower to the NZKMB. We then adjusted those costs
to reflect the fruit loss of 22 percent, which was disclosed by the NZKMB in its financial statement. We added the NZKMB's
general and administrative expenses to the farm's average cost per tray.

The orchard set-up costs for all growers were amortized over 20 years (See memorandum to Holly A. Kuga, 4/21/94). Because
several growers failed to provide actual orchard set-up costs, we must base our determination on the ``best information
available'' (BIA), pursuant to 19 CFR 353.37(a). For those growers that did not or could not provide actual set-up
costs, we used grower number 17's average cost per hectare, collected at verification, as BIA to calculate set-up
costs. These are the highest orchard set-up costs of the 20 growers in our sample. 

For growers that allocated costs over the productive area, that is, canopy area, we made adjustments to include the
headlands and sidelands in the productive area of the kiwifruit orchard for the purpose of allocating costs. 

We made adjustments to growers' cost for depreciation, interest, labor, repairs, management, vehicles, fertilizer,
spraying, rates (property tax), electricity, shelter, water, general and administrative, pruning, and mowing
on a farm-specific basis where appropriate. 

For the grower that failed verification, we used BIA to determine its COP, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.37(a). This BIA was
based on the highest COP we calculated for all responding growers. 

We calculated a simple average COP from the sampled growers' individual COPs. The total COP was calculated on a New
Zealand dollar per single-layer tray equivalent basis (NZ$/SLT). 

Pursuant to Department practice, in conducting our COP analysis, if over 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a particular
model were at prices above the COP, we did not disregard any below-cost sales of that model because we determined that
the respondent's below-cost sales were not made in substantial quantities, as required under section 773(b) of the
Tariff Act. See 

Certain Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings from Thailand; Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value,

 57 FR 21065 (1992). If between 10 and 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a particular model were at prices above the
COP, we retained the sales above cost for analysis, and we examined the sales below cost to determine whether they occurred
over an extended period of time. Consistent with the Departments' practice, the Department disregarded those sales
made below cost if occurring in more than two months. Where we found that more than 90 percent of respondent's sales
of a model were at prices below the COP and over an extended period of time, we disregarded all home market sales of that
model and based FMV on constructed value (CV) in accordance with section 773(b) of the Tariff Act. There is no information
on the record demonstrating that prices of below cost sales would recover all costs within a reasonable period of time.


To calculate CV, the statutory minimum profit of eight percent was added because the NZKMB's actual profit was less
than the statutory minimum (See section 773(e) of the Tariff Act). We added selling, general and administrative expenses
for the NZKMB to the farm's average cost per tray because the actual expenses were higher than the statutory minimum
of 10 percent. 

We adjusted third-country prices, where appropriate, to reflect deductions for rebates, New Zealand inland freight,
New Zealand inland freight insurance, New Zealand port loading expenses, ocean freight and charter insurance. Direct
advertising, imputed credit, and letter of credit charges were also deducted. 
We also deducted indirect selling expenses including inventory carrying costs, New Zealand instore and fire insurance,
product liability and tamper insurance, indirect advertising, and other indirect selling expenses when calculating
FMV for comparison to ESP transactions. This deduction for third country indirect selling expenses was capped by
the amount represented by U.S. indirect selling expenses plus U.S. commissions, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b).




Preliminary Results of Review 



We have preliminarily determined that the following margin exists for the period November 27, 1991, through May 31,
1993: 



 


Interested parties may request disclosure within five days of the date of publication of this notice, and a hearing
within 10 days of the date of publication. Any hearing requested will be held as early as convenient for parties but
not later than 44 days after the date of publication, or the first workday thereafter. Case briefs, or other written
comments, from interested parties may be submitted not later than 30 days after the date of publication of this notice.
Rebuttal briefs and rebuttal comments, limited to issues raised in the case briefs, may be filed no later than 37 days
after the date of publication. The Department will publish the final results of review, including its results of its
analysis of issues raised in any such written comments. 

The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
Individual differences between U.S. price and FMV may vary from the percentage stated above. Upon completion of this
review, the Department will issue appraisement instructions concerning the respondent directly to the U.S. Customs
Service. 

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise,
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of this
administrative review, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed
firm will be that firm's rate established in the final results of this administrative review; and (2) the cash deposit
rate for merchandise exported by all other manufacturers and exporters who are not covered by this or any previous
administrative review conducted by the Department will be the ``all others'' rate of 98.60 percent established in
the LTFV investigation. 

These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next
administrative review. 

This notice serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 

This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22.

Notice of termination of circumvention inquiry of antidumping duty order.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On June 9, 1992, the Department of Commerce (the Department) received a request from Brecoflex Corporation (Brecoflex)
for a circumvention inquiry of the antidumping duty order on industrial belts and components and parts thereof, whether
cured or uncured, from Japan with respect to imports by Mectrol Corporation (Mectrol). Pursuant to that request,
the Department initiated a circumvention inquiry on October 18, 1993 (58 FR 53706). The circumvention inquiry covers
the period January 1, 1992 through June 30, 1993.


Based on a review of Brecoflex's submissions in conjunction with the International Trade Commission's (ITC) analysis
of the manufacturing process for production of industrial power belts, the Department determines that Brecoflex
does not have standing as a domestic producer of a like product to file the request in the instant inquiry. Therefore,
we are terminating the circumvention inquiry.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


On June 14, 1989, the Department published the antidumping duty order on industrial belts and components and parts
thereof, whether cured or uncured, from Japan (54 FR 25314). On August 4, 1989, we published an amended order (54 FR
32104). On June 9, 1992, Brecoflex, who identified itself as a producer of a like product in the United States, alleged
that the antidumping duty order on industrial belts from Japan was being circumvented and requested that the Department
investigate the matter. The Department initiated a circumvention inquiry on October 18, 1993.
In several submissions, Mectrol alleged that Brecoflex did not have standing to file a request for a circumvention
inquiry. Therefore, on February 1, 1994, and February 28, 1994, the Department issued a standing questionnaire and
supplemental standing questionnaire, respectively, to Brecoflex. Brecoflex responded to the standing questionnaires
on February 17, 1994, and March 4, 1994.


Analysis


Standing To File a Request for a Circumvention Inquiry


Section 353.29 of the Department's regulations states that ``[a]ny interested party, as defined in  353.2(k),
may file'' a request for a circumvention inquiry (19 CFR 353.29). In its June 9, 1993, request for a circumvention inquiry,
Brecoflex claimed standing to bring the request as a domestic producer of industrial power belts. The provision in
the Department's regulations for standing as a producer is  353.2(k)(3) which includes in the definition of
interested party ``[a] producer in the United States of the like product'' (19 CFR 353.2(k)(3)).


Brecoflex's U.S. Operations


In its June 9, 1992, request for a circumvention inquiry, Brecoflex claimed standing to bring the request as a producer
in the United States of a like product as covered by the antidumping duty order on industrial belts from Japan. Pursuant
to questions raised by Mectrol concerning Brecoflex's standing to bring this request for a circumvention inquiry,
the Department issued a standing questionnaire to Brecoflex. In its standing questionnaire response, Brecoflex
explained its U.S. operations as follows.
Brecoflex states that it imports from Germany polyurethane timing belts and performs secondary operations on these
belts in its only United States facility in Eatontown, New Jersey. The secondary operations consist of the following:



(1) Slitting of roll stock and truly endless belts to narrower belt widths;
(2) Cutting roll stock to specific lengths;
(3) Splicing and welding of open-ended roll stock to finished belts;
(4) Attaching injection molded profiles to belt backs; and
(5) Machining of finished belts such as edge grinding, removing sections of teeth, providing holes for joining belts
in linear drives, and grinding of belt back.



Brecoflex states that it fabricates, markets and sells three basic types of synchronous polyurethane timing belts
that it considers to be subject merchandise. These belts include the Breco M, the Breco V, and the Brecoflex. Brecoflex
performs the operations listed above on these three belts. (See the Department's April 15, 1994, Recommendation
Memorandum for further detail.)

Production of Industrial Power Belts


In its final report during the injury investigation in 1989, the ITC determined that there are four main stages in the
manufacturing of industrial power transmission belts:
(1) Parts manufacturing,
(2) Assembling or building,
(3) Curing or vulcanizing, and
(4) Finishing and packaging (see Industrial Belts from Japan, USITC Pub. 2194 (1989) (ITC Report) at 6 and 7). In addition,
the ITC Report describes the three main components of most industrial power belts: (1) A tensile member (a textile,
fiberglass, or steel cord, yarn, or fabric), which adds strength to withstand the tension imposed in transmitting
power;
(2) The base material (usually synthetic rubber, such as neoprene or plastics), which forms the bulk of the belt and
encloses the tensile member, and is referred to as the undercord and the overcord; and
(3) Adhesion material or gum, which bonds all the components together (USITC Pub. 2194 at a-2).
As discussed above, Brecoflex either sells the German belts as imported, or performs secondary operations on the
belts in preparation for sale. We determine that these secondary operations listed above do not add to the material
composition of the belts or fundamentally alter the essential nature of the merchandise as imported. Specifically,
the merchandise as imported already incorporates the three main components of industrial belts as described in the
ITC Report. Furthermore, the belting stock as imported has already undergone, before arrival in the United States,
the first three stages of the belt manufacturing process as described in the ITC Report.
As Brecoflex indicated in its request for a circumvention inquiry, the major cost in producing timing belts is incurred
in production of the belt stock from which the finished belts are made. As Brecoflex itself explained, completion
of a finished belt from belt stock requires merely slitting to width, cutting to length, and possibly die cutting to
length and welding. According to Brecoflex, these operations_the same secondary operations that Brecoflex performs
in its U.S. facility_involve some skilled labor but little in the way of machinery or capital investment. Thus, as
indicated in its submissions, Brecoflex performs only secondary operations in its U.S. facility, all of which fall
within the fourth stage of the belt manufacturing process as described in the ITC Report, i.e., finishing and packaging.
Brecoflex also markets and services the imported roll stock it sells in the United States.
Based on the above analysis and the information submitted by Brecoflex, the Department determines that Brecoflex
is not a domestic producer of industrial belts and, therefore, is not an interested party within the meaning of 19 CFR
353.2(k)(3) entitled to file a request for a circumvention inquiry. As such, the Department determines that Brecoflex
does not have standing to file a request for a circumvention inquiry against Mectrol.


Conclusion


Because Brecoflex Corporation is not a producer of industrial power belts in the United States and, therefore, does
not have standing under 19 CFR 353.2(k) to file a request for a circumvention inquiry with regard to the antidumping
duty order on industrial belts and components and parts thereof, whether cured or uncured, from Japan, the Department
hereby terminates this circumvention inquiry.

 Notice of Amendment to Final Results of Antidumping 
Duty Administrative Review.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On August 16, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 43327) the final results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on porcelain-on-steel
cooking ware from Mexico. Based on corrections of clerical errors, we have changed the margins for one company and
are now amending the final results.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On August 16, 1993, the Department published the final results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty
order on porcelain-on-steel cooking ware from Mexico (58 FR 43327). The review covered the period December 1, 1989
through November 30, 1990. 

On August 24, 1993, we received a letter from counsel for CINSA, S.A., alleging that the Department had made ministerial
errors. Petitioner submitted rebuttals to respondent's comments on September 1, 1993. On December 23, 1993, we determined
that ministerial errors were made. (See Memorandum to Joseph A. Spetrini dated December 23, 1993; Corrections of
Alleged Clerical/Ministerial Errors in Antidumping Duty Administrative Review.) Although these final results
are the subject of litigation before the Court of International Trade (the Court), by order dated March 31, 1994, the
Court granted the Department leave to correct these errors. 



Amended Final Results of Review 



After reviewing all comments, we have corrected the errors where appropriate. 

We corrected the double counting of CINSA's freight expenses for U.S. sales by deducting only the U.S. dollar factor
amount, instead of both the dollar and pesos amounts, from U.S. prices to arrive at the net price used in our price-to-price
comparisons. 

We recalculated the brokerage charges on U.S. sales and used the correct brokerage expense factor to derive total
brokerage charges. 

We made an additional correction. We recalculated the home market sales price used in our determination of sales below
cost by adding the value added tax to the home market price as stated in our notice of final results. 

For further discussion of the Department's positions on the above corrections, see Memorandum to Joseph A. Spetrini
dated December 23, 1993; Corrections of Alleged Clerical/Ministerial Errors in Antidumping Duty Administrative
Review. 

As a result of our corrections of clerical errors, we determine the margin for CINSA, S.A., to be 6.71 percent. 

Based on this rate, the Department will instruct the Customs Service to collect cash deposits of estimated antidumping
duties and to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries in accordance with the procedures discussed in
the final results of this review (58 FR 43327). These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until
publication of the final results of the next administrative review. 

This notice also serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during the review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent 
assessment of double antidumping duties. 

This notice is in accordance with sections 751(f) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1675(f)) and 19 CFR
353.28(c).

ACTION: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with Executive Order 11625, and 15 U.S.C. 1512, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is
soliciting competitive applications under its Minority Business Development Center (MBDC) program. The total
cost of performance for the first budget period (12 months) from September 1, 1994 to August 31, 1995 is estimated at
$222,196. The total Federal Amount is $188,867 and is composed of $184,260 plus the Audit Fee Amount of $4,607. The
application must include a minimum cost-share of 15% ($33,329) of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions.
Cost-sharing contributions may be in the form of cash contributions, client fees, in-kind contributions or combinations
thereof. The MBDC will operate in the State of Connecticut geographic service area.



The funding instrument for the MBDC will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state, and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.

The MBDC Program provides business development services to the minority business community to help establish and
maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate public and
private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of management and technical
assistance to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority
business. 

Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: The experience and capabilities of the firm and its staff
in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs of minority businesses,
individuals and organizations (50 points); the resources available to the firm in providing business development
services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included
in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points). 

An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category to be considered
programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will
then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the
demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose
of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal
Awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point score will
not necessarily receive the award.

MBDCs shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. To
assist them in this effort, MBDCs may charge client fees for management and technical assistance (M&TA) rendered.
Based on a standard rate of $50 per hour, MBDCs will charge client fees at 20% of the total cost for firms with gross sales
of $500,000 or less, and 35% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of over $500,000.

Quarterly reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities.

Sea Turtle Conservation; Shrimp Trawling Requirements 



<AGENCY>

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact 
statement; request for scoping comments. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS announces its intention to prepare a proposed rule pursuant to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) that would amend
NMFS' regulations relating to endangered and threatened species of sea turtles. The purpose of this notice is to alert
the interested public of the commencement of a scoping process and to provide for public participation in the preparation
of the environmental impact statement (EIS) as required by the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA). 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 


All sea turtles that occur in U.S. waters are listed as either endangered or threatened under the ESA. Kemp's ridley
(

Lepidochelys kempii

), leatherback (

Dermochelys coriacea

) and hawksbill (

Eretmochelys imbricata

) turtles are listed as endangered. Loggerhead (

Caretta caretta

), green (

Chelonia mydas

) and olive ridley (

Lepidochelys olivacea

) turtles are listed as threatened, except for breeding populations of green turtles in Florida and on the Pacific
coast of Mexico, and the breeding population of olive ridley turtles on the Pacific coast of Mexico, which are listed
as endangered. 
In 1990, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) completed a review of the biology of sea turtles, and the causes and
significance of their decline. The NAS concluded that incidental capture in shrimp trawls without turtle excluder
devices (TEDs) is by far the leading cause of human-induced mortality to sea turtles at sea, but collectively, the
activities in the non-shrimp fisheries constitute the second largest source of mortality. The study identified
finfish trawls, seine nets, pompano gillnets, and various passive fishing gear such as sink gillnets, weirs, traps
and longlines as potential sources of mortality to sea turtles. 
NMFS is considering sea turtle conservation measures addressing incidental takings in non-shrimp fisheries. NMFS
is considering many options, including: (1) Requiring the use of nets equipped with NMFS-approved turtle excluder
devices (TEDs) at certain times of the year by non-shrimp bottom trawl fishing vessels fishing in waters of Delaware
through Texas, to protect threatened and endangered sea turtles; (2) establishing a mandatory observer requirement
in all fisheries that may take sea turtles incidental to fishing operations; and (3) providing a mechanism to allow
NMFS to respond quickly to emergency situations that threaten listed sea turtles. Through these management actions,
NMFS intends to protect endangered and threatened sea turtles in a manner that is compatible with commercial fishing
operations. NMFS intends to solicit further public comments and to hold public hearings during the rulemaking process.



1. TED-Use Requirement 


Under the current regulations, most shrimp trawlers are required to use TEDs in inshore and offshore waters from North
Carolina through Texas. Other bottom-trawl vessels using essentially the same equipment are not required to use
TEDs, despite operating in areas with turtles. NMFS has determined that non-shrimp bottom trawlers, such as summer
flounder bottom trawlers, are as likely to capture and drown sea turtles as are shrimp trawlers. Through an interim
rule (58 FR 48797, September 20, 1993), NMFS currently requires the summer flounder fishery to use TEDs in the waters
off North Carolina and southern Virginia. 
Turtle stranding and observation data suggest that turtles are found year-round off portions of North Carolina,
in the waters of Virginia and Maryland from May through December, and in New York coastal bays from July through October.
Information on turtle occurrence and capture is limited for areas north of Delaware Bay. However, NMFS is collecting
data on the possible incidental take of turtles in the North Atlantic. 
NMFS is considering requiring bottom trawlers operating in offshore waters south of Cape May, NJ, to use TEDs, and
is collecting information regarding when and where bottom trawlers interact with sea turtles. NMFS requests comments
on bottom trawl gear and fisheries that may capture sea turtles.

2. Mandatory Observer Coverage 


Under the current regulations (50 CFR 227.72), NMFS must propose a temporary rule in order to require mandatory observer
coverage in any non-shrimp fishery that may take sea turtles. 
Non-shrimp fisheries using longlines, bottom trawls, gillnets, pound nets and traps are suspected to be major causes
of sea turtle mortality at sea. The NAS recommended that NMFS conduct a comprehensive observer-based assessment
of incidental capture of sea turtles in non-shrimp fisheries. 
NMFS is considering establishing a mandatory observer requirement in those fisheries that are not already required
to carry observers upon NMFS request. The observer system would require NMFS to publish a finding that a specific fishery
is believed to be taking sea turtles. This finding would notify the fishery that the Regional Director may require
observers at any time, and will notify vessel owners by personal communication. An observer requirement might also
include a registration requirement, observer access requirement and observer treatment standards. 


3. Emergency Response Framework 


Under the current regulations (50 CFR 227.72), NMFS cannot take timely action during emergencies that result in mass
turtle strandings. Unpredictable situations, despite compliance with current regulations, may require immediate
sea turtle conservation measures that cannot wait for lengthy agency and public review. Emergency rulemaking can
take 2 weeks to 2 months to implement, depending on the required measures and complexity of the rule. 
NMFS is considering the establishment of framework measures to respond to specific sea turtle emergencies. For example,
if NMFS determines that high concentrations of small juvenile turtles that are not excluded by standard TEDs are occurring
with fishing activity, it may notify the fishery (through the 

Federal Register

 and various media) of immediate conservation measures such as gear modification, observers, or area closures. Because
the industry will have been notified in advance through rulemaking that specific emergency measures may be required
for specific purposes, delayed effectiveness and prior notice would not be required. Emergency conservation measures
could be in effect for up to 30 days.

SUMMARY: 

This notice revises the schedules of income eligibility levels for participation in the Foster Grandparent Program
(FGP) and Senior Companion Program (SCP), published in 58 FR 13735, March 15, 1993 and 58 FR 40405, July 28, 1993



The revised schedules are based on changes in program regulations published in 59 FR 15120, March 31, 1994 and in the
Poverty Guidelines from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), published in 59 FR 6277, February 10,
1994. The change in regulations eliminates the SSI (Supplemental Security Income) adjustment to income eligibility
used in prior years. No volunteer currently participating in these programs shall become ineligible as a result of
this change in guidelines.
In accordance with the revised program regulations, the income eligibility level for each State is 125 percent of
the DHHS Poverty Guidelines, except in those areas determined by the Corporation to be of higher cost of living in which
case the guideline shall be 135 percent of the DHHS Poverty Guidelines.
The level of eligibility is rounded to the next highest multiple of $5.00.
For purposes of determining eligibility, an amount not to exceed 15 percent of the applicable FGP/SCP income guideline
is deductible from gross income for out-of-pocket medical expenses of the applicant, enrollee, or spouse.
Any person whose income is not more than 100 percent of the DHHS Poverty Guideline for her/his specific family unit
shall be given special consideration for participation in the Foster Grandparent and Senior Companion Programs.

<DOCTITLE>Availability of Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the Proposed Anacostia River and Tributaries,
District of Columbia and Maryland Feasibility Study</DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, DOD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Baltimore District of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers investigated the feasibility of construction of fish and wildlife
restoration measures in the Anacostia River basin. The District Engineer recommends the restoration of 80 acres
of wetlands, t miles of streams and 33 acres of bottomland habitat. The feasibility study of the potential restoration
actions was conducted under authority of a U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Public Works and Transportation
resolution adopted September 8, 1988. The non-Federal sponsors for the feasibility phase of the project are: Montgomery
County, Prince Georges County, the District of Columbia, the State of Maryland, the Interstate Commission on the
Potomac River Basin, and the Metropolitan Washington Counsel of Governments.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 






1. The U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Public Works and Transportation, authorized the Anacostia River
and Tributaries study in a resolution adopted on September 8, 1988. The resolution requested the Corps of Engineers
to determine if further improvements for flood control, navigation, erosion, sedimentation, water quality and
other related water resources needs are advisable on the Anacostia River and Tributaries.

2. The Anacostia River basin is a 170-square-mile sub-basin of the Potomac River. Headwaters of the Anacostia River
are in the Piedmont and coastal plain areas of Montgomery and Prince Georges Counties, Maryland and it joins with the
Potomac River in the District of Columbia. The entire river system is freshwater; although, the total tidal influence
extends for approximately 9 miles above the confluence with the Potomac River.


3. The Corps of Engineers involvement in the basin dates back more than 115 years and includes projects and programs
for navigation, flood control, debris removal and aquatic vegatation control. These Federal actions have served
their intended purposes well and have benefited the area in terms of improved navigation and reduced flood damage.
However, from 1902 through the 1960s, project construction eliminated approximately 2,600 acres of wetlands, 99,000
linear feet of aquatic habitat and 700 acres of bottomland hardwoods. These ecosystems performed numerous beneficial
ecological functions for the Anacostia basin and the associated Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay. One of the primary
functions of these ecosystems is fish and wildlife habitat. Historically, the Anacostia River basin contained a
diverse assemblage of fish and wildlife species. However, populations of many species have sharply declined due
to the habitat loss and degradation in the Anacostia basin.

5. The Baltimore District has prepared a DEIS which describes the impacts of the proposed projects on environmental
and cultural resources in the study area and the overall public interest. The DEIS also apply guidelines issued by
the Environmental Protection Agency, under authority of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act of 1977 (Pub. L. 95-217).
An evaluation of the proposed actions on the waters of the United States was performed pursuant to the guidelines of
the Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, under authority of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
The Section 404(b)(1) evaluations show that the proposed actions meet all guidelines under the Clean Water Act, and
an exemption under Section 404(r) of Public Law 92-500, as amended is therefore requested.

6. The public involvement included meetings and close coordination with interested private individuals and organizations,
as well as concerned Federal, state and local agencies. A public notice requesting comments on the proposed project
and DE is being provided to appropriate agencies and the public through printed media and mailings. The Baltimore
District invites potentially affected Federal, state and local agencies, and other interested organizations and
parties to comment on the study recommendations. Agencies that are currently involved in the feasibility study and
EIS process include, but are not limited to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
National Marine Fisheries Service, U.S. Geological Service, U.S. Soil Conservation Service, National Park Service,
National Capital Planning Commission, Montgomery County Department of Environmental Protection, Prince George's
County Department of Environmental Resources, District of Columbia Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs
and Department of Public Works, Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Maryland Department of the Environment,
Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission, Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin, and the
Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments.

7. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Clean Water Act, the Corps of Engineers
is soliciting comments from the public, Federal, state and local agencies and officials, and other interested parties.
Any comments received will be considered by the Corps of Engineers in the decision to implement the projects. To make
this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other interest factors listed above. Comments are also used to determine the overall
public interest and the need for a public hearing on the proposed activities. This public notice is being sent to organizations
and individuals known to have an interest in the restoration of the Anacostia River basin. Please bring this notice
to the attention of any other individuals with an interest in this matter.

8. Any person who has an interest in the proposed projects may make comments and/or request a public hearing. Comments
must clearly set forth the interest which may be adversely affected by these activities and the manner in which the
interest may be adversely affected. Copies of the DEIS are available upon request. Written comments must be submitted
within 30 calendar days of the date of the notice in the 

Federal Register.

<DOCTITLE>Northwest Pipeline Corp.; Request Under Blanket Authorization</DOCTITLE>


May 2, 1994.


Take notice that on April 26, 1994, Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest), 295 Chipeta Way, Salt Lake City,
Utah 84158, filed in Docket No. CP94-379-000 a request pursuant to  157.205 of the Commission's
Regulations to partially abandon existing facilities and to construct and operate replacement facilities at the
Genesee Meter Station in Whitman County, Washington to maintain the ability to accommodate its existing firm maximum
daily delivery obligations (MDDO) to The Washington Water Power Company (Water Power), a local distribution company,
under Northwest's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-433-000, pursuant to Section 7 of the
Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.
Northwest proposes to replace a two-inch positive displacement meter at the Genesee Meter Station in Whitman County,
Washington with a two-inch Roots meter which will decrease the maximum design delivery capacity of the station from
350 dth per day to approximately 185 dth per day at 150 psig. Northwest states that the smaller design capacity would
be adequate to deliver the current MDDO of 128 dth per day at this point. Northwest states that the estimated cost of
replacing the facilities at the Genesee Meter Station is $30,440, including the $2,622 cost of removing the retired
facilities. Northwest indicates that since it initiated this project to replace obsolete equipment, Northwest
would not require any cost reimbursement from Water Power.
Further, Northwest states that no significant impact on Northwest's peak day or annual deliveries is projected from
the proposed facility replacement. Northwest's tariff does not prohibit the modification of delivery point facilities
and any volumes delivered to the Genesee delivery point would be within the authorized entitlements of any shipper.
Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file
pursuant to rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention
and pursuant to  157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request.
If not protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective
the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time
allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to
section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.

<USDEPT>FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>BankAmerica Corporation, San Francisco, California; Application To Engage in Nonbanking Activities</DOCTITLE>


BankAmerica Corporation, San Francisco, California (Applicant), has applied pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the
Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC Act) and  225.23(a)(3) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(3))
to engage 

de novo

 through BA Futures, Inc., Chicago, Illinois (Company), a futures commission merchant registered under the Commodity
Exchange Act (7 U.S.C.  1 

et seq.

), in executing and clearing, and clearing without executing the following contracts on the following exchanges:
Light Sweet Crude Oil Futures, Options on Light Sweet Crude Oil Futures, No. 2 Heating Oil Futures and Options on No.
2 Heating Oil Futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange; Corn Futures, Options on Corn Futures, Wheat Futures, Options
on Wheat Futures, Soybean Futures and Options on Soybean Futures on the Chicago Board of Trade; and Live Cattle Futures,
Options on Live Cattle Futures, Feeder Cattle Futures, Options on Feeder Cattle Futures, Live Hog Futures and Options
on Live Hog Futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Applicant proposes to conduct these activities throughout
the world.
Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires
that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine
that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case
that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public
benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects.
A particular activity may be found to meet the closely related to banking test if it is demonstrated that banks have
generally provided the proposed activity, that banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally
similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity, or that banks
generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their provision
in a specialized form. 

National Courier Ass'n v. Board of Governors

, 516 F.2d 1229, 1237 (D.C. Cir. 1975). In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that
the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement
Regarding Regulation Y, 49 FR 806, January 5, (1984).
The Board previously has approved acting as a futures commission merchant in executing and clearing the proposed
commodity contracts. 

See

 Bank of Montreal, 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 1049 (1993); 

J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated

, 80 Federal Reserve Bulletin 151 (1994)(

J.P. Morgan

). The Board also previously has approved providing a combination of advisory services regarding nonfinancial commodity
derivatives and acting as a futures commission merchant in the execution and clearance of these derivatives. 

J.P. Morgan

. 
Applicant proposes to conduct the proposed activities in a manner that differs slightly from what previously has
been approved by the Board. Specifically, in 

J.P. Morgan

 the Board conditioned approval of the application on J.P. Morgan's commitment that it would not perform execution,
clearance or investment advisory services for commodity funds (or commodity pools) owned, sponsored by, or otherwise
affiliated with, J.P. Morgan. In contrast, Applicant proposes that Company's customers would include a managed
commodity fund formed outside of the United States, sponsored by an affiliate of Applicant.
In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice
of the proposal is published solely to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application
and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the
BHC Act.
Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than May 23, 1994. Any request for a hearing
on this application must, as required by  262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be accompanied
by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically
any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating
how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.
This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.

Analysis of Consent Order To Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement, subject to final approval, to a proposed consent order from
respondents AJM Packaging Corporation, a Michigan corporation, and Abram Epstein, an officer of said corporation.

The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the agreement's proposed order.

This matter concerns the package labeling of ``Nature's Own Green Label'' disposable paper plates. The Commission's
complaint in this matter charges that respondents' labeling falsely represented that ``Nature's Own Green Label''
disposable paper plates are recyclable after ordinary use. In fact, the complaint alleges, while ``Nature's Own
Green Label'' disposable paper plates are capable of being recycled, the vast majority of consumers cannot recycle
the product because there are virtually no collection facilities that accept used paper plates for recycling. The
complaint further charges that the respondents' labeling contained unsubstantiated representations concerning
the plates' alleged degradability and the environmental benefits that could be obtained when the bags were disposed
of as trash that is subsequently buried in a sanitary landfill (customary disposal). The complaint alleges that the
respondents represented that ``Nature's Own Green Label'' disposable paper plates offer a significant environmental
benefit when consumers customarily disposed of them, and that ``Nature's Own Green Label'' disposable paper plates
will completely break down, decompose and return to nature_

i.e.,

 decompose into elements found in nature_within a reasonably short period of time after customary disposal.

The proposed consent order contains provisions designed to remedy the violations charged and to prevent the respondents
from engaging in similar acts and practices in the future.

Part I of the proposed order requires that the respondents cease representing, in any manner, directly or by implication,
that any of their paper products or packages are ``degradable,'' ``biodegradable,'' or ``photodegradable,'' or
through the use of such terms or similar terms, that any such product or package offers any environmental benefits
when consumers dispose of them as trash that is buried in a sanitary landfill, unless the respondents have competent
and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate the representations at the time they are made.

Part II of the proposed order requires that the respondents cease misrepresenting, in any manner, directly or by implication,
the extent to which any paper product or package is capable of being recycled or the extent to which recycling collection
programs are available.

Part III of the proposed order requires the respondents to cease representing that their products or packages offer
any environmental benefit, unless at the time of making such a representation, the respondents possess and rely upon
competent and reliable evidence, which when appropriate must be competent and reliable scientific evidence, that
substantiates such representations.

Part IV of the proposed order permitted the respondents to deplete their existing inventory of certain paper plate
product packaging in the normal course of business without violating the order until October 31, 1993.

The proposed order also requires the respondents to maintain materials relied upon to substantiate the claims covered
by the order, to distribute copies of the order to certain company officials, to notify the Commission of any changes
in corporate structure that might affect compliance with the order, to notify the Commission of any changes in the
business or employment of the named individual respondent, and to file one or more reports detailing compliance with
the order.

The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

Analysis of Consent Order To Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement, subject to final approval, to a proposed consent order from
respondents LePage's, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, and LP Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation.


The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the agreement's proposed order.

This matter concerns the labeling and advertising of LePage's Biodegradable Transparent Tape. The Commission's
complaint in this matter alleges that LePage's Biodegradable Transparent Tape is a cellophane tape made from wood
pulp and adhesive material; that the retail tape product is sold with a hard clear non-foam polystyrene plastic dispenser
that does not identify the type(s) of plastic resin from which it is made; and that the tape and dispenser are attached
to a non-corrugated paperboard or cardboard backcard. The complaint charges that the respondents represented without
substantiation that LePage's Biodegradable Transparent Tape will completely break down and return to nature_

i.e.,

 decompose into elements found in nature_within a reasonably short period of time after customary disposal and that
compared to other transparent tape, LePage's Biodegradable Transparent Tape offers a significant environmental
benefit after customary disposal. The complaint further charges that the respondents falsely represented that
the plastic tape dispenser and paperboard backcard of LePage's Biodegradable Transparent Tape are recyclable.
In fact, the complaint alleges, the plastic tape dispenser and the paperboard package are not recyclable, because
there are only a few collection facilities nationwide that will accept the non-foam polystyrene tape dispenser or
the non-corrugated paperboard or cardboard backcard for recycling.

The proposed consent order contains provisions designed to remedy the violations charged and to prevent the respondents
from engaging in similar acts and practices in the future.



Part I of the proposed order requires that the respondents cease and desist from representing, in any manner, directly
or by implication, that any of their products or packages are degradable, biodegradable, or photodegradable, or
more specifically through the use of such terms or similar terms that any such product or package offers any environmental
benefits when consumers dispose of it as trash that is buried in a sanitary landfill, unless at the time of making such
representation, the respondents possess and rely upon competent and reliable scientific evidence that substantiates
such representation.




Part II of the proposed order requires that the respondents cease and desist from misrepresenting, in any manner,
directly or by implication, with respect to any product or package the extent to which it is capable of being recycled
or to which recycling collection programs are available. Part II also contains a provision that allows the respondents
to advertise non-foam polystyrene and non-corrugated paperboard and cardboard products or packages as recyclable
without violating Part II of the order. The respondents may do so if they truthfully represent that such products or
packages are capable of being recycled; disclose clearly, prominently and in close proximity to such claim (a) that
such product or package is recyclable in the few communities with recycling collection programs for non-foam polystyrene
or for non-corrugated paperboard or cardborad; or (b) the approximate number of U.S. communities with recycling
collection programs for such product or package; or (c) the approximate percentage of U.S. population to which recycling
collection programs for such product or package are available; and in addition, in the case of any non-foam polystyrene
product or package, such product or package itself bears a clear identification of the specific plastic resin(s)
from which it is made.


Part III of the proposed order provides that if the respondents represent in advertising or labeling that any product
or package offers any environmental benefit, they must have a reasonable basis consisting of competent and reliable
evidence, which when appropriate must be competent and reliable scientific evidence, that substantiates the claims.


The proposed order also requires the respondents to maintain materials relied upon to substantiate the claims covered
by the order, to distribute copies of the order to certain company officials, to notify the Commission of any changes
in corporate structure that might affect compliance with the order, and to file one or more reports detailing compliance
with the order.


The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement, subject to final approval, to a proposed consent order from
respondents Mia Rose Products, Inc., a California corporation, and Mia Rose Palencar, individually and as an officer
of the corporation.

The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action or make final the agreement's proposed order.

This matter concerns two products, named ``Air Therapy'' and ``Pet Air,'' sold by Mia Rose Products, Inc. (``the company'').
Air Therapy and Pet Air are air sprays made from the essential oils of citrus fruit and/or herbs. These two products
have identical ingredients, and are both sold for their alleged air freshening, air cleaning and insecticidal effects.
The Commission's complaint charges that respondents' advertising contained false and unsubstantiated representations
that these products are effective in eliminating indoor air pollutants and household insects. Specifically, the
complaint alleges that respondents falsely represented that: (1) These products are effective in cleaning or purifying
indoor air; (2) these products are more effective in cleaning or purifying indoor air than conventional air cleaning
products; (3) spraying these products into the air eliminates smoke; (4) spraying these products into the air eliminates
pollen; (5) spraying these products into the air eliminates airborne bacteria; (6) spraying Pet Air into the air eliminates
pet dander; (7) spraying Air Therapy into the air eliminates household insects; and (8) spraying these products into
the air eliminates, rather than masks, odors.

The proposed consent order contains provisions designed to remedy the violations charged and to prevent the respondents
from engaging in similar acts and practices in the future. Part I of the proposed order would prohibit the company from
making any of the false claims delineated above for Air Therapy, Pet Air, or any products with substantially similar
ingredients.

Part II of the proposed order includes broad fencing-in relief, requiring the respondents to cease and desist from
representing the efficacy or performance of any air cleaning, air freshening, or insecticidal product unless such
representation is true, and at the time of making such representation, Mia Rose possesses and relies upon competent
and reliable evidence, which when appropriate must be competent and reliable scientific evidence.

Part IV of the proposed order is a provision that allows the company a period of four months from the date the proposed
order becomes final before it is obligated to re-word its labeling on its current inventory of Air Therapy and Pet Air
cans. All other provisions of the order become effective immediately upon the Commission's issuance of the order
as final.

The proposed order also requires the respondents to maintain materials relied upon to substantiate claims covered
by the order; to provide a copy of the consent agreement to all employees or representatives involved in the preparation
and placement of the company's advertisements, or in communication with the company's customers or prospective
customers; to notify the Commission of any changes in corporate structure that might affect compliance with the order;
to notify the Commission of certain changes in the business or employment of the named individual respondent; and
to file one or more reports detailing compliance with the order.

The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

Definitions

The term 

product or package

 means any product or package that is offered for sale, sold or distributed to the public by respondents, their successors
and assigns, under the Oak Hill brand name or any other brand name of respondents, their successors and assigns; and
also means any product or package sold or distributed to the public by third parties under private labeling agreements
with respondents, their successors and assigns.



Competent and reliable scientific evidence

 shall mean tests, analyses, research, studies or other evidence based on the expertise of professionals in the relevant

labeling, advertising, promotion, offering for sale, sale, or distribution of any product or package in or affecting
commerce, as ``commerce'' is defined in the Federal Trade Commission Act, do forthwith cease and desist from misrepresenting,
in any manner, directly or by implication, the extent to which:

(1) Any such product or package is capable of being recycled; or,

(2) Recycling collection programs for such product or package are available.

B. Provided, however, respondents will not be in violation of part I(A)(2) of this Order, in connection with the advertising,
labeling, offering for sale, sale, or distribution of any non-foam polystyrene, polypropylene film, or low-density
polyethylene film product or package, if they truthfully represent that such product or package is recyclable, provided
that:

(1) Respondents disclose clearly, prominently, and in close proximity to such representation:

(a) In regard to any non-foam polystyrene product or package, that such product or package is recyclable in the few
communities with recycling collection programs for non-foam polystyrene; in regard to any polypropylene film product
or package, that such product or package is recyclable in the few communities with recycling collection programs

Foster, individually and as an officer of said corporation, and respondents' agents, representatives, and employees,

Analysis of Consent Order To Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement, subject to final approval, to a proposed consent order from
respondents Oak Hill Industries Corp., a New York corporation, and Malcolm Foster, individually and as an officer
of the corporate respondent.

The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the agreement's proposed order.

This matter concerns the labeling and advertising of Oak Hill brand plastic plates, bowls and utensils. The Commission's
complaint in this matter alleges that Oak Hill brand plastic plates, bowls and utensils are made from non-foam polystyrene;
that they are packaged in thin plastic packaging which is sometimes made from polypropylene film and at other times
from low-density polyethylene film; and that such plastic products and packaging do not identify the type(s) of plastic
resin from which they are made. The complaint charges that Oak Hill falsely represented that the plastic plates, bowls
and utensils and the plastic film packaging are recyclable. In fact, the complaint alleges, the plastic products
and packaging are not recyclable, because there are only a few collection facilities nationwide that will accept
non-foam polystyrene plates, bowls or utensils or the polypropylene film or low-density polyethylene film plastic
packaging for recycling.

The proposed consent order contains provisions designed to remedy the violations charged and to prevent the respondents
from engaging in similar acts and practices in the future.

Part I of the proposed order requires that respondents cease and desist from misrepresenting, in any manner, directly
or by implication, with respect to any product or package the extent to which it is capable of being recycled or to which
recycling collection programs are available. Part I also contains a proviso that allows the respondents to advertise
non-foam polystyrene, polypropylene film or low-density polyethylene film products or packages as recyclable
without violating Part I of the order. The respondents may do so if they truthfully represent that such products or
packages are capable of being recycled; disclose clearly, prominently and in close proximity to such claim: (a) That
such product or package is recyclable in the few communities with recycling collection programs for non-foam polystyrene,
polypropylene film or low-density polyethylene film; or (b) the approximate number of U.S. communities with recycling
collection programs for such product or package; or (c) the approximate percentage U.S. communities or the U.S. population
to which recycling collection programs for such product or package are available; and in addition, such product or
package itself bears a clear identification of the specific plastic resin(s) from which it is made.

Part II of the proposed order provides that if the respondents represent in advertising or labeling that any product
or package offers any environmental benefit, they must have a reasonable basis consisting of competent and reliable
evidence, which when appropriate must be competent and reliable scientific evidence, that substantiates the claims.

The proposed order also requires respondents to maintain materials relied upon to substantiate the claims covered
by the order, to distribute copies of the order to certain company officials, to notify the Commission of any changes
in corporate structure that might affect compliance with the order, and to file one or more reports detailing compliance
with the order.

The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

 Preamendments Class III Devices; Strategy Document; Availability



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is making available a document that sets forth the agency's strategy for implementing
the provisions of the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (the SMDA) which require FDA to review the classification of
certain class III (premarket approval) devices, and either reclassify the devices into class I (general controls)
or class II (special controls) or retain them in class III. The statute also requires FDA to establish a schedule for
requiring the submission of premarket approval applications (PMA's) for those devices retained in class III.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 513 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360c) requires the classification of medical
devices into one of three regulatory classes: Class I (general controls), class II (special controls), and class
III (premarket approval). Generally, devices that were on the market before May 28, 1976, the date of enactment of
the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (the amendments) (Pub. L. 94-295), and devices marketed on or after that
date that are substantially equivalent to such devices, have been classified by FDA. This notice refers to both the
devices that were on the market before May 28, 1976, and the substantially equivalent devices that were marketed on
or after that date, as ``preamendments devices.''


 Section 515(b)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(b)(1)) establishes the requirement that a preamendments device that
FDA has classified into class III is subject to premarket approval. However, submission of a PMA, or a notice of completion
of a product development protocol (PDP), is not required until 90 days after FDA promulgates a final rule requiring
premarket approval for the device, or 30 months after final classification of the device, whichever is later. Similarly,
a preamendments device is not required to have an approved investigational device exemption (IDE) (21 CFR part 812)
contemporaneous with its interstate distribution until the date identified by FDA in the final rule requiring submission
of a PMA for the device. To date, FDA has issued eight final rules requiring submission of PMA's for preamendments class
III devices. Nine additional proposed rules have been issued.
 The SMDA (Pub. L. 101-629) added new section 515(i) to the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(i)). This section requires FDA
to order manufacturers of class III preamendments devices for which no final rule has been issued requiring the submission
of PMA's to submit to FDA a summary of, and citation to, any information known or otherwise available to the manufacturer
respecting such devices, including adverse safety and effectiveness information that has not been submitted under
section 519 of the act (21 U.S.C. 360i). Section 515(i) of the act further directs FDA to publish a regulation before
December 1, 1995, for each device subject to section 515(i) either revising the classification of the device into
class I or class II or retaining the device in class III. Within 12 months after publication of a regulation retaining
a device in class III, the statute requires FDA to establish a schedule for the promulgation of a rule requiring the
submission of PMA's for the device. However, the SMDA does not prevent FDA from proceeding immediately to rulemaking
under section 515(b) of the act on specific devices, in the interest of public health, independent of the procedure
in section 515(i) of the act.
 Since enactment of the SMDA, FDA has issued proposed rules to require the submission of PMA's for five devices: Silicone
inflatable saline filled breast prostheses; penile implants; testicular implants; nonroller cardiovascular
blood pumps; and cranial electrotherapy stimulators. FDA is now announcing the availability of a document outlining
its plans for either revising the classification, or requiring the submission of PMA's for the remaining preamendments
class III devices.


FDA has divided this universe of devices into three groups:


 1. Group 3 devices are devices that FDA believes are currently in commercial distribution and are not likely candidates
for reclassification. FDA will require the submission of PMA's for these devices in the near future. FDA intends to
issue proposed rules to require the submission of PMA's for the 15 highest priority devices in this group in phases
over the next 3 years. In accordance with the procedures in section 515(b) of the act, manufacturers will have an opportunity
to petition for reclassification of these devices by submitting a reclassification petition within 15 days of publication
of the proposed rule to require submission of PMA's. Manufacturers who wish to petition for reclassification should
begin preparing petitions for reclassification as soon as possible. FDA will initiate the 515(i) process for the
remaining Group 3 devices. 


 2. Group 2 devices are devices that FDA believes have a high potential for being reclassified into class II. For these
devices, FDA intends to issue an order under section 515(i) of the act requiring




manufacturers to submit a summary of, and citation to, any information respecting these devices. A manufacturer
who wishes to have one of these devices reclassified will be required to submit information to support reclassification
of the device.



 3. Group 1 devices are devices that FDA believes raise significant questions of safety and/or effectiveness but are
no longer used or are very limited in use. FDA believes that, for these devices, rulemaking under section 515(b) of
the act will not result in viable PMA's or reclassification petitions. FDA intends to initiate a rulemaking proceeding
to require the submission of PMA's for this group of devices. FDA will review any information received in response
to the proposed rule to determine whether to issue a final rule requiring the submission of PMA's.


 The strategy document lists the devices by categories in each of these groups. It also describes in more detail FDA's
plans for implementing these procedures.
 FDA believes that the procedures set forth in this strategy document are consistent with the congressional intent
in enacting section 515(i) of the act. The Senate report makes clear the need to require submission of PMA's as soon
as possible for those devices that are to remain in class III. (See S. Rept. 513, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 18 (1990)). Furthermore,
the House of Representatives Report of the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 stated:


In formulating these schedules [for requiring the submission of a PMA], the FDA should take into account its priorities
and limited resources, together with the Committee's intention that the evaluation process be expeditious. 


(See H. Rept. 808, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 26 (1990)). 


 Interested persons may, on or before July 9, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this strategy document. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals
may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document.
The strategy document and received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through
Friday.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing its approval of the application by Pace Medical, Inc., Waltham,
MA, for premarket approval, under section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), of the Model 4553
MICRO-PACE

TM

 Dual-Chamber, DDD, Temporary Cardiac Pacemaker (Model 4553 MICRO-PACE

TM

). FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) notified the applicant, by letter of March 10, 1994, of
the approval of the application.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On June 30, 1992, Pace Medical, Inc., Waltham, MA 02154, submitted to CDRH an application for premarket approval of
the Model 4553 MICRO-PACE

TM

. The device is a temporary external pulse generator and is indicated for use in any clinical situation in which the
use of a temporary pacemaker on a patient provides therapeutic or diagnostic value or serves a prophylactic purpose.
Indications for the use of temporary cardiac pacemakers include, but are not limited to, the following: Intermittent
or complete heart block associated with asystole or bradycardia, symptomatic sinus bradycardia, surgically induced
heart block, and heart block accompanying an acute myocardial infarction.


Additionally, temporary cardiac pacing has been used to overdrive, and thereby terminate, atrial arrhythmias,
including atrial flutter. It has been used in preparation for permanent pacemaker implantation to ascertain the
thresholds for sensing and pacing on the acute lead system. Although the intended uses of the Model 4553 MICRO-PACE

TM

 are primarily therapeutic and prophylactic, the ability to extensively program both the amplitude of the constant
voltage output and the pulse width in the Model 4553 MICRO-PACE

TM

 does make it, when necessary, a satisfactory alternative to a properly functioning pacing system analyzer for the
thresholds for sensing and stimulation.
In accordance with the provisions of section 515(f)(2) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(f)(2)) as amended by the Safe Medical
Devices Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-629), this premarket approval application (PMA) was not referred to the Circulatory
System Devices Panel, an FDA advisory panel, for review and recommendation because the information in the PMA substantially
duplicates information previously reviewed by this panel.
On March 10, 1994, CDRH approved the application by a letter to the applicant from the Acting Director of the Office
of Device Evaluation, CDRH.
A summary of the safety and effectiveness data on which CDRH based its approval is on file in the Dockets Management
Branch (address above) and is available from that office upon written request. Requests should be identified with
the name of the device and the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document.


Opportunity for Administrative Review


Section 515(d)(3) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(d)(3)) authorizes any interested person to petition, under section
515(g) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(g)), for administrative review of CDRH's decision to approve this application.
A petitioner may request either a formal hearing under part 12 (21 CFR part 12) of FDA's administrative practices and
procedures regulations or a review of the application and CDRH's action by an independent advisory committee of experts.
A petition is to be in the form of a petition for reconsideration under  10.33(b) (21 CFR 10.33(b)). A petitioner
shall identify the form of review requested (hearing or independent advisory committee) and shall submit with the
petition supporting data and information showing that there is a genuine and substantial issue of material fact for
resolution through administrative review. After reviewing the petition, FDA will decide whether to grant or deny
the petition and will publish a notice of its decision in the 

Federal Register

. If FDA grants the petition, the notice will state the issue to be reviewed, the form of review to be used, the persons
who may participate in the review, the time and place where the review will occur, and other details.
Petitioners may, at any time on or before June 6, 1994, file with the Dockets Management Branch (address above) two
copies of each petition and supporting data and information, identified with the name of the device and the docket
number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received petitions may be seen in the office above between
9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
This notice is issued under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (secs. 515(d), 520(h) (21 U.S.C. 360e(d), 360j(h)))
and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.10) and redelegated to the Center for

<DOCTITLE>Marsh-Billings National Historical Park, Woodstock, VT; Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement and
Notice of Public Scoping Period </DOCTITLE>



In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-109 section 102(2)(c)), the National
Park Service (NPS) is preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Marsh-Billings National Historical
Park (Marsh-Billings NHP), located in Woodstock, Vermont. The purpose of the EIS is to assess the impacts of alternative
management strategies which will be described in the General Management Plan for Marsh-Billings NHP. A range of alternatives
will be formulated for natural and cultural resource protection, visitor use and interpretation, facilities development,
and operations. 

The NPS will hold a series of community meetings throughout the spring of 1994, which will serve as public scoping for
the GMP/EIS. The meetings, which will be announced through various local media will be held at various locations throughout
the community. Additionally, the NPS will issue a community survey in May 1994. The purpose of these meetings and the
survey is to obtain both written and verbal comments concerning the future development of Marsh-Billings NHP. Those
persons who wish to comment verbally or in writing, who wish to participate in a small group meeting, or to 
complete a questionnaire should contact Marjorie Smith, Planning Team Captain, North Atlantic Region, National
Park Service, 15 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109-3572, or telephone (617) 223-5133. 

The draft GMP/EIS is expected to be completed and available for public review in 1995. After public and interagency
review of the draft document, comments will be considered, and a final EIS and Record of Decision will be prepared.


The responsible official is Marie Rust, Regional Director, North Atlantic Region, National Park Service, 15 State
Street, Boston, MA 02109-3572.

of individual contract actions may be published in the 

Federal Register

 and in newspapers of general circulation in the areas determined by the Reclamation to be affected by the proposed
action. Announcements may be in the form of news releases, legal notices, official letters, memorandums, or other
forms of written material. Meetings, workshops, and/or hearings may also be used, as appropriate, to provide local

to delegated or redelegated authority, the Commissioner of Reclamation or one of the Regional Directors. In some
instances, congressional review and approval of a report, water rate, or other terms and conditions of the contract
may be involved.

procedures:

1. Only persons authorized to act on behalf of the contracting entities may negotiate the terms and conditions of a
specific contract proposal.

2. Advance notice of meetings or hearings will be furnished to those parties that have made a timely written request

The Elk River Railroad, Inc._Construction and Operation Exemption_Clay and Kanawha Counties, WV 


The Commission's Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) hereby notifies all interested parties that SEA will prepare
a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) and conduct scoping meetings in this proceeding. The Elk River Railroad,
Inc. (TERRI) filed a petition for exemption seeking authority to construct and operate a 30-mile line of railroad
from Hartland to Falling Rock, in Clay and Kanawha Counties, WV. Because of the proposed construction and operation's
potential for significant environmental impacts, SEA has determined that preparation of a DEIS is necessary. 
The DEIS will address the environmental impacts associated with this proposed construction and operation and will
be served on all the parties to the proceeding and made available to the public. There will be a 45 day comment period
from the date the DEIS is served to allow the public opportunity to comment. After assessing all of the comments to the
DEIS, SEA will then issue a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) that will include SEA's final recommendations
to the Commission. The Commission will consider the FEIS and the environmental record in making its decision. 
The purpose of the scoping process is to identify significant environmental issues and determine the scope of issues
to be addressed in the DEIS. Issues typically addressed in DEIS's include alternatives to the proposed action, impacts
on transportation systems, land use, socio-economic impacts directly related to changes in the physical environment,
energy resources, air quality, noise quality, public health and safety, biological resources, water quality, historic
resources, coastal zone management consistency review, and mitigation to reduce or avoid impacts on the environment.
Persons that cannot attend the scoping meetings may submit questions and comments in writing up to 30 days after the
scoping meetings. Written comments may be submitted directly to the Commission no later than July 1, 1994. Public
scoping meetings will be held on the following dates: 
 May 31, 1994, from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m at the Clendenin Community Center (next to the Town Hall) and 
 June 1, 1994, from 4 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at the Clay High School Cafeteria.

Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.

General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 

Federal Register

, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.

Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., room S-3014, Washington, DC 20210.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR WASTE TECHNICAL REVIEW BOARD</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Panel on Structural Geology and Geoengineering: Update on the Status of the ESF</DOCTITLE>



Pursuant to its authority under section 5051 of Public Law 100-230, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act
of 1987, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board's Panel on Structural Geology & Geoengineering will hold a
meeting on Monday, June 13 and Tuesday, June 14, 1994, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The meeting will be held at the Holiday Inn
Crowne Plaza, 4255 South Paradise Road, Las Vegas, NV 89109; tel (702) 369-4400, fax (702) 369-3770. The
meeting, which is open to the public, will run from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Monday, June 13; then continue on Tuesday, June
14 at 8 a.m. The meeting on Tuesday should end around noon.




During the meeting, panel members will hear presentations from the Department of Energy (DOE) and its contractors
on improving the efficiency of underground exploration and construction of the exploratory studies facility (ESF).
Efforts are under way to identify potential ways to reduce costs and shorten the excavation schedule by simplifying
the design of the underground facility. Additional topics that will be addressed at the meeting include how the administration's
new funding proposal for the high-level waste management program (Scenario A) will affect site-suitability issues;
how to use the tunnel boring machine most efficiently during excavation of the five-mile, portal-to-portal main
loop; how thermal loading issues could affect repository design; and how the proposed plan for 100-year retrievability,
including in Scenario A, could affect the design of the repository.

The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board was created in the 1987 amendments act to evaluate the technical and scientific
activities in the DOE's civilian radioactive waste management program, including site characterization, storage,
and transport. A site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, currently is being characterized by the DOE for its suitability as
the possible location of a permanent repository for civilian spent fuel and defense high-level waste.

Transcripts of the meeting will be available on computer disk or on a library-loan basis in paper format from Victoria
Reich, Board librarian, beginning July 26, 1994. For further information, contact Frank Randall, External Affairs,
Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, 1100 Wilson Boulevard, suite 910, Arlington, Virginia 22209; (703) 235-4473.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>







Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago
Board Options Exchange, Inc. Relating to Modifications of Exchange Fees



April 29, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on April 1, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the CBOE. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The CBOE proposes to establish the following fees: (1) A $350 monthly fee for CBOE members who install ILX/WDN personal
computer (``PC'') terminals in their floor booth(s); and (2) a $150 quarterly fee for non-clearing Designated Primary
Market Makers (``DPMMs'') for the Exchange's work in reviewing their SEC Form X-17A-5 reports and conducting
annual financial audits to ensure their compliance with the Commission's net capital rule, as amended, effective
April 1, 1994.
 In addition, the Exchange proposes to expand its customer box spread fee rebate program, which is currently limited
to positions in Standard & Poor's 500 (``SPX'') index options, to make the rebate available on a member's request
for qualifying public customer positions in any and all European-style index options.







The text of the proposed fee changes is available at the office of the Secretary, CBOE and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the CBOE included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




The purpose of the proposed rule change is to establish two new fees and to extend the CBOE's current fee rebate program
for SPX options to additional classes of European-style options. The first new fee is a $350 monthly fee to CBOE members
who install ILX/WDN PC terminals in their floor booth(s). These terminals, which will replace booth-installed Quotron
terminals, will use Windows-based software and will include and ILX window for display of market data as well as a CBOE
WDN window for internal CBOE displays and functions.

The second new fee is a $150 quarterly fee to be paid by non-clearing DPMMs for the Exchange's work in reviewing their
reports on SEC Form X-17A-5 and conducting annual financial audits of such DPMMs to ensure compliance
with the Commission's net capital rule, as amended, effective April 1, 1994.
 In the past, because non-clearing market makers were exempt from the net capital rule, the CBOE'S financial oversight
of non-clearing DPMMs was less extensive, as were the CBOE'S costs therefor. Beginning on April 1, 1994, however,
non-clearing DPMMs will be required to meet portions of the Commission's net capital rule, and the Exchange's oversight
costs will increase accordingly. The CBOE believes that the $150 quarterly fee will recover a substantial portion
of the new oversight costs which the Exchange estimates it will incur.





In addition to the two new fees described above, the CBOE proposes to expand the customer box spread fee rebate program,
which is currently limited to positions in SPX options.
 The expansion will make the rebate available on a member's request for qualifying public customer positions in any
and all European-style index options. The existing rebate program, which was approved permanently in February 1993,
 enables members to reduce certain transaction and trade match fees which they pay to the Exchange.






The terms of the fee rebate and the rebate procedures proposed for all European-style index options will be identical
to the rebate terms and procedures applicable to SPX options. Under the current rebate program, as under the proposal,
CBOE members may request a rebate of 50% of their transaction and trade match fees
 assessed an options transactions that meet the following parameters: (1) The options transaction(s) are executed
for a customer account; and (2) the transactions are box spreads
 on a European-style index that total 500 or more contracts for the four sides of the spread (i.e., 125 contracts per
side).






Members seeking a fee rebate must submit a rebate request together with supporting documentation to the Exchange's
Accounting Department. At a minimum, the supporting documentation must include the trade date, the executing broker
acronym, and the contract class, series, premium, and quality.

<PARENT> FR940506-2-00078 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of section 6(b)(4), in particular, in that it provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable
dues, fees, and other charges among CBOE members and other persons using the CBOE's facilities.


(B) 

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others


No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Because the foregoing rule change establishes or changes a due, fee or other charge imposed by the Exchange, it has
become effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder.
At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the
protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the CBOE. All submissions should refer to the file number in the
caption above and should be submitted by May 27, 1994.

Bando McGlocklin Capital Corporation (``Bando'') and Bando McGlocklin Small Business Investment Corporation
(the ``SBIC Subsidiary'').





RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: 

Exemption requested under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act from sections 8(b), 12(d), 17(a), 18(a), 18(c), 30(a),

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION:

 Applicants request an order to permit Bando to form two new subsidiaries and engage in certain transactions with the
new subsidiaries. The order also would permit modified asset coverage requirements for Bando and one of the subsidiaries
and, in addition, permit certain reports to be filed on a consolidated basis. The requested order would amend two prior
orders.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations



1. Bando and the SBIC Subsidiary, Wisconsin corporations, are registered closed-end investment companies. In 1992
and 1993, the SEC issued orders to permit Bando and the SBIC Subsidiary to create a holding company structure with the
SBIC Subsidiary being a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bando, and to permit Bando to issue a class of senior security (the
``Prior Order'').
 Bando was licensed to operate as a small business investment company under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958.
On March 26, 1993, Bando transferred substantially all of its assets and its small business investment company license
to the SBIC Subsidiary. Presently, the SBIC Subsidiary provides secured loans to small businesses.





2. Bando proposes to form two additional subsidiary corporations. One of these will be a small business lender (``the
SBL Subsidiary'') participating in a government guaranteed loan program and the other will be the ``Bankruptcy Remote
Subsidiary.'' The SBL and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries will be registered closed-end investment companies under
the Act.

3. Subject to the approval of the Small Business Administration (``SBA''), the SBL Subsidiary will operate as a qualified
lender licensed under the government guaranteed loan program authorized by section 7(a) of the Small Business Act
(the ``7(a) Program''). The 7(a) Program's objective is to provide funds to small business concerns, which otherwise
may have limited access to credit. The SBA guarantees up to 70 to 85% of the principal amount of loans made by lenders
under the 7(a) Program. The SBA has notified Bando that Bando's participation in the 7(a) Program must be effected
in a corporation separate from the Bando and the SBIC Subsidiary.

4. The Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary will facilitate the ``securitization'' of portfolio loans of Bando, the SBIC
Subsidiary, and the SBL Subsidiary. Securitization of loans held by the SBL and SBIC Subsidiaries will be effected
by the sale of the loans to Bando, followed by the sale of the loans to the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary. The Bankruptcy
Remote Subsidiary then will sell the loans to a ``company'' that is not taxed as a corporation under the Internal Revenue
Code, in exchange for cash and securities issued by the company. The directors of the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary
will not be identical to those of Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary, or the SLB Subsidiary. This will enable certain securities
issued by a company and collateralized by the loans purchased from the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary to obtain an investment
grade rating. A majority of the directors of the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary will be directors of Bando. All loans
would be sold on a non-recourse basis and neither Bando nor any of its subsidiaries would guarantee payment of such
loans.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



A. Section 12(d)



1. Section 12(d)(1) of the Act limits the amount of securities a registered investment company may hold of other investment
companies. Section 12(e) provides an exemption to the section 12(d)(1) limitations for acquisitions of securities
of certain corporations, such as those that furnish capital to industry, provided that, among other things, the aggregate
cost of the securities does not exceed 5% of the total assets of the acquiring company at the time of purchase. Subsequent
to the Bando's initial acquisition of the outstanding common stock of the SBL Subsidiary, Bando's additional purchases
of the SLB Subsidiary's common stock may exceed 5% of Bando's total assets and, therefore, the section 12(e) exemption
will no longer be available.

2. In addition, because Bando will hold more than 3% of the outstanding voting stock of the SBL Subsidiary, Bando's
loans to the SBL Subsidiary could violate section 12(d)(1) if such loans were considered acquisitions of the SBL Subsidiary's
debt securities. Bando's organization of the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary and subsequent purchases of the subsidiary's
common stock also will violate section 12(d)(1) absent an exemption, and section 12(e) will not be available because
the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary will not engage in any of the businesses specified in section 12(e). Accordingly,
Bando requests an exemption from section 12(d)(1) to permit Bando to (a) make further acquisitions of the common stock
of the SBL Subsidiary, (b) acquire notes and other indebtedness of the SBL Subsidiary, and (c) acquire the common stock
of the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary.



B. Section 17(a)



1. Section 17(a) of the Act generally prohibits sales or purchases of securities between registered investment companies
and any affiliated person of that company. Bando, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary will be
affiliated persons. Since the SBL Subsidiary will be fully owned by Bando, Bando's initial acquisition of the outstanding
common stock of the SBL Subsidiary will be exempt under rule 17a-3 from section 17(a).
 In addition, applicants assert that investments in the SBL Subsidiary in the form of stock purchases, capital contributions,
or loans do not violate section 17(a) because the seller is the issuer and is controlled by Bando. Purchases and sale
of portfolio securities between Bando and the SBL Subsidiary, however, appear to be violations of section 17(a).
 Accordingly, applicants request an exemption from section 17(a) to the extent necessary to permit purchases and
sales of portfolio securities between Bando and the SBL Subsidiary.






2. Applicants assert that the organization and operation of the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary does not raise any issues
under section 17(a) because it will be able to rely on the rule 17a-3 exemption.

C. Section 18


1. Section 18(a) of the Act prohibits a registered closed-end investment company from issuing any class of senior
security unless the company complies with the asset coverage requirements set forth in the section. ``Asset coverage''
is defined in section 18(h) to mean the ratio which the value of the total assets of an issuer, less all liabilities not
represented by senior securities, bears to the aggregate amount of senior securities of such issuer. Under section
18(a), senior securities of closed-end investment companies representing indebtedness must have an asset coverage
of 300% immediately after their issuance and senior securities of such companies representing stock must have an
asset coverage of 200%. Section 18(c) prohibits a registered closed-end investment company from issuing more than
one class of senior securities representing indebtedness.
2. Bando, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary are subject to the asset coverage requirements
of section 18(a) on an individual basis, and Bando on a consolidated basis because Bando may be an indirect issuer of
senior securities with respect to the SBL and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries' indebtedness. Accordingly, Bando
would be required to treat as its own any liabilities of the SBL and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries.
3. Absent exemptive relief, the asset coverage limitations of section 18(a) would prevent the SBL Subsidiary from
using borrowings from Bando to fund 7(a) Program loans. Similarly, without an exemption, section 18(c) would preclude
the SBL Subsidiary from issuing more than one class of securities to finance such borrowings. In addition, if deemed
to be an indirect issuer of the SBL Subsidiary's indebtedness, sections 18 (a) and (c) would impose the same limitations
on Bando with respect to the SBL Subsidiary's borrowings on a consolidated basis. Accordingly, applicants request
an exemption from 18(a) to the extent necessary to treat the SBL Subsidiary's borrowings from Bando as ``liabilities
and indebtedness not represented by senior securities'' within the meaning of section 18(h) in applying the asset
coverage requirements of section 18(a). Applicants also request an exemption from section 18(c) to permit Bando
and the SBL Subsidiary, on an individual basis, to have more than one class of senior security representing indebtedness,
subject to condition 5 below. The organization and operation of the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary does not raise any
issues under section 18 because it will not issue senior securities.


D. Sections 8 and 30


In the absence of an exemption, each of Bando, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary would be required
to file annual amendments to its registration statement and transmit to its shareholders annual and/or semi-annual
reports on form N-SAR pursuant to sections 8(b), 30(a), 30(b), and 30(d) and rules 8b-16, 30a-1,
30b1-1, and 30d-1. Applicants request an exemption to permit: (a) Bando to file on behalf of itself, the
SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary amendments to its registration statement containing information
with respect to Bando, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary on a consolidated basis only; (b)
Bando to file on behalf of itself and the SBL Subsidiary semi-annual reports on form N-SAR containing information
with respect to Bando, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary on a consolidated basis only; and
(c) Bando to transmit to its shareholders semi-annually reports containing the financial information for Bando,
the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary on a consolidated basis only.


E. Modification of Condition 6 of Prior Order


1. Condition 6 of the Prior Order provides that if 10% or more of Bando's total assets on a consolidated basis are invested
in assets other than securities issued by the SBIC Subsidiary, then, in addition to the consolidated financial statements
of Bando and the SBIC Subsidiary, there shall be included in such reports separate financial statements of the SBIC
Subsidiary. Absent exemptive relief, applicants assume that if 10% or more of Bando's total assets on a consolidated
basis are invested in assets other than the SBIC, SBL, and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries, separate financial statements
would be required.

<TEXT>
 

2. In the future, Bando may make loans directly and may purchase loans from the SBIC or SBL Subsidiaries, and may therefore
have more than 10% of its assets on a consolidated basis invested in assets other than the SBIC, SBL, and Bankruptcy
Remote Subsidiaries. Accordingly, applicants request that condition 6 of the Prior Order be modified to require
separate financial statements of the SBIC, SBL, and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries if 10% or more of Bando's total
assets on a consolidated basis are invested in assets other than securities issued by the SBIC, SBL, and Bankruptcy
Remote Subsidiaries and securities similar to securities in which the subsidiaries invest.



F. Standards for Exemption Under Sections 6(c) and 17(b)



1. Section 6(c) of the Act permits the SEC to exempt any person or transaction from any provision of the Act, if such exemption
is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes
fairly intended by the policy of the Act. The relationship of Bando's shareholders to the activities to be carried
out by the SBL and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries will be no different than if such activities were carried out by Bando
because (a) the SBL and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries will be wholly-owned subsidiaries of Bando; and (b) Bando
has agreed that it will exercise its rights as the shareholder of the SBL and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries on matters
required by the Act to be approved by shareholders only as directed by Bando's shareholders. Accordingly, applicants
believe that the requested exemptions meet the section 6(c) standards.

2. Section 17(b) of the Act permits the SEC to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) if evidence establishes
that (a) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable
and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent
with the policy of each registered investment company concerned; and (c) the proposed transaction is consistent
with the general purposes of the Act. Applicants believe that the requested relief from section 17(a) meets these
standards.



Applicants' Conditions



Applicants state that as a condition to the granting of the exemptive relief requested, each of Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary,
the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary will comply with the following conditions:

1. Bando will at all times own and hold beneficially and of record all of the outstanding voting capital stock of the
SBIC, SBL, and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries.

2. The SBIC and SBL Subsidiaries will have the same fundamental policies of Bando, as set forth in Bando's registration
statement; the SBIC and SBL Subsidiaries will not engage in any of the activities described in section 13(a) of the
Act, except in each case as authorized by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of Bando. The Bankruptcy
Remote Subsidiary will not engage in any of the activities described in section 13(a) of the Act, except in each case
as authorized by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of Bando.

3. No person shall serve or act as investment adviser to the SBIC, SBL, or Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries under circumstances
subject to section 15 of the Act, unless the directors and shareholders of Bando shall have taken the action with respect
thereto also required to be taken by the directors and shareholders of the SBIC, SBL, or Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries,
as the case may be.

4. No person shall serve as a director of the SBIC, SBL, or Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries who shall not have been elected
as a director of Bando at its most recent annual meeting, as contemplated by section 16(a) of the Act and subject to the
provision thereof relating to the filling of vacancies, provided that the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary may have
two directors who are not directors of Bando as long as a majority of its board of directors consists of directors who
are also directors of Bando. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the board of directors of the SBIC and SBL Subsidiaries
will be elected by Bando as the sole shareholder of both corporations, and such board will be composed of the same persons
that serve as directors of Bando and (b) the board of directors of the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary will be elected
by Bando as the sole shareholder of the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary and such board will be composed of the same persons
that serve as directors of Bando except to the extent noted above.

5. Bando will not itself issue or sell any senior security representing indebtedness if immediately thereafter Bando
will have outstanding more than one class of senior security representing indebtedness; and Bando will not issue
or sell any senior security which is a stock if immediately thereafter Bando shall have outstanding more than one class
of senior security which is a stock, as provided under section 18(c) of the Act. Bando shall not guarantee any borrowings
of the SBIC or SBL Subsidiaries, nor shall Bando enter into any express or implied agreement that is the functional
equivalent of such a guarantee, including any agreement that will ensure that the SBIC or SBL Subsidiaries has a tangible
net worth of a specified amount. Bando will not cause or permit the SBIC or SBL Subsidiaries to issue or sell any senior
security of which the SBIC or SBL Subsidiaries is the issuer except as hereafter set forth: the SBIC and SBL Subsidiaries
may issue and sell to banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions their secured or unsecured promissory
notes or other evidences of indebtedness in consideration of any loan, or any extension or renewal thereof made by
private arrangement, and the SBIC Subsidiary may issue debt securities held or guaranteed by SBA, provided the following
conditions are met: (a) Such notes or evidences of indebtedness are not intended to be publicly distributed; and (b)
such notes or evidences of indebtedness are not convertible into, exchangeable for or accompanied by any options
to acquire, any equity security. Immediately after the issuance or sale of any class of senior security by Bando or
the issuance or sale of any such notes or evidences by the SBIC or SBL Subsidiaries, Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary, and
the SBL Subsidiary on a consolidated basis, and Bando and the SBL Subsidiary individually, shall have the asset coverage
required by section 18(a), except that, in determining whether Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary, and the SBL Subsidiary,
on a consolidated basis, and the SBL Subsidiary on an individual basis, have the asset coverage required by section
18(a), any borrowings by the SBIC Subsidiary or any borrowings by the SBIC Subsidiary or any borrowings by the SBL Subsidiary
from Bando, for purposes of the definition of ``asset coverage'' in section 18(h), shall be treated as indebtedness
not represented by senior securities. The Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary will not issue senior securities.

6. Bando will file with the SEC pursuant to rule 8b-16 amendments to its registration statement pursuant to section
8(b) of the Act on behalf of itself, the SBIC Subsidiary, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary
containing information with respect to, and financial statements of, Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary, the SBL Subsidiary,
and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary on a consolidated basis only, such amendments to be in lieu of and in satisfaction
of the separate filing obligations of Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary
pursuant to rule 8b-16. Bando will file with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b) of the Act and rules 30a-1
and 30b1-1 thereunder semi-annual reports on form N-SAR, or appropriate successor form, on behalf of
itself, the SBIC Subsidiary, and the SBL Subsidiary containing information with respect to Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary,
the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary on a consolidated basis only, such consolidated semi-annual
reports to be lieu of and in satisfaction of the separate filing obligations of Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary, and the
SBL Subsidiary pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b) and rules 30a-1 and 30b1-1. Bando will in response
to the appropriate item of form N-SAR or appropriate successor form indicate that the report is being filed on
behalf of the SBIC, SBL, and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries and include the ``811'' number of each of the SBIC, SBL,
and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries. Bando will transmit to its shareholders semi-annually pursuant to section
30(d) of the Act and rule 30d-1 thereunder reports containing the financial information and statements prescribed
and required by such section and rule for Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote
Subsidiary on a consolidated basis only, which reports shall be in lieu of and in satisfaction of the separate reporting
obligations of Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary pursuant to
section 30(d) and rule 30d-1, only so long as the amount of Bando's total assets on a consolidated basis invested
in assets other than securities of the SBIC, SBL, and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries, or securities similar to those
in which such subsidiaries invest, does not exceed 10%. Notwithstanding anything in this condition, Bando shall
not be relieved of any of its reporting obligations including, but not limited to, any consolidating statement setting
forth the individual statements of the SBIC, SBL, or Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries required by rule 6-03(c)
of regulation S-X. The selection of any independent public accountant who signs a consolidated financial statement
filed by Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary with the SEC shall be
ratified in accordance with section 32(a)(2) of the Act by a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as defined
in section 2(a)(42) of the Act) of Bando.

7. Bando will acquire securities of the SBIC Subsidiary representing indebtedness only if, in each case, the prior
approval of SBA has been obtained. Bando and the SBIC Subsidiary will purchase and sell portfolio securities between
themselves only if, in each case, the prior approval of SBA has been obtained.

AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC``).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for Exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

The Haven Fund (the ``Fund''), HCM Partners, L.P. (the ``Partnership''), and Haven Capital Management, Inc. (the
``Adviser'').




RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under section 17(b) of the Act for an exemption from section 17(a) of the Act.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order that would permit the exchange of shares of the Fund for portfolio securities of the Partnership.
Thereafter, the Partnership will dissolve and distribute the shares it received in the exchange pro rata to its partners.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.






Applicants' Representations



1. The Partnership was organized in 1984 as a limited partnership under New York state Law. It has not been registered
under the Act in reliance upon section 3(c)(1) of the Act, and the Partnership interests have not been registered under
the Securities Act of 1933 in reliance upon section 4(2) thereof. The general partners of the Partnership, Messrs.
Stephen Ely, Colin C. Ferenbach, and Denis M. Turko (the ``General Partners''), have exclusive control over the management
and business of the Partnership. The General Partners have maintained an investment in the Partnership not less that
1% of the net assets of the Partnership, and are allocated net income, gains, and losses of the Partnership in proportion
to their respective investments.

2. The Fund is the initial series of The Haven Capital Management Trust, a business trust formed under the laws of Delaware
on March 17, 1994. The Fund, an open-end management investment company, filed a notification of registration under
the Act on Form N-8A and a registration statement under the Act and the Securities Act on Form N-1A on March
18, 1994. The registration statement has not yet been declared effective, and no offering of shares has commenced.

3. The Adviser is the investment adviser to the Partnership and will be the investment adviser to the Fund. PFPC, Inc.
and Provident Distributors, Inc., which are not affiliated with any of the applicants, will act as the Fund's administrator
and principal underwriter, respectively. The Fund does not currently intend to enlist the assistance of other broker-dealers
to market shares and there is no intention to advertise the Fund in newspapers or other media. Neither the Adviser nor
Provident intends to solicit widespread public interest in the Fund.

4. Applicants propose that, prior to offering the shares to the public, the Fund will exchange shares for the assets
of the Partnership, less funds required to pay the liabilities of the Partnership. Thereafter, the Partnership will
dissolve and distribute the shares it received to its partners 

pro rata

, including the General Partners. Partners of the Partnership will constitute all of the holders of shares, except
for shares representing seed capital contributed to the Fund by the Adviser pursuant to section 14(a) of the Act. The
Fund was designed as a successor investment vehicle to the Partnership, with investment objectives and policies
substantially the same as those of the Partnership. The same persons who selected the investments for the Partnership
will select them for the Fund.

5. The Fund intends to adopt a plan of distribution pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Act. Under the rule 12b-1
plan, the Fund may spend no more than 0.25% of its average daily net assets for sales activities including compensation
paid to Provident and the printing and mailing of prospectuses and sales literature. The Fund will comply with rules
regarding distribution expenses adopted by the National Association of Securities Dealers.

6. The proposed exchange will be effected pursuant to an agreement and plan of exchange (the ``Plan'') to be approved
by the limited partners of the Partnership. Under the Plan, the portfolio securities of the Partnership will be acquired
at their independent ``current market price,'' as defined in rule 17a-7 under the Act. The Fund will not acquire
securities that, in the opinion of the Adviser, are overvalued or would result in a violation of the Fund's investment
objectives, policies, or restrictions. It is not expected that the Partnership will hold any such securities. Any
remaining securities will be liquidated by the partnership for cash and these proceeds distributed 

pro rata

 to the partners of the Partnership.

<PARENT> FR940506-2-00080 </PARENT>

7. The General Partners of the Partnership will consider the desirability of the exchange from the point of view of
the Partnership and must conclude that (a) the exchange is in the best interests of the Partnership and its partners
and (b) upon the exchange, the interests of the partners of the Partnership will not be diluted as a result of the exchange.
8. The Fund's board of trustees will consider the desirability of the exchange from the point of view of the Fund and
a majority of the trustees, including a majority of the non-interested members, must conclude that: (a) The exchange
is desirable as a business matter from the point of view of the Fund; (b) the exchange is in the best interest of the Fund;
(c) upon the exchange, the interests of existing shareholders of the Fund will not be diluted as a result of the exchange;
and (d) the terms of the exchange as reflected in the Plan have been designed to meet the criteria contained in section
17(b) of the Act. The trustees will consider each aspect of the exchange, including: (i) The method of valuing the portfolio
securities to be acquired from the Partnership, (ii) the value of the shares to be delivered to the Partnership, (iii)
the procedure for selecting among the portfolio securities of the Partnership, (iv) the possibility of incurring
excessive brokerage costs, (v) the allocation of the costs of the exchange, (vi) the possibility of adverse tax consequences
to future shareholders of the Fund, (vii) the benefits from the exchange accruing to the Adviser, and (viii) the benefits
from the exchange accruing to the General Partners.
9. The exchange will not be effected unless: (a) The registration statements of the Fund have been declared effective,
(b) the limited partners of the Partnership have approved the Plan and an amendment to the partnership agreement authorizing
the General Partners to take such actions as they deem necessary or appropriate to effect the exchange, (c) the requested
order has been granted, and (d) the limited partners have received an opinion of counsel that: (i) The distribution
of shares from the Partnership to its limited partners, which will be in liquidation of the Partnership, will not cause
taxable gain or loss to be recognized by the limited partners, (ii) the basis to the limited partners for the shares
will be equal to the adjusted basis of the limited partners' interests in the Partnership, and (iii) the limited partners'
holding periods with respect to the shares will include their holding periods for their Partnership interests.
10. The Partnership, the Fund, and the Adviser will each pay their respective costs in connection with the forming
of the Fund and completing the exchange. No brokerage commission, fee, or other remuneration will be paid in connection
with the exchange.


Applicants' Legal Conclusions


1. Section 17(a) of the Act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company from selling
to or purchasing from such investment company any security. The Fund and the Partnership may be affiliated persons
of each other because they are under the common control of the Adviser and the General Partners. Thus, the proposed
exchange may be prohibited by section 17(a). Section 17(b) authorizes the SEC to exempt a proposed transaction from
section 17(a) if evidence establishes that the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or
received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, the transaction
is consistent with the policies of the registered investment company, and the transaction is consistent with the
general purposes of the Act.
2. Applicants believe that the proposed transaction satisfies the criteria of section 17(b). They contend that because
the Fund and the Partnership have similar investment objectives and policies, the Fund will obtain portfolio securities
that initially will be substantially identical to those held by the Partnership. The Fund will acquire the Partnership
securities at their independent ``current market price.'' Applicants believe that this price will be as advantageous
to the Fund as open-market purchases. In addition, by acquiring suitable securities from the Partnership, the Fund
will avoid incurring brokerage and other transactions costs. Applicants believe that the exchange can be viewed
as a change in the form in which the assets are held, rather than as a disposition giving rise to section 17(a) concerns.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order to permit the Funds to issue multiple classes of shares representing interests in the same
portfolio of securities and to permit the Funds to assess and, under certain circumstances, waive a contingent deferred
sales charge (``CDSC'') on certain redemptions of certain shares.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.




Applicant's Representations



1. Each Fund is an open-end management investment company registered under the Act. KFS serves as the investment adviser
and principal underwriter for each Fund. Each Fund has a non-rule 12b-1 administrative services agreement
(``Administrative Plan'') with KFS providing for a service fee
 at an annual rate of up to .25% of average daily net assets.





2. Applicants propose to establish a Multiple Distribution System (the ``Multiple Distribution System''). Under
the Multiple Distribution System, each Fund would have the opportunity to offer investors the option of purchasing
shares subject to: (i) A front-end sales load that may vary among Funds and a service fee (``Class A shares''), (ii)
without a front-end sales load, but subject to a CDSC, a rule 12b-1 distribution fee and a service fee (the ``Deferred
Option'' or ``Class B shares''), (iii) without a front-end sales load or CDSC but subject to a rule 12b-1 plan
distribution fee and to a service fee (the ``Level Load Option'' or ``Class C shares''), and (iv) without a front-end
load, CDSC, distribution fee or service fee (``Class I shares'').

3. The Funds may create one or more additional classes of shares in the future, the terms of which will differ from the
Class A, B, C, and I shares in the following respects: Any such class: (a) May bear different distribution fees and any
other costs relating to implementing or amending the rule 12b-1 plan for such class; (b) may bear different service
fees; (c) may bear different shareholder servicing fees;
 (d) may bear different ``Class Expenses,'' that may include any or all of the following expenses: (i) Printing and
postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and
proxy statements to current shareholders of a specific class; (ii) Commission registration fees incurred by a specific
class; (iii) litigation or other legal expenses relating to a specific class of shares; (iv) Trustee fees or expenses
incurred as a result of issues relating to a specific class; and (v) accounting expenses relating to a specific class;
(e) may bear a different name or designation; (f) will have exclusive voting rights as to any rule 12b-1 plan adopted
exclusively with respect to such class except as provided in condition 16 below; (g) may have different conversion
features; (h) may have different exchange privileges; (i) may be sold under different sales arrangements, including
selling only to a particular type of investor; and (j) may bear any other incremental expenses subsequently identified
that should be properly allocated to such class and that shall be approved by the Commission.





4. Any distribution arrangement of a Fund, including distribution fees, service fees, and front-end and deferred
sales loads, will comply with Article III, section 26, of the Rules of Fair Practice of the NASD.

5. After a shareholder's Class B shares remain outstanding for a period of time, they automatically will convert to
Class A shares of the same Fund at the relative net asset values of the two classes and will thereafter not be subject
to a rule 12b-1 plan. Shares purchased through the reinvestment of distributions paid upon Class B shares will
be treated as Class B shares and will be converted to Class A shares on a 

pro rata

 basis with the Class B shares. The Level Load Option differs from the Deferred Option in that the Class C shares would
not automatically convert to Class A shares after a specified period of time as would the Class B shares.

6. Any other class of Non-Institutional Shares (as defined below) may provide that shares in that class (the ``Purchase
Class'') will, after a period of time, automatically convert into another class of shares (the ``Target Class'')
on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other
charge provided that, after conversion, the converted shares would be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or
service fee, if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and/or service fee to which the
Purchase Class shares were subject prior to the conversion.

7. Any conversion of shares of one class to shares of another class is subject to the continuing availability of a ruling
of the Internal Revenue Service or an opinion of counsel to the effect that the conversion of shares does not constitute
a taxable event under federal income tax law. Any such conversion may be suspended if such a ruling or opinion is no longer
available.

8. Class I shares would be offered for purchase only by the following investors (the ``Institutional Investors''):
(a) Tax-exempt retirement plans of KFS and its affiliates, and (b) the following investment advisory clients of KFS
and its investment advisory affiliates that invest at least $1 million in a Fund: (1) benefit plans unaffiliated with
KFS, such as qualified retirement plans (other than individual retirement accounts and self-directed retirement
plans), (2) banks and insurance companies unaffiliated with KFS purchasing for their own accounts, and (3) endowment
funds of non-profit organizations unaffiliated with KFS.

9. Future classes may be offered to meet the specific investment needs of non-institutional investors (herein, such
future classes together with Class A, B, and C shares are ``Non-Institutional Shares''). Other future classes, in
addition to Class I shares, may be offered to meet the specific investment needs of a particular category of Institutional
Investor (together with Class I shares, ``Institutional Shares''). Still other future classes may be offered to
various market segments or through various types of intermediaries.

10. Only Institutional Investors will be eligible to invest in Institutional Shares. Applicants may choose not to
make a particular class of Institutional Shares available to one or more categories of Institutional Investors.
If no class of Institutional Shares is made available to a particular category of Institutional Investor, Institutional
Investors in this category will be permitted to purchase Non-Institutional Shares. However, no Institutional Investor
that is eligible to invest in any class of Institutional Shares will be permitted by applicants to invest in any class
of Non-Institutional Shares. Accordingly, there will be no overlap between the investors eligible to invest in Institutional
Shares and investors eligible to invest in Non-Institutional Shares of a Fund or series thereof.

11. Under the Multiple Distribution System, certain expenses may be attributable to a Fund, but not to a particular
series thereof. All such expenses will be borne by each class on the basis of the relative aggregate net assets of the
classes, except in the case of a Fund that has series, in which case they will first be allocated among series, based
on the relative aggregate net assets of such series. Expenses that are attributable to a particular series, but not
to a particular class thereof, will be borne by each class on the basis of the relative aggregate net assets of the classes.

12. Applicants also propose to assess and, under certain circumstances, waive or reduce a CDSC on certain redemptions
of their shares. The CDSC will not be imposed upon a redemption of shares that were purchased more than a specified period
of time prior to the redemption (the ``CDSC Period'') or upon shares derived from reinvestment of distributions.
Furthermore, no CDSC will be imposed upon an amount that represents share appreciation.

13. The Funds request the ability to waive the CDSC as described below: (a) On redemptions following the total disability
(as evidenced by a determination by the federal Social Security Administration) of the shareholder (including a
registered joint owner) occurring after the purchase of the shares being redeemed, (b) in the event of the death of
the shareholder (including a registered joint owner), (c) on redemptions pursuant to the Funds' right to liquidate
small accounts or to charge an annual small account fee, (d) on redemptions of shares acquired as a result of the investment
of distributions from shares of a class of one Fund into shares of the same class of another Fund, (e) for redemptions
made pursuant to a systematic withdrawal plan, and (f) in connection with the following redemptions of shares held
by employer sponsored employee benefit plans maintained on the subaccount record keeping system made available
by KFS: (i) Redemptions to satisfy participant loan advances (loan repayments would constitute new purchases for
purposes of the contingent deferred sales charge and the conversion privilege), (ii) redemptions in connection
with retirement distributions (limited at any one time to 10% of the total value of plan assets invested in the Fund),
(iii) redemptions in connection with distributions qualifying under the hardship provisions of Internal Revenue
Code section 403(b)(7) or in Treasury Regulation 401(k)-1(d)(2), as amended, and (iv) redemptions representing
returns of excess contributions to such plans.

14. The Funds will provide a credit (i.e., a reimbursement) for any CDSC paid by a redeeming shareholder in connection
with a redemption of shares of a class followed by a reinvestment in any shares of the same class of the same Fund or, as
permitted by KFS, the same class of another Fund, effected within such number of days of the redemption as may be specified
in a Fund's prospectus. The CDSC credit will be paid by KFS. Upon redemption thereafter, when calculating the amount
of the CDSC the shares will be deemed to have been held for the period from purchase through reinvestment, except for
the period between redemption and reinvestment, until such shares are finally redeemed.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. The creation of multiple classes of shares may result in shares of a class having priority over another class as to
payment of dividends and having unequal voting rights, because under the proposed arrangement: (1) Shareholders
of different classes (i) would pay different fees because of the rule 12b-1 plan (and related costs) and (ii)
may pay different service fees, shareholder servicing fees and Class Expenses and (2) each class would be entitled
to exclusive voting rights as to matters concerning its rule 12b-1 plan.

2. The abuses that section 18 of the Act is intended to address as set forth in section 1(b) of the Act are that the interest
of investors are adversely affected when investment companies by excessive borrowing and the issuance of excessive
amounts of senior securities increase unduly the speculative character of their junior securities or operate without
adequate assets or reserves. The Multiple Distribution System does not involve borrowings and does not affect the
Funds' existing assets or reserves. In addition, the proposed arrangement will not increase the speculative character
of the shares of the Funds, since all such shares will participate 

pro rata 

in all the Fund's appreciation, income and expenses (with the exception of the different distribution fees payable
by each class of shares and any other costs relating to implementing the rule 12b-1 plan for such class or an amendment
to such plan including obtaining shareholder approval of the rule 12b-1 plan for such class or any amendment
to such plan), any different service fees, shareholder servicing fees, and Class Expenses.

3. Applicants believe that the imposition of the CDSC is fair and in the best interests of their shareholders. The proposed
CDSC provides shareholders the advantage of having more investment dollars working for them from the time of their
purchase than if a sales load were imposed at the time of purchase. Furthermore, the CDSC described above is fair to
shareholders because it applies only to amounts representing purchase payments and does not apply to amounts representing
share appreciation, or to amounts representing reinvestment of distributions.



Applicants Conditions



Applicants agree that the order of the Commission granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following
conditions:

1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund, and be identical in
all respects to each other class, except as set forth below. The only differences among the various classes of shares
of the same Fund will relate solely to: (a) Different distribution fee payments associated with any rule 12b-1
plan for a particular class of shares and any other costs relating to implementing or amending such Plan (including
obtaining shareholder approval of such Plan or any amendment thereto) which will be borne solely by shareholders
of such classes, (b) different service fees, (c) different shareholder servicing fees, (d) different Class Expenses,
which will be limited to the following expenses determined by the Trustees to be attributable to a specific class of
shares: (i) Printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports,
prospectuses, and proxy statements to current shareholders of a specific class; (ii) Commission registration fees
incurred by a specific class; (iii) litigation or other legal expenses relating to a specific class; (iv) Trustee
fees or expenses incurred as a result of issues relating to a specific class; and (v) accounting expenses relating
to a specific class; (e) the voting rights related to any 12b-1 Plan affecting a specific class of shares, except
as provided in condition 16 below; (f) conversion features; (g) exchange privileges; and (h) class names or designations.
Any additional incremental expenses not specifically identified above which are subsequently identified and determined
to be properly applied to one class of shares shall not be so applied unless and until approved by the Commission by an
amended order.

2. The Trustees of each Fund, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, will approve the Multiple Distribution
System for a particular Fund prior to its implementation by that Fund. The minutes of the meetings of the Trustees of
each Fund regarding the deliberations of the Trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multiple
Distribution System will reflect the reasons for the Trustees' determination that the proposed Multiple distribution
System is in the best interests of both the Fund and its shareholders.

3. The initial determination of any Class Expenses that will be applied to a class and any subsequent changes thereto
will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the Board of Trustees, including a majority of the non-interested Trustees.
Any persons authorized to direct the application and disposition of monies paid or payable by the Fund to meet Class
Expenses shall provide to the Board of Trustees, and the Trustees shall review at least quarterly, a written report
of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made.

4. Any distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may be sold to particular investors.
Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to conform to such standards; and such compliance
standards will require that all investors eligible to purchase Institutional Shares will be sold only Institutional
Shares rather than any other class of shares offered by a Fund, and that all investors eligible to purchase Non-Institutional
Shares will be sold only Non-Institutional Shares.

5. The Administrative Plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b-1(b)
through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b-1, except that shareholders need
not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b-1.

6. On an ongoing basis, the Trustees of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise,
will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes of shares.
The Trustees, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary
to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. KFS will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing
conflicts to the Trustees. If a conflict arises, KFS at its own cost will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing
a new registered management investment company.

7. The Trustees of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and servicing
expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b-1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the
statements only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will
be used to support any distribution or service fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing
of a particular class will not be presented to the Trustees to support any distribution or servicing fee attributable
to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review of
the Independent Trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.

8. Dividends paid by a Fund as to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in
the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that any distribution fees,
service fees, shareholder servicing fees and Class Expenses allocated to a class will be borne exclusively by that
class.

9. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various
classes and the proper allocation of expenses between or among the various classes has been reviewed by an expert (the
``Expert'') who has rendered to the applicants a report, which has been provided to the staff of the Commission, stating
that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in
an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner
in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually
a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall
be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the Commission pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act.
The work papers of the Expert concerning such reports, following request by the Funds which the Funds agree to make,
will be available for inspection by the Commission staff upon the written request to the Fund for such work papers by
a senior member of the Division of Investment Management or of a Regional Office of the Commission, limited to the Director,
an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director and any Regional
Administrators or Associate and Assistant Regional Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``Report
on Policies and Procedures in Existence,'' and the ongoing reports will be ``Reports on Policies and Procedures Placed
in Operation and Tests of Operating Effectiveness,'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be
amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as they may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.

10. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for
calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various classes of shares and the proper allocation
of expenses between or among such classes of shares; and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert
in the initial report referred to in condition (9) above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate
substitute Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition (9) above.
Applicants agree to take immediate corrective action if the Expert, or appropriate substitute Expert, does not so
concur with the ongoing reports.

11. The prospectuses of each Fund will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled
to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation as to one class of
Fund shares in relation to another.

12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the Trustees
of the Funds concerning the Multiple Distribution System will be set forth in guidelines that will be furnished to
the Trustees as part of the materials setting forth the duties and responsibilities of the Trustees.

13. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees,
sales loads, deferred sales loads, conversion features, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares
other than Institutional Shares in every prospectus, regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through
each prospectus. Institutional Shares will be offered solely pursuant to a separate prospectus. The prospectus
for Institutional Shares will disclose the existence of the Fund's other classes, and the prospectus for the Fund's
other classes will disclose the existence of Institutional Shares and will identify the persons eligible to purchase
Institutional Shares. The shareholder reports on each Fund will disclose the respective expenses and performance
data applicable to each class of shares. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities
and statement of operations, information related to the Fund as a whole and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per
share data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis for all classes of shares of that Fund. To the extent that any
advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares,
it will disclose the expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares except Institutional Shares.
Advertising materials reflecting the expenses or performance data for Institutional Shares will be available only
to those persons eligible to purchase Institutional Shares. The information provided by applicants for publication
in any newspaper or similar listing of the Funds' net asset values and public offering prices will present separately
each class of shares except Institutional Shares.

14. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by the application will not imply Commission
approval, authorization, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to
their rule 12b-1 distribution plans or Administrative Plan in reliance upon the exemptive order.
15. Purchase Class shares will convert into Target Class shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the
two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares
will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, section
26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and
service fee to which they were subject prior to the conversion.
16. If a Fund implements any amendment to its rule 12b-1 Plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendment of a non-rule 12b-1 service plan) that would increase materially the amount that may be borne by
the Target Class shares under the plan, existing Purchase Class shares will stop converting into Target Class shares
unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The Trustees shall take
such actions as are necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class
of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to the Target Class as it existed prior to implementation
of the proposal, no later than such shares previously were scheduled to convert into the Target Class. If deemed advisable
by the Trustees to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase Class shares
for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to the existing Purchase Class shares in all material respects
except that New Purchase Class will convert into New Target Class. The New Target Class or the New Purchase Class may
be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected
in a manner that the Trustees reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition
6 above, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of the New Target Class or the New
Purchase Class shall be borne solely by the investment adviser and principal underwriter. Purchase Class shares
sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment,
provided that the material features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class
shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement.
17. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c-10 under the Act, Investment Company Act
Release No. 16619 (November 2, 1988) as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended.

<DOCTITLE>National Equity Trust; Notice of Application</DOCTITLE>




May 2, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application for exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``Act'').







APPLICANT: 

National Equity Trust.




RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: 

Exemption requested under section 6(c) from the provisions of section 12(d)(3).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicant seeks a conditional order on behalf of its series (the ``Series'') to permit each Series to invest up to twenty
percent of its total assets in securities of issuers that derived more than fifteen percent of their gross revenues
in their most recent fiscal year from securities related activities.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicant's Representations








1. Each Series will be a series of applicant, a unit investment trust registered under the Act. Prudential Securities
Incorporated (``Prudential'') is applicant's depositor. Prudential currently intends to offer a new Series four
times a year at about the beginning of each calendar quarter.

2. Each Series' investment objective is to provide total return through a combination of potential capital appreciation
and current dividend income. Each Series will invest approximately 20%, but in no event more than 20.5%,
 of the value of such Series' total assets in each of the five lowest dollar price per share stocks of the ten common stocks
in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (``DJIA'') having the highest dividend yields. Dividend yields will be calculated
by annualizing the last quarterly or semi-annual ordinary dividend distributed on that security and dividing the
result by the market value of the security at the close of the New York Stock Exchange either on or shortly before such
Series' initial date of deposit.






3. The DJIA comprises 30 widely-held common stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange which are chosen by the editors
of 

The Wall Street Journal. 

The DJIA is the property of Dow Jones & Company, Inc., which is not affiliated with Prudential or any Series, and
does not participate in any way in the creation of any Series or the selection of its stocks.



4. The securities deposited in each Series will be chosen solely according to the formula described above, and will
not necessarily reflect the research opinions or buy or sell recommendations of Prudential. Prudential will have
no discretion as to which securities are purchased. Securities deposited in a Series may include securities of issuers
that derived more than fifteen percent of their gross revenues in their most recent fiscal year from securities related
activities.





5. During the 90-day period following the initial date of deposit, Prudential may deposit additional securities,
maintaining to the extent practicable the original proportionate relationship among the number of shares of each
stock in the portfolio. Subsequent deposits made after the 90-day period following the initial date of deposit must
replicate exactly (subject to certain limited exceptions) the proportionate relationship among the face amounts
of the securities comprising the portfolio at the end of the initial 90-day period, whether or not a stock continues
to be among the five highest dividend yielding stocks.

6. A Series' portfolio will not be actively managed. Sales of portfolio securities will be made in connection with
redemptions and at the termination of the trust. Prudential will have no discretion as to when securities will be sold
except that it is authorized to direct the trustee to sell securities upon failure of the issuer of a security held by
a Series to declare or pay anticipated cash dividends, institution of certain materially adverse legal proceedings
against the issuer, default by the issuer under certain documents materially and adversely affecting future declaration
or payment of dividends, or the occurrence of other market or credit factors that, in the opinion of Prudential, would
make retention of such securities by a Series detrimental to the interests of the unit holders. The adverse financial
condition of an issuer will not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a Series' portfolio.



Applicant's Legal Analysis



1. Section 12(d)(3), with limited exceptions, prohibits an investment company from acquiring any security issued
by any person who is a broker, dealer, underwriter, or investment adviser. Rule 12d3-1(b) exempts from section
12(d)(3) purchases by an investment company of securities of an issuer that derived more than fifteen percent of its
gross revenues in its most recent fiscal year from securities related activities, provided that, among other things,
immediately after such acquisition, the acquiring company has invested not more than five percent of the value of
its total assets in securities of the issuer. Notwithstanding the above, rule 12d3-1(c) prohibits any registered
investment company from acquiring any security issued by that company from acquiring any security issued by that
company's investment adviser, promoter, or principal underwriter, or any affiliated person of such investment
adviser, promoter, or principal underwriter.

2. Applicant seeks an exemption to permit any Series to invest up to approximately twenty percent, but in no event more
than 20.5 percent, of the value of its total assets in securities of an issuer that derives more than fifteen percent
of its gross revenues from securities related activities. Applicant and each series will comply with all of the provisions
of rule 12d3-1, except for the five percent limitation on the amount of assets that may be invested in securities
of issuers that derived more than fifteen percent of their gross revenues from securities related activities in their
most recent fiscal year.

3. Applicant asserts that section 12(d)(3) was intended to prevent investment companies from exposing their assets
to the entrepreneurial risk of securities related businesses, to prevent potential conflicts of interest, and to
eliminate certain reciprocal practices between investment companies and securities related businesses.

4. One potential conflict discussed by applicant could occur if an investment company purchased securities or other
interests in a broker-dealer to reward that broker-dealer for selling fund shares, rather than solely on investment
merit. Applicant argues that this concern does not arise in connection with its application because neither the applicant
nor the sponsor has discretion in choosing the securities or percentage amount purchased. The security must first
be included in the DJIA, which is unaffiliated with Prudential and applicant, and must also qualify as one of the five
highest dividend yielding securities as calculated by the objective formula described above.

5. Applicant also states that the effect of a Series' purchase on the stock of parents of broker-dealers would be 

de minmis

. Applicant asserts that the common stocks of securities related issuers represented in the DJIA are widely held,
have active markets, and that potential purchases by any Series would represent an insignificant amount of the outstanding
common stock and the trading volume of any of these issues. According to applicant, it is highly unlikely that purchases
of these securities by a Series would have any significant impact on the market valuer of any such securities.

6. Another potential conflict of interest discussed by applicant could occur if an investment company directed brokerage
to a broker-dealer in which the company has invested to enhance the broker-dealer's profitability or to assist it
during financial difficulty, even though the broker-dealer may not offer the best price and execution. To preclude
this type of conflict, applicant and each Series agree, as a condition of this application, that no company held in

Central and South West Corporation, et al. (70-7918)


Central and South West Corporation (``CSW''), a registered holding company, and two of its nonutility subsidiaries,
CSW Energy, Inc. (``Energy''), CSW Development-I, Inc. (``Energy Sub''), a nonutility subsidiary of Energy Sub,
CSW Mulberry, Inc. (``CSW Mulberry''), and a proposed nonultility subsidiary of Energy Sub, CSW Mulberry II, Inc.
(``Mulberry LP Sub''), each located at 1616 Woodall Rodgers Freeway, P.O. Box 660164, Dallas, Texas 75202; and three
other nonutility subsidiaries, ARK/CSW Development Partnership (``Joint Venture''), Polk Power Partners, L.P.
(``Partnership'') and Polk Power GP (``JV Sub''), Inc., and a proposed nonutility subsidiary of Joint Venture, Polk
Power GP II, Inc. (``Mulberry GP sub''), each located at 23046 Avenida de la Carlota, Suite 400, Laguna Hills, California
92653 (collectively, ``Applicants''), have filed a post-effective amendment under sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10,
12(b), and 12(c) of the Act and Rules 42, 43, 45 and 50(a)(5) thereunder to their application-declaration previously
filed under sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10 and 12(b) of the Act and Rules 43, 45, 50(a)(5) and 51 thereunder.
By order dated February 18, 1992 (HCAR No. 25477) (``February Order''), CSW, Energy, Energy Sub and the Joint Venture
were authorized, among other things, to contribute up to $9 million to the capital of the Partnership, to borrow up
to $120 million (``Construction Financing'') to construct and develop a 122.2 megawatt, gas-fired cogeneration
facility and integrated carbon dioxide plant steam host (``Project'') located near Bartow in Polk County, Florida,
and to convert such borrowings to a term loan facility (``Term Loan Financing'') with a lender or group of lenders (``Lenders'')
upon completion of the project. Under the February Order, CSW, Energy, Energy Sub and the Joint Venture were also authorized
to organize the Partnership to own and operate the Project and organize JV Sub to be the sole general partner of the Partnership.
Once operational, the Project would be a qualifying cogeneration facility under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies
Act of 1978 (``PURPA''). JV Sub is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Joint Venture, a general partnership owned equally
by Energy Sub and ARK Energy, Inc. (``ARK''), a nonassociate corporation. JV Sub, a corporation, has a 1% interest
in the Partnership. The two limited partners are Energy Sub and ARK. They each hold a 49.5% interest in the Partnership.
By subsequent order dated August 6, 1992 (HCAR No. 25599) (``August Order''), the Commission authorized, among other
things, certain technical changes to the Project description and the Partnership to enter into a construction agreement
with Energy or Energy Sub for the purpose of developing and constructing the Project. The August Order also authorized
the Applicants to increase the amount of Construction Financing to $135 million and to increase the amount of capital
contributions that Energy Sub and ARK would each contribute to the Partnership to $13.5 million.

By order dated March 19, 1993 (HCAR No. 25762) (``March Order''), the Applicants were authorized to: (1) increase
the amount of Construction Financing to $160 million (2) increase the maximum amount, excluding advances, as defined
below, of the aggregate equity contributions to the Partnership by JV Sub and Energy Sub to $32 million, constituting
a maximum equity contribution equal to 20% of the amount to be financed; and (3) make, directly or indirectly through
Energy, loans, open account advances, or additional equity contributions to the Partnership in an aggregate amount
not to exceed $85 million (``Advances'').

By order dated January 31, 1994 (HCAR No. 25983), the Commission authorized a change in the description of the Project
and the formation of CSW Mulberry. In addition, the Commission authorized the investment of a new limited partner
(``New Limited Partner'') in the Partnership in lieu of the term loan financing for the Project and the issuance of
corporate guaranties by the Applicants or stand-by letters of credit with the Applicants as account party in an amount
not to exceed $50 million, such guaranties or letters of credit to support payment obligations of the Partnership
required by the provider of third party financing for the Project or fuel suppliers, fuel transportation or other
third parties under various project agreements.

The Applicants now propose that Energy Sub form a special purpose wholly owned subsidiary to be known as CSW Mulberry
II, Inc. (``Mulberry LP Sub''). Mulberry LP Sub would be incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware with an
authorized capital of up to 1,000 shares of common stock without par value. In exchange for an assignment from Energy
Sub to Mulberry LP Sub of all of Energy Sub's right, title and interest in and to CSW Mulberry, Energy Sub would subscribe
to all of Mulberry LP Sub's common stock. It is further proposed that the Joint Venture form a special purpose wholly
owned subsidiary to be known as Polk Power GP II, Inc. (``Mulberry GP Sub''). Mulberry GP Sub would be incorporated
under the laws of the State of Delaware with an authorized capital of up to 1,000 shares of common stock without par value.
In exchange for an assignment from the Joint Venture to Mulberry GP Sub of all of the Joint Venture's right, title and
interest in and to JV Sub, the Joint Venture would subscribe to all of Mulberry GP Sub's common stock.

In the event that Mulberry LP Sub and Mulberry GP Sub are formed pursuant to the authority sought, the Applicants request
authority to include Mulberry LP Sub and Mulberry GP Sub in the flow of funds for equity contributions, open account
advances and intercompany loans on the terms and in the manner authorized by the prior orders of the Commission in this
matter, above.

The Applicants request the authority to form Mulberry LP Sub and Mulberry GP Sub in order to limit the liability of Energy
Sub and the Joint Venture and aid in the procurement of the Term Financing. It is anticipated that a pledge of the stock
of CSW Mulberry and JV Sub by their holders, Energy Sub and the Joint Venture, respectively, which was required in connection
with the Construction Financing, will be required in connection with the Term Financing. The requested authority
is desirable to limit the liability of Energy Sub and the Joint Venture, which have acquired interests in several other
partnerships and corporations that are unaffiliated with the Project. If Energy Sub and the Joint Venture make such
pledges and the Partnership defaults in its repayment obligations under the terms of such Construction Financing
or Term Financing, interests of Energy Sub and the Joint Venture that are not associated with the Project could be adversely
affected by the actions taken by the provider(s) of such Construction Financing or Term Financing. 



GPU Nuclear Corporation (70-8393)



GPU Nuclear Corporation (``GPUN''), One Upper Pond Road, Parsippany, NJ 07054, a wholly owned utility subsidiary
company of General Public Utilities Corporation (``GPU''), a registered holding company, has filed an application
under Sections 9(a) and 10 of the Act.

GPUN proposes to offer to non-affiliates, with nuclear or non-nuclear plants in the U.S. and abroad, a range of services
that are based on the skills, expertise, experience, resources and facilities that it has developed relative to its
normal core business operations (``Services''). The application outlines three general categories of Services
that GPUN now contemplates_(i) Engineering and Technical Services, which would include power plant inspections
and risk analysis, power plant accident analysis, power plant stress analysis, power plant operations analysis,
power plant life extension analysis, nuclear fuels cycle analysis, power plant modification, design, installation,
evaluation, testing and project management, power plant equipment corrosion control and failure analysis, chemical
and metallurgical laboratory services, human factors engineering services, commercial grade dedication of equipment,
radioactive waste services, plant decommissioning services, mechanical, electrical and structural engineering
services, nondestructive testing and examination services, and instrument calibration services; (ii) Management
and Consulting Services, which would include nuclear plant decommissioning and decontamination management and
consulting services, nuclear plant outage management and consulting services, quality assurance audits, medical
services management and consulting services, and Final Safety Analysis Report licensing consultation and operations
analysis; and (iii) Training and Education Services, which would include computer-based training, instructor
training, nuclear plant operating room simulator certification and training, simulator maintenance and modification
training, fire safety and plant and facility security training, and diesel equipment training.

The application also proposes to license or lease to non-affiliates the use of intellectual and proprietary property
as well as the reserve capacity of laboratory or other support facilities. It is stated that the reserve capacity licensed
or leased would not exceed 50% of the capacity of the laboratory and other support facilities available to GPUN.

The application proposes that GPUN be authorized through December 31, 1999 to enter into agreements, with terms of
up to ten years and negotiated on an arm's-length basis, for the Services. It is stated that revenues received and expenses
incurred in connection with the Services will be accounted for under appropriate accounts in accordance with the
Uniform System of Accounts. The application also states that the net revenues from the Services will be used to reduce
the cost of GPUN service charges to GPU electric public utilities.
The application states that GPUN expects not to materially increase its staff or capital investments to provide the
Services. In addition, it is stated that for the five-year period for which an authorization is sought, the aggregate
annual revenues from and expenses associated with the Services are not anticipated to exceed 5% of the total annual
operating expenses of GPUN, which in 1993 were $421 million.
The application states that it could be advantageous to provide the Services through one or more new wholly-owned
subsidiaries, each of which the application proposes that GPU form and acquire through the purchase of $1,000 in capital
stock. Finally, the application states that GPUN will, on or before May 1, of each year, report to the Commission the
Services provided for the preceding year as well as the revenues derived therefrom and the expenses associated therewith.

ACTION:

 Notice; request for comments; public meeting. 



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The FHWA and the FTA request comments which will be used in developing and conducting a review of the Congestion Mitigation
and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) Program, to be undertaken by the FHWA and the FTA in cooperation with the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA). The review's purpose is to determine whether the CMAQ program is meeting its goals under
the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), Public Law 102-240, 105 Stat. 1914, and the
Clean Air Act (CAA) as amended in 1990, Public Law 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399, to support transportation measures
intended to assist nonattainment areas in meeting the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and to maximize
the program's effectiveness. Comments are solicited on the structure and content of the program review, specific
policy questions raised in this notice, and other areas of policy and implementation which should be investigated.




This notice also announces a public meeting to be held on June 2, 1994. The purpose of the meeting is also to solicit input
for the review. Those intending to participate are asked to notify Mr. Mike Savonis at the number listed under the

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

(I) Background 



Authorized at $6 billion for years 1992-1997, the CMAQ Program provides funds to States for transportation
projects and programs that will contribute to attainment of an NAAQS. The Program focuses primarily on reductions
in ozone precursors (hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen) and carbon monoxide emissions, but under certain conditions
funds may be expended on projects to reduce small particulate matter (PM-10), as well. Typical projects include:
development of HOV lanes, improvements to public transit facilities and equipment, traffic signalization and incident
management improvements, bicycle and pedestrian projects, new ridesharing services, and establishment of vehicle
inspection and maintenance programs. 

The FHWA and the FTA, in consultation with the EPA, issued guidance providing eligibility criteria to govern CMAQ
program expenditures on October 16, 1992. A series of questions and answers were also issued subsequent to the program
guidance to address specific issues and eligibility questions as they have arisen. The program guidance was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on January 4, 1993 (58 FR 146) and, with the questions and answers, is available through the Federal Electronic Bulletin
Board System (202-366-3764). In addition, a brochure, ``A Guide to the Congestion Mitigation and Air
Quality Improvement Program,'' was issued in January 1994. 

Three apportionments have been made for fiscal years 1992-1994, making a total of $2.7 billion available for
the States' use. In FY 1992, $340 million was obligated by all States which was 42 percent of the amount available. In
FY 1993, $600 million was obligated for a rate of 62 percent. Overall, $940 million was obligated during the program's
first two years for a cumulative rate of 53 percent. Unobligated funds under the CMAQ program lapse and are no longer
available to the States after four years from the beginning of the fiscal year for which they were apportioned. 



(II) Proposed Purpose and Scope 



As with any new program, implementation of the CMAQ program has generated questions about new areas of eligibility,
the purpose and effectiveness of funded projects and the coordination processes between transportation and air
quality agencies at the Federal, State and local levels. Consequently, a review of CMAQ program implementation will
be undertaken, as noted in the FHWA-FTA program guidance of October 16, 1992. 



(A) Purpose



The review has two intended purposes: (1) To determine whether the CMAQ Program is meeting its goals under ISTEA and
the CAA to support transportation measures intended to assist nonattainment areas to meet the National Ambient Air
Quality Standards, and (2) to identify how the CMAQ program's benefits can be maximized. 



(B) Objectives



(1) To evaluate the kinds of projects funded under the CMAQ program, their emission reductions, cost-effectiveness,
the length of time the funding process took, and other attributes, and to determine what was not funded. 

(2) To determine what transportation control measures (TCMs) have been included in the States' Implementation Plans
and whether funding sources have been identified for them. 

(3) To raise key issues, like the air quality impacts of various TCMs such as traffic flow improvements, possible obstacles
to innovative projects, etc., and to evaluate those issues. 

(4) To identify any barriers or constraints to effective program implementation, especially with respect to coordination
processes between transportation and air quality agencies at the Federal, State and local levels. 

(5) To identify, document and disseminate examples of well-thought-out projects, project development and coordination
processes, and transportation/air quality analytical techniques for each of the transportation-related pollutants.


(6) To determine the effectiveness of current guidance, with an eye toward possible mid-course policy adjustments.

<PARENT> FR940506-2-00087 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(7) To determine how projects funded under the CMAQ program affect greenhouse gases. 


(C) Approach 


The review will be conducted by the FHWA and the FTA, in cooperation with the EPA. It will be conducted in an open way to
solicit concerns, recommendations and issues from all interested parties, including environmental groups, transportation
agencies, energy interests, State air quality agencies and others. 
A public meeting will be held to solicit ideas from any group wishing to comment, especially national transportation
and air quality groups, State and local agencies, environmental interest groups, industry groups, and other interested
parties. Those commenting should address the structure of the review, relevant policy questions, and their experience
in program implementation. The need for a second meeting to describe review findings will be determined as the evaluation
progresses. 
The review will focus on the effectiveness of current policies and guidance as implemented at the project level. As
such, the review will begin and end with policy considerations, but any potential changes in policy will be based on
a review of specific projects and existing coordination processes. Issues will be examined from both a public policy
and legal perspective with review of the CMAQ provisions of the ISTEA (Section 1008) and other relevant provisions
of the ISTEA or CAA, as necessary. 


(D) Policy Questions 


Several policy questions have arisen as CMAQ program implementation has progressed. They serve as a starting point
for the review. Other policy considerations will be evaluated as they arise. Current questions include: 
(1) Have the needed coordination mechanisms between the transportation and air quality communities at the Federal,
State and local levels been established? Have they been effective? What have the impediments been? What can Federal
agencies do to smooth coordination processes? 
(2) How effective are the projects that have been funded under the CMAQ program in reducing transportation emissions?
How can their effectiveness be improved? Is it possible at this time to identify the types of projects that have the
greatest air quality impact? 
(3) What are the short term and long term impacts of funded projects? How should these considerations be included in
the determination of funding priorities under the CMAQ program? 
(4) Will the low obligation rate for the first two years of the program ultimately result in the lapsing of Federal funds?
What can be done to avoid this? 
(5) How should projects that have the potential to increase oxides of nitrogen be treated? Should they be eligible
as long as aggregate emissions are reduced in line with the Clean Air Act's conformity requirements? 
(6) Under current guidance, new or expanded rideshare services are eligible for CMAQ funds, but the routine funding
of existing services for ridesharing, transit, traffic control and inspection and maintenance programs, etc.,
is ineligible. Is the current policy too restrictive because it assumes that further emission reductions will not
result by funding currently existing services? 
(7) Traffic flow improvements are legislatively eligible for CMAQ funding as a transportation control measure identified
in the Clean Air Act. What are the pros and cons of funding these projects for emission reduction purposes? Should changes
be pursued to exclude them from eligibility? 
(8) Under the current legislation, projects in a nonattainment area are no longer eligible for CMAQ funds once the
area achieves attainment of the NAAQS and is redesignated as a maintenance area. Would a change to allow the use of CMAQ
funds in newly redesignated areas constitute good public policy even if the State's remaining nonattainment areas
lose CMAQ funds as a result? 
(9) Projects that are not expected to contribute to emission reductions prior to the scheduled attainment date under
the Clean Air Act are not eligible for CMAQ funds. Should any project which reduces emissions be eligible even if it
is scheduled for completion after the attainment date?

Should a project whose construction is not expected to start until after the attainment date be eligible? 

(E) Project-Level
