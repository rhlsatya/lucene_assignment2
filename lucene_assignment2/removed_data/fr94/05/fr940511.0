Revision of Class E Airspace: DeRidder, LA 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Federal rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action revises the Class E airspace at Beauregard Parish Airport, DeRidder, LA. The establishment of an airport
surveillance approach (ASR) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) has made this action necessary. Controlled
airspace extending upward from 700 feet above ground level (AGL) is needed for aircraft executing the approach. This
action provides adequate Class E airspace to contain IFR operations for aircraft executing the SIAP's at Beauregard
Parish Airport, DeRidder, LA.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
History 


On November 24, 1993, a proposal to amend Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to revise the Class
E Airspace at Beauregard Parish Airport, DeRidder, LA, was published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 62059). An ASR approach, a SIAP, was developed for the Beauregard Parish Airport, DeRidder, LA. The proposal
was to revise the controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet AGL to contain instrument flight rules (IFR)
operations in controlled airspace during portions of the terminal operation and while transitioning between the
en route and terminal environments. 

Interested persons were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments were received. Therefore the proposal is adopted with only editorial changes.


The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American 
Datum 83. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level
are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is
incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1994). The Class E airspace designation listed in this
document will be published subsequently in the Order. 



The Rule 


This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 71) revises the Class E airspace located at DeRidder,
LA, to provide controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet AGL for aircraft executing the SIAP's at Beauregard
Parish Airport, DeRidder LA. 

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need
frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation,
it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the Criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action establishes Class E airspace areas at Roswell, NM; Enid, OK; and Lawton, OK. Presently, these areas are
designated as Class D airspace when the associated control tower is in operation. However, controlled airspace to

Request for Comments on the Rule


Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the
rule. This rule will become effective on the date specified in the DATES

 section. However after the review of the comments and, if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will
initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date of the rule or amend the regulation.
Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful
in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are
specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects
of the rule that might suggest the need to modify the rule.


The Rule


This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace areas at Roswell, NM; Enid,
OK; and Lawton, OK. Currently, this airspace is designated as Class D when the associated control tower is in operation.
Nevertheless, controlled airspace to the surface is needed for IFR operations at Roswell, NM; Enid, OK; and Lawton,
OK, when the control towers are closed. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class E airspace for
IFR operations at these airports when these control towers are closed. As noted in the Airspace Reclassification
Final Rule, published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 17, 1991 (56 FR 65645), airspace at an airport with a part-time control tower should be designated as a Class
D airspace area when the control tower is in operation, and as a Class E airspace area when the control tower is closed.
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as
surface areas for airports are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace
designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented,
the FAA concludes that there is an immediate need to establish these Class E airspace areas in order to promote the safe
and efficient handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C.
553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest.
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need
frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action amends the Aurora, Buckley ANG Base Airport, Colorado, Class D airspace. It amends the Class D airspace
effective hours to conform with the control tower's hours of operation at the Buckley ANG Base, Colorado. Airspace
reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued use of the terms ``control zone'' and ``air
traffic area,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' This amendment would bring publications
up to date.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

History


On March 23, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 11 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to amend the Buckley ANG Base
Class D airspace to incorporate ``part-time'' information into the rule (59 FR 13663; March 23, 1994). The information
would provide pilots with notice that the Class D airspace would not be effective during certain periods of the day.
No comments were received. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued use of
the terms ``control zone'' and ``air traffic area,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace.''
Class D airspace designations are published in Paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 8, 1993). The Class D airspace
designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The coordinates are in North American
Datum 83.


The Rule


This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) amends Class D airspace at the Buckley
ANG Base, Aurora, Colorado, by adding information regarding the times the Class D airspace is effective. The FAA has
determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and
routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation,
it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Rule


This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace areas at
Fayetteville, AR; Fort Smith, AR; Lake Charles, LA; Monroe, LA; New Orleans, LA; Clovis, NM; Farmington, NM; Oklahoma
City, OK; Beaumont, TX; Brownsville, TX; College Station, TX; Corpus Christi, TX; Laredo, TX; McAllen, TX; San Angelo,
TX; San Antonio, TX; Waco, TX; and Wichita Falls, TX, by amending the areas' effective hours to coincide with the associated
control tower's hours of operation. This action also establishes Class E airspace at these areas when the associated
control tower is closed. Prior to Airspace Reclassification, an airport traffic area (ATA) and a control zone (CZ)
existed at these airports. However, Airspace Reclassification, effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the
use of the term ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zone,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace.''
The former CZ was continuous, while the former ATA was contingent upon the operation of the air traffic control tower.
The consolidation of the ATA and CZ into a single Class D airspace designation makes it necessary to modify the effective
hours of the Class D airspace to coincide with the control tower's hours of operation. This action also establishes
Class E airspace during the hours the control tower is closed. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when
two-way radio communication with these air traffic control towers is required and to provide adequate Class E airspace
for instrument approach procedures when these control towers are closed.
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and E airspace designations
are published in Paragraphs 5000 and 6002, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September
16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D and E airspace designations
listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes
that there is an immediate need to modify these Class D and establish these Class E airspace areas in order to promote
the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures
under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest.
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need
frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation,
it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Modification of Class D Airspace: Austin, TX



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action modifies the Class D airspace area at Austin, TX, by amending the areas' effective hours to coincide with
the associated control tower's hours of operation. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way radio
communication with this air traffic control tower is required.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Request for Comments on the Rule



Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the
rule. This rule will become effective on the date specified in the ``DATES'' section. However, after the review of
the comments, and, if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will initiate rulemaking proceedings,
extend the effective date of the rule or to amend the regulation.

Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful
in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are
specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects
of the rule that might suggest the need to modify the rule.

The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace area at
Austin, TX by amending the areas' effective hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours of operation.
Prior to Airspace Reclassification, an airport traffic area (ATA) and a control zone (CZ) existed at this airport.
However, Airspace Reclassification, effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic
area'' and ``control zone,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' The former CZ was continuous,
while the former ATA was contingent upon the operation of the air traffic control tower. The consolidation of the ATA
and CZ into a single Class D airspace designation makes it necessary to modify the effective hours of the Class D airspace
to coincide with the control tower's hours of operation. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way
radio communication with this air traffic control tower is required.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace designations are published
in Paragraphs 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designations listed in this document will
be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an immediate
need to modify this Class D airspace area in order to promote the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in these
areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to
the public interest.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need
frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation,
it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Example 1. Calculation and payment of rebate for a fixed

(i) 

Facts. 

On January 1, 1994, City 

A 

issues a 
fixed yield issue and invests all the sale proceeds of the issue 
($49 million). There are no other gross proceeds. The issue has 
a yield of 7.0000 percent per year compounded semiannually 
(computed on a 30 day month/360 day year basis). City 

A 

receives 
amounts from the investment and immediately expends them for the 
governmental purpose of the issue as follows: 





(ii) 

First computation date. 

(A) City 

A

 chooses 
January 1, 1999, as its first computation date. This date is the 
latest date that may be used to compute the first required rebate 
installment payment. The rebate amount as of this date is 
computed by determining the future value of the receipts and the 
payments for the investment. The compounding interval is each 6-month (or shorter) period and the 30 day month/360
day year basis 
is used because these conventions were used to compute yield on 
the issue. The future value of these amounts, plus the computation credit, as of January 1, 1999, is:

(B) City 

A 

pays 90 percent of the rebate amount ($407,189) 
to the United States within 60 days of January 1, 1999. 


(iii) 

Second computation date. 

(A) On the next required 
computation date, January 1, 2004, the future value of the 
payments and receipts is: 






(B) As of this computation date, the future value of the 
payment treated as made on January 1, 1999, is $574,380, which 
equals at least 90 percent of the rebate amount as of this 
computation date ($638,200  x  0.9), and thus no additional rebate 
payment is due as of this date. 


(iv) 

Final computation date. 

(A) On January 1, 2009, City 

A 


redeems all the bonds, and thus this date is the final 
computation date. The future value of the receipts and payments 
as of this date is: 







(B) As of this computation date, the future value of the 
payment made on January 1, 1999, is $810,220 and thus an 
additional rebate payment of $89,024 is due. This payment 
reflects the future value of the 10 percent unpaid portion, and 
thus would not be owed had the issuer paid the full rebate amount 
as of any prior computation date. 



Example 2. Calculation and payment of rebate for a variable 
yield issue

. * * * 

(iii) * * *

(D) If the yield during the second computation period were, 
instead, 7.0000 percent, the rebate amount computed as of July 1, 
1999, would be $1,320,891. The future value of the payment made 
on July 1, 1999, would be $1,471,007, and, therefore, City B 
would have overpaid the rebate amount by $150,116.

Par. 3. 

Section 1.148-10(d) is amended by revising the ninth 
and tenth sentence of 

Example 1 

as follows: 



 1.148-10

Anti-abuse rules and authority of Commissioner.

(d) * * *






Example 1

. * * * The Bank note and the 1994 issue have 
different prepayment terms. The City does not reasonably expect 
to treat prepayments of the Bank note as gross proceeds of the 
1994 issue. * * *



* * * * *






Par. 4. 

Section 1.149(e)-1 is amended by revising 
paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (e)(4) as follows: 



 1.149(e)-1

Information reporting requirement for tax-exempt 
bonds.

Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is finalizing its decision not to change the corresponding onshore area (``COA'') designations for outer continental
shelf (``OCS'') platforms Habitat, Henry, Hillhouse, Houchin, Hogan, and Union A, B, and C (collectively, the ``OCS
platforms''). This decision on the reconsideration proceeding was proposed in the 

Federal Register

 on November 19, 1993. Pursuant to petitions filed by Unocal and Ventura, the reconsideration proceeding was convened
on March 16, 1993 to determine whether the COA for the OCS platforms should be changed to the Ventura County Air Pollution
Control District (``Ventura County APCD'' or ``VCAPCD''). The COA for these platforms is currently the Santa Barbara
County Air Pollution Control District (``Santa Barbara County APCD'' or ``SBCAPCD'') as established in the final
OCS rule promulgated September 4, 1992. The intended effect of this document is to finalize the designation of the
Santa Barbara County APCD as the COA for the OCS platforms so that the sources can comply with the OCS air regulations
(40 CFR part 55) by the September 4, 1994 compliance date. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On September 4, 1992, EPA promulgated the OCS rule (40 CFR part 55) in the 

Federal Register

 pursuant to section 328 of the Clean Air Act (the ``Act''). (57 FR 40792). The OCS rule established requirements to
control air pollution from OCS sources in order to attain and maintain Federal and state ambient air quality standards
and to comply with the provisions of part C of title I of the Act. The rule applies to all OCS sources located offshore
of the United States except for those located in the Gulf of Mexico west of 87.5 degrees longitude. The Act requires
new OCS sources (as defined in section 111(a)) to comply with the OCS rule immediately upon promulgation, and existing
sources to comply 24 months thereafter, or by September 4, 1994.
Pursuant to section 328, the requirements for sources located within 25 miles of a state's seaward boundary must be
the same as would be applicable if the sources were located in the COA. The Administrator designated the nearest onshore
area (``NOA'') as the COA for all existing and proposed sources offshore of California in the preamble to the final
rule.

1

 If an area other than the NOA desires to become the COA, that area must submit a request and make a demonstration pursuant
to 40 CFR 55.5. 





On November 2 and 3, 1992, Union Oil Company of California, Pacific Operators, Inc. d.b.a. Pacific Operators Offshore,
Inc., and Texaco Exploration and Production Inc. (collectively, ``Unocal'') and the Ventura County APCD filed petitions
for reconsideration with EPA, asking EPA to reconsider the COA designations for the OCS platforms Habitat, Henry,
Hillhouse, Houchin, Hogan, and Union A, B, and C. The Ventura County APCD and Unocal also filed petitions for review
in the Courts of Appeal for the District of Columbia and the Ninth Circuits, but these cases have been stayed pending
EPA's review of their petitions for reconsideration.

2

 





EPA granted the parties' requests for reconsideration on March 16, 1993. The parties agreed to a June 15, 1993 deadline
for the submittal of a stringency analysis and any other relevant data by the Ventura County APCD and the Santa Barbara
County APCD. Rules applicable to OCS sources that were already adopted by both the Ventura and Santa Barbara County
APCDs as of September 4, 1992, the date of the OCS rule promulgation and the version of the rule to which the petition
pertains, were to be used for the stringency comparison. EPA encouraged the parties to work together to reach consensus
on as many issues as possible. The Santa Barbara County APCD agreed to submit any issues and information to EPA by June
15, as opposed to after EPA's proposal, to facilitate a timely resolution. On June 15, 1993, both the Ventura County
APCD and the Santa Barbara APCD submitted the relevant information to EPA.
Pursuant to  55.5 (b), the chief executive officer of an APCD, such as the Ventura County APCD, who believes that
the District has more stringent air pollution control requirements than the NOA for a proposed OCS source, may submit
a request to EPA for the APCD to be designated as the COA. The Ventura County APCD submitted such a request for the OCS
platforms at issue. In order to substantiate its request, the Ventura County APCD, not being the NOA, must make a demonstration
that: (1) The Ventura County APCD has more stringent requirements with respect to the control and abatement of air
pollution than the Santa Barbara County APCD; (2) the emissions from the OCS platforms are or would be transported
to the Ventura County APCD; and (3) the transported emissions would affect the Ventura County APCD's effort to attain
or maintain a Federal or state ambient air quality standard or to comply with the requirements of part C of title I of
the Act, taking into account the effect of air pollution control requirements that would be imposed if the Santa Barbara
County APCD were designated as the COA.  55.5(b)(2). 
EPA examined the material submitted by the Ventura County APCD and the Santa Barbara County APCD regarding EPA's COA
designation for the OCS platforms at issue. The submittal was evaluated on a rule by rule basis comparing the rules'
requirements, standards, and exemptions. A copy of this evaluation is contained in the Technical Support Document
(TSD) dated September 24, 1993. In response to comments, EPA has prepared a supplement to the TSD dated February 23,
1994. After review of the submitted analyses, EPA determined that Ventura County did not demonstrate that the Ventura
County APCD's requirements are more stringent with respect to the control of air pollutants than those of the Santa
Barbara County APCD. For this reason, EPA is finalizing the decision not to change the OCS platform COA designations.



Response to Public Comments


A 30-day public comment period was provided in the proposed action to deny Ventura APCD's request to be designated
the COA. 58 FR 61041. EPA received comments from the Ventura County APCD, the Santa Barbara County APCD, Pacific Operators
Offshore, Inc. and Unocal. These comments and the responses are summarized below:



1. Ground Rules To Be Used for the Stringency Analysis





1-1. Comment:

 EPA violated and ignored its own established ground rules for the stringency determination by relying on Santa Barbara's
interpretation of Rule 331. EPA established ground rules for the stringency analysis that among other things established
the requirement that actual rule language must be used to determine which agencies' rules would result in greater
emission reductions, and that innovative interpretations would not be allowed.



Response:

 EPA disagrees that it violated established ground rules for the analysis. EPA established the following requirements
for the reconsideration proceedings: (1) The criteria outlined in 40 CFR 55.5 must be used; and (2) the date of September
4, 1992 should be used for rule comparisons.

Section 55.5 states that the area requesting to be designated the COA in place of the NOA must demonstrate that:



a. The area has more stringent requirements with respect to the control and abatement of air pollution than the NOA;
b. The emissions from the source are or would be transported to the requesting area; and
c. The transported emissions would affect the requesting area's efforts to attain or maintain a Federal or state ambient
air quality standard or to comply with the requirements of part C of title I of the Act, taking into account the effect
of air pollution control requirements that would be imposed if the NOA were designated as the COA.

At the request of the Ventura County APCD, EPA Region 9 hosted a meeting of interested parties on March 4, 1993. EPA reiterated
at that time the 3 regulatory criteria of  55.5 that Ventura County must meet to have the Ventura County APCD designated
the COA for the eight (8) platforms in question. Other issues discussed included:



(1) The rules to be evaluated in the stringency comparison would be those adopted by the Districts as of September 4,
1992 (the rules actually on the books at the time of promulgation). EPA did not impose any requirements that limited
the stringency analysis to a rule's ``actual language'' and the issue of regulatory interpretation was not discussed.
(2) The inclusion/exclusion of modifications, proposed modifications, and future/hypothesized modifications
was discussed.
(3) Ventura County and Santa Barbara County APCDs were to reach an agreement on workable emission factors. 
(4) A schedule was discussed for gathering and submitting the necessary information for the reconsideration.




In conclusion, EPA set only 2 ``ground rules'': the criteria of 40 CFR 55.5 must be used, and rules adopted by the Districts
as of September 4, 1992 should be compared. There was no requirement limiting the stringency analysis to a rule's actual
language.
 


1-2. Comment:

 EPA selected a cut off date for rule comparison which coincided with the promulgation of the final rule, September
4, 1992. By fixing this date instead of the December 5, 1991 promulgation of the proposed rule additional Santa Barbara
County rules qualified for inclusion in the stringency analysis.



Response:

 The parties asked EPA which date should be used for the stringency analysis. EPA set September 4, 1992. This date was
not chosen to include or exclude specific rules but rather was chosen because it was the date of promulgation of the
final OCS rule. Neither party objected to that date at the time it was selected. If the December 5, 1991 date had been
chosen, the following rule revisions from both districts would not have been included:


 

SBCAPCD: 


Rule 331, Fugitive Emissions Inspection and Maintenance (Adopted 12/10/91)
Rule 333, Control of Emissions from Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines (Adopted 12/10/91)


VCAPCD: 


Rule 71.1, Crude Oil Production and Separation (Adopted 6/16/92)
Rule 74.10, Components at Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production Processing Facilities (Adopted 6/16/92) 



2. Quantification of Emissions





2-1. Comment:

 EPA failed to quantify emissions reductions. The basis of EPA's analysis is simply a rule by rule comparison between
the Santa Barbara and Ventura County rules, versus an analysis on a platform by platform basis that shows actual emission
reductions.



Response:

 Neither section 328 of the Act nor 40 CFR 55.5 requires EPA to specifically quantify emission reductions. Pursuant
to 40 CFR 55.5, VCAPCD had to demonstrate that: (1) It had more stringent air pollution requirements than SBCAPCD;
(2) the emissions from the source are or would be transported to VCAPCD; and (3) the transported emissions would affect
the VCAPCD's effort to attain or maintain a Federal or state ambient air quality standard or to comply with the requirements
of part C of title I of the Act, taking into account the effect of air pollution control requirements that would be imposed
if the NOA were designated as the COA. 

EPA received a stringency analysis from VCAPCD and SBCAPCD, and reviewed both of the submittals in detail. After review
of the Districts' submittals, EPA conducted an independent rule analysis that compared the rules' standards, requirements,
and exemptions to determine if VCAPCD's requirements were more stringent than SBCAPCD. EPA also requested SBCAPCD
to submit additional information on its Rule 331, and provided VCAPCD an opportunity to also submit additional information
on SBCAPCD Rule 331. Based on its independent rule analysis, EPA concluded that for all the requirements found to be
applicable by VCAPCD, none were more stringent than the SBCAPCD. As a result of EPA's conclusion that VCAPCD's requirements
were not more stringent, it was not necessary in this case for EPA to quantify emission reductions at each platform.
 


2-2. Comment:

 EPA did not quantify emission differences in real terms between the districts' fugitive emissions and architectural
coatings rules.
 


Response:

 As stated above, because EPA found the VCAPCD's rules were not more stringent than SBCAPCD's rules when comparing
each element of the rules, a further quantitative analysis was not required. A detailed analysis of both Districts'
fugitive emissions rules is included in the TSD. In response to comments, EPA again reviewed the exemption provisions
of the Districts' fugitive emissions rules and concluded that VCAPCD's inspection requirements, leak thresholds,
and exemptions are not more stringent than SBCAPCD's fugitive emission rule. Therefore, VCAPCD's rule would not
have resulted in greater reductions. 

VCAPCD's analysis found that there is no difference in the Districts' architectural coatings rules. Although EPA's
rule comparison showed the rules are substantiallly similar, SBCAPCD has lower limits for some coatings. Based on
this analysis, EPA properly determined that the VCAPCD rules are not more stringent. EPA did not need to quantify the
difference in reductions to make that determination.




3. Santa Barbara County APCD Rule 331-Fugitive Emissions Inspection and Maintenance





3-1. Comment:

 EPA erred in adopting Santa Barbara's administrative interpretation of the scope of the application of Rule 331,
Fugitive Emissions Inspection and Maintenance. 


Response:

 EPA received opposing interpretations of SBCAPCD's rule 331 in the initial analyses submitted by the Districts.
First, VCAPCD contended that SBCAPCD's Rule 331 does not cover venting of emissions; and second, SBCAPCD interpreted
its rule to cover venting. EPA requested that SBCAPCD support its interpretation, and on August 30, 1993, the Santa
Barbara County Counsel submitted an interpretation of Rule 331 on behalf of the SBCAPCD. On September 9, 1993, the
Ventura County Counsel submitted a different interpretation of the rule on behalf of the VCAPCD. After careful consideration
of the two positions, EPA determined that SBCAPCD's interpretation of its own rule was reasonable and consistent
with the Act, and therefore, concluded that deference to Santa Barbara's reasonable interpretation of its own rule
was appropriate. 



3-2. Comment:

 The TSD failed to mention the letter from Ventura County Counsel on behalf of the Ventura County APCD, explaining why
EPA should not and need not follow Santa Barbara's interpretation.



Response:

 Failure to mention Ventura County Counsel's letter in the TSD was simply an oversight. It was, however, included in
the docket upon its receipt. Moreover, as stated above, EPA carefully reviewed the letter from Ventura County Counsel.
EPA decided to defer to SBCAPCD's interpretation of Rule 331 because it was consistent with the language of the rule
and the Act, and was a reasonable interpretation.


3-3. Comment:

 If Rule 331 has the ability to regulate venting as claimed by Santa Barbara County Counsel, why is the SBCAPCD currently
seeking the adoption of Rule 325 (which states ``emissions of produced gas shall be controlled at all times'')?



Response:

 EPA does not know the District's intentions. However, Federal, state, and local agencies often revise existing rules
and adopt new provisions to clarify the intent of the existing rules. In any event, the critical issue is whether VCAPCD
has shown that its rules are more stringent than SBCAPCD's rules. Based on EPA's analysis, as reflected in the response
to comments, VCAPCD did not make such a showing.




3-4. Comment:

 In EPA's TSD, EPA concludes that VCAPCD's exemption provisions in its fugitive emissions rule appear to be more stringent
than SBCAPCD's rule exemption requirements (i.e. the VCAPCD provision would result in greater emission reductions).
This is not the case. SBCAPCD's fugitive emissions rule allows fewer components to be exempt than Ventura's rule.
In addition, exempted components are still subject to other control requirements of SBCAPCD Rule 331 (e.g., capping
of open-ended lines, repair of leakers, leak threshold requirements) while components exempted under Ventura Rule
74.10 are exempted from all rule requirements. 



Response:

 The commenter is correct. The TSD should have read that VCAPCD's rule's exemption requirements do not appear to be
more stringent than the provisions in SBCAPCD's rule. The supplemental TSD has been revised to reflect this correction.
VCAPCD's rule's exemption requirements do not control as many components and thus are not more stringent than the
provisions in SBCAPCD's rule.

VCAPCD's Rule 74.10 exempts:



(1) Components, not at natural gas processing plants, with gaseous streams with ROC concentrations of 12% by weight
or less.
(2) Any component at a natural gas processing plant with gaseous streams with ROC concentrations, less the ethane
concentration, equal to or less than 1% by weight.
(3) Components, except for components at natural gas processing plants, in liquid service, with ROC concentrations
of 12% by weight or less.

SBCAPCD's Rule 331 exempts:



(1) Components exclusively handling natural gas. (Natural gas by the District's rule definition is a mixture of gaseous
hydrocarbons, with at least 80 percent methane, and less than one percent of ROC, on a weight basis, excluding ethane,
determined according to specified test methods.)
(2) Components buried below ground.
(3) One-half inch and smaller stainless steel tube fittings which have been determined to be leak-free by the Control
Officer based on an initial inspection in accordance with the test method section.




3-5. Comment:

 The exemption element of the fugitive emission rules may be the most significant element of the rule since that determines
whether the rules apply at all.



Response:

 As stated and outlined above, the exemptions in both Districts' fugitive emissions rules were thoroughly evaluated.




3.6. Comment:

 EPA seemingly gives the edge to Santa Barbara's fugitive hydrocarbon emission rule even though Ventura's rule results
in a greater reduction of approx. 67 tons per year    (t/y) ROC (reactive organic compounds).



Response:

 The commenter misstates the conclusion of VCAPCD's stringency submittal. The 67 t/y difference was not based on this
one rule; rather the VCAPCD stringency submittal contained a comparative analysis of all VCAPCD and SBCAPCD requirements
and stated that application of all of VCAPCD's rules would result in a reduction of 67 t/y more than application of the
SBCAPCD rules. However, when evaluating individual rules such as VCAPCD's fugitive emissions rule against SBCAPCD's
fugitive emissions rule, EPA concluded that SBCAPCD's rule has more stringent requirements for inspection practices,
leak thresholds, and exemptions, and would not result in less emission reductions than VCAPCD's rule.



4. Marine Loading Rule
 




4-1. Comment:

 EPA neglected to recognize that the difference in VOC emission reductions caused by the difference between Ventura
and Santa Barbara marine vessel loading requirements is insignificant (0.07 tons per year) when compared to the overall
difference in VOC emissions found when all Ventura and Santa Barbara requirements are compared (67.4 tons per year).



4-2. Comment:

 A simplistic comparison of rule language will bias the results if equal weight is given to both insignificant and significant
rules. EPA apparently gives Santa Barbara full credit for having a marine loading rule in place, yet the rule only results
in a reduction of 0.07 t/y ROC. 




Response:

 EPA evaluated the marine vessel loading requirements because VCAPCD included a review of those requirements in the
stringency analysis. EPA analyzed all rules submitted to it by VCAPCD and SBCAPCD. If this requirement and the reductions
from this requirement are not significant, VCAPCD could have omitted it from its stringency analysis. 

According to VCAPCD's analysis, a marine loading rule would apply to OCS sources. Moreover, SBCAPCD has a marine loading
rule but VCAPCD does not. EPA's evaluation showed that SBCAPCD's marine loading rule did apply to OCS sources and VCAPCD
did not have a marine loading rule. Therefore, for sources subject to the marine loading rule, VCAPCD's requirements
are not more stringent. 

As stated in response to comment 2-1, EPA did not attach ``credit'' or ``weight'' to the rules. The analyses submitted
by both VCAPCD and SBCAPCD were reviewed in detail by comparing the rules' standards, requirements, and exemptions,
which allowed EPA to determine which District's requirements are more stringent. Since EPA determined that none
of Ventura's rules evaluated were more stringent, there was no need to assign credit or weight to the rules. 



5. Oil Drilling Operations





5-1. Comment:

 EPA disregarded Ventura's application of its oilfield drilling requirements to drilling engines while they are
being used for operations that are not specifically listed in the rule's definition of ``Drilling Operations.''



Response:

 EPA has re-evaluated this issue by consulting with VCAPCD, Texaco, and Pacific Operators Offshore, Inc. on the type
of drilling rigs on platforms Habitat, Hogan, and Houchin. After consultation and review of the types of drilling
rigs on the platforms, EPA concluded that the drilling rigs in question were defined as vehicular rigs and would not
be subject to VCAPCD Rule 74.16 by definition.



5-2.

 EPA gives Santa Barbara full credit for a stricter architectural coating rule without investigating if such coatings
are actually used, yet denies Ventura credit for a more restrictive diesel internal combustion (I.C.) engine rule
because, in EPA's opinion, there are currently no drilling activities offshore which could be regulated under Ventura's
rule. In our opinion, this biased mistreatment demonstrates the need to return to a quantification method of comparing
rules.



Response:

 There was no ``biased mistreatment.'' EPA evaluated all the information contained in VCAPCD's stringency analysis.
First, the architectural coatings rule was listed in VCAPCD's analysis as an applicable requirement. EPA reviewed
that requirement and determined that although VCAPCD's stringency analysis stated VCAPCD and SBCAPCD rules are
equivalent, SBCAPCD's rule has lower limits for some coatings.

Second, the Stationary Internal Combustion Engines rule and Oilfield Drilling Operations rule were listed in VCAPCD's
analysis as applicable requirements. EPA reviewed the requirements and determined that the Stationary I.C. Engines
rule does apply but the Oilfield Drilling Operations rule did not apply. VCAPCD's analysis listed two rules applicable
to diesel I.C. engines: a) 74.9, Stationary Internal Combustion Engines and b) 74.16, Oilfield Drilling Operations.


According to VCAPCD's analysis, Rule 74.9 does not set emission limits for diesel engines (non-drilling), while
SBCAPCD's Rule 333 (Control of Emissions from Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines) limits NOx emissions
from diesel engines (non-drilling) to 797 ppmV (corrected to 15% oxygen). All other requirements in the rules are
equivalent.

VCAPCD's analysis also states that if Rule 74.16 (Oilfield Drilling Operations) was applied, greater reductions
would be achieved when compared to SBCAPCD's Rule 333. VCAPCD's analysis asserted that two engines on platform Habitat
(Texaco), one engine on Hogan (Pacific Operators Offshore, Inc.), and one engine on Houchin (Pacific Operators Offshore,
Inc.) would be subject to the rule. Again, after consultation with VCAPCD, Texaco, and Pacific Operators, Inc., EPA
determined that by definition these engines on Habitat, Hogan, and Houchin would not be subject to Rule 74.16. 

In conclusion, VCAPCD does not have a more restrictive diesel I.C. engine rule because:



(1) For Oilfield Drilling Operations, VCAPCD's Rule 74.16 does not apply to the drilling engines on the three platforms;
and 
(2) For stationary I.C. engines, VCAPCD's Rule 74.9 does not set limits for non-drilling diesel engines and the other
requirements of the rule are equivalent to SBCAPCD's Rule 333. 



6. Other





6-1. Comment:

 EPA disregarded Ventura's submittal regarding the relative stringency of the districts' New Source Review (NSR)
rules-rules that could generate significant emission reductions. 


Response:

 EPA did not disregard VCAPCD's submittal. In fact, VCAPCD stated in its submittal that no major projects are budgeted
at this time on the platforms, and the future difference in emissions caused by the difference between the NSR requirements
of VCAPCD and SBCAPCD cannot be quantified. In addition to the fact that these rules do not appear to be applicable in
the near future, it would be very difficult to determine the relative stringency of NSR rules. NSR rules do not involve
specific limitations or standards, but are applied on a case by case basis. Based on this information, EPA did not review
the requirements of the NSR rules.



6-2. Comment:

 The decision proposed in the November 19, 1993 notice of proposed rulemaking seems not to be based on sound scientific
or technical analysis.



Response:

 EPA's decision was based on a detailed technical analysis of the VCAPCD and SBCAPCD rule requirements, which is set
forth in the TSD, and additional analysis in response to comments to the proposed action to deny VCAPCD's request to
be designated the COA for the OCS platforms.
 


6-3. Comment:

 EPA's decision will cause a dual agency jurisdiction for Pacific Operators Offshore, Inc. facilities, with the onshore
plant being regulated by Ventura County, and the offshore platforms being regulated by Santa Barbara County. EPA
should not financially damage a small business operator, further weaken the local and California economies, and
further increase U.S. dependency on foreign oil, regarding an issue that has little or no air quality impact on the
county EPA is currently designating as the COA.



Response:

 In determining the COA for the OCS platforms, EPA followed the requirements of section 328 of the Act and 40 CFR 55.5.
The Act addressed only air quality concerns with regard to redesignation of a COA for an OCS source, and not the relationship
to onshore facilities. Many companies onshore also have facilities in multiple locations, thereby having to comply
with different local requirements. 



6-4. Comment:

 Santa Barbara's overall enforcement capabilities have recently been questioned by David Howekamp, Director, Air
& Toxics Div. of EPA in a letter dated June 11, 1993.



Response:

 This issue has no bearing on the stringency analysis. The reference correspondence was in response to the District's
proposed reorganization plans. EPA expressed concern that the reorganization might jeopardize the District's
ability to comply with the Federal law due to a possible reduction in staff and resources. The letter did not reflect
any specific allegations of current failure to enforce in Santa Barbara County. However, if a District fails to enforce
the requirements of the Act, EPA has the authority to take independent enforcement action.



EPA Action


EPA has evaluated the comments received and is reaffirming the following OCS platform COA designations as provided
in the final rule. The designated COA shall remain the COA for the lifetime of each source:



Platform A: Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District
Platform B: Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District
Platform C: Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District
Platform Habitat: Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District
Platform Henry: Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District
Platform Hillhouse: Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District
Platform Hogan: Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District
Platform Houchin: Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District

Disaster Assistance; Hazard Mitigation and Relocation Assistance 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim rule increases the Federal share for eligible hazard mitigation and relocation assistance projects
from a maximum of 50 percent to 75 percent, increases the total amount of grant assistance available for each disaster,
and places restrictions on property acquisition and relocation projects. The intent of the changes is to carry out
the Hazard Mitigation and Relocation Assistance Act of 1993, which provides new flexibility in hazard mitigation
and relocation assistance to States. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The President signed the Hazard Mitigation and Relocation Assistance Act (the Act), Pub. L. 103-181, on December
3, 1993. The Act amends Section 404 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford
Act), 42 U.S.C. 5170c, to increase the Federal contribution to 75 percent, to increase the limit on Federal expenditures,
and to place restrictions on property acquisition and relocation project grants. This interim rule amends 44 CFR
part 206 to implement the Act. 




We amend the definition of grant to include the newly established limit on the total grant award. The Act states that
the grant award for hazard mitigation shall not exceed 15 percent of the total estimated Federal grant assistance
(excluding administrative costs) provided under the Stafford Act. Grant assistance is available under Sections
403, 406, 407, 408, 410, 411, 416, and 601 of the Stafford Act. FEMA will estimate the amount of assistance provided
under these sections based on available data summarized in the damage survey reports and the Disaster Management
and Projections report. FEMA will include in this total the cost of mission assignments to other agencies that provide
functions that would normally be funded as grant assistance. 


The Act increases from 50 percent to 75 percent the maximum Federal contribution of the cost of hazard mitigation measures,
and increases total grant awards from 10 percent of Section 406 to 15 percent of the total estimated Federal assistance
under the Stafford Act. 


Under the Act, FEMA must restrict the eligibility of projects involving property acquisition and relocation assistance
for property owners and structures. An eligible applicant must enter an agreement with the Director of FEMA that provides
assurances that the property will be dedicated and maintained in perpetuity for uses compatible with open space,
recreational, or wetlands management practices, and no future Federal disaster assistance in any form will be sought
or given with respect to the property. No structures can be built on these properties unless they are public facilities
and functionally related to open space usage and are open on all sides, or are rest rooms. 


The Director may approve other structures, in writing and before construction begins. The Director's approval will
be granted rarely, and when granted, buildings must be compatible with open space, recreational, or wetlands management
practices and be in accordance with sound floodplain management. 

The Act makes the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 inapplicable
to properties damaged by flooding during the 1993 Midwest Floods when certain conditions are met. We define the conditions
under which acquisition of certain properties in nine midwestern States is not subject to the Uniform Relocation
Act. The intent and effect of this provision is to simplify and speed the acquisition and relocation process in the
nine States severely affected by the Midwest Floods of 1993. 



National Environmental Policy Act




This rule is excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR part 10, Environmental Consideration. No environmental assessment
has been prepared.

Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review 



Promulgation of this interim rule is required by statute, 42 U.S.C. 5170(c), which also specifies the regulatory
approach taken in the proposed rule. To the extent possible under the statutory requirements of 42 U.S.C. 5170(c),
this proposed rule adheres to the principles of regulation as set forth in this Executive Order. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



This rule does not involve any collection of information for the purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act. 



Executive Order 12612, Federalism



In promulgating this rule, FEMA has considered the President's Executive Order 12612 on Federalism. This rule makes
no changes in the division of governmental responsibilities between the Federal government and the States. Grant
administration procedures under 44 CFR Part 13, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative
Agreements to State and Local Governments, remain the same. No Federalism assessment has been prepared. 



Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform 



This rule meets the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform, dated
October 25, 1991, 3 CFR, 1991 Comp., p. 359. 



List of Subjects in 44 CFR Part 206

of the Stafford Act. The estimate of Federal assistance under these sections shall be based on the Regional Director's
estimate of all Damage Survey Reports, actual grants, mission assignments, and associated expenses. 


(c) 

Cost sharing.

 All mitigation measures approved under the State's grant will be subject to the cost sharing provisions established
in the FEMA-State Agreement. FEMA may contribute up to 75 percent of the cost of measures approved for funding under
the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program for major disasters declared on or after June 10, 1993. FEMA may contribute up
to 50 percent of the cost of measures approved for funding under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program for major disasters
declared before June 10, 1993. The nonfederal share may exceed the Federal share. FEMA will not contribute to costs
above the Federally approved estimate.

I. Section-by-Section Analysis 



A detailed list of changes follows: 

1. Section 904.404 is amended to reference the updated version of Department of Energy Order 1240.2, Unclassified
Visits and Assignments by Foreign Nationals.

which are no longer used by the Department. 

3. Subsection 905.403-70, paragraph (c) is deleted to remove a reference to special research contracts, which
are no longer used by the Department. 

4. Subsection 914.201-5, paragraph (b) is deleted to remove the requirement to include the solicitation provision
at 952.215-70, Required subcontractor representations and certifications. This solicitation provision
is being deleted as noted below.

6. Subpart 917.71 is deleted to remove obsolete coverage addressing Special Research Contracts with Educational
Institutions. This type of contract has not been used by DOE for several years, and, pursuant to FAR 1.302, continued
DEAR coverage is neither appropriate nor necessary to satisfy the specific needs of the agency. 

7. Subsection 919.705-2, paragraph (a), fourth sentence is revised to remove the reference to special research
contracts, which are no longer used by the Department. 

8. Subparts 936.70 and 936.73 are deleted to remove obsolete coverage addressing Rental of Construction Equipment
and the Outline for Equipment Rental Agreement. These procedures have not been used by DOE for several years, and,
pursuant to FAR 1.302, continued DEAR coverage is neither appropriate nor necessary to satisfy the specific needs
of the agency. 

9. Section 943.301 is amended to remove language that is duplicative of FAR coverage addressing the use of Standard
Form 30 for the deobligation of contract funds. 

10. Subpart 952.1 is deleted to remove language addressing the incorporation of provisions and clauses by reference.
The appropriate guidance is contained in the FAR. 

11. Subsection 952.212-72 is revised to delete a reference to special research contracts, which are no longer
used by the Department. 

12. Subsection 952.215-70 is deleted to remove language addressing subcontractor representations and certifications.
The appropriate guidance is contained in the FAR. 

13. Subsection 970.0404-4(a)(3) is deleted to remove the requirement to include clause 970.5204-34,
Sensitive Foreign Nations Control, in management and operating contracts. This clause applies solely to unclassified
research contracts that may involve making unclassified information about nuclear technology available to certain
sensitive foreign nations, and not to management and operating contracts which encompass broader missions than
those contained in unclassified research contracts. 

14. Section 970.2272 is amended to remove obsolete language addressing conflict of interest policies for management
and operating contracts with colleges and universities. The referenced ``Policy of the Federal Council for Science
and Technology Relating to Conflicts of Interest by Staff Members of Colleges and Universities'' is no longer utilized
by DOE, and, pursuant to FAR 1.302, continued DEAR coverage is neither appropriate nor necessary to satisfy the specific
needs of the agency. 

15. Subsection 970.5204-12 is amended to clarify the prescription for use of alternate language in the clause
which addresses the responsibility of management and operating contractors for the conduct of their employees.


16. Subsection 970.5204-34 is deleted to remove the requirement to include clause 970.5204-34, Sensitive
Foreign Nations Control, in Management and Operating contracts. The clause does not apply to these contracts, as
identified in the change to Subsection 970.0404-4(a)(3) above. 

17. Subsection 970.5204-35 is amended to include a reference to Department of Energy Order 1240.2, Unclassified
Visits and Assignments by Foreign Nationals, which had been omitted from the clause language. 



II. Public Comments 



These amendments were announced in a notice of proposed rulemaking in the December 2, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 63553). DOE invited interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting data, views or arguments
with respect to the DEAR amendments set forth in the notice of proposed rulemaking. The public comment period closed
on January 31, 1994, a period of 60 days. During that period, no comments were received; however, comments were received
from one interested party after the closing date and were subsequently considered by DOE prior to issuing this final
rule. 

The comments addressed DEAR 952.215-70, Required subcontractor representations and certifications, stating
that the DEAR coverage did not recognize the dollar thresholds identified in the FAR for applicability of the representations
and certifications to subcontractors. After review of these comments and the guidance contained in DEAR 952.215-70,
it was determined that the requirements contained in FAR do not need supplementary coverage in the DEAR. Therefore,
DEAR 952.215-70 will be deleted. Additionally, subsections 914.201-5(b) and 915.406-5(d) are
deleted to remove the prescriptions for including this solicitation provision. 



III. Procedural Requirements 



A. Regulatory Review 



Today's regulatory action has been determined not to be a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order
12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, today's action was not subject
to review, under that Executive Order, by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB). 



B. Review Under Executive Order 12778 



Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations
and reviewing existing regulations. These requirements, set forth in sections 2(a) and (b), include eliminating
drafting errors and needless ambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain
legal standards for affected conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed
to make every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation specifies clearly any preemptive effect, effect on
existing Federal law or regulation, and retroactive effect; describes any administrative proceedings to be available
prior to judicial review and any provisions for the exhaustion of such administrative proceedings; and defines key
terms. DOE certifies that this rule meets the requirements of sections 2(a) and (b) of Executive Order 12778. 



C. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-354, which requires preparation
of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any rule that is likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. This rule will have no impact on interest rates, tax policies or liabilities, the cost of
goods or services, or other direct economic factors. It will also not have any indirect economic consequences such
as changed construction rates. DOE certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities and, therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared. 



D. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 



No new information collection or recordkeeping requirements are 
imposed by this rule. Accordingly, no OMB clearance is 
required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.). 



E. Review Under Executive Order 12612 



Executive Order 12612, entitled ``Federalism,'' 52 FR 41685 (October 30, 1987), requires that regulations, rules,
legislation, and any other policy actions be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, on the relationship
between the Federal Government and the States, or in the distribution of power and responsibilities among various
levels of government. If there are sufficient substantial direct effects, then the Executive Order requires preparation
of a federalism assessment to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating and implementing a policy action.
This rule will apply to States that contract with DOE; however, none of the revisions is substantive in nature. 



F. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act 



DOE has concluded that this rule would not represent a major Federal action having significant impact on the human
environment under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq.) (1976) or the Council
on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508) and, therefore, does not require an environmental
impact statement or an environmental assessment pursuant to NEPA.

Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of in-season action. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, on behalf of the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC),
publishes notice of this in-season action pursuant to IPHC regulations approved by the United States Government
to govern the Pacific halibut fishery. This action is intended to enhance the conservation of Pacific halibut stocks
in order to help sustain them at an adequate level in the northern Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The IPHC, under the Convention between the United States of America and Canada for the Preservation of the Halibut
Fishery of the Northern Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea (signed at Ottawa, Ontario, on March 2, 1953), as amended by a Protocol
Amending the Convention (signed at Washington, DC, on March 29, 1979), has issued this in-season action pursuant
to IPHC regulations governing the Pacific halibut fishery. The regulations have been approved by the Secretary of
State of the United States of America (59 FR 22522, May 2, 1994). On behalf of the IPHC, this in-season action is published
in the 

Federal Register

 to provide additional notice of its effectiveness, and to inform persons subject to the in-season action of the restrictions
and requirements established therein. 


Inseason Action 


1994 Halibut Landing Report No. 1 


Northwest Treaty Tribes Fishery in Area 2A 


Northwest treaty Indian tribes were allocated a total allowable catch of 192,500 pounds (lbs) (87.3 metric tons (mt))
in subarea 2A-1 (northern Washington coast) in 1994. Of this total, 16,000 lbs (7.3 mt) are reserved for ceremonial
and subsistence purposes, leaving 176,500 lbs (80 mt) for the commercial fishery. Poor weather on the March 1 opening
date resulted in canceling the fishery until March 5. Three fishing periods of 84 hours, 96 hours, and 30 hours respectively
between March 5 and March 26 resulted in a total catch of 187,700 lbs (85.1 mt), exceeding the commercial catch limit
by 11,200 lbs (5.1 mt). 


Non-Treaty Commercial Fishing Period Limits in Area 2A 


The Commission has determined that fishing period limits will be required during the 10-hour, July 6 non-treaty commercial
fishing period in Area 2A to avoid exceeding the 178,750 lbs (81 mt) catch limit. 
The following table of fishing period limits reflects the average catch by vessel class from openings without trip
limits in Area 2A, adjusted by anticipated fleet size to avoid exceeding the catch limit: 






The appropriate vessel length and letter are printed on each halibut license. Decals showing the letter have been
supplied with the license and should be displayed on the vessel. 
The fishing period limit is shown in terms of dressed, head-off weight as well as dressed, head-on weight although
fishermen are reminded that regulations require that all halibut from Area 2A be landed with their heads on. 
The July 6 fishing period will begin at 8 a.m. and end at 6 p.m. The fishing period limit applies to the vessel, not the
individual fisherman, and any landings over the vessel limit will be subject to forfeiture and fine. 


Canadian Commercial Fishery in Area 2B 


Canadian halibut landings from Area 2B have totaled 
2.4 million lbs (907.2 mt) between March 1 and March 31. This fishery will continue until all Individual Vessel Quota's
have been filled or November 15, whichever is earlier.

Annette Islands Reserve Fishery in Area 2C 


The Metlakatla Indian Community has been authorized by the United States Government to conduct a commercial halibut
fishery within the 3,000 foot (914.4 meters) Annette Islands Reserve waters. Fishing is restricted to 96 hours per
month, and all catches are deducted from the Area 2C catch limit. Four 48-hour fishing periods in April and March produced
a catch of just under 
500 lbs (0.2 mt). 


June Fishing Period Limits in Area 3B and 4A 


The Commission has determined that fishing period limits will be required during the June 6 opening in Area 3B to avoid
exceeding the catch limit. Last year, 5.2 million lbs (2,358.7 mt) were landed from Area 3B during the June fishing
period, and this year's catch limit is 4.0 million lbs (1,814 mt). With fishing period limits in Area 3B, the Commission
is concerned that some Area 3B fishermen might shift to Area 4A, thereby increasing the Area 4A catch. A shift of effort
to Area 4A could jeopardize the August 15 fishing period, and possibly even result in exceeding the Area 4A catch limit.
The Commission approved the June opening in Area 4A with the understanding that the catch would be minimal and that
the August fishery would not be effected. Therefore, the fishing period limits in Area 3B will also be in effect in Area
4A. The fishing period in both areas will open at 12 noon on June 6 and close at 12 noon on June 7 with the following fishing
period limits:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is closing the directed fishery for species in the rock sole/``other flatfish'' fishery category by vessels
using trawl gear in bycatch limitation zone 2 (Zone 2) of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (BSAI).
This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the prohibited species bycatch allowance of 

C. bairdi

 Tanner crab to the trawl rock sole/``other flatfish'' fishery category in Zone 2.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (FMP) prepared by the
North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act.
Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. 


The 1994 prohibited species bycatch allowance of 

C. bairdi 

Tanner crab in Zone 2 for the trawl rock sole/``other flatfish'' fishery category, which is defined at  675.21(b)(1)(iii)(B)(

2

), was established as 260,000 crabs by the final 1994 initial specifications (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994). 
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with  675.21(c)(1)(ii), that the prohibited
species bycatch allowance of 

C. bairdi 

Tanner crab for the trawl rock sole/``other flatfish'' fishery in Zone 2 has been reached. Therefore, NMFS is prohibiting
directed fishing for species in the rock sole/``other flatfish'' fishery category by vessels using trawl gear in
Zone 2 of the BSAI from 12 noon, A.l.t., May 7, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. 
Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is closing the directed fishery for Pacific cod by vessels using trawl gear in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands
Management Area (BSAI). This action is necessary because the 1994 prohibited species bycatch mortality allowance
of Pacific halibut specified for the trawl Pacific cod fishery in the BSAI has been reached.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI 
exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce 
according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish 
Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson
Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP

Seasonal Closure of the O'Malley River Area in the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule and request for comments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) issues this interim regulation to limit public access, occupancy and use
of a portion of the O'Malley River drainage and adjacent lands bordering Karluk Lake and O'Malley Lake within the Kodiak
National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge). Public use of a parcel of land and water consisting of approximately 3,955 acres
will be restricted from June 25, 1994, through September 30, 1994, to individuals participating in a refuge-sponsored
bear viewing program. 


This closure is necessary to prevent incompatible conflicts between people and brown bears at an important bear concentration
area, during the season when conflicts and impacts on bears are most prevalent. It is intended to control increasing
human use of a very important bear concentration area so that human uses in the area remain compatible with refuge purposes.
Research and experience have clearly demonstrated that control of human activity in major bear concentration areas
is necessary to avoid conflicts between people and bears. Organized bear viewing programs elsewhere in Alaska have
proven highly successful in reducing conflict to an acceptable level while maintaining quality public use opportunities.
This action will allow quality public viewing and photography opportunities through the O'Malley Bear Viewing Program
without adversely affecting bear use of this important feeding area. After a thorough evaluation of the bear viewing
program conducted during 1994, the Service will decide whether to continue the program. 

A proposed rule that would provide a permanent seasonal restriction on public access is being published elsewhere
in this separate part of the 

Federal Register

 with this interim rule.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge by Executive Order 8857 on August
14, 1941, to ``preserve the natural feeding and breeding ground of the brown bear and other wildlife.'' This action
withdrew about 1.9 million acres from unreserved public domain on Kodiak and Uganik Islands. Congress redesignated
the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge in 1980 when it enacted the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA).
All the lands, water, interests, and submerged lands retained in federal ownership at the time of statehood were included
in the refuge. This legislation also added about 50,000 acres of public lands on Afognak and Ban Islands to Kodiak National
Wildlife Refuge. Section 303(5)(b) of ANILCA states generally that the purposes for which Kodiak National Wildlife
Refuge is established and shall be managed include: (i) To conserve fish and wildlife populations and habitats in
their natural diversity including, but not limited to, Kodiak brown bears, salmonoids, sea otters, sea lions, and
other marine mammals and migratory birds; (ii) to fulfill the international treaty obligations of the United States
with respect to fish and wildlife and their habitats; (iii) to provide, in a manner consistent with purposes set forth
in subparagraphs (i) and (ii), the opportunity for continued subsistence use by local residents; and (iv) to ensure,
to the maximum extent practicable and in a manner consistent with the purposes set forth in subparagraph (i), water
quality and necessary water quantity within the refuge.

The Kodiak Refuge Comprehensive Conservation Plan (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1987) provides primary guidance
for management of the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge. According to its approved alternative, ``the Service will
undertake detailed management planning to guide implementation of the plan and operation of the refuge.'' In support
of that mandate, utilizing a full spectrum of public involvement, the final draft of the Kodiak Refuge Public Use Management
Plan has been written. This interim rule and the proposed rule which is being published elsewhere in this separate
part of the 

Federal Register

 are a result of direction provided by both these planning processes. 

During 1990-91 the Service tested a trial bear viewing program, staffed by Refuge personnel, at the Dog Salmon
Creek Fish Pass on Kodiak Refuge. No closure was utilized for unguided use, but guided use was restricted through the
special use permit process. This trial bear viewing program was successful except that the presence of artificial
fish passage structures significantly impaired the quality of viewing opportunities available to the public. 
Public use is increasing about ten percent annually on the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge and available information
indicates the rate of increase is even greater in the O'Malley River area. Also, a trend of increasing adverse interactions
between people and bears has occurred in the O'Malley River area in recent years. Generally, brown bears are negatively
impacted by expanding human use. Bears are often killed ``in defense of life or property'' as a consequence of increased
levels of human activity in areas that are used heavily by bears. In addition to mortality, interaction between bears
and people can impose stress on bears that ultimately affect survival and/or productivity of bears as well as jeopardize
human safety. 

In 1991, a research camp was established on the O'Malley River to study bear use of the area and potential impacts of
public use on bears. Research data document human impacts on bears in the O'Malley River area and confirm the need to
control or restrict human uses in this area. The O'Malley River area supports approximately 33% of the entire brown
bear population in the Karluk Lake basin. At least 110 different bears used the O'Malley River area during July-September
1991, with peak use occurring during the second and third weeks of July. More importantly, refuge research data suggest
that frequently sighted bears represent only a small portion of the total population utilizing the O'Malley River
area. 
During approximately 250 hours of intensive observation of bear groups in the O'Malley River area in 1991, 66 interactions
between bears and people were recorded. One-third of the interactions disturbed and/or displaced the bears by causing
them to run or walk away from people. In one instance, people caused the separation of a female from one of her first-year
cubs; while trying to locate its mother, the cub was subsequently killed by another bear. 
Alternatives considered in response to the public use/bear problems in the O'Malley River area include closing the
area to all public use, which would satisfy the need to conserve bears, but would eliminate all opportunity for public
use during the period of closure. The area could be left open to provide ample public use opportunity, but this use would
have incompatible impacts on refuge bear populations. Seasonal closure in support of a bear viewing program not only
would satisfy the need to conserve bears, but would also make possible continued public use. No other alternative
could provide both benefits. 
The refuge's trial bear viewing program initiated at Dog Salmon Creek was moved to the O'Malley River area in 1992 because
of the documented problems and incompatibility between high and unregulated public use and bears in the O'Malley
area. A temporary closure, pursuant to 50 CFR 36.42, was utilized to avoid conflicts between people and bears at this
important seasonal bear concentration area. Goals of the trial O'Malley bear viewing program were:

1. To replace an incompatible level of unrestricted use of the O'Malley River area during key bear use periods, with
a compatible recreational opportunity which would protect and conserve brown bear populations. 
2. To develop and maintain a program that provides the general public a safe and professional guided bear viewing opportunity,
that is consistent with Refuge management objectives and policies established in the Comprehensive Conservation
Plan. 
The program proved popular with the public; in 1992, 88 persons participated. The Service was satisfied that both
program goals were adequately met. 
The O'Malley Bear Viewing Program is designed to increase wildlife viewing opportunities for the public. The brown
bears of Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge offer unique and highly desirable opportunities for viewing; opportunities
that are most safely and effectively provided by a structured viewing program. 
Structured wildlife viewing programs have been used successfully as a conservation management tool and to enhance
public use opportunities elsewhere in Alaska. The best known program is conducted at the McNeil River State Game Sanctuary
by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. The McNeil River program has gained a worldwide reputation for quality bear
viewing, and competition for permits is so intense that applicants have less than an 8 percent chance of obtaining
a permit. Another popular bear viewing program is conducted at Brooks Camp in Katmai National Park. The number of visitors
at Brooks Camp is not limited except by availability of lodge and campground facilities. Use of these facilities during
peak visitation periods is presently at or beyond capacity and the National Park Service may limit the number of visitors
in the future. A third bear viewing program is located at Pack Creek on Admiralty Island and is cooperatively managed
by the U.S. Forest Service and Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Permits are required to visit Pack Creek; during
1993 the Forest Service announced that the number of visits to Pack Creek will be limited. 
Experience at McNeil River State Game Sanctuary has demonstrated that brown bears are least disturbed by human activity
that is consistent and predictable. Studies at the Brooks Camp and Pack Creek bear viewing programs have confirmed
that unpredictable human activity causes some bears to avoid important habitat. Inconsistent human activity has
also been shown to cause conflicts between people and bears. At the McNeil River Sanctuary, implementation of a structured
bear viewing program increased bear use and at the same time reduced the incidence of bear/human conflicts. 
Successful reduction of conflict, through implementation of a structured brown bear viewing program at O'Malley
River, will require control of public use and access. Restriction of public use and access to anyone not participating
in the viewing program will promote a quality wildlife experience for participants and reduce the potential for serious
and incompatible conflicts between refuge visitors and bears. In this interim rule, public use and access would be
restricted from June 25, 1994, to September 30, 1994. These dates were selected because it is the time period when the
greatest number of bears are concentrated in the O'Malley River area to feed on the seasonal salmon runs that provide
a critical component of their diet. Consequently, this is the period bears are most vulnerable to adverse impacts
from excessive and unpredictable human use. 
The Service has issued a permit, under which a private operator will conduct the O'Malley Program, for the period 1994-1998.
The program will be thoroughly evaluated during 1994 and, if successful, will be continued. 
This interim rule would remain in effect only through September 30, 1994. A proposed rule is being submitted concurrently
with this interim rule to permanently restrict public entry and use of the O'Malley area annually to bear viewing program
participants during the June 25 through September 30 period of heavy bear use. 



Statutory Authority
 


In accordance with the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd), the Secretary
is authorized under such regulations as he may prescribe to permit the use of any area within the National Wildlife
Refuge System for any purpose whenever he determines that such uses are compatible with the major purposes for which
such areas were established.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940511-0-00033 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940511-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Refuge Recreation Act of 1962 (16 U.S.C. 460k) authorizes the Secretary to administer such areas for public recreation
as an appropriate incidental or secondary use only to the extent that it is practicable and not inconsistent with the
primary purposes for which the area was established. 

Section 304 of ANILCA requires the Secretary to prescribe such regulations and impose such terms and conditions as
may be necessary and appropriate to ensure that any activities carried out on a national wildlife refuge in Alaska
under any permit or easement granted under any authority are compatible with the purposes of that refuge. 

Section 1306 of ANILCA permits the Service to provide visitor facilities in the refuge if compatible with the unit's
purpose. 
This rule is being generated to help structure public use. Adequately regulated public use is consistent with and
will not interfere with the refuge purposes delineated above, and is thus compatible with the purposes for which Kodiak
National Wildlife Refuge was established according to 16 U.S.C. 668(dd). 


Request for Comments 


Department of Interior policy is, whenever practicable, to afford the public a meaningful opportunity to participate
in the rulemaking process. A 60 day comment period is specified in order to both facilitate public input and move forward
to protect important refuge resources. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written comments concerning
this interim rule to the persons listed above under the heading 

ADDRESSES. 

All substantive comments will be reviewed and considered. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 
 


This rulemaking does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. 


Environmental Considerations 


This rulemaking is categorically excluded under 40 CFR 1508.4 from the requirements of the National Environmental
Protection Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347) as an administrative action that will have no potential for causing
substantial environmental impact. 


Economic Effect 


Implementation of this interim rule will seasonally close two tenths of one percent (.02%) of Kodiak Refuge lands,
to commercial operators and public use not connected with the organized bear viewing program. Observations by refuge
personnel indicate that commercial use of the closure area has historically been steady. All use (commercial and
non-commercial) was estimated to have averaged 266 user days during 1989 and 1990, and 353 user days during 1991. These
levels of use will clearly be exceeded by the amount of commercial use (minimum of 480 user days) that will be allowed
under terms of a permit authorizing the bear viewing program. Thus, a net gain of commercial use is expected to occur.
Also, at least a portion of the commercial use previously occurring in the closure area will simply be displaced to
another location and therefore not lost to the local economy. 
Changes in use of the resource will have no significant effect on national income. Private income will be enhanced,
but dollar amounts will be small and have insignificant impact on the local economy. Agency costs for monitoring the
closure and the bear viewing commercial operation will be approximately $40,000 less than that expended during fiscal
year 1992 for program operation by the government. 
This rulemaking was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. In addition,
a review under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) has been done to determine whether the rulemaking
would have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities, which include businesses, organizations
or governmental jurisdictions. This interim rule would have minimal effect on such entities.

 Notice of National Marine Sanctuary Designation; final 
rule; and summary of final Management Plan. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), by the Designation Document contained in this document,
and as required by section 205(a)(4) of Public Law No. 100-627, designates an approximately 2,500 square nautical
mile area of coastal and ocean waters, and the submerged lands thereunder, off the Olympic Peninsula of Washington
State, including the waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca eastward to Koitlah Point, as the Olympic Coast National Marine
Sanctuary (Sanctuary). This document publishes the final Management Plan detailing the goals and objectives, management
responsibilities, research activities, interpretive and educational programs, and enforcement, including surveillance,
activities for the Sanctuary. 



Further, NOAA, by this document, issues final regulations to implement the designation by regulating activities
affecting the Sanctuary consistent with the provisions of the Designation Document. The intended effect of these
regulations is to protect the conservational, recreational, ecological, historical, research, educational,
and aesthetic resources and qualities of the Sanctuary. 




Effective Dates: 

Pursuant to section 304(b) of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (16 U.S.C. 1434(b)), the Governor
of the State of Washington has 45 days of continuous session of Congress beginning on the day on which this notice is
published to review the designation and regulations before they take effect. After 45 days, the designation and regulations
automatically become final and take effect. However, if the Governor of the State of Washington certifies within
the 45-day period to the Secretary of Commerce that the designation or any of its terms are unacceptable, the designation
or the unacceptable terms cannot take effect in the area of the Sanctuary lying within the seaward boundary of the State.
If the Secretary considers that such disapproval will affect the designation in a manner that the goals and objectives
of the Sanctuary cannot be fulfilled, the Secretary may withdraw the designation. A document announcing the effective
date will be published in the 

Federal Register

.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



Section 303 of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, as amended (the ``Act'' or ``MPRSA''), 16 U.S.C.

1433), provides that the Secretary may designate any discrete area of the marine environment as a National Marine
Sanctuary if the Secretary determines that such designation will fulfill the purposes and policies of the Act as set
forth in section 301(b) (16 U.S.C. 1431(b)) and finds that: 

(1) The area is of special national significance due to its resource or human-use values; 

(2) Existing state and Federal authorities are inadequate or should be supplemented to ensure coordinated and comprehensive
conservation and management of the area, including resource protection, scientific research, and public education;


(3) Designation of the area as a national marine sanctuary will facilitate the coordinated and comprehensive conservation
and management of the area; and 

(4) The area is of a size and nature that will permit comprehensive and coordinated conservation and management.

The authority of the Secretary to designate national marine sanctuaries and administer the other provisions of the
Act has been delegated to the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere by DOC Organization Order 10-15,
section 3.01(z), January 11, 1988. The authority to administer the other provisions of the Act has been re-delegated
to the Assistant Administrator of NOAA for Ocean Services and Coastal Zone Management by NOAA Circular 83-38,
Directive 05-50, September 21, 1983, as amended. 

The coastal and ocean waters off the Olympic Coast were recognized for their high natural resource and human use values
and placed on the National Marine Sanctuary Program Site Evaluation List (SEL) in August of 1983 (48 FR 35568). In 1988,
Congress reauthorized and amended the Act and directed the Secretary to designate the Olympic Coast National Marine
Sanctuary (Pub. L. 100-627, section 205(a)). In report language accompanying this legislation, Congress
noted that the Olympic Coast possesses a unique and nationally significant collection of flora and fauna, and that
adjacency of the area to the Olympic National Park merits the designation of this area as a national marine sanctuary
(H. Rep. No. 4210, 100th Cong., 1st. Sess., 1988). 

NOAA held four scoping meetings in Washington State April 10-13, 1989, to solicit public comments on the designation:
Aberdeen on April 10, Port Angeles on April 11, Forks on April 12, and Seattle on April 13 (45 FR 10398, March 13, 1989).


On September 20, 1991, NOAA published a proposed Designation Document and proposed implementing regulations and
announced the availability of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement/Management Plan (DEIS/MP) (56 FR 47836).
Public hearings to receive comments on the proposed designation, proposed regulations, and DEIS/MP were held on
November 6th in Port Angeles, November 7th in Seattle, November 12th in Olympia, November 13th in Aberdeen, November
14th in Seaview, and November 20th in Washington DC. On November 14th, 1991, the period for submitting public comments
was extended from November 27th, 1991 to December 13th, 1991 pursuant to requests from the State of Washington and
the coastal counties (56 FR 57869). All comments received by NOAA in response to the 

Federal Register

 notice and at the public hearings were considered and, where appropriate, incorporated in the final regulations
and FEIS/MP. A summary of the comments on the proposed regulations and the regulatory elements of the DEIS/MP and NOAA's
responses to them follow. 



II. Comments and Responses



Issue: Boundaries 




Boundary Alternative 1 





Comment: 

NOAA should choose boundary alternative 1 because: (1) it contains most of the unique ecological features off the
Washington Coast; (2) NOAA can offer greater protection to the coastal features than the resources further offshore
in the event of a spill of hazardous materials; and (3) vessel traffic would be least affected, thereby ensuring safer
seas. 



Response: 

NOAA disagrees. Boundary alternative 1 contains most of the ecological features visible above the sea surface. However,
a marine sanctuary should encompass a discrete ecological unit with definable boundaries (16 U.S.C. 1433 (b)(1)(F)).
The marine mammals and seabirds that transit the waters off the Olympic Peninsula and colonize the offshore rocks
and islands forage in the rich waters and benthic communities over and on the continental shelf. The shelf is broad
off the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The seaward extent of the shelf coupled with the upwelling produced from the Juan de Fuca
Canyon are the physical parameters that support the food chain from the plankton to the marine mammals and seabirds.
The offshore rocks and intertidal communities are only one habitat within the marine ecosystem off the Olympic Coast.
Therefore, the marine sanctuary should encompass the ecologically significant offshore waters. 

With respect to NOAA's ability to protect the offshore waters in the event of a spill, NOAA agrees that there is little
that can be done once a spill has occurred. The high seas would most likely render response capabilities ineffective.
However, NOAA will coordinate with the U.S. Coast Guard, the Washington State Office of Marine Safety, and the coastal
tribes to ensure that there is an adequate response capability for the coastal waters, intertidal regions, and beaches
along the sanctuary including seabird and marine mammal rescue capabilities. 

Extension of the Sanctuary boundary to the shelf edge provides a buffer area for protecting the coastal resources.
NOAA is working with the U.S. Coast Guard to develop a proposal for an Area to be Avoided (ATBA) from the shoreward boundary
to 25 nautical miles offshore of the Olympic Peninsula. This ATBA is designed to provide sufficient time to respond
to a vessel that loses power off the Olympic Peninsula. The ATBA is compatible with many of the existing voluntarily
adhered to traffic patterns along the coast and thus adds only minimal time and distance to transits between the Strait
of Juan de Fuca and destinations to the south. 



Boundary Alternative 2 





Comment: 

NOAA should choose boundary alternative 2 as the preferred alternative. 



Response: 

NOAA disagrees for the same reasons stated in response to the previous comment. The seaward extent of boundary alternative
2, which approximates the 50 fathom isobath, has no relation to the seaward extent of the coastal ecosystem.

Boundary Alternative 3 





Comment:

 NOAA should choose boundary alternative 3 as the preferred alternative. 



Response:

 Boundary Alternative 3 excludes the Juan de Fuca Canyon, which is one of the richest regions of the offshore oceanic
ecosystem. It also excludes some of the highest concentrations of human uses which threaten the health of the marine
ecosystem off the Olympic Peninsula. 



Comment:

 NOAA should not choose boundary alternative 3 as the preferred alternative because it will be too restrictive for
vessel traffic. 



Response:

 NOAA is proposing no regulations that will unduly restrict vessel traffic. (See response to comment on boundary alternative
1). 



Boundary Alternative 4 





Comment:

 NOAA should select boundary alternative 4 as the preferred alternative because: 

(1) Many of the unique unspoiled ecological resources that might be significantly impacted by oil are located in the
physically complex area north of Pt. Grenville including areas of submarine canyons, productive fishing grounds,
and coastal features that are critical habitat;
(2) Sanctuary status in the southern portion of the study area would conflict with state managed activities such as
dredged material disposal, while most of the shoreline in the north has little commercial activity; and
(3) NOAA can enlarge the boundary in the future. 



Response:

 NOAA agrees. One of the most valuable qualities of the Olympic Peninsula is that it is undeveloped and relatively pristine.
NOAA recognizes that the southern portion of the boundary is much more developed, especially with respect to the harbor
maintenance activities in Grays Harbor. Further, the rocky intertidal habitats in the north are much more sensitive
to pollution from oil and gas compared to the sandy beach environments in the southern portion of the study area. In
the event of a spill of hazardous materials, experts predict that it would take years for intertidal communities of
rocky intertidal environments to become reestablished, whereas it would take an order of months for the sandy intertidal
communities to recolonize. Lastly, NOAA can expand Sanctuary boundary 4 in the future, in accordance with the requirements
of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA), the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA),
and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), if deemed necessary. 



Comment:

 NOAA should not choose boundary alternative 4 because:
(1) It is not scientifically defensible for it fails to protect the important and environmentally delicate estuaries
along the southern coast;
(2) It would render ineffective NOAA's resource monitoring and sanctuary enforcement mandates; and
(3) It will be too restrictive for vessel traffic. 



Response:

 The boundary of a marine sanctuary should approximate the most identifiable boundaries of a marine ecosystem. The
Site Evaluation List (SEL), from which sites are selected for consideration as marine sanctuaries, identified the
coastal offshore islands as the core of the proposed Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (originally identified
as the Western Washington Outer Coast). With this focus, NOAA has determined that the boundaries of the ecosystem
are encompassed by boundary alternative 4. NOAA recognizes that the coastal estuaries are ecologically valuable
and that many organisms that exist within, or transit through boundary alternative 4, depend on the estuaries. However,
while the estuaries and outer coast are ecologically linked, the productivity of the two environments is a function
of very distinct environmental processes. 

NOAA believes that protection of the estuaries could be best achieved through possible inclusion of these areas in
programs targeting estuarine management such as, the National Estuarine Research Reserve System, the National
Estuary Program, or the Coastal Zone Management Program. 

NOAA believes that the size of the sanctuary encompassed by boundary alternative 4 is manageable with respect to research
and monitoring initiatives. 

As discussed above, NOAA is working with the U.S. Coast Guard to develop a proposal for an ATBA off the northern Olympic
Peninsula. It is designed to be as compatible with existing customary practices among mariners as possible. NOAA
is not promulgating vessel traffic regulations with designation.

Boundary Alternative 5 




Comment:

 NOAA should choose boundary alternative 5 because:
(1) Activities that are, or could occur, in the southern portion of the study area can affect the resources in the north;
(2) The entire study area is ecologically connected;
(3) The management needs are greatest in the south;
(4) The sanctuary management regime would complement existing management initiatives (Willapa Bay watershed planning
processes, Columbia and Snake River Salmon Recovery Planning, State National Heritage Plans); and
(5) Expansion of the Sanctuary boundary in the future will be too time-consuming. 


Response:

 NOAA's preferred boundary alternative is based on an ecologically identifiable boundary. The northern and southern
portions of the study area are distinct with respect to their coastal and offshore ecology. NOAA can protect Sanctuary
resources from outside activities through the prohibition on discharges outside the Sanctuary boundary that enter
and injure Sanctuary resources. NOAA will be involved in planning activities that could potentially threaten Sanctuary
resources outside its boundary. The boundary can be expanded in the future if needed. 


Comment:

 NOAA should not choose boundary alternative 5 because it is not necessary to encompass the entire Washington coastline
as a marine sanctuary, and it would eliminate any future development of the coastal areas. 

Response:

 NOAA agrees. See response to previous comment. 


Comment:

 A more detailed analysis of the impacts of sanctuary designation must be undertaken before seriously considering
boundary alternative 5. 


Response:

 NOAA has undertaken an extensive analysis of the uses and ecology of the southern portion of the study area and believes
that the ecologically sensitive estuarine environments are adequately protected. 


Alternative Boundary Suggestions 




Comment:

 NOAA should establish a series of smaller site-specific areas surrounding unique marine resources, such as ocean
waters immediately adjacent to already protected terrestrial ecosystems such as wildlife refuges and the Olympic
National Park. This alternative would afford sanctuary status to marine resources while maintaining provisions
for compatible ocean uses. 


Response:

 NOAA disagrees. Smaller site-specific areas would not encompass an ecosystem for the reasons stated above. Further,
designation of the marine sanctuary would allow for the continuation of pre-existing and compatible uses. 


Comment:

 NOAA's analysis of the resources within the study area identified the southern portion as highly important in terms
of wildlife and fishery values, particularly the areas in and surrounding Willapa Bay. NOAA should consider modifying
boundary alternative 4 by adding a satellite site encompassing the estuarine environment and the offshore waters
of Willapa Bay. 


Response:

 NOAA's analysis confirmed that the estuarine areas in the southern portion of the study area are significant natural
resources and that many of the resources utilize the waters off the northern coast as well. However, NOAA has determined
that the estuarine ecosystems are distinct from the higher energy marine environment of the northern portion of the
study area. In addition, the activities in, and adjacent to Grays Harbor are managed pursuant to an existing estuarine
management plan promulgated pursuant to the Washington State Shorelands Management Act. The residents living in
the watersheds of Willapa Bay are currently preparing an estuarine management plan. 


Comment:

 NOAA should consider the creation of a north and south Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary with separate but coordinated
management regimes. 



Response: 

The Act requires the designation of one sanctuary on the Western Washington Outer Coast with the offshore Islands
and coastal areas of the northern Olympic Peninsula as the core area of the sanctuary. In carrying out this mandate,
NOAA examined the seaward, northerly, southerly, and easterly extent of the ecosystem that has as its core the intertidal
communities of the outer coast. 



Comment: 

The boundary of the Sanctuary should be modified as further cetacean information is available. 


Response:

 NOAA can modify the boundary in the future, in accordance with the requirements of the MPRSA, the NEPA and the APA, as
more information becomes available. 


Modification of the Western Boundary 




Comment:

 The outer boundary of the sanctuary should extend westward to a point that minimizes restrictions and needless re-routing
of vessel traffic and harbor maintenance activities at the opening of Grays Harbor. To accomplish this objective,
the outer limit of the sanctuary should be set at a distance between 2 and 10 miles from shore. 


Response:

 Sanctuary boundaries are not established based on vessel traffic routes, particularly because routes are subject
to change. NOAA will work with existing regulatory agencies to minimize impacts. While vessel traffic is in the scope
of sanctuary regulations, NOAA is not promulgating vessel traffic regulations at this time. 


Comment:

 The outer boundary should be established at either the 100 or 500 fathom isobath. 



Response: 

NOAA has established the boundary at the 100 fathom isobath because it is generally recognized to be the seaward extent
of the continental shelf, the area where photosynthetic activity is greatest.

Comment:

 Clarify the rationale for establishing the western boundary of alternatives 4 and 5. 



Response:

 See response to previous comment. 



Modification of the Shoreline Boundary 





Comment:

 The shoreline boundary should be established at the lower low water mark to preclude interference with carefully
crafted beach management plans regulating beach traffic, razor clam harvests and emergency aircraft landings.




Response:

 The shoreline boundary of the Sanctuary is located at the higher high water line where adjacent to Federally-owned
land (including the Olympic National Park and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife refuges) and the lower low line mark when adjacent
to State-owned land. Thus, the boundary does not interfere with beach management plans. Razor clam harvests within
the intertidal zone of the Sanctuary will be managed by existing authorities such as the Washington State Department
of Natural Resources, the Quinault Indian Tribe, and the National Park Service. Emergency aircraft landings are
permissible in the Sanctuary. 



Comment:

 The shoreline boundary should cut across the mouths of all rivers, streams and estuaries because there are sufficient
management plans in place providing protection of inland environments such as the Washington State Coastal Zone
Management Program and the Grays Harbor Estuary Management Plan.



Response:

 The shoreline boundary of the Sanctuary has been modified to cut across the mouths of all rivers, streams and estuaries.




Comment:

 Clarify why the shoreward boundary distinguishes between adjacency to tribal and non-tribal lands. 



Response:

 The Tribes have jurisdiction to the mean lower low water line. Both the Tribes and the State have requested that the
Sanctuary boundary not overlap with tribal and State lands. Therefore, the coastal boundary has been modified so
that it is at mean lower low water when adjacent to tribal and State owned lands and at mean higher high water when adjacent
to Federally owned lands. 



Comment:

 Existing National Park Service standards, regulations, and policies must not be diminished as a result of dual designation
as a National Park and National Marine Sanctuary. The majority of the intertidal areas of the Olympic National Park
are Federally designated Wilderness Area and must be managed accordingly. 



Response:

 The Sanctuary boundary overlaps with the boundary of the Olympic National Park. NOAA will not diminish the standards,
regulations and policies currently applying to the intertidal areas of the Olympic National Park. The existing standards,
regulations and policies of the intertidal areas will remain. NOAA will enhance the protection of these intertidal
areas by working with the Coast Guard to ensure a safer vessel traffic environment, and the upland users of the watershed
to monitor and minimize the impacts of non-point source pollution. Additionally, NOAA will support research and
resource monitoring initiatives in the intertidal areas and may seek compensation for damages if an accident were
to occur that injures Sanctuary resources. 



Inclusion of the Strait of Juan de Fuca 





Comment:

 The northeastern boundary of the sanctuary should extend further into the Strait of Juan de Fuca to either: (1) The
Lyre River; (2) the Clallam County Marine Sanctuary at Salt Creek; (3) Low Point; (4) Crescent Bay/Agate Beach; or
(5) Pillar Point. Omission of the Strait of Juan de Fuca from the Sanctuary excludes the head of the Juan de Fuca Canyon
from the boundary of the Sanctuary, and thus represents a boundary not based upon an ecological rationale. 



Response:

 NOAA has examined the resources of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the FEIS/MP has been revised accordingly. Sections
III and IV (Alternatives, and Environmental Consequences) examine the benefits and consequences of various alternatives
in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. NOAA believes that the existence of a functional biotic community characteristic of
the marine environment extends into the Strait of Juan de Fuca to Observatory Point. Eastward of Observatory Point,
the ecosystem is more characteristic of an estuarine environment.

<PARENT> FR940511-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Despite the ecological arguments that support inclusion of the Strait of Juan de Fuca in the Sanctuary boundary, NOAA
does not believe that the public has had ample opportunity to analyze and comment on the proposal to add the Strait.
Since the Strait of Juan de Fuca lies entirely in state waters, the Strait of Juan de Fuca cannot be included without
the approval of the Governor of Washington State. However, NOAA will pursue expanding the boundary if supported by
the State of Washington. 



Comment:

 The boundary of the Sanctuary should be contiguous with that of the proposed Northwest Straits Sanctuary. A gap between
these two proposed sanctuaries would cause confusion for commercial shipping and fishing interests and government
managing agencies. 



Response:

 At this time, the future and nature of the proposed Northwest Straits National Marine Sanctuary is uncertain and cannot
serve as a deciding factor in the determination of the eastern boundary of the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary.
The boundary of the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary must be determined based on ecological and human use factors.
NOAA can modify the boundary in the future if it is deemed appropriate. NOAA will coordinate with existing managing
agencies to ensure that the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary and the proposed Northwest Straits National
Marine Sanctuary do not unduly disrupt the management of vessel traffic and fishing. 



Comment:

 The boundary of the Sanctuary should not encompass the waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca because closely-monitored
vessel traffic lanes already exist. 



Response:

 The MPRSA encourages multiple uses of the Sanctuary as long as they are compatible with the resource protection goals
of the Sanctuary. Clearly, the Coordinated Vessel Traffic System in the Strait of Juan de Fuca is in the best interest
of the vessel traffic industry and the environment. NOAA would not interfere with the vessel traffic management regime
in the Strait of Juan de Fuca if the Governor of the State of Washington supported inclusion of the Strait of Juan de Fuca
in the Sanctuary boundary. 



Northern Boundary 





Comment:

 The northern boundary of the Sanctuary should be adjacent to the international border and include vessel traffic
lanes to facilitate the establishment of a cooperative international sanctuary and coordinated vessel traffic
management regime. 



Response:

 The northern boundary is adjacent to the international boundary. 




Inclusion of the Estuaries 





Comment:

 NOAA recognized both the high resource values of the estuaries and the high level of point source discharges. By including
the estuaries in the boundary NOAA would be in a position to work with the Washington Department of Ecology (WDOE) to
correct the sources of pollution. 



Response:

 NOAA has been working with the Washington Department of Ecology to address pollution problems in the coastal estuaries.
The Grays Harbor Estuary Management Plan was supported by funding provided pursuant to the Washington Shorelands
Management Act. NOAA agrees that the estuaries are extremely valuable environments with high levels of point source
discharges. However, NOAA believes that the estuaries are ecologically distinct from the offshore waters of the
Olympic Peninsula, which is the core area of the Sanctuary. Inclusion in the National Estuarine Research Reserve
System (NERRS) is a more appropriate management framework for NOAA involvement in estuarine management. 



Comment:

 The estuaries should be excluded from the Sanctuary boundary because the Washington State Coastal Zone Management
Program and the Grays Harbor Management Plan offer sufficient protection to the estuaries. 



Response:

 NOAA agrees. The estuaries are excluded from the preferred boundary of the Sanctuary.

Consideration of Other National Marine Sanctuaries and National Estuarine Research Reserves (NERRS) 




Comment:

 Some commenters believed that NOAA should designate the estuaries as NERR's if they are not included in the boundary
of the Sanctuary because of their natural resource values. Other commenters believed that NERR status is inadequate
since it does not include the marine environment. Clarification is needed on the specific elements of the NERRS:

(1) The degree of protection that the NERRS would provide to Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay;
(2) The process of designation;
(3) Timetable for designation;
(4) Assurances that designation would occur; and
(5) The degree of protection to the estuaries that would be provided in comparison to sanctuary status. 


Response:

 The terms of designation as a NERR are determined between the State and NOAA. The process begins with the nomination
of an estuary, or portion thereof, to NOAA for inclusion in the NERRS by the Governor of the State. The State holds scoping
meetings in the region nominated for inclusion to solicit public input. The State then prepares a draft environmental
impact statement and management plan (DEIS/MP) where boundary, management, and regulatory alternatives are assessed
and a preferred alternative is decided upon. The DEIS/MP must demonstrate that the key core land and water areas are
adequately protected by the state. Once the DEIS/MP is completed, public hearings are held in the region. After a comment
period of one month, the State must produce a Final Environmental Impact Statement/Management Plan (FEIS/MP) incorporating
the public comments. Once NOAA approves the FEIS/MP the Reserve is officially designated. The entire process requires
approximately three years. Designation is contingent upon available funding. 


Comment:

 NOAA should encourage sanctuary designations in Northern Puget Sound, Hood Canal, Southern Oregon and Northern
California. 


Response:

 NOAA is working with the State of Washington to study the feasibility of a sanctuary in Northern Puget Sound. New candidates
for sanctuary status are selected from NOAA's SEL. Sites in southern Oregon and Northern California are presently
on the SEL. 


Harbor Exclusion/Inclusion 




Comment:

 How will sanctuary designation influence the disposal of dredge material from harbor maintenance and development
activities that occur in the Port of La Push, the mouth of the Quilleute River, and Neah Bay?



Response: 

No dredge spoil disposal will be permitted within the Sanctuary, except when used in connection with beach nourishment
projects related to harbor maintenance activities. Harbors are excluded from the Sanctuary boundary. Therefore,
maintenance and development activities can occur, but disposal of dredge material must be either on land or outside
the boundary of the Sanctuary. 


Growth Management 




Comment:

 The Sanctuary should help to limit population growth.



Response: 

The sanctuary program has no control over population growth adjacent to the Sanctuary boundary. Rather, the program
exists to ensure that human uses resulting from growth do not have a negative impact on Sanctuary resources. 


Comment:

 Private land owners should not lose development rights to their land, nor should they have the value of their land significantly
decreased by regulation without due compensation for that loss.



Response: 

NOAA is issuing no regulations that will diminish the development rights of private property owners. 


Opposition to Sanctuary Designation 




Comment:

 The marine sanctuary should not be designated because: (1) It would shut down the fishing industry; (2) existing legislation
and management regimes offer adequate protection; (3) potential industrial interests would be stifled because
the sanctuary would over-regulate the local economy and its growth; (4) the ecological/aesthetic values of Washington's
coastline are not permanently threatened; (5) local airports in Aberdeen and Ocean Shores would close due to insurance
problems; and (6) the Olympic National Park has too much control over the Olympic Peninsula already. 


Response:

 The Sanctuary will not shut down the fishing industry. Fishing is not within the scope of Sanctuary regulation; the
regulation of fishing would remain with existing management regimes. Further, the Sanctuary will ensure greater
protection from risks due to oil, gas and mineral development and vessel traffic accidents. 
NOAA disagrees that existing legislation offers adequate protection of the offshore resources. The threats from
such things as vessel traffic, oil and gas development, sand and gravel mining and Navy practice bombing of Sea Lion
Rock have not been addressed through a comprehensive management regime that recognizes the value and fragility of
the marine ecosystem off the Olympic Peninsula. NOAA does not believe that the Sanctuary will over-regulate the local
economy since the main source of income in the region is from tourism, fishing and timber production-none of which
will be negatively affected by the Sanctuary. Tourism and fishing will likely benefit from Sanctuary status due to
the increased protection of the marine environment.

Issue: Alteration of/or Construction on the Seabed 




Comment: 

The regulation pertaining to alteration or construction of the seabed may be interpreted as prohibiting such activities
as geologic research, the placement of current meters, sediment traps and similar research equipment, all of which
might be necessary if environmental studies were to be conducted in the Mineral Management Service (MMS) Washington-Oregon
planning area. To clarify the intent of this prohibition, ``Government sponsored environmental studies'' should
be added in the second sentence of this section as one of the activities for which this prohibition does not apply. 


Response: 

NOAA supports research within the Sanctuary. However, the prohibition on alteration of, or construction on the seabed
applies to all research activities, including those conducted by governmental agencies. All research activities
conducted within the Sanctuary that violate a Sanctuary regulation must be undertaken pursuant to a Sanctuary research
permit to ensure that the impacts from the research are minimal and temporary. 


Comment: 

The prohibition on the alteration of, or construction on the seabed should not interfere with current or future harbor
maintenance or fishing activities including: (1) Jetty and groin construction; (2) permitted dredging of channels
and harbors; (3) the use of dredge spoils for underwater berm construction; (4) construction and improvement of boat
launching and marine facilities adjacent to reservations; (5) the retrieval of fishing gear (including crab pots)
and sunken vessels; (6) bottom trawling and scallop dredging; and (7) tribal fin and shellfish operations. NOAA needs
to clarify the exemption of activities incidental to routine fishing and vessel operations. The exemptions for harbor
maintenance and fishing activities should read: ``attempting to alter the seabed for any purpose other than anchoring
vessels, normal fishing operations to include commercial bottom trawling and crab pot recovery, and routine harbor
maintenance.'' 


Response: 

Ports and harbors are not included within the boundary of the Sanctuary. The boundary of the Sanctuary adjacent to
the Port of La Push is congruent with the Colreg lines at the mouth of the harbors. Further, there is the following exception
to the alteration-of-the-seabed regulation: ``Harbor maintenance in the areas necessarily associated with Federal
Projects in existence on the effective date of Sanctuary designation, including dredging of entrance channels and
repair, replacement or rehabilitation of breakwaters and jetties.'' The noted activities incidental to fishing
have been exempted from the Sanctuary regulations. 


Comment: 

NOAA should prohibit all dredging and removal of sand and gravel within the Sanctuary boundary. 


Response: 

NOAA has prohibited all dredging and removal of sand and gravel within the Sanctuary boundary except as an incidental
result of harbor maintenance activities. These activities threaten the integrity of the benthic community and the
food source of many fish, marine mammals and seabirds. 


Comment: 

NOAA should not subject the exploration and development of offshore mineral activities to the same restrictions
proposed for the exploration and development of Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) oil and gas.

Response: 

All of these activities injure the benthic communities in the Sanctuary and NOAA does not believe that there is cause
for exceptions. 



Comment: 

Clarify NOAA's policy on establishing artificial reefs within the Sanctuary. 



Response: 

There are no artificial reefs in the Sanctuary as of the date of designation. The creation of new artificial reefs would
be prohibited pursuant to the prohibition on alteration of, or construction on, the seabed. 



Comment: 

NOAA should prohibit the construction of pipelines on the sea floor. 



Response: 

The regulation prohibiting the alteration of, or construction on, the seabed would prohibit the construction of
pipelines on the sea floor. 



Issue: Cultural and Historic Resources 





Comment: 

NOAA should prohibit moving, injuring, or possessing historic resources within the Sanctuary.



Response: 

NOAA agrees that it is necessary to protect and manage historical and cultural resources within the Sanctuary boundary.
NOAA has included a prohibition on moving, removing, possessing, injuring, or attempting to move, remove, or injure
these resources, except as resulting incidentally from traditional fishing operations. If NOAA determines that
fishing activities are resulting in injury to Sanctuary historic and cultural resources, NOAA may amend the Sanctuary
regulations to abolish the exemption for these activities. 



Comment: 

The proposed regulations dealing with cultural resources fail to preserve the tribes' ability to control access
to, and removal of, their cultural heritage. Therefore, NOAA should add a new  925.5(a)(8) prohibiting: ``removal
or attempted removal of any Indian cultural resource or artifact, or entry onto a significant cultural site designated
by a tribal governing body with the concurrence of the Director, except with the express written consent of the governing
body of the tribe or tribes to which such resource, artifact, or cultural site pertains.'' NOAA should pursue a cooperative
agreement with the tribes to coordinate management of cultural artifacts of tribal significance. 



Response: 

The MPRSA provides NOAA with the authority to control access to cultural artifacts within the Sanctuary thereby helping
to ensure their preservation. Accordingly, anyone proposing to remove a cultural or historic resource must apply
for and obtain a sanctuary permit from NOAA. NOAA acknowledges the interest of the coastal tribes in preserving their
cultural heritage and, in particular, those cultural artifacts of tribal significance found within the Sanctuary.
NOAA considers its objective of preserving the historical and cultural resources of the Sanctuary to be compatible
with the coastal tribes' desire to preserve their cultural heritage. Therefore, NOAA has modified  925.9(j)
to state: ``The Director or designee shall obtain the express written consent of the governing body of an Indian tribe
prior to issuing a permit, if the proposed activity involves or affects resources of cultural or historical significance
to the tribe.'' NOAA has also added  925.9(k) which states: ``removal, or attempted removal of any Indian cultural
resource or artifact may only occur with the express written consent of the governing body of the tribe or tribes to
which such resource or artifact pertains, and certification by the Director that such activities occur in a manner
that minimizes damage to the biological and archeological resources. Prior to permitting entry into a significant
cultural site designated by a tribal governing body, the Director shall acquire the express written consent of the
governing body of the tribe or tribes to which such cultural site pertains.'' NOAA will enter into a cooperative agreement
with the tribes and the State of Washington that clarifies the process by which permits will be granted to conduct research
or salvage operations on historical and cultural resources of tribal significance. 



Comment: 

Current management of cultural resources is agreed upon between the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the tribes.
The BIA supports the tribes in the management of their cultural resources. 



Response: 

See response to previous comment.



Comment: 

The regulation as proposed in the DEIS/MP is duplicative of State law. There already exists state and Federal antiquities
acts to protect coastal archeological and historical sites that occur on or near the median high tide boundary. The
State archeologist already coordinates archeological matters. 



Response: 

The MPRSA is not duplicative of existing laws protecting historical and cultural resources. The MPRSA is more comprehensive
in that it provides enforcement authority, including civil penalties, for the destruction or injury of historical
and cultural resources. 

The Abandoned Shipwreck Act of 1987 gives states the title to certain abandoned shipwrecks in state waters. Under
the MPRSA, NOAA has trustee responsibilities for abandoned shipwrecks and other historical and cultural resources
within national marine sanctuaries, including those located in state waters, for the purpose of protecting them.
NOAA will coordinate with State agencies to ensure that historical and cultural resources within the Sanctuary are
protected, and that the policies affecting historical and cultural resources in State waters are consonant with
the policies in the Federal waters of the Sanctuary. 


Issue: Discharges 



Ocean Dumping 





Comment: 

NOAA should not prohibit the use of dredged material disposal sites off Grays Harbor, Willapa Bay, the Columbia River,
or on the north jetty and breakwater of the Port of La Push.

<PARENT> FR940511-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response: 

The Sanctuary boundary does not extend south of Copalis Beach and excludes ports and harbors. Therefore, the maintenance
activities at La Push and the use of the dredge disposal sites south of the boundary is not prohibited. In addition,
the use of dredged spoil within the Sanctuary for beach nourishment in connection with harbor maintenance activities
is exempt from the regulatory prohibition. 



Comment: 

No ocean dumping should be allowed in proximity to the major submarine canyons. 



Response: 

The regulations prohibit ocean dumping within the Sanctuary, and outside the Sanctuary if the material enters and
injures Sanctuary resources or qualities. 



Point Source Discharges 





Comment: 

Prohibit discharges of toxics, plastic, and municipal garbage and sewage into the marine environment.



Response: 

The dumping of municipal garbage, toxics and plastics is prohibited within the Sanctuary by Sanctuary regulations
and by regulations promulgated pursuant to the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (33 U.S.C. 1901 

et seq

.) and the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act of 1987, which implements Annex V of MARPOL 73/78 in the
U.S. Point source discharges are allowed provided such discharge is certified by NOAA in accordance with  925.10
or approved by NOAA in accordance with  925.11. After expiration of current permits, discharges from municipal
treatment plants will be subject to the review process of  925.11. At a minimum, secondary treatment will be
required. 



Comment: 

Current regulations are adequate. NOAA has not proven that the proposed regulations will enhance the recreational
or aesthetic appeal, and water quality. 



Response: 

Current regulations do not protect the area from the cumulative impacts of various types of discharges, including:
(1) Some ocean dumping; (2) sewage receiving only primary treatment; and (3) non-point source discharges. NOAA's
ocean disposal regulation offers protection to the offshore environment that does not otherwise exist. NOAA will
work with existing tribal, State and Federal authorities to ensure that the quality of the water and Sanctuary resources
are maintained. 



Comment: 

Clarify how discharges from drilling and production rigs may be addressed if oil and gas leasing were to occur in the
future. 



Response: 

The regulations prohibit oil and gas exploration, development, and production activities within the Sanctuary.
NOAA will work with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to ensure that best available technology is implemented
on any drilling rigs located outside of the Sanctuary to ensure that no discharges enter and injure Sanctuary resources
and qualities. 



Comment: 

Depositing or discharging from any location within the Sanctuary or from beyond the Sanctuary should be prohibited.




Response: 

The mandate of the National Marine Sanctuary Program is to facilitate multiple uses that are compatible with resource
protection. Depositing or discharging most materials within the boundary of the Sanctuary, or from beyond the boundary
of the Sanctuary if such material subsequently enters the Sanctuary and injures Sanctuary resources or qualities
is prohibited. NOAA will work with EPA, the tribes and the State of Washington to maintain water quality. NOAA may require
special terms and conditions, including (but not limited to) improved effluent quality, on EPA permits to ensure
Sanctuary resources and qualities are protected. 



Non-Point Source Discharges 





Comment: 

NOAA should not require at a minimum secondary treatment and sometimes tertiary or more for non-point source pollution.
It is virtually impossible to subject runoff to these levels of treatment. 



Response: 

NOAA does not require such treatment for non-point source pollution. NOAA will monitor non-point source pollution
and work with those living and working in the coastal watersheds to minimize runoff into the Sanctuary. 



Comment: 

It should be stated that there is no intent to regulate forest practices by Sanctuary administrators. There is no research
or evidence which would justify the statement made in the proposed DEIS that the ``greatest source of non-point discharge
is the forest.'' This statement needs clarification and tree farmers must be assured that they can continue to grow
and harvest trees pursuant to Washington's Forest Practices Act, one of the most stringent in the country. 



Response: 

NOAA's Strategic Assessment Branch has analyzed existing watershed data from the National Coastal Pollutant Discharge
Inventory to determine sources of runoff. Summaries of pollution discharges for total volumes of nitrogen, lead,
and all suspended solids combined indicate that with the exception of suspended solids discharged by paper mills,
the greatest source of sediments discharged into sanctuary waters is from natural forest runoff. 

Despite this evidence, NOAA will not be directly regulating upland uses. However, NOAA will coordinate with the upland
user groups, and managing agencies to minimize non-point source impacts on Sanctuary resources. 



Comment: 

The suggestion that excessive erosion from clear cutting practices is the source of most non-point source pollution
from forests supports the need for further study of this common practice and the issuance of more stringent controls
due to the steep and unstable slopes and amount of rainfall. 



Response: 

NOAA agrees and will conduct monitoring and research initiatives in coordination with those living and working in
the watersheds to minimize the impacts from timbering activities.

Discharges Outside the Sanctuary 




Comment: 

Clarify to what extent the ``sphere of influence'' of the discharge regulation extends, to what degree it may affect
coastal communities including the tribes, and who determines if injury to a Sanctuary resource has occurred. Would
a community such as Ocean Shores or an Indian tribe face increased water quality regulations or enforcement? Further,
does the discharge prohibition apply to particulates that are discharged into the air from pulp mills and subsequently
enter the Sanctuary and harm Sanctuary resources and qualities. 
NOAA should not impose additional restrictions, beyond the existing requirements of the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act (FWPA), on the discharge of effluent and dredge spoils into marine waters. There is no evidence that additional
restrictions on these activities are required to protect water quality in the proposed sanctuary. 


Response: 

The MPRSA protects Sanctuary resources and qualities (including water quality) from the impacts of discharges from
within and outside the boundary of a Sanctuary whether airborne or waterborne. NOAA is responsible for determining
injury to Sanctuary resources. Discharges pursuant to existing permits may be continued subject to the certification
requirements of  925.10. New permits are subject to the review process of  925.11. At a minimum, secondary
treatment will be required for any treatment plants discharging directly into the Sanctuary. With respect to airborne
or waterborne discharges outside the Sanctuary, NOAA may condition such permits only if it is established that the
discharges are entering the Sanctuary and injuring Sanctuary resources or qualities. NOAA will work closely with
all to ensure that none is unduly burdened by permitting requirements related to discharges. NOAA will coordinate
with the State's Air Quality Board and Department of Ecology to monitor air and water quality over and in the Sanctuary.



Application of Discharge Regulations to Vessel Traffic 




Comment: 

The application of this regulation should prohibit organic and inorganic discharges from fishing vessels and submarines
(including bilge), aircraft. The prohibition should apply to all naval operations. 


Response: 

The Sanctuary regulations specify the fishing and vessel related activities exempted from the discharge prohibition
( 925.5(a)(2)(i)-(iv)). Discharges and deposits from vessels are prohibited except for specific discharges
intended to provide for traditional fishing activities, such as fish wastes resulting from traditional fishing
operations in the Sanctuary, and for allowed vessel operations in the Sanctuary, namely biodegradable effluent
incidental to vessel use and generated by approved marine sanitation devices, water generated by routine vessel
operations, and engine exhaust. Such discharges are determined to be of minimal threat to the Sanctuary and are important
for the safe and effective functioning of fishing and other vessels. Other discharges from vessel operations are
prohibited. If in the future NOAA determines that increased protection for Sanctuary resources and qualities from
these exempted activities is warranted, the Sanctuary regulations could be revised. 


Comment: 

Clarify acceptable and unacceptable discharges from fishing vessels. 


Response: 

See response to previous comment. 


Economic Impacts of Discharge Regulations 




Comment: 

Banning the use of approved dredge disposal sites would impose severe economic impacts on marine navigation and commerce,
and ultimately to the coastal communities. 


Response: 

The boundary of the Sanctuary does not encompass the approved dredge disposal sites off of Grays Harbor, Willapa Bay,
and the Columbia River. However, no new dredge disposal sites may be located within the Sanctuary boundary. 


Comment: 

NOAA must examine the economic impacts of the discharge regulations on existing industries. There are currently
72 identified dischargers in the study area. It is unclear if the proposed Sanctuary would impact the continued operation
of the pulp mill's NPDES permitted discharge near Grays Harbor. 


Response: 

The Sanctuary's boundary does not extend south of Copalis Beach. Therefore, the only discharge regulation that would
apply to dischargers in Grays Harbor would be the prohibition on discharges from outside the boundary that subsequently
enter and injure Sanctuary resources or qualities. NOAA will need to establish that effluents from pulp mills are
injuring Sanctuary resources or qualities before it would impose terms and conditions on the pulp mill's NPDES permit.
If this situation were to occur, NOAA would work with the discharger, the State of Washington, and EPA to minimize the
economic impacts of reducing the impacts. 


Issue: Oil and Gas Development 




Comment: 

NOAA's failure to offer as an alternative an outright, no conditions ban on hydrocarbon development within the Sanctuary
is contrary to NEPA regulations, 40 CFR 1502.14 which states that the alternatives section is the heart of the environmental
impact statement. NOAA should permanently ban oil and gas exploration, development, and production activities.



Response: 

Section 2207 of the Oceans Act of 1992 prohibits oil and gas exploration, development and production within the Sanctuary.
The Sanctuary regulations repeat this prohibition. 


Comment: 

NOAA should designate a buffer zone based on ocean currents and local seabed geography to prevent damage from external
mineral operations.

Response: 

NOAA believes that the Sanctuary is large enough to buffer the sensitive canyon and coastal ecosystems from negative
impacts of mineral development. Further, NOAA's authority to regulate discharges from outside the Sanctuary boundary
that subsequently enter and injure Sanctuary resources or qualities provides additional protection over mineral
activities. 


Comment: 

NOAA should commit in the FEIS/MP and Record of Decision to the preparation of an EIS before lifting the prohibition.



Response: 

As previously discussed, the Oceans Act of 1992 prohibits oil and gas explorations, development and production within
the Sanctuary. This prohibition may only be lifted by an Act of Congress. 


Comment: 

The oil companies should be excluded from voicing an opinion regarding the Sanctuary because this privilege should
be extended only to those who have spent time enjoying the State of Washington coastline. 


Response: 

The Sanctuary program does not and cannot discriminate against any individual, agency, or interest group. All individuals
have the right to voice an opinion. 



Comment: 

Has NOAA come across any proposal for offshore wind generated power? 


Response: 

NOAA is not aware of any proposal for offshore wind generated power. 


Comment: 

The President's decision to postpone OCS activities off the coasts of Washington and Oregon until after the year 2,000
should expire at that time unless affirmatively extended. 



Response: 

Section 2207 of the Oceans Act of 1992 indefinitely bans oil and gas exploration, development and production within
the boundary of the Sanctuary. These prohibitions could only be lifted by an Act of Congress. 



Contingency Plans 




Comment: 

The Sanctuary should establish a contingency plan in coordination with existing state and Federal contingency plans.
Efforts should be made to coordinate with the State of Washington Departments of Wildlife, Fisheries, Ecology, and
Natural Resources and pursue data sharing opportunities. 



Response: 

The FEIS/MP identifies existing oil spill contingency plans and efforts in the State of Washington to cover the Strait
of Juan de Fuca and Outer Coast. NOAA will coordinate closely with the existing agencies involved in contingency and
emergency response planning, particularly the U.S. and Canadian Coast Guard and the State of Washington Office of
Marine Safety (OMS). However, NOAA agrees that the Sanctuary requires its own contingency plan to ensure that resources
are protected during events that threaten the environment. A prototype Sanctuary Contingency Plan is being tested
at the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary. Once implementation experience has been gained, the plan will
be adapted to other sites, including the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary. To implement successfully an organized
emergency response, NOAA will incorporate state and Federal legislation as well as local efforts into the Sanctuary
Contingency Plan. 


Comment: 

NOAA needs to provide for better oil spill response planning. 


Response: 

NOAA is coordinating with the regional response committees of the OMS to ensure that the equipment is available to
address an emergency that would threaten Sanctuary resources. 



Comment: 

An Oil Spill Response Center should be sited in close proximity to the Sanctuary to address small spills north of Grays
Harbor where there is currently a lack of oil spill response capability. 



Response: 

NOAA is promoting this idea in its participation on the regional response subcommittee whose jurisdiction is the
Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Outer Coast. However, priority will be placed on the stationing of tugs and barges dedicated
to emergency response. 


Comment: 

The tribes should be properly funded to handle resource damage assessment as well as other activities where an oil
spill could impact their subsistence and ceremonial harvest and cultural values. 


Response: 

The reservations are not within the Sanctuary boundary. Therefore, the Sanctuary cannot dedicate funds to the Tribes
for the purpose of damage assessment pursuant to a spill of hazardous materials. 


Comment: 

NOAA should request that the oil industry's Marine Spill Response Corporation station a tractor/tug response vessel
at Neah Bay. 


Response: 

NOAA has made the recommendation to the subcommittee on emergency response for the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Outer
Coast. NOAA is actively participating in formulating the recommendation to the State, and will coordinate with the
Makah Tribe in their planning initiative to expand their marina to plan to accommodate a tug or emergency response
vessel that is of appropriate size to service the Outer Coast and the Strait of Juan de Fuca. 


Comment: 

NOAA should ensure that drills are conducted for the Clean Sound Cooperative with outside evaluation. 


Response: 

NOAA intends to hire an operations manager immediately after designation to address issues related to vessel traffic
and contingency planning. One of the priorities of this position will be to encourage the Coast Guard to focus on the
Sanctuary during its emergency response drills.

Comment:

 NOAA should propose the examination of extending unlimited liability for spills to the shipping companies and the
original firms providing the original source materials involved in the polluting activities. 


Response:

 The MPRSA only provides NOAA with the authority to collect $100,000 per day for each violation pursuant to 
16 U.S.C. 1437(c)(1), and damages to Sanctuary natural resources pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1443. 


Issue: Sealion Rock 




Comment:

 NOAA should prohibit, or at least condition, the Navy's practice bombing activities over Sealion Rock due to the impact
on seabirds, depositing of metal objects in the Sanctuary, and because the military environment does not require
such a sensitive area to be used for such purposes. At the very least, NOAA should prohibit the practice bombing during
the breeding season. Section 7 consultations with the Department of Commerce and the Department of the Interior should
not be construed as sufficient mitigation because these processes do not address impacts to non-endangered species.



Response:

 NOAA agrees that the Navy practice bombing of Sealion Rock is inconsistent with the goals of the Sanctuary program.
Because the permit under which the Navy conducted its activities over Sealion Rock was rescinded by the Secretary
of the Interior in August, 1993, NOAA may prohibit outright all bombing activities within the Sanctuary and has determined
to do so. The regulation adopted by NOAA prohibits all practice bombing and provides that no exemption from the prohibition
will be granted. 


Comment:

 NOAA does not have the authority to prohibit or condition the Navy's activities. 


Response:

 Because the Navy's authorization from the Secretary of Interior was rescinded, NOAA now has the authority to not only
condition but also prohibit the Navy's practice bombing activities. 


Comment:

 NOAA should place the Navy's bombing activities within the scope of regulation to allow future regulation if necessary.
To not list military activities is in conflict with the primary goal of resource protection. 


Response:

 NOAA has addressed Navy activities in 
 925.5(d) of the regulations. 


Comment:

 NOAA should investigate the history of the Navy's activities over Sealion Rock to determine if a grandfather clause
is warranted. 


Response:

 The history of the Navy's activities and the permit that authorized its activities has been outlined in the FEIS/MP.
The Navy's authority to conduct practice bombing activities has been rescinded and thus consideration of a grandfather
clause is irrelevant. 


Comment:

 Clarify how Navy bombing of Sealion Rock at 200 feet is less disruptive than commercial overflights. 


Response:

 NOAA does not assert that the Navy's low flying activities are less disruptive than commercial or non-commercial
overflights. NOAA's differing regulations in the DEIS/MP applying to Navy and non-military overflights resulted
from limitations placed on NOAA by the MPRSA with respect to terminating pre-existing leases and permits. 


Issue: Protection of Treaty Rights




Comment:

 NOAA's regulations do not formally recognize the Federal Government's trust responsibility to the coastal Tribes.
The regulations contain no provision which formally requires the Director to consider and protect tribal interests
when ruling on permit applications to conduct development activities within the Sanctuary. To address this issue,
the following modifications to the  925.8 should be made: 




The Director * * * may issue a permit * * * to conduct an activity otherwise prohibited
by  925.5(a)(2)-(7), if the Director finds that the activity will: further research related to Sanctuary
resources: * * * 

or promote the welfare of any Indian Tribe adjacent to the Sanctuary.

 In deciding whether to issue a permit, the Director shall consider such factors as * * * 

the impacts of the activity on adjacent Indian Tribes. Where the issuance or denial of a permit is requested by the governing
body of an Indian Tribe, the Director shall consider and protect the interests of the Tribe to the fullest extent practicable
in keeping with the purposes of the Sanctuary and his or her fiduciary duties to the Tribe

 * * *







Response:

 NOAA agrees that the designation of the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary is subject to the Federal government's
general fiduciary responsibility to the coastal tribes. Accordingly, NOAA has modified  925.9(d) of the regulations
to incorporate the recommended language. 


Comment:

 NOAA's regulation prohibiting the taking of marine mammals and seabirds conflicts with treaty rights to fish and
hunt marine mammals in tribal usual and accustomed fishing grounds.

Response:

 NOAA recognizes that, given the standard for abrogating treaty rights enunciated by the Supreme Court in 

United States

 v. 

Dion,

 476 U.S. 734 (1985), the provisions of the MPRSA do not abrogate the coastal Tribes' treaty fishing and hunting rights.
However, it is unclear whether Congress intended the MMPA and the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to abrogate these rights.
Recently, the Makah Tribe has pursued clarification regarding the applicability of the Marine Mammal Protection
Act (MMPA) and ESA to its treaty rights to hunt whales and seals. The issue is currently being examined by the tribes
and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Given the concerns raised by the coastal tribes,  925.5(a)(6)
has been revised to read as follows: 



Taking any marine mammal, sea turtle, or seabird in or above the Sanctuary, except as authorized by the National Marine
Fisheries Service or the United States Fish and Wildlife Service under the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection
Act, as amended (MMPA), 16 U.S.C. 1361 

et seq.,

 the Endangered Species Act, as amended, (ESA), 16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.,

 and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, as amended, (MBTA), 16 U.S.C. 703 

et seq.,

 or pursuant to any treaty with an Indian Tribe to which the United States is a party, provided that the treaty right is
exercised in accordance with the MMPA, ESA, and MBTA, to the extent that they apply.


 

In addition,  925.5(a)(8) has been modified similarly. The revised language recognizes the coastal Tribe's
treaty right to hunt whales and seals. However, the regulation also requires that the right be exercised in accordance
with the provisions of the MMPA, ESA, and MBTA. If the MMPA, ESA or MBTA is determined to abrogate or otherwise restrict
the Tribe's exercise of its right to hunt whales and seals, then that determination shall apply to the Tribe's exercise
of those rights within the boundary of the Sanctuary. 


Comment: 

The regulations fail to preserve tribal control of their cultural heritage. NOAA should amend  925.5(a)(8)
to read as follows: 



Removal or attempted removal of any Indian cultural resource or artifact, or entry onto a significant cultural site
designated by a Tribal governing body with the concurrence of the Director, except with the express written consent
of the governing body of the Tribe or Tribes to which such resource, artifact, or cultural site pertains. 





Response:

 The MPRSA provides NOAA with the authority to control access to cultural or historical artifacts within the Sanctuary
thereby helping to ensure their preservation. Accordingly, anyone proposing to remove a cultural or historical
resource must apply for and obtain a Sanctuary permit from NOAA. NOAA also acknowledges the coastal Tribes' desire
to preserve their cultural heritage and, in particular, those cultural artifacts of tribal significance found within
the Sanctuary. NOAA considers its objective of preserving the historical and cultural resources of the Sanctuary
to be compatible with the coastal Tribes' desire to preserve their cultural heritage. Accordingly,  925.9(j)
has been modified and  925.9(k) has been added to address the coastal tribe's concerns. 


Comment:

 The regulation prohibiting overflights under 1,000 ft. except for valid law enforcement purposes conflicts with
the treaty secured rights to access certain reservation lands such as Tatoosh Island and Ozette, which are only accessible
by helicopter in the winter months, and to conduct aerial timber cruises and engage in helicopter logging on portions
of the reservation abutting the Sanctuary. Therefore the following amendment to  925.5(7) is proposed: 



Flying motorized aircraft at less than 1,000 feet above the Sanctuary within one nautical mile of the coastal boundary
of the Sanctuary and the Flattery Rocks, Quilleute Needles, and Copalis National Wildlife Refuges, except for valid
law enforcement purposes 

or where authorized by a governing body of an Indian Tribe to provide access to reservation lands.







Response:

 NOAA acknowledges the Tribes' concerns and does not intend to interfere with tribal rights to access reservation
lands. Also, for the reasons discussed below, the minimum altitude has been changed to 2000 ft. In order not to interfere
with Tribal access to reservation lands, the prohibition on flying has been changed to read: 



Flying motorized aircraft at less than 2,000 feet above the Sanctuary within one nautical mile of the Flattery Rocks,
Quillayute Needles, or Copalis National Wildlife Refuge, and within one nautical mile seaward from the coastal boundary
of the Sanctuary, except as necessary for valid law enforcement purposes, for activities related to tribal timber
operations conducted on reservation lands, or to transport persons or supplies to or from reservation lands as authorized
by a governing body of an Indian Tribe. 





Comment:

 NOAA should apply the management plan equally to tribal and non-tribal governmental entities within the adopted
boundary equally. 


Response:

 NOAA is legally bound to recognize treaty secured rights and has no intention to interfere with these rights. As such,
there will be circumstances in which Sanctuary regulations will apply to tribal and non-tribal members differently.



Issue: Vessel Traffic 




Comment:

 Route tankers and barges as far away from near-shore reefs and islands as possible. Clarify what types of vessels can
transit close to shore. 


Response:

 There exists a Cooperative Vessel Traffic Management System (CVTMS) established and jointly managed by the United
States and Canada. The CVTMS is a mandatory regime and consists of all navigable waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca
and its offshore approaches, southern Georgia Strait, the Gulf and San Juan Archipelagos, Rosario Strait, Boundary
Pass, Haro Strait, and Puget Sound, bounded on the west by longitude 147 
 W. latitude 48 
 N., and on the northeast by a line along 49 
 N. from Vancouver Island to Semiamoo Bay.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940511-0-00049 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940511-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The rules of the CVTMS are intended to enhance safe and expeditious vessel traffic movement, to prevent groundings
and collisions, and to minimize the risk of property damage and pollution to the marine environment. The rules apply
to: 

a. Each vessel of 30 meters or more in length; and 

b. Each vessel that is engaged in towing alongside or astern, or in pushing ahead, one or more objects, other than fishing
gear, where: 

(1) The combined length of the vessel towing, the towing apparatus, and the vessel or object towed is 45 meters or more;
or 

(2) The vessel or object towed is 20 meters or more in overall length. 

Both the Canadian and the United States Coast Guards are studying methods to improve the CVTMS in the area. Items being
studied include replacement of outdated equipment, elimination of gaps in coverage, and increasing operator training
and assignment length. 

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) requires the U.S. Coast Guard to conduct a national Tanker Free Zone Study. This
study is nearing completion and will recommend regulations requiring tank vessels to remain offshore during coastal
transits. 

Further, NOAA has recommended to the U.S. Coast Guard that an International Maritime Organization (IMO) approved
ATBA be established within the proposed Sanctuary boundary. This would request that vessels transporting hazardous
materials remain at least 25 nautical miles offshore while in the vicinity of Sanctuary waters or until making their
approach to the Strait of Juan de Fuca using the established CVTMS traffic separation scheme. Although ATBA's are
not compulsory for foreign flag vessels, a maritime state may make such an area compulsory for domestic vessels transiting
the waters under its jurisdiction. 



Comment:

 Clarify ``commercial vessel'' and distinguish between various sizes, uses, and types of vessels. 



Response:

 ``Commercial vessel'' means any vessel operating in return for payment or other type of compensation. Clarification
between sizes, uses, and types of vessels would require more space than is available in this document. Rather than
attempt to hold to a general definition of ``commercial vessel'', reference will be made to specific types of vessels,
i.e., tank vessels, bulk carriers, fishing vessels, pleasure craft, etc., wherever required. 



Comment:

 The Sanctuary boundary should be published on navigational charts. 



Response:

 NOAA agrees and will submit the Sanctuary boundary to the Nautical Charting Division of the National Ocean Service.
The boundary will be delineated on the next update of the appropriate navigational chart. 



Comment:

 Spill containment and cleanup measures should be part of appropriate mitigation requirements for vessels operating
within the Sanctuary. 



Response:

 OPA 90 mandates that tank vessel contingency plans be prepared for a worst-case discharge, and that vessel plans be
reviewed and approved by the U.S. Coast Guard. OPA 90 also stipulates that each responsible party for a vessel from
which oil is discharged, or which poses the substantial threat of a discharge of oil into or upon the navigable waters
or adjoining shorelines or the exclusive economic zone, is liable for the removal costs and damages resulting from
such an incident. 

Further, Washington State law (title 88 section 46 Revised Code of Washington) requires the owner or operator of a
tank vessel to prepare and submit an oil spill prevention plan prior to the vessel's entry into a Washington port. The
law also requires that each tank vessel, cargo vessel of greater than three hundred or more gross tons, or passenger
vessel of greater than three hundred or more gross tons have a contingency plan for the containment and cleanup of oil
spills from such vessel into the waters of the State. 



Comment:

 NOAA should provide a more complete explanation of how implementation of each of the regulations would put U.S. shipping
companies at an economic disadvantage in relation to foreign vessels. Precisely what would be the estimated cost
in dollars, time, inconvenience, and ultimate impact upon U.S. shipping companies.

Response:

 NOAA is promulgating no regulations that will adversely affect domestic vessels. 



Comment:

 NOAA should put forth a vessel traffic management plan, spearheaded by the U.S. Coast Guard, that addresses research
needs, vessel traffic monitoring and communication systems, and future regulatory alternatives. The management
plan should be proactive, and establish a timetable for considering new vessel traffic regulations in the future.




Response:

 NOAA is working with the U.S. Coast Guard, which has the primary authority for vessel traffic regulation, to determine
the need for additional measures to ensure protection of Sanctuary resources and qualities. In addition, NOAA will
work with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) and the EPA regarding vessel traffic activities resulting from the
transport of dredged material through the Sanctuary for disposal outside the Sanctuary. These consultations will
aim to determine which resources are most at risk, which vessel traffic practices are most threatening, and which
regulations or restrictions would be most appropriate to alleviate such risk. 

NOAA agrees that an improved vessel traffic monitoring and communication system along the coast is desirable. OPA
90 requires the Secretary of Transportation to complete a comprehensive study on the impact of installation, expansion,
or improvement of vessel traffic servicing systems. NOAA will work with the State of Washington's OMS, the U.S. Coast
Guard, and appropriate public agencies during the development of these monitoring studies to determine an appropriate
system for the Sanctuary and the need for any additional site-specific protective measures. 

Vessel traffic monitoring and research and coordination on this subject have been incorporated into the Sanctuary
management plan. 



Comment:

 Allow only double-hulled vessels in the Sanctuary. 



Response:

 OPA 90 establishes double hull requirements for tank vessels. Most tank vessels over 5,000 gross tons will be required
to have double hulls by 2010. Vessels under 5,000 gross tons will be required to have a double hull or a double containment
system by 2015. All newly constructed tankers must have a double hull (or double containment system if under 5,000
gross tons), while existing vessels are phased out over a period of years. 

As previously stated, the U.S. Coast Guard is completing a study of a tanker free zone where tank vessels would be required
to remain offshore during coastal transits. Further, a proposal to establish an ATBA within the Sanctuary boundary
has been developed and will be submitted to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for approval at the earliest
possible date which, in accordance with IMO's procedures, is June, 1994. Both actions will serve to ensure that hazardous
material laden vessels will remain an appropriate distance offshore. 



Comment:

 Require vessels to have a pilot aboard. 



Response:

 Requirements for pilots are set forth in both Federal and state regulations. NOAA will monitor and review vessel traffic
in the Sanctuary and make recommendations to the appropriate regulatory agencies, state and Federal, regarding
the need for additional pilotage requirements. Pilotage is currently compulsory for all vessels except those under
enrollment or engaged exclusively in the coasting trade on the West Coast of the continental United States (including
Alaska) and/or British Columbia. Port Angeles has been designated as the pilotage station for all vessels enroute
to or from the sea. 

OPA 90 requires the U.S. Coast Guard to designate U.S. waters where a second licensed officer must be on the bridge of
a coastwise seagoing tanker over 1,600 gross tons. Under the Ports and Waterways Safety Act, the U.S. Coast Guard also
is proposing to require a second officer on foreign flag tankers over 1,600 gross tons and on U.S. registered tankers
over 1,600 gross tons. 



Comment:

 Establish a tonnage limit within three nautical miles of shore except for those making a port call. 



Response:

 All types of vessels and traffic patterns will be reviewed by NOAA, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the State of Washington
OMS to determine any appropriate action to be taken. In conducting this review, attention will be paid to vessel type,
cargo carried, and vessel size.

Comment:

 Require all vessels to have English speaking bridge personnel. 




Response:

 All vessels required to participate in the Juan de Fuca region CVTMS are required to make all reports in English. 




Comment:

 Curtail traffic during poor weather conditions. 




Response:

 NOAA will work with the state, U.S. Coast Guard, and appropriate public agencies to determine the need for further
vessel traffic regulations to specifically address vessel traffic during adverse weather conditions. 


During conditions of vessel congestion, adverse weather, reduced visibility, or other hazardous circumstances
in the area of the Juan de Fuca Region CVTMS, the Cooperative Vessel Traffic Management Center may issue directions
to control and supervise traffic. They may also specify times when vessels may enter, move within or through, or depart
from ports, harbors, or other waters of the CVTMS Zone. 


Further, the U.S. Coast Guard's Navigation Rules, International and Inland, speak specifically to the conduct of
vessels while at sea. Rule 6 of the International and Inland Steering and Sailing Rules states that ``Every vessel
shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that she can take proper and effective action to avoid collision and be stopped
within a distance appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions.'' 




Comment:

 Prohibit engine powered water craft of any type. 




Response:

 A fundamental objective of the sanctuary program is ``to facilitate, to the extent compatible with the primary objective
of resource protection, all public and private uses of the resources of these marine areas not prohibited pursuant
to other authorities'' (16 U.S.C. 1431(b)(5)). NOAA will consider the threats from all types of vessels_power driven,
sailing, or paddle propelled_as a continuing analysis of vessel traffic within the sanctuary boundaries. 




Comment:

 Manage the off-loading or exchange of cargo or oil. 




Response:

 No offloading or exchange of oil occurs within the boundary of the Sanctuary. This activity generally occurs in ports
which are located outside of the Sanctuary boundary. Further, this type of activity is addressed by both OPA 90 and
programs being established by the recently created Washington State OMS. 




Comment:

 Prohibit shipment of reclaimed spent nuclear fuel from foreign reactors through the Sanctuary. 




Response:

 As previously noted, NOAA has recommended to the U.S. Coast Guard that an IMO approved ATBA be established within the
Sanctuary boundary. This would require vessels transporting hazardous materials to remain at least 25 nautical
miles offshore while in the vicinity of Sanctuary waters or until making their approach to the Strait of Juan de Fuca
using the established CVTMS traffic separation scheme. 


NOAA will also work with the State of Washington's OMS and both the U.S. and Canadian Coast Guards to be informed of,
and alerted to, in a timely and regular manner, all hazardous cargo carriers transiting near Sanctuary waters. Further,
through participation in regular meetings of the Washington State Regional Marine Safety Committees and discussions
with the U. S. Coast Guard, NOAA will ensure that contingency plans adequately address such transport issues. 




Comment:

 Prohibit commercial vessel anchorages within the Sanctuary, particularly off Makah Bay, except in emergencies.





Response:

 The use of the Makah Bay anchorage by vessels waiting either for an available pilot at Port Angeles or instructions
from their home office, has been examined. Currently, its use as a temporary anchorage has been agreed upon by both
the U.S. and Canadian Coast Guards. This is viewed as a more favorable alternative than having such vessels continuously
underway within, and off the entrances to, the Strait. Vessels at anchor are subject to MARPOL, U.S. Federal law, and
Sanctuary regulations regarding discharges. The use of this anchorage is monitored by Tofino Vessel Traffic Service
which can also educate such vessels regarding the Sanctuary and its regulations.

Comment:

 Clarify NOAA's authority to regulate vessel traffic within State of Washington waters. 




Response:

 Section 303 of the MPRSA gives NOAA the authority to promulgate regulations to implement the designation, including
regulations necessary to achieve resource protection. 




Comment:

 The State and Federal government have appropriated $75 million to expand and enhance maritime activity at Grays Harbor
through waterway dredging and port terminal development programs. If vessel traffic is restricted, one branch of
the government would be defeating the purpose of other parts of the government. 




Response:

 NOAA has studied vessel traffic along the Washington coast. The result of the analysis was the recommendation for
the previously mentioned ATBA. This proposal, if adopted, would add approximately 17 nautical miles on a transit
from Grays Harbor to the entrance of the Straits of Juan de Fuca and approximately 21 nautical miles on a transit from
the entrance of the Straits to Grays Harbor. In comparison to the costs of cleanup, legal fees, liability, fines, loss
of cargo, and vessel and environmental damages, the proposals to establish the ATBA seem reasonable. 




Comment:

 Double-hulled proposals are not economically sensible in the foreseeable future. 




Response:

 Congress has mandated (OPA 90) national double hull requirements for tank vessels. 



Issue: Overflights 





Comment:

 Establish the boundary for overflights at the beach rather than one (1) mile inland. 




Response:

 The boundary for overflights is at the shoreline and not one (1) mile inland. 




Comment:

 Establish a 2,500 foot minimum flight altitude over the sanctuary. 




Response:

 To be consonant with current regulations regarding flights over charted National Park Service Areas, U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service Areas, and U.S. Forest Service Areas, NOAA is prohibiting the flying of motorized aircraft at less
than 2,000 feet above the Sanctuary within one nautical mile of the Flattery Rocks, Quillayute Needles, or Copalis
National Wildlife Refuge, and at less than 2,000 feet above the Sanctuary within one nautical mile seaward from the
coastal boundary of the Sanctuary, except as necessary for valid law enforcement purposes, for activities related
to tribal timber operations conducted on reservation lands, or to transport persons or supplies to or from reservation
lands as authorized by a governing body of an Indian Tribe. NOAA will work with the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) on how best to reflect this limitation on aeronautical charts. 




Comment:

 Permit search and rescue at all times by whatever aircraft is needed to accomplish the task. 




Response:

 The prohibitions set forth in the Sanctuary regulations do not apply to activities necessary to respond to emergencies
threatening life, property, or the environment pursuant to  925.5(c) of the regulations. Thus, in any emergency,
search and rescue aircraft are allowed to perform whatever tasks are required within the Sanctuary boundary. 




Comment:

 When necessary to bring a research flight into the area below the Sanctuary prescribed ceiling, regulations should
require the plane's engine be kept at or below a reasonable decibel level as heard from the ground. 




Response:

 FAA regulations (14 CFR part 36) codify noise standards for aircraft operating within U.S. airspace. Adherence to
these standards is already required. When research is to be conducted within the Sanctuary boundary, aircraft operators
will be required to obtain a permit and conduct such research in such a manner so as to minimize disturbance yet remain
within safe aircraft operating parameters. 




Issue: Living Resource Extraction 




Fishing 






Comment:

 NOAA should not restrict access to fishing grounds or catch-ability. Crab fishing and razor clam digging must be allowed.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940511-0-00053 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940511-0-00015 </PARENT>

Response:

 The regulation of fishing is not authorized by the Designation Document. NOAA has determined that existing fishery
management authorities are adequate to address fishery resource issues. As with all other fisheries that occur within
the Sanctuary, crab fishing and razor clam digging remain under the regulatory authority of existing Federal, state,
tribal and regional fishery authorities. NOAA does not view fishing as contrary to the goals of the Sanctuary. The
sanctuary program is by law mandated ``to facilitate to the extent compatible with the primary objective of resource
protection, all public and private uses of the resources * * * .'' (including fishing) (16
U.S.C. 1431(b)(5)). 

Existing fishery management agencies are primarily concerned with the regulation and management of fish stocks
for a healthy fishery. In contrast, the National Marine Sanctuary Program has a different and broader mandate under
the MPRSA to protect all Sanctuary resources on an ecosystem-wide basis. Thus, while fishery agencies may be concerned
about certain fishing efforts and techniques in relation to fish stock abundance and distribution, the Marine Sanctuary
Program is also concerned about the potential incidental impacts of specific fishery techniques on all Sanctuary
resources including benthic habitats or marine mammals as well as the role the target species plays in the health of
the ecosystem. In the case of the Olympic Coast, fish resources are already extensively managed by existing authorities
and NOAA does not envision a fishery management role for the Sanctuary Program. Accordingly, fishing activities
have not been included in the list of activities in the Designation Document subject to regulation as part of the Sanctuary
regime. However, the Sanctuary Program will provide research results and recommendations to existing fishery management
agencies in order to enhance the protection of fishery and other resources within the Sanctuary. 



Comment:

 No additional fisheries management or regulation is needed in the Sanctuary. Commercial, recreation, and subsistence
fishing can be compatible with sanctuary designation, and the existing regulatory framework is adequate at this
time. 



Response:

 See response to previous comment. The Designation Document places kelp harvesting within the scope of future regulation
since there is no existing management plan for kelp harvesting. 



Comment:

 Clarify the language associated with commercial fishing practices near sunken vessels, rocks and reefs in the proposed
sanctuary to insure continuance of historical and customary fishing practices. Existing Federal and state regulations
adequately protect archeological treasures, man-made reefs, and natural rock and reef formations. The FEIS should
acknowledge and permit prevailing practices. 



Response:

 Commercial fishing vis-a-vis historical resources is an exempted activity under the prohibition against disturbance
of historical resources. However, the exemption is only for incidental disturbance and therefore does not allow
deliberate disturbance. 



Comment:

 Fishing should either be regulated, or placed in the scope of regulation, because there may be a time in the 
future when fishing needs to be regulated by the Sanctuary. 



Response:

 NOAA believes that existing authorities are adequate to regulate fishing. Should the need arise to regulate fishing
as part of the Sanctuary management regime, the Designation Document could be amended. 



Comment:

 Proposed regulations should result in the gradual reduction of fishing, aquaculture, kelp harvesting and waterfowl
hunting to insure that no commercial activity threatens the integrity of any resources in the proposed Sanctuary.
Some commenters believed that the Sanctuary should ban all commercial fishing activities except Native American
fishing activities. 



Response:

 A blanket reduction of resource-use activities across the Sanctuary could not be imposed without credible evidence
that each resource affected is threatened by a population decrease or stock failure. Absent such evidence, the Act
requires that existing uses be facilitated to the extent compatible with the primary objective of resource protection.




Comment:

 True refugia should be established where all consumptive uses are prohibited for a period of time. 



Response:

 The determination of whether refugia are established in the Sanctuary will be done in coordination with the NMFS,
PFMC, Washington Department of Fisheries (WDF), the tribes, environmental groups, and industry. The Sanctuary
Advisory Committee (SAC) will be an important forum to address this issue. If, in coordination with other governmental
agencies, it is determined that establishment of refugia is a desirable alternative, NOAA will analyze the alternative
through the preparation of an environmental impact statement/management plan and solicitation of public input
pursuant to the NEPA and the APA.

Comment:

 Driftnets, trawling, and all dragnet fisheries should be banned from the proposed Sanctuary as inconsistent with
the regulation prohibiting alteration of, or construction on, the seabed. 



Response:

 The only net gear used in fisheries in the Sanctuary are trolling gear (for salmon) and trawling gear (for groundfish).
The regulatory prohibition on altering the seabed includes an exception for incidental disturbance resulting from
traditional fishing operations. NMFS has conducted a limited study of the impact of trawl gear on the benthos and has
not identified any resulting systematic destruction. However, the regulations could be modified to regulate any
activity that is shown to cause significant disturbance of the seabed. This reflects adherence to the MPRSA's goals
of preserving natural and human-use qualities of a marine area. 

High-seas driftnets, defined as nets greater than 1.5 miles long, have been banned pursuant to United Nations resolution
46/215. While gillnets and setnets are currently used in the inland waters of the State of Washington, they are not
used in Sanctuary waters. 



Comment:

 NOAA should facilitate the regulation of resource extraction within the Sanctuary under a regulatory framework
that is controlled by a single agency. 



Response:

 Regulatory authority over resources and resource extraction industries is expressly granted by state and Federal
statute. NOAA does not have the primary regulatory authority over resource extraction. NOAA can act to coordinate
the various regulators and can impose additional regulations, but cannot reassign itself or other agencies regulatory
authority. 



Comment:

 NOAA must clarify and acknowledge all tribal treaty fishing rights in the FEIS/MP, and the interaction of Sanctuary
regulations with the right of tribes to fish in their Usual and Accustomed fishing areas. 



Response:

 This issue is clarified in the Designation Document and in Part II (under Socio-Demographic profile and Land Use).
In addition, the coastal tribe's treaty rights are acknowledged in several sections of the regulations. 



Comment:

 The entire study area must be considered as a ``fishing area'' since fish migrate along the entire Washington coast.




Response:

 NOAA recognizes that fish ``know no boundaries in the sea.'' The fishing areas identified in the FEIS/MP only represent
known locations where certain fishery activity is concentrated. The fishing areas displayed in the FEIS/MP are not
related to regulatory jurisdiction in any way. They are simplified visual aids to complement the discussion of resources
off the coast of Washington. 



Aquaculture 





Comment:

 Clarify NOAA's intention to regulate, condition, or prohibit aquaculture activities throughout the Sanctuary
and adjacent to Indian reservations. 



Response:

 The Sanctuary regulations do not directly prohibit aquaculture operations within the Sanctuary boundary. However,
discharge of matter into the Sanctuary, or alteration of or construction on the seabed in connection with aquaculture
activities are prohibited. It is unlikely that permits would be granted for aquaculture activities in the Sanctuary
that violate these prohibitions. This determination is based upon U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) guidance related
to permits for fish pen mariculture operations, which prohibits fish farms in Federal natural resource areas, such
as national seashores, wilderness areas, wildlife refuges, parks or other areas designated for similar purposes
(e.g., national marine sanctuaries). 



Comment:

 NOAA should change the proposed regulation governing alteration of or construction on the seabed to ``maintenance
and development of approved aquaculture operations'', and strike ``existing prior to the effective date of these
regulations.'' Eliminating future aquaculture development off the Olympic Coast would preclude opportunities
for both private shellfish and finfish production and for public enhancement. Technology is being developed which
would result in minimal environmental imbalance, and would afford employment for regional communities. 



Response:

 See response to previous comment. 



Comment:

 The Sanctuary should not regulate aquaculture activities because there are sufficient regulations in place.

Comment:

 The Sanctuary should provide mutually agreed upon requirements for aquaculture activities among the oyster growers
of Willapa Bay. 


Response:

 The boundary of the Sanctuary does not include Willapa Bay. 


Comment:

 The discussion in the FEIS/MP on the impacts of aquaculture needs to be expanded and the proposal to not regulate aquaculture
in the Sanctuary should be re-assessed. The FEIS/MP needs to address the use of drugs in farm-raised fish. 


Response:

 The discussion of aquaculture within the Sanctuary is intended only to evaluate the current status of the industry
in the study area_it is not intended to measure aggregate impacts. The request for expanded discussion of resources
does not identify specific issues of discussion. A reassessment of aquaculture vis-a-vis the Sanctuary reveals
that the industry is adequately regulated by existing state and Federal requirements. However, any discharges from
such operations into the Sanctuary would be prohibited. The Sanctuary has no jurisdiction over the use of drugs in
aquaculture_such determinations are under the purview of the Washington State Department of Health (WDH) and the
Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 


Comment:

 All aquaculture should be banned from within the Sanctuary. 


Response:

 See responses to previous comments regarding aquaculture. 


Comment:

 Kelp harvesting should be banned or regulated within the Sanctuary. 


Response:

 At present there is no kelp harvesting within the Sanctuary. While kelp harvesting was proposed to be included within
the scope of activities listed in the Designation Document as subject to potential regulation under the Sanctuary
Program, the final Designation Document does not list kelp harvesting. Kelp is only found within the state waters
of the Sanctuary. Because the Washington Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has promulgated regulations for
the management of kelp which should adequately protect the kelp, NOAA does not believe it necessary to list kelp as
being subject to potential Sanctuary Program regulation. If the state regulations do not adequately protect the
kelp within the Sanctuary, the Sanctuary Designation Document could be amended following the same procedures used
to promulgate this Designation Document to authorize the regulation of kelp. 

Issue: Marine Mammals, Sea Turtles and Seabirds 




Comment:

 Clarify ``takings''. The prohibition on the taking of marine mammals and seabirds within the Sanctuary is redundant
with the ESA, the MMPA and the MBTA, and what further impact it will have on the fishing community. 


Response:

 ``Taking'' is defined in section 925.3 of the regulations to mean: (1) For any marine mammal, sea turtle or seabird
listed as either endangered or threatened pursuant to the ESA to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap,
capture, collect or injure, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct and, (2) for any other marine mammal, sea turtle,
or seabird, the term means to harass, hunt, capture, kill, collect or injure, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct.
While marine mammals, seabirds and endangered and threatened species are protected under the MMPA, ESA and MBTA,
NOAA believes that the higher penalties afforded under the MPRSA will provide a stronger deterrent. 


The MBTA sets maximum criminal fines at either $500 or $2,000 per violation, depending on the violation. The MMPA sets
maximum civil penalties at $10,000 and maximum criminal fines at $20,000. The ESA sets maximum civil penalties at
$500, $12,000 or $25,000 per violation, depending on the violation; maximum criminal fines are set at $50,000. (All
three statutes also provide for imprisonment for criminal violations.)

Section 307 of the MPRSA allows NOAA to assess civil penalties as high as $100,000 for each violation. In addition,
monies collected under the MPRSA are available for use by the National Marine Sanctuary Program. 



Comment:

 The MBTA would not allow any taking of migratory birds in the sanctuary, thus providing even stronger prohibition
than sanctuary status can provide. 



Response:

 See above response. Section 925.5(a)(6) of the Sanctuary regulations prohibits the taking of migratory birds within
the Sanctuary. Including a prohibition on ``taking'' marine birds in the Sanctuary regulations allows such violations
to be subject to the civil penalties authorized by the MPRSA which far exceed those authorized by the MBTA. 


Comment:

 Prohibit all takings of marine mammals and seabirds, regardless of military or fishing exemptions. 


Response:

 Section 925.5(a)(6) of the Sanctuary regulations prohibits the taking of marine mammals and seabirds in or above
the Sanctuary except as authorized by the NMFS or the United States Fish and Wildlife Service under the authority of
the MMPA, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 1361 

et seq.,

 the ESA, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.,

 and the MBTA, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 703 

et seq.,

 or pursuant to any treaty with an Indian tribe to which the United States is a party, provided that the treaty right is
exercised in accordance with the MMPA, ESA, and MBTA, to the extent that they apply. Exemptions include a limited five-year
incidental take of marine mammals provided by interim regulations promulgated pursuant to the MMPA, which are in
effect until October, 1993. The ESA also has a limited incidental take exemption. See 16 U.S.C. section 1539(a)(2)B(i).
NMFS, in conjunction with environmental groups and the fishing industry, is developing a permanent management regime
to be implemented upon expiration of the MMPA interim regulations. 


If in the future NOAA determines that the existing regulations promulgated under MMPA, ESA, MBTA or any other state
or Federal statute are not adequate to ensure the coordinated and comprehensive management of marine mammals and
seabirds, changes to the Sanctuary regulations would be undertaken in accordance with the requirements of the MPRSA,
NEPA and APA. 


Comment:

 Exclude from [takings] prohibition birds considered game. 


Response:

 The only birds  925.5(a)(6) prohibits the taking of are seabirds_seabirds are not considered game species.



Comment:

 Section 925.5(a)(6) of the proposed regulations would prohibit the taking of marine mammals or seabirds unless affirmatively
permitted by regulations promulgated under authority of the ESA, MMPA, or MBTA. Because these regulations do not
expressly permit any takings by treaty Indians, the proposed sanctuary regulations would effectively prohibit
the Makah Tribe from exercising their treaty rights to take marine mammals. The proposed regulations would also hinder
the tribe's ability to exercise its fishing rights by precluding fisheries which result in the incidental taking
of marine mammals and seabirds. 


The DEIS/MP offers no conservation justification for imposing restrictions on the taking of marine mammals and seabirds
which go beyond the restrictions imposed by the ESA and MMPA. The DEIS/MP concedes that the purpose of the proposed
sanctuary regulations is 

not

 to protect particular species from extinction. According to the DEIS, the purpose of these additional prohibitions
in the proposed regulations is to ``extend protection for sanctuary resources on an environmentally holistic basis.''
This goal does not permit infringement of treaty rights. Therefore, the regulations should be amended by adding ``or
in accordance with any treaty to which the United States is a party.'' 


Response:

 The regulatory prohibitions do not abrogate or obstruct any rights under an existing treaty. The regulations have
been changed by adding ``or pursuant to any treaty with an Indian tribe to which the United States is a party, provided
that the treaty right is exercised in accordance with the MMPA, ESA and MBTA, to the extent that they apply.'' The treaty
between the Makah Tribe and the United States explicitly assures the ``right of taking fish and of whaling or sealing
at usual accustomed grounds and stations.'' (Article 4, Treaty of Neah Bay, 1855). 

Incidental takes of marine mammals can legally occur under permit and exemption provisions of the MMPA. Currently,
Washington coastal tribes apply for and receive exemption certificates from NMFS for the incidental taking of marine
mammals during fishing. Fees for this exemption are waived for tribes. 


Further, tribes cannot be denied entry into any fishery based on the likelihood or occurrence of seabird or marine
mammal takings. 


Comment:

 Change the wording of the regulation to read ``as authorized or permitted by NMFS or [the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]
USFWS under the authority of the MMPA and ESA.'' NMFS suggests that the preamble and/or regulations clarify that Sanctuary
permits will not be required for activities authorized or permitted by NMFS or USFWS under MMPA or ESA. Such clarification
would relieve many concerns over the possibility of overlapping and potentially duplicative permitting requirements.

Response:

 NOAA has amended the regulation by adding ``as authorized by the National Marine Fisheries Service or the United States
Fish and Wildlife Service under the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, as amended, (MMPA), 16 U.S.C. 1361


et seq.

, the Endangered Species Act, as amended, (ESA), 16 U.S.C. 1531

Issue: Sanctuary Administration 




Regulations/Permits 






Comment:

 NOAA should use economic incentives rather than regulations to ensure that activities do not impact resources. 




Response:

 NOAA does not have sufficient authority to provide economic incentives to ensure that activities do not impact Sanctuary
resources. Even regulations, which include economic disincentives such as monetary penalties, are not sufficient
to ensure that any activity does not impact resources. 




Comment:

 Clarify the statement: ``When a conflict with a sanctuary regulation related to specific [non-sanctuary] regulations
occurs, the one more protective of sanctuary resources will prevail.'' NOAA regulations should not override those
of the local jurisdictions. NOAA needs to clarify: 

(1) The application of this policy to fishing; 

(2) Types of conflicts the statement applies to; 

(3) Who determines whether a conflict exists; and 

(4) The process for resolving a conflict. 




Response:

 NOAA agrees that the statement as written in the DEIS/MP is unclear. Accordingly, the statement has been deleted in
the FEIS/MP. Essentially, the statement meant that if two regulations exist covering an activity in the Sanctuary,
one promulgated by NOAA under the MPRSA authority and the other by another agency under a different statute, compliance
with the less restrictive regulation will not relieve the obligation to comply with the other more restrictive one.





Comment:

 NOAA should follow the guidelines of NEPA when proposing any change in regulations that are listed in the scope of regulations.
This is especially applicable to vessel traffic and discharge regulations. Also, clarification is needed on the
rulemaking and amendment processes. 




Response:

 Listing activities in the scope of regulation reflects that the issues and alternatives were addressed in the FEIS/MP,
public hearings were held, and public comments were solicited regarding the activities. If NOAA later proposes the
regulation of an activity listed in the scope of regulations in the Designation Document but not regulated at the time
of Sanctuary designation, NOAA will request public comments on the proposal. When NOAA plans to amend a rule that has
been promulgated, an analysis of the issues, affected environment, alternatives and consequences will be completed
and public comments solicited. NOAA will then modify the proposal if necessary and respond to public comments when
taking the final action. 




Comment:

 A procedure must be established to disagree with management and issue an appeal if permits to conduct research are
denied. 




Response:

 Section 925.12 of the Sanctuary regulations set forth the procedures for appealing denials of Sanctuary permits.
The appeal process involves a written statement by the appellant to the Assistant Administrator of NOAA. The Assistant
Administrator may conduct a hearing on the appeal. 




Comment:

 Clarify the procedure for obtaining permits for low-flying aircraft engaged in ongoing species monitoring studies
and damage assessment studies in response to an incident such as an oil spill. Activities authorized by the NMFS and
USFWS should not require a Sanctuary permit because the requirements for permits would be duplicative. 




Response:

 All flights engaged in monitoring or research activities that fly below 2,000 feet are required to obtain a Sanctuary
permit, or, if the activity is already pursuant to a permit, to have that permit certified. Permits are not required
for overflights necessary to respond to emergencies threatening life, property or the environment. 




Comment:

 NOAA should not grandfather existing uses if otherwise prohibited by sanctuary regulations. 




Response:

 Section 304(c)(1)(B) of the MPRSA specifies that NOAA may not terminate any valid lease, permit, license, or right
of subsistence use or of access, if the lease, permit, license, or right ``is in existence on the date of designation
of any national marine sanctuary * * *.'' 




Comment:

 Treaty secured rights should not require sanctuary certification. Further, NOAA should obligate federal regulators
to consider and protect tribal interests when issuing permits which may affect those interests.

Response:

 Treaty secured rights do not require certification by the Sanctuary program pursuant to  925.5(g). NOAA agrees
that pursuant to its trust responsibility to the tribes, it should consider and protect tribal interests when issuing
permits. Therefore,   925.9 and 925.11 have been modified accordingly. While NOAA as a trustee urges
all other Federal agencies to consider and protect tribal interests, it does not have the legal authority to require
other Federal agencies to consider and protect tribal interests when issuing permits pursuant to other regulatory
authorities. 




Comment:

 The regulations, exemptions and authority to place conditions on existing permitted activities are unclear. 




Response:

 Section 304(c)(2) of the MPRSA provides NOAA with the right to regulate the exercise of a lease, permit, license, or
right of subsistence use or of access existing on the effective date of Sanctuary designation. 




Comment:

 Sanctuary management should be formally coordinated with tribal regulatory and law enforcement authorities through
cooperative agreements. 




Response:

 Cooperative agreements will be developed as necessary between NOAA and the tribes regarding regulatory and law enforcement
activities. 




Comment:

 The Sanctuary should offer increased enforcement which should be conducted by Sanctuary personnel rather than the
U.S. Coast Guard. Clarify the enforcement procedures. 




Response:

 There will be enforcement of Sanctuary regulations through cooperative agreements with the U.S. Coast Guard, NMFS,
WDF, the coastal tribes, USFWS, and the National Park Service (NPS). Considering fiscal constraints, level of use,
and availability of enforcement personnel working in the field already, NOAA has determined that it is not a high immediate
priority to hire Sanctuary enforcement personnel. The Sanctuary must first become fully staffed and operational,
and a determination must be made whether additional enforcement personnel are needed. The enforcement procedures
will be determined pursuant to the cooperative agreements that are established. 




Comment:

 The broad scope of the discharge prohibition will require a well-coordinated enforcement operation to monitor all
discharge and disposal activities from sources on land as well as in offshore, coastal and inland waters over large
areas outside of the Sanctuary boundary. It may be impossible to determine the origin of discharges or deposits found
in the Sanctuary after the dumping activity has occurred. 




Response:

 The prohibition on discharges from outside the boundary relates to discharges that enter and injure Sanctuary resources.
NOAA must establish that discharges not only enter, but injure the resources before enforcement actions will be taken.
It will, therefore be desirable for NOAA to undertake a comprehensive monitoring program by which it can determine
ecosystem health and use impacts. 




Comment:

 NOAA should impose unlimited liability for spills extended to shipping companies and firms providing original source
materials involved in polluting activities. 




Response:

 NOAA is permitted to seek penalties of up to $100,000 per day for a violation pursuant to section 307(c)(1) of the MPRSA
(16 U.S.C. 1437(c)(1)), and for natural resource damages pursuant to section 312 of the MPRSA (16 U.S.C. 1443). 




Transboundary Coordination 






Comment:

 NOAA should coordinate with other Federal and Canadian authorities to regulate vessel traffic, reduce the risk of
oil spills, and eliminate oil and gas drilling in Canadian waters adjacent to the proposed sanctuary. NOAA should
encourage an adjacent sanctuary along the west coast of Vancouver Island. 




Response:

 NOAA agrees and is working with the Canadian Coast Guard, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Washington OMS to reduce the risk
of oil spills. The regulation of vessel traffic will currently remain with the U.S. and Canadian Coast Guards and the
OMS. NOAA will support any Canadian initiative to designate a marine protected area in Canadian waters on the Pacific
Coast. 




Beach Management Policies 






Comment:

 NOAA should grandfather in the existing beach management policies including allowable beach driving activities.

Response:

 The boundary of the Sanctuary does not encompass beaches where beach driving is permitted. 



Advisory Committee/Decision Making 





Comment:

 NOAA and the State of Washington should work together to determine the composition of the Sanctuary Advisory Committee
(SAC). The SAC should include representatives from private landowners, local industry, the county and tribes. The
SAC should be based at the local level to oversee operations and help maintain strong local input. 



Response:

 NOAA will work with local user and interest groups and state and local governments to obtain broad representation
on the SAC. The law limits the SAC to no more than 15 members. 



Comment:

 The SAC should have the power to direct the Sanctuary manger and set priorities for funding. The SAC decisions should
be binding. If the decisions are not binding, then the manager should at least provide a rationale for any actions taken
which are directly contrary to the recommendations of the SAC. 



Response:

 The SAC recommendations to the manager will be instrumental in guiding the manager with respect to prioritizing actions.
If the manager chooses not to pursue the recommendations of the SAC, a rationale will be provided to the members of the
SAC. 



Comment:

 One of the first tasks of the SAC should be to review 
and update the State of Washington's coastal zone management 
program to ensure consistency with the Sanctuary management plan. 
The Sanctuary management plan goals and objectives should also be 
reviewed. 



Response:

 Prior to designation, the State of Washington will 
review the FEIS/MP as part of its consistency determination as it 
relates to Washington's approved coastal zone management program. 
The WDOE has jurisdiction for the Shoreline Management Act. The 
SAC will not share that jurisdiction, rather, the SAC will be 
responsible for reviewing the Sanctuary management plan goals and 
objectives. The SAC's first priority will be to help determine 
the five-year Sanctuary operating plan establishing priorities 
for education, research, monitoring, facilities siting and 
administration. 



Miscellaneous 





Comment:

 Firearms should be controlled or banned within the 
Sanctuary. 



Response:

 Possession and use of firearms is regulated by 
State law for public safety purposes. The primary purpose of 
Sanctuary designation is resource protection. 



Management Alternatives/Strategies 





Comment:

 The administrative models being discussed in the 
Northwest Straits proposal should be considered. 



Response:

 The administrative model identifying NOAA as the 
lead agency in managing the sanctuary with guidance and 
assistance from the SAC (which will represent State and local 
interests) will be implemented in the Olympic Coast National 
Marine Sanctuary. The administrative model which involves joint 
administration between NOAA and the State of Washington was not 
considered for the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary 
because the Sanctuary is predominately in Federal waters. One 
model suggested for the proposed Northwest Straits National 
Marine Sanctuary focuses on joint administration because the 
Sanctuary would be located entirely within State waters. NOAA 
will work closely with the state and counties and other Federal 
agencies in the administration of the Olympic Coast National 
Marine Sanctuary. 



Comment:

 The management plan needs to account for tribal 
sovereignty and jurisdiction with respect to cultural resources, 
law enforcement and research practices. NOAA needs to recognize 
the need to coordinate with each tribal entity in the same manner 
as with the state and its management agencies. 



Response:

 NOAA acknowledges the importance of tribal 
sovereignty. Nothing in the designation will impact the treaty 
rights of the coastal tribes. NOAA will consult closely with the 
tribes on any action that may potentially impact tribal rights or 
interests. 



Comment:

 NOAA should choose management plan alternative 1 which 
proposes to gradually phase in program activities and staffing. 
Staff could be co-located with another Federal agency in Port 
Angeles, with satellite sites in Klaloch or La Push. National 
concerns with fiscal restraint support this choice. 

Some commenters supported management plan alternative 2 which 
proposes to set up the sanctuary headquarters and immediately 
provide full-staffing. Sanctuary headquarters should be located 
on the coast. The former Makah Air Force Station is one possible 
location. 



Response:

 NOAA is experiencing the fiscal constraints that 
all Federal programs are experiencing. NOAA proposes to balance 
the needs for resource protection and fiscal restraint by phasing 
in staffing and maximizing cooperative relationships with other 
agencies and jurisdictions working in the area (e.g., NPS, U.S. 
Coast Guard, the tribes, and the USFWS) to implement the 
management plan. The Sanctuary manager will have an office on 
the Olympic Coast with administrative support facilities in 
Seattle. 



Comment:

 Implementation of the final management plan must be 
adequately funded in order to prevent pollution and resource 
damage.

Response:

 The level of funding for the first year after 
Sanctuary designation will depend upon the Sanctuary Program's 
funding which is authorized and appropriated by Act of Congress. 
However, the reality of the program's funding situation will 
require the manager and SAC to identify alternative sources of 
funding for Sanctuary programs. 



Comment:

 A volunteer program, coordinated by a full-time 
volunteer coordinator, should be established to assist in 
implementation of the management plan. 



Response:

 NOAA agrees that the establishment of a 
volunteer program can assist in implementation of the management 
plan. The SAC will be influential in determining the priority of 
hiring a volunteer coordinator. 



Comment:

 The management alternatives should more accurately 
describe NOAA's comprehensive planning as implemented through a 
combination of legal management authority over certain specific 
Sanctuary activities and advisory coordination with other 
entities managing the remaining essential components. 



Response:

 NOAA agrees. The FEIS/MP outlines the regulations 
which NOAA is promulgating. The FEIS/MP also outlines the role of 
the SAC, whose composition is aimed at enhancing the coordination 
with other entities with management jurisdiction in the 
Sanctuary. 



Comment:

 The Sanctuary manager should have a great deal of 
responsibility for setting the Sanctuary budget, as well as 
assigning funds to local governments for assistance in 
implementing management plans. 



Response:

 The Sanctuary manager will have primary 
responsibility for recommending the Sanctuary budget to 
headquarters. The Sanctuaries and Reserves Division has 
responsibility for the entire National Marine Sanctuary Program 
budget, and will work with the site manager to develop the annual 
program budget. The manager has the discretion to earmark funds 
to local governments or groups to implement Sanctuary programs. 



Comment:

 Zoning plans should be implemented which accommodate 
the varying resource management needs within the Sanctuary. Some 
zoning examples include allowing for the needs of ports to the 
south, designating areas which would be closed to all consumptive 
uses on a rotating basis, and zoning specific areas within the 
sanctuary for the sole purposes of research, recreational use, 
commercial use and no use. 



Response:

 Zoning is not anticipated as part of the FEIS/MP 
for the Sanctuary. If NOAA, in consultation with the SAC, 
believes that zoning would better meet the needs of the program, 
the management plan and regulations can be amended in accordance 
with the requirements of the MPRSA, the NEPA and the APA.

Research/Education Protocol 




Comment:

 Research results and data should be shared through 
existing databases with Federal and state agencies and tribes. 
The sharing of data should be formalized through cooperative 
agreements. 


Response:

 NOAA agrees that research results and data should 
be shared and will pursue appropriate cooperative agreements to 
ensure this coordination. 


Comment:

 It is unnecessary to severely restrict or eliminate 
activities such as fishing, commercial vessel activity, dredging 
and aircraft operation in order to carry out the Sanctuary goals 
of promoting research and public education. 


Response:

 The primary goal of sanctuary designation is the 
comprehensive long-term protection of marine resources. Some 
restrictions are necessary to accomplish this goal. Of the above 
activities, only dredging is being eliminated within the 
Sanctuary boundary. Research and education provide additional 
means to promote the goal of marine resource protection. 


Comment:

 Geophysical exploration should not be prohibited, as 
the information gathered from this research can benefit coastal 
communities and academic institutions. 


Response:

 NOAA's emphasis on research within the Sanctuary 
allows for research which may involve an otherwise prohibited 
activity (such as alteration of or construction on the seabed) as 
long as researchers obtain a research permit pursuant to  925.9 of the Sanctuary regulations. NOAA will determine
the 
environmental consequences of the proposed research, including 
short and long term effects on marine biota (such as noise which 
may interfere with cetacean communication) in deciding whether to 
issue a permit. 


Comment:

 The research program should stress applied research 
such as research which can facilitate fisheries management, 
provide information on long-term environmental trends, and 
provide links between the marine systems and the adjacent 
terrestrial systems. Providing research results to decision 
makers at the various governmental levels would be an important 
link in addressing marine resource problems. 


Response:

 NOAA agrees and has clarified this point in the 
research section of the management plan. 


Comment:

 Criteria for acceptable research within the Sanctuary 
should be established prior to formal designation of the 
Sanctuary. The criteria should be used in review of research 
permit applications, and an appeal process should be established 
in the case of research permit application denial. 


Response:

 Research permit applications will be reviewed on a 
case-by-case basis and evaluated to determine the potential short 
and long term impacts of the proposed activities. In addition,  925.12 of the regulations sets forth the procedures
for 
appealing to the Assistant Administrator the denial of a research 
permit. 


Comment:

 NOAA should conduct research into the effects of 
fishing activities on the entire marine system. Fish stocks, 
species abundance, and monitoring information should be presented 
to the PFMC. 


Response:

 The National Ocean Service (which includes the 
Sanctuaries and Reserves Division) and the NMFS have entered into 
a Memorandum of Understanding outlining the working relationship 
between the Sanctuary Program and the NMFS. The PFMC will be 
involved in this agreement, through its relationship with the 
NMFS. Research which benefits the overall goal of resource 
protection is addressed within this agreement by highlighting the 
need for interagency coordination, research and monitoring. 


Comment:

 The benefits of sanctuary designation to the fishing 
community and others should be clearly articulated. 
Additionally, connections between the regulations and resource 
protection should be integrated in the education plan (e.g., 
establishing warning signs at popular access sites to alert 
boaters and hikers to the effect of disturbance of pelagic birds 
and marine mammals.) 


Response:

 NOAA agrees and has clarified the education goals 
in the Sanctuary management plan. NOAA has articulated the 
benefits of the Sanctuary program for the fishing community. 
NOAA will coordinate with the USFWS and the NPS to post warning 
signs around critical marine bird and mammal habitat. 


Comment:

 NOAA should provide for increased education and 
interpretation of the shoreline through a variety of media. 
Educational materials and outreach programs should be developed 
by pre-existing facilities and organizations on the Olympic 
Peninsula. 


Response:

 Sanctuary designation will provide for increased 
education and interpretation of the entire Sanctuary ecosystem. 
Education materials and outreach programs will be developed in 
cooperation with existing Federal, tribal, state and local 
entities. 


Issue: Informational Amendments of the DEIS/MP 


Biological Amendments 




Comment:

 The discussion of the neretic and shelf edge 
environments in the DEIS/MP needs to be expanded. The resource 
assessment must stress the biological richness of the area. 


Response:

 The resource assessment describing the ecosystem of 
the Sanctuary study area has been expanded in the FEIS/MP. 


Comment:

 Biological resources need to be discussed in terms of 
ecosystem interactions and not single species descriptions. 


Response:

 NOAA has expanded the discussion to include a 
description of the study area from an ecosystem perspective.

Socioeconomic 




Comment:

 The FEIS/MP must contain a socioeconomic impact study 
of the regulations on the affected coastal communities and 
Tribes. Failure to consider and mitigate these impacts violates 
the NEPA and Federal Trust responsibility to Indians. 


Response:

 An economic analysis has been included within the 
FEIS/MP. NOAA is not promulgating regulations that will unduly 
burden the tribes. The regulations have provisions that 
recognize treaty secured rights. In addition, NOAA will consult 
with the Tribes when considering permits affecting proposed 
development activities in the Sanctuary. NOAA believes that the 
regulations do not conflict with the economic interests of the 
Tribes since the regulations offer increased protection for those 
natural resources critical to the tribal economy. 


Comment:

 The Federal government should investigate the 
possibility of tax breaks to offset economic impacts of the 
management plan. 


Response:

 NOAA's actions do not add economic burdens to the 
area. The issue of tax breaks should be addressed to an 
individual's representatives in Congress. NOAA does not have the 
legislative authority to address tax laws. 


Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement 




Comment:

 NOAA should submit a supplemental Draft 
Environmental Impact Statement for the following reasons: (1) The DEIS/MP lacks a satisfactory examination of the
socioeconomic 
impacts of the regulations on the coastal communities; (2) the DEIS/MP contains erroneous information related to
port activities 
in Grays Harbor; (3) some information is missing, outdated, or 
inaccurate; (4) inadequate definition of the unique environment 
deserving protection that is identified by the SEL. 


Response:

 NOAA has determined that the matters for which an 
SEIS has been requested can be addressed in the FEIS/MP. The 
FEIS/MP addresses the socioeconomic impacts of regulations that 
could potentially affect the coastal communities in the 
alternatives and consequences section. Further, the vessel 
traffic section has been amended substantially to provide a 
detailed description of the significance of vessel traffic to the 
coastal communities. Additionally, the description of the marine 
environment under consideration has been expanded greatly. 


Management 




Comment:

 NOAA needs to address or recognize a number of current 
local and state regulatory controls in place within the shoreline 
areas. 


Response:

 NOAA has addressed local and state regulatory 
controls within the shoreline areas. These controls are listed 
in appendix J.

The following sets forth the text of the Designation 
Document for the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary. 



Designation Document for the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary 



Under the authority of Title III of the Marine Protection, 
Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, as amended (the ``Act''), 
16 U.S.C. 1431 

et seq

., the waters off the Olympic Coast of 
Washington State including the U.S. portion of the Strait of Juan 
de Fuca west of Koitlah Point, and the submerged lands 
thereunder, as described in Article II, are hereby designated as 
the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary for the purposes of 
protecting and managing the conservation, ecological, 
recreational, research, educational, historical and aesthetic 
resources and qualities of the area. 



Article I. Effect of Designation 



The Act authorizes the issuance of such final regulations as 
are necessary and reasonable to implement the designation, 
including managing and protecting the conservation, recreational, 
ecological, historical, research, educational, and aesthetic 
resources and qualities of the Olympic Coast National Marine 
Sanctuary. Section 1 of Article IV of this Designation Document 
lists activities that either will be regulated on the effective 
date of designation or may have to be regulated at some later 
date in order to protect Sanctuary resources and qualities. 
Listing does not necessarily mean that a type of activity will be 
regulated; however, if an activity is not listed, it may not be 
regulated, except on an emergency basis, unless section 1 of 
Article IV is amended to include the type of activity by the same 
procedures by which the original designation was made. 



Article II. Description of the Sanctuary Area 



The Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary boundary 
encompasses approximately 2500 square nautical miles 
(approximately 8577 sq. kilometers) of coastal and ocean waters, 
and the submerged lands thereunder, off the central and northern 
coast of the State of Washington. The Sanctuary boundary extends 
from Koitlah Point due north to the United States/Canada 
international boundary seaward to the 100 fathom isobath. The 
seaward boundary of the Sanctuary approximates the 100 fathom 
isobath in a southerly direction from the U.S./Canada 
international boundary to a point due west of the Copalis River, 
cutting across the heads of Nitnat, Juan de Fuca, and Quinault 
Canyons. 

The shoreward boundary of the Sanctuary is the mean lower low 
water line when adjacent to Indian reservations and State and 
county lands. When adjacent to Federally managed lands, the 
coastal boundary extends to the mean higher high water line. The 
coastal boundary cuts across the mouths of all rivers and 
streams. The precise boundary of the Sanctuary is set forth in Appendix A of this Designation Document. 



Article III. Characteristics of the Sanctuary Area That Give It 
Particular Value 


The Sanctuary is a highly productive, nearly pristine ocean 
and coastal environment that is important to the continued 
survival of several ecologically and commercially important 
species of fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. Its rugged and 
undeveloped coastline makes the region one of the more dramatic 
natural wonders of the coastal United States, paralleling the 
majestic splendor of such terrestrial counterparts as Yosemite 
National Park and the Grand Tetons. The region's high biological 
productivity is fueled by seasonal enhanced upwelling along the 
edge of the continental shelf, especially at submarine canyons, 
during periods of high solar radiation. 

The diversity of habitats that make up the Sanctuary support a 
great variety of biological communities. This unusually large 
range of habitat types include: Offshore islands and rocks; some 
of the most diverse kelp beds in the world; intertidal pools; 
erosional features such as rocky headlands, seastacks, and 
arches; interspersed exposed beaches and protected bays; 
submarine canyons and ridges; the continental shelf, including a 
broad shallow plateau extending from the mouth of the Juan de 
Fuca canyon; and continental slope environments. The numerous 
seastacks and rocky outcrops along the Sanctuary shoreline, 
coupled with a large tidal range and wave splash zone, support 
some of the most diverse and complex intertidal zones in the 
United States.

<TEXT>
 

The Sanctuary provides an essential habitat for a wide variety 
of marine mammals and birds, and is of particular interest due to 
the presence of endangered and threatened species that live or 
migrate through the region. Twenty seven species of marine 
mammals are reported to breed, rest within, or migrate offshore 
of the Olympic Peninsula. Of particular interest is the 
migration route of the endangered California gray whale, the 
threatened northern sea lion, the occasional presence of the 
endangered right, fin, sei, blue, humpback, and sperm whales, and 
the reintroduced resident population of sea otters. 

In addition, the seabird colonies of Washington's outer coast 
are among the largest in the continental United States and 
include a number of species listed as endangered or threatened 
including the short-tailed albatross, peregrine falcon, brown 
pelican, Aleutian Canada goose, marbled murrelet, and one of the 
largest populations of bald eagles in the continental United 
States. 

The high biological productivity of the coastal and offshore 
waters in the Sanctuary support valuable fisheries that 
contribute significantly to the State and tribal economies. The 
commercially important species of fish include five species of 
salmon, groundfish, and shellfish. 

In addition to the Sanctuary's value with respect to its 
biological resources, the region encompasses significant 
historical resources including Indian village sites, ancient 
canoe runs, petroglyphs, Indian artifacts, and numerous 
shipwrecks. 

The diversity and richness of marine resources suggests that 
the marine sanctuary designations will provide exceptional 
opportunities for scientific research in the areas of species 
interactions, population dynamics, physiological ecology, 
linkages between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and marine 
anthropology. The scientific research encouraged by the 
Sanctuary management plan will, in turn, help support an 
intensive public education and awareness program that will 
address the diverse, complex, and sensitive ecosystems in 
Washington's coastal and oceanic environments. 



Article IV. Scope of Regulations 



Section 1. Activities Subject to Regulation 



The following activities are subject to regulation, 
including prohibition, to the extent necessary and reasonable to 
ensure the protection and management of the conservation, 
ecological, recreational, research, educational, historical and 
aesthetic resources and qualities of the area: 

a. Exploring for, developing, or producing oil, gas or 
minerals (e.g., clay, stone, sand, metalliferous ores, 
gravel, non-metalliferous ores or any other solid 
material or other solid matter of commercial value) 
within the Sanctuary; 

b. Discharging or depositing from within the boundary of 
the Sanctuary, any material or other matter; 

c. Discharging or depositing, from beyond the boundary of 
the Sanctuary, any material or other matter; 

d. Taking, removing, moving, catching, collecting, 
harvesting, feeding, injuring, destroying or causing 
the loss of, or attempting to take, remove, move, 
catch, collect, harvest, feed, injure, destroy or cause 
the loss of, a marine mammal, sea turtle, seabird, 
historical resource or other Sanctuary resource; 

e. Drilling into, dredging, or otherwise altering the 
seabed of the Sanctuary; or constructing, placing, or 
abandoning any structure, material or other matter on 
the seabed of the Sanctuary; 

f. Possessing within the Sanctuary a Sanctuary resource or 
any other resource, regardless of where taken, removed, 
moved, caught, collected or harvested, that, if it had 
been found within the Sanctuary, would be a Sanctuary 
resource; 

g. Flying a motorized aircraft above the Sanctuary; 

h. Operating a vessel (i.e., watercraft of any description 
in the Sanctuary; 

i. Interfacing with, obstructing, delaying or preventing 
an investigation, search, seizure or disposition of 
seized property in connection with enforcement of the 
Act or any regulation or permit issued under the Act. 



Section 2. Emergencies 



Where necessary to prevent or minimize the destruction of, 
loss of, or injury to a Sanctuary resource or quality, or 
minimize the imminent risk of such destruction, loss or injury, 
any and all activities, including those not listed in Section 1 
of this Article, are subject to immediate temporary regulation, 
including prohibition. 



Article V. Effect on Leases, Permits, Licenses, and Rights 



Pursuant to section 304(c)(1) of the Act, 16 U.S.C. 
1434(c)(1), no valid lease, permit, license, or other 
authorization issued by any Federal, State, or local authority of 
competent jurisdiction, or any right of subsistence use of 
access, may be terminated by the Secretary of Commerce or 
designee as a result of this designation. The Secretary of 
Commerce or designee, however, may regulate the exercise 
(including, but not limited to, the imposition of terms and 
conditions) of such authorization or right consistent with the 
purposes for which the Sanctuary is designated. 

In no event may the Secretary or designee issue a permit 
authorizing, or otherwise approve: (1) Exploration for, 
development or production of oil, gas or minerals within the 
Sanctuary; (2) the discharge of primary treated sewage (except 
for regulation, pursuant to section 304(c)(2) of the Act, of the 
exercise of valid authorizations in existence on the effective 
date of Sanctuary designation and issued by other authorities of 
competent jurisdiction); (3) the disposal of dredged material 
within the Sanctuary other than in connection with beach 
nourishment projects related to harbor maintenance activities; or 
(4) bombing activities within the Sanctuary. Any purported 
authorizations issued by other authorities after the effective 
date of Sanctuary designation for any of these activities within 
the Sanctuary shall be invalid. 



Article VI. Alteration of This Designation 



The terms of designation, as defined under Section 304(a) of 
the Act, may be modified only by the same procedures by which the 
original designation is made, including public hearings 
consultation with interested Federal, State, and local agencies, 
review by the appropriate Congressional committees and the 
Governor of the State of Washington, and approval by the 
Secretary of Commerce or designee.

III. Summary of Final Management Plan 



The FEIS/MP for the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary sets forth the Sanctuary's location and provides details
on the most important resources and uses of the Sanctuary. The FEIS/MP describes the resources and uses of the Sanctuary.
The FEIS/MP describes the resource protection, research, education and interpretive programs, and establishes
goals and objectives to be 
accomplished by each program. The FEIS/MP includes a detailed discussion, by program area, of agency roles and responsibilities.


The goals and objectives for the Sanctuary are: 



Resource Protection 



The highest priority management goal is to protect the marine environment, resources and qualities of the Sanctuary.
The specific objectives of protection efforts are to: 

(1) Coordinate policies and procedures among agencies sharing responsibility for protection and management of
resources; 

(2) Encourage participation by interested agencies and organizations in the development of procedures to address
specific management concerns (e.g., monitoring and emergency-response programs); 

(3) Develop an effective and coordinated program for the enforcement of Sanctuary regulations; 

(4) Enforce Sanctuary regulations in addition to other regulations already in place; 

(5) Promote public awareness of, and voluntary compliance with, Sanctuary regulations and objectives, through
an educational/interpretive program stressing resource sensitivity and wise use; 

(6) Ensure that the water quality of the coastal and ocean waters off the Olympic Peninsula is maintained at a level
consonant with Sanctuary designation; 

(7) Establish mechanisms for coordination among all the agencies participating in Sanctuary management; 

(8) Ensure that the appropriate management agencies incorporate research results and scientific data into effective
resource protection strategies; and 

(9) Reduce threats to Sanctuary resources and qualities. 



Research Program 



Effective management of the Sanctuary requires the implementation of a Sanctuary research program. The purpose
of Sanctuary research activities is to improve understanding of the marine environment off the Olympic peninsula,
its resources and qualities, and to resolve specific management problems, some of which may involve resources common
to both the marine and upland freshwater environments. Research results will be used in interpretive programs for
visitors, for those living on the Peninsula, and working adjacent to or in the Sanctuary, others interested in the
Sanctuary, as well as for protection and 
management of resources and qualities. 

Specific objectives of the research program are to: 

(1) Establish a framework and procedures for administering research to ensure that research projects are responsive
to management concerns and that results contribute to improve management of the Sanctuary; 

(2) Incorporate research results into the interpretive/education program in a format useful for the general public;


(3) Focus and coordinate data collection efforts on the physical, chemical, geological and biological oceanography
of the Sanctuary; 

(4) Encourage studies that integrate research from the variety of coastal habitats with nearshore and open ocean
processes; 

(5) Initiate a monitoring program to assess environmental changes as they occur due to natural and human processes;


(6) Identify the range of effects on the environment that would result from predicted changes in human activity or
natural phenomena; and 

(7) Encourage information exchange among all the organizations and agencies undertaking management-related research
in the Sanctuary to promote more informed management. 



Education Program 



The goal for the education program is to improve public awareness and understanding of the significance of the Sanctuary
resources and qualities to foster a heightened sense of stewardship for Sanctuary resources and qualities. 

The management objectives designed to meet this goal are to: 

(1) Provide the public with information on the Sanctuary and its goals and objectives, with an emphasis on the need
to use Sanctuary resources and qualities wisely to ensure their long-term viability; 

(2) Broaden support for the Sanctuary management by offering programs suited to visitors with a range of diverse interests;


(3) Foster public involvement by encouraging feedback on the effectiveness of education programs, collaboration
with Sanctuary management staff in extension and outreach programs, and participation in other volunteer programs;
and 

(4) Collaborate with other organizations to provide educational services complementary to the Sanctuary program.




Visitor Use 



The Sanctuary goal for visitor management is to facilitate, to the extent compatible with the primary objective of
resource protection, public and private uses of the resources of the Sanctuary not prohibited pursuant to other authorities.


Specific management objectives are to: 

(1) Provide relevant information about Sanctuary regulations, use policies and standards; 

(2) Collaborate with public and private organizations in promoting compatible uses of the Sanctuary; 

(3) Encourage the public who use the Sanctuary to respect sensitive Sanctuary resources and qualities; and 

(4) Monitor and assess the levels of use to identify and control potential degradation of resources and qualities
and minimize potential user conflicts. 

The Sanctuary headquarters will be located in Port Angeles, 
WA with an initial satellite office near Forks, WA.

IV. Summary of Regulations 



The regulations set forth the boundary of the Sanctuary; prohibit a relatively narrow range of activities; set forth
procedures for applying for national marine sanctuary permits to conduct prohibited activities; set forth certification
procedures for existing leases, licenses, permits, other authorizations or rights authorizing the conduct of a
prohibited activity; set 
forth notification and review procedures for applications for licenses, permits, or other authorizations to conduct
a prohibited activity; set forth the maximum per-day penalties for violating Sanctuary regulations; and set forth
procedures for administrative appeals. 

The regulations are codified in part 925 of title 15, Code of Federal Regulations. 

Section 925.1 sets forth as the purpose of the regulations 
to implement the designation of the Olympic Coast National Marine 
Sanctuary by regulating activities affecting the Sanctuary 
consistent with the terms of that designation in order to protect 
and manage the conservation, ecological, recreational, research, 
educational, historical and aesthetic resources and qualities of 
the area. 

Section 925.2 and Appendix A following  925.12 set forth the boundary of the Sanctuary. 

Section 925.3 defines various terms used in the regulations. Other terms appearing in the regulations are defined
at 15 CFR 922.2 and/or in the MPRSA. 

Section 925.4 allows all activities except those prohibited by  925.5 to be undertaken subject to the requirements
of any emergency regulation promulgated pursuant to  925.6, subject to all prohibitions, restrictions and
conditions validly imposed by any other authority of competent jurisdiction, and subject to the liability established
by Section 312 of the Act. 

Section 925.5 prohibits a variety of activities and thus makes it unlawful for any person to conduct them or cause them
to be conducted. However, any of the prohibited activities except for: 

(1) The exploration for, development or production of oil, gas or minerals in the Sanctuary; 

(2) The discharge of primary-treated sewage within the Sanctuary (except pursuant to certification under  925.10,
of a valid authorization in 
existence on the effective date of Sanctuary designation and issued by other authorities of competent jurisdiction);


(3) The disposal of dredged material within the Sanctuary other than in 
connection with beach nourishment projects related to harbor maintenance activities; and 

(4) Bombing activities within the Sanctuary could be conducted lawfully if: 

(1) The activity is necessary to respond to an emergency threatening life, property, or the environment (not applicable
to the prohibitions against takings and interference with law enforcement); necessary for valid law enforcement
purposes; authorized by a National Marine Sanctuary permit issued under  925.9 (not applicable to the prohibition
against interference 
with law enforcement); or authorized by a Special Use Permit issued under Section 310 of the Act (not applicable to
the prohibition against interference with law enforcement); 

(2) With regard to Department of Defense activities: (A) the activity is an existing military activity including
hull integrity tests and other deep water tests; live firing of guns, missiles, torpedoes, and chaff; activities
associated with the Quinault Range including the in-water testing of non-explosive torpedoes; and anti-submarine
warfare operations, or (B) the 
activity is a new activity and exempted by the Director of the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management or designee
after consultation between the Director or designee and the Department of Defense. The regulations require that
the Department of Defense carry out its activities in a manner that avoids to the maximum extent practicable any adverse
impact on Sanctuary 
resources and qualities and that it, in the event of threatened or actual destruction of, loss of, or injury to a Sanctuary
resource or quality resulting from an untoward incident, including but not limited to spills and groundings, caused
by it, promptly coordinate with the Director or designee for the purpose of taking appropriate actions to respond
to and mitigate the harm and, if possible, restore or replace the Sanctuary resource or quality. The final regulation
regarding Department of Defense activities differs from the proposed regulation principally by prohibiting all
bombing activities within the Sanctuary; 

(3) The activity is authorized by a certification by the Director of the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management
or designee under  924.10 of a valid lease, permit, license or other authorization issued by any Federal, State
or local authority of competent jurisdiction and in existence on (or 
conducted pursuant to any valid right of subsistence use or access in existence on) the effective date of this designation,
subject to complying with any terms and conditions imposed by the Director or designee as he or she deems necessary
to achieve the purposes for which the Sanctuary was designated, except that treaty rights of a Federally recognized
Indian tribe may be exercised by the tribe without certification by the Director or 
designee; 

(4) The activity is authorized by a valid lease, permit, license, or other authorization issued by any Federal, State
or local authority of competent jurisdiction after the effective date of Sanctuary designation, provided that the
Director of the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management or designee was notified of the application in accordance
with the requirements 
of  925.11, the applicant complies with the requirements of  925.11, the Director or designee notifies
the applicant and authorizing agency that he or she does not object to issuance of the authorization, and the applicant
complies with any terms and conditions the Director or designee deems necessary to protect Sanctuary resources and
qualities.

The first activity prohibited is exploring for, developing 
or producing oil, gas or minerals within the Sanctuary. With 
regard to oil and gas, this regulation implements the 
requirements of Section 2207 of the Oceans Act of 1992 which 
prohibits ``oil or gas leasing or pre-leasing activity [from 
being] conducted within the area designated as the Olympic Coast 
National Marine Sanctuary * * *.'' The resources and qualities 
of the coastal and offshore waters of the Olympic Peninsula, 
particularly the sea birds and pinnipeds that use the haul-out 
sites, kelp forests and rocks along the Olympic Coast, and the 
high water quality of the area, are especially vulnerable to oil 
and gas activities in the area. A prohibition on oil and gas 
exploration, development and production activities within the 
Sanctuary boundary partially protects Sanctuary resources and 
qualities from oil and gas activities. Only partial protection 
will be provided due to the remaining threat from oil and gas 
from vessel traffic transiting through and near the Sanctuary, 
particularly oil tankers not operating in accordance with the 
voluntary agreement of the Western States Petroleum Association 
to remain 50 nautical miles from shore. A prohibition on mineral 
activities within the Sanctuary is consistent with the 
prohibition on alteration of or construction on the seabed as 
discussed below. ``Mineral'' is defined to mean clay, stone, sand, 
gravel, metalliferous ore, nonmetalliferous ore, or any other 
solid material or other solid matter of commercial value. The 
prohibition on oil, gas and mineral activities additionally will 
prevent the negative effects of physical and possible chemical 
disturbances associated with extraction activities, e.g., 
destruction of benthic biota; resuspension of fine sediments; 
interference with filtering, feeding and respiratory functions of 
marine organisms; loss of food sources and habitats; and lowered 
photosynthesis and oxygen levels. 
The second activity prohibited is depositing or discharging 
from within the boundary of the Sanctuary any material or other 
matter except: 
(1) Fish, fish parts, chumming materials or bait 
used in or resulting from traditional fishing operations in the 
Sanctuary; 
(2) Biodegradable effluent incidental to vessel use 
and generated by marine sanitation devices approved in accordance 
with Section 312 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as 
amended (FWPCA), 33 U.S.C. 1322 

et seq.

; 
(3) Water generated by routine vessel operations (e.g., cooling water, deck wash down and graywater as defined by
Section 312 of the FWPCA) excluding 
oily-wastes from bilge pumping; 
(4) Engine exhaust; and 
(5) Dredge spoil in connection with beach nourishment projects 
related to harbor maintenance activities. 
This prohibition is necessary to protect Sanctuary resources 
and qualities from the effects of pollutants deposited or 
discharged into the Sanctuary. 
After expiration of current permits, discharges from 
municipal treatment plants will be subject to the review process 
of  925.11. At a minimum, secondary treatment will be required. 
Depending on the risk to Sanctuary resources and qualities, 
greater treatment may be required. The intent of this 
prohibition is to protect Sanctuary resources and qualities from 
the effects of land and sea originating pollutants. 
The third activity prohibited is depositing or discharging, 
from beyond the boundary of the Sanctuary, any material or other 
matter that subsequently enters the Sanctuary and injures a 
Sanctuary resource or quality, except for the five exclusions 
discussed above for the second prohibited activity. 
The fourth activity prohibited is moving, removing or 
injuring or attempting to move, remove or injure a Sanctuary 
historical resource. Historical resources in the marine 
environment are fragile, finite and non-renewable. This 
prohibition is designed to protect these resources so that they 
may be researched and information about their contents and type 
made available for the benefit of the public. This prohibition 
does not apply to moving, removing or injury resulting 
incidentally from traditional fishing operations. 
Historical resources located within the Sanctuary that are 
of significance to an Indian tribe(s) (e.g., submerged 
Indian villages) will be managed so as to protect other Sanctuary 
resources and the interests of the governing body of an Indian 
tribe(s) in such historical resources. If an Indian tribe 
determines that a historical resource of tribal significance may 
be researched, excavated or salvaged, the Sanctuary manager may 
issue a Sanctuary permit if the criteria for issuance have been 
met (See  925.9). Removal or attempted removal of any Indian 
cultural resource or artifact may only occur with the express 
written consent of the governing body of the tribe or tribes to 
which such resource or artifact pertains.

The fifth activity prohibited is drilling into, dredging or 
otherwise altering the seabed of the Sanctuary; or constructing, 
placing or abandoning any structure, material or other matter on 
the seabed of the Sanctuary, except if any of the above results 
incidentally from: (1) Anchoring vessels; (2) traditional fishing 
operations; (3) installation of navigation aids; (4) harbor 
maintenance in the areas necessarily associated with Federal 
Projects in existence on the effective date of Sanctuary 
designation, including dredging of entrance channels and harbors, 
and repair, replacement or rehabilitation of breakwaters and 
jetties; (5) construction, repair, replacement, enhancement or 
rehabilitation of boat launches, docks or piers and associated 
breakwaters and jetties; or (6) beach nourishment projects 
related to harbor maintenance activities. Federal projects are 
any water resources development projects conducted by the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers or operating under a permit or 
authorization issued by the Corps of Engineers and authorized by 
Federal law. 
The intent of this prohibition is to protect the resources 
and qualities of the Sanctuary from the harmful effects of 
activities such as, but not limited to, archaeological 
excavations, drilling into the seabed, strip mining, laying of 
pipelines and outfalls, and offshore commercial development, 
which may disrupt and/or destroy sensitive marine benthic 
habitats, such as kelp beds, invertebrate populations, fish 
habitats and estuaries. 
The sixth activity prohibited is taking marine mammals, sea 
turtles or seabirds in or above the Sanctuary, except as 
authorized by NMFS or USFWS under the authority of the Marine 
Mammal Protection Act, as amended, (MMPA), 16 U.S.C. 1361 

et 
seq.,

 the Endangered Species Act, as amended, (ESA), 
16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.,

 and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, as 
amended, (MBTA), 16 U.S.C. 703 

et seq.,

 or pursuant to a 
treaty with an Indian tribe to which the United States is a 
party, provided that the treaty right is exercised in accordance 
with the MMPA, ESA and MBTA, to the extent that they apply. The 
term ``taking'' includes all forms of harassment. The MMPA, ESA 
and MBTA prohibit the taking of species protected under those 
acts. The prohibition overlaps with the MMPA, ESA and MBTA but 
also extends protection for Sanctuary resources on an 
environmentally holistic basis and provides a greater deterrent 
with civil penalties of up to $100,000 per taking. The 
prohibition covers all marine mammals, sea turtles and seabirds 
in or above the Sanctuary. The prohibition recognizes existing 
treaty rights to hunt marine mammals, sea turtles and seabirds to 
the extent that the treaty rights have not been abrogated by 
provisions of the MMPA, ESA or MBTA. 
The seventh activity prohibited is flying motorized aircraft 
at less than 2,000 feet (610m) both above the Sanctuary within 
one nautical mile of the Flattery Rocks, Quillayute Needles or 
Copalis National Wildlife Refuge, or within one nautical mile 
seaward of the coastal boundary of the Sanctuary, except as 
necessary for valid law enforcement purposes, for activities 
related to tribal timber operations conducted on reservation 
lands, or to transport persons or supplies to or from reservation 
lands as authorized by a governing body of an Indian tribe. This 
prohibition is designed to limit potential noise impacts, 
particularly those that might startle hauled-out seals and sea 
lions, and colonial seabirds along the shoreline margins of the 
Sanctuary. 
Both the eighth and ninth prohibitions serve to facilitate 
enforcement actions for violations of Sanctuary regulations. The 
eighth prohibition is the possession within the Sanctuary of any 
historical resource or marine mammal, sea turtle or seabird, 
regardless of where the resource was taken, except in compliance 
with the MMPA, ESA and MBTA and the ninth prohibition is 
interfering with, obstructing, delaying or preventing 
investigations, searches, seizures or disposition of seized 
property in connection with enforcement of the Act or any 
regulation or permit issued under the Act. 
Section 925.6 authorizes the regulation, including 
prohibition, on a temporary basis of any activity where necessary 
to prevent or minimize the destruction of, loss of, or injury to 
a Sanctuary resource or quality, or minimize the imminent risk of 
such destruction, loss or injury. 
Section 925.7 sets for the maximum statutory civil penalty 
for violating a regulation_$100,000. Each day of a continuing 
violation constitutes a separate violation. Section 925.8 
repeats the provision in section 312 of the Act that any person 
who destroys, causes the loss of, or injures any sanctuary 
resource is liable to the United States for response costs and 
damages resulting from such destruction, loss or injury, and any 
vessel used to destroy, cause the loss of, or injure any 
sanctuary resource is liable in rem to the United States for 
response costs and damages resulting from such destruction, loss 
or injury. The purpose of these sections is to draw the public's 
attention to the liability for violating a Sanctuary regulation 
or the Act. 
Regulations setting forth the procedures governing 
administrative proceedings for assessment of civil penalties, 
permit sanctions and denials for enforcement reasons, issuance 
and use of written warnings, and release or forfeiture of seized 
property appear in 15 CFR part 904.

Section 925.9 sets forth the procedures for applying for a 
National Marine Sanctuary permit to conduct a prohibited activity 
and the criteria governing the issuance, denial, amendment, 
suspension and revocation of such permits. A permit may be 
granted by the Director of the Office for Ocean and Coastal 
Resource Management or designee if he or she finds that the 
activity will not substantially injure Sanctuary resources and 
qualities and will: Further research related to Sanctuary 
resources; further the educational, natural or historical 
resource value of the Sanctuary; further salvage or recovery 
operations in or near the Sanctuary in connection with a recent 
air or marine casualty; assist in the management of the 
Sanctuary; further salvage or recovery operations in connection 
with an abandoned shipwreck in the Sanctuary title to which is 
held by the State of Washington; or promote the welfare of any 
Indian tribe. In deciding whether to issue a permit, the 
Director or designee may consider such factors as the 
professional qualifications and financial ability of the 
applicant as related to the proposed activity, the duration of 
the activity and the duration of its effects, the appropriateness 
of the methods and procedures proposed by the applicant for the 
conduct of the activity, the extent to which the conduct of the 
activity may diminish or enhance Sanctuary resources and 
qualities, the cumulative effects of the activity, the end value 
of the activity, and the impacts of the activity on adjacent 
Indian tribes. In addition, the Director or designee is 
authorized to consider any other factors she or he deems 
appropriate. 
Section 925.10 sets forth procedures for requesting 
certification of leases, licenses, permits, other authorizations, 
or rights in existence on the date of Sanctuary designation 
authorizing the conduct of an activity prohibited under 
paragraphs (a)(2)-(8) of  925.5. Pursuant to paragraph (f) of 
 925.5, the prohibitions in paragraphs (a)(2)-(8) of  925.5 do 
not apply to any activity authorized by a valid lease, permit, 
license, or other authorization in existence on the effective 
date of Sanctuary designation and issued by any Federal, State or 
local authority of competent jurisdiction, or by any valid right 
of subsistence use or access in existence on the effective date 
of Sanctuary designation, provided that the holder of such 
authorization or right complies with the requirements of  925.10 
(e.g., notifies the Director or designee of the existence of, 
requests certification of, and provides requested information 
regarding such authorization or right) and complies with any 
terms and conditions on the exercise of such authorization or 
right imposed as a condition of certification by the Director or 
designee as she or he deems necessary to achieve the purposes for 
which the Sanctuary was designated. 
Section 925.10 allows the holder 90 days from the effective 
date of Sanctuary designation to request certification. The 
holder is allowed to conduct the activity without being in 
violation of the prohibitions in paragraphs (a)(2)-(8) of  925.5 
with regard to which the holder is requesting certification 
pending final agency action on his or her certification request, 
provided the holder has complied with all requirements of 
 925.10. 
Section 925.10 also allows the Director or designee to 
request additional information from the holder and to seek the 
views of other persons. 
As a condition of certification, the Director or designee 
will impose such terms and conditions on the exercise of such 
lease, permit, license, other authorization or right as she or he 
deems necessary to achieve the purposes for which the Sanctuary 
was designated. This is consistent with the Secretary's 
authority under section 304(c)(2) of the Act. The holder may 
appeal any action conditioning, amending, suspending or revoking 
any certification in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
 925.12. 
Any amendment, renewal or extension not in existence as of 
the date of Sanctuary designation of a lease, permit, license, 
other authorization or right is subject to the provisions of  
925.11. 
Section 925.11 states that consistent with paragraph (g) of 
 925.5, the prohibitions of paragraphs (a)(2)-(8) of  925.5 do 
not apply to any activity authorized by any valid lease, permit, 
license, or other authorization issued after the effective date 
of Sanctuary designation by any Federal, State or local authority 
of competent jurisdiction, provided that the applicant notifies 
the Director or designee of the application for such 
authorization within 15 days of the date of filing of the 
application or of the effective date of Sanctuary designation, 
whichever is later, that the applicant is in compliance with the 
other provisions of  925.11, that the Director or designee 
notifies the applicant and authorizing agency that he or she does 
not object to issuance of the authorization, and that the 
applicant complies with any terms and conditions the Director or 
designee deems necessary to protect Sanctuary resources and 
qualities. Where the applicant is the governing body of an 
Indian tribe, the Director shall consider and protect the 
interests of the tribe to the fullest extent practicable in 
keeping with the purposes of the Sanctuary and the U.S. trust 
responsibility to the affected tribes. 
Section 925.11 allows the Director or designee to request 
additional information from the applicant and to seek the views 
of other persons.

An application for an amendment to, an extension of, or a 
renewal of an authorization is also subject to the provisions of 
 925.11. 
The applicant may appeal any objection by, or terms or 
conditions imposed by, the Director or designee to the Assistant 
Administrator or designee in accordance with the procedures set 
forth in  925.12. 
Section 925.12 sets forth the procedures for appealing to 
the Assistant Administrator or designee actions of the Director 
or designee with respect to: 
(1) The granting, conditioning, 
amendment, denial, suspension or revocation of a National Marine 
Sanctuary permit under  925.9 or a Special Use permit under 
Section 310 of the Act; 
(2) The granting, denial, conditioning, 
amendment, suspension or revocation of a certification under 
 925.10; or 
(3) The objection to issuance or the imposition of 
terms and conditions under  925.11. 
Prior to conditioning the exercise of existing leases, 
permits, licenses, other authorizations or rights or conditioning 
or objecting to proposed authorizations, NOAA intends to consult 
with relevant issuing agencies as well as owners, holders or 
applicants. 
NOAA's policy is to encourage best available management 
practices to minimize non-point source pollution entering the 
Sanctuary and, for municipal sewage discharge, to require, at a 
minimum, secondary treatment and sometimes tertiary treatment or 
more, depending on predicted effects on Sanctuary resources and 
qualities. 
Section 925.13 has been added which requires the Director to 
consult with state, local and tribal governments regarding areas 
of mutual concern, including Sanctuary programs, permitting 
activities, development and threats to Sanctuary resources. This 
section also requires the Director to enter into memorandums of 
understanding with such governments when requested regarding such 
consultations. 


V. Miscellaneous Rulemaking Requirements 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


The regulations in this notice allow all activities to be 
conducted in the Sanctuary other than a relatively narrow range 
of prohibited activities. The procedures in these regulations 
for applying for National Marine Sanctuary permits to conduct 
prohibited activities, for requesting certifications for 
pre-existing leases, licenses, permits, other authorizations or 
rights authorizing the conduct of a prohibited activity and for 
notifying NOAA of applications for leases, licenses, permits, 
approvals or other authorizations to conduct a prohibited 
activity will all act to lessen any adverse economic effect on 
small entities. The regulations, in total, will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
entities, and when they were proposed the General Counsel of the 
Department of Commerce so certified to the Chief Counsel for 
Advocacy of the Small Business Administration. As a result, 
neither an initial nor final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was 
prepared. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


This rule contains collection of information requirements 
subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act 
(Pub. L. 96-511). The collection of information requirements 
contained in the rule have been reviewed by the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) under section 3504(h) of the 
Paperwork Reduction Act and have been approved under OMB Control 
No. 0648-0141. Comments from the public on the collection of 
information requirements contained in this rule are invited and 
should be addressed to the Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction 
Project (06480141) Washington, DC 20503 (Attn: Desk Officer for 
NOAA) and to Richard A. Roberts, room 724, 6010 Executive 
Boulevard, Rockville, MD 20852. 


Executive Order 12612 


A Federalism Assessment (FA) was prepared for the proposed 
designation, draft management plan and proposed implementing 
regulations. The FA concluded that all were fully consistent 
with the principles, criteria and requirements set forth in 
sections 2 through 5 of Executive Order 12612, Federalism 
Considerations in Policy Formulation and Implementation (52 FR 41685, Oct. 26, 1987). Copies of the FA are available
upon 
request to the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management at 
the address listed above.



National Environmental Policy Act 


In accordance with Section 304(a)(2) of the Act 
(16 U.S.C. 1434(a)(2)) and the provisions of the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321-4370(a)), a 
DEIS/MP was prepared for the designation and proposed 
regulations. As required by Section 304(a)(2) of the Act, the 
DEIS/MP included the resource assessment report required by 
section 303(b)(3) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1433(b)(3)), maps 
depicting the boundary of the area proposed to be designated, and 
the existing and potential uses and resources of the area. 
Copies of the DEIS/MP were made available for public review on 
September 20, 1991, with comments due on December 13, 1991. 
Public hearings were held in Port Angeles, Seattle, Olympia, 
Aberdeen, Seaview and Washington, DC from November 7 to 20, 
1991. All comments were reviewed and, where appropriate, 
incorporated into the FEIS/MP and these regulations. Copies of 
the FEIS/MP are available upon request (see address section). 


Executive Order 12630 


This rule does not have takings implications within the 
meaning of Executive Order 12630 sufficient to require 
preparation of a Takings Implications Assessment under that 
order. It would not appear to have an effect on private property 
sufficiently severe as effectively to deny economically viable 
use of any distinct legally potential property interest to its 
owner or to have the effect of, or result in, a permanent or 
temporary physical occupation, invasion or deprivation. While 
the prohibition on the exploration, development and production of 
oil, gas and minerals from the Sanctuary might have a takings 
implication if it abrogated an existing lease for OCS tracts 
within the Sanctuary or an approval of an exploration or 
development and production plan, no OCS leases have been sold for 
tracts within the Sanctuary and no exploration or production and 
development plans have been filed or approved.

date of Sanctuary designation and issued by other authorities of 
competent jurisdiction); the disposal of dredged material within 
the Sanctuary other than in connection with beach nourishment
