DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 

 

Forest Service

Prichard Project Area, Idaho Panhandle National Forests, Shoshone County, ID 

 

<ACTION>
action:

 Notice of Availability of the Final Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision for proposed activities
in the Prichard Project Area. 

 



 
</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 Notice is hereby given that the Forest Service has prepared a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) and signed
a Record of Decision documenting a landscape-level approach to ecosystem management in the Prichard Project Area.
The area is located approximately 12 air miles northeast of Wallace, Idaho, and is approximately 29,700 acres in size.


 

Public participation has been on going throughout the project. Comments received during the comment period have
been addressed by appropriate specialists in an appendix located in the FEIS. During the 45 day appeal period comments
and concerns should still be addressed to the planning officer for clarification. 

 The District Ranger is the responsible official for this EIS, and has made the decision to implement alternative 7,
a modification of the preferred alternative in the DEIS. Rationale for this decision can be found in the Record of Decision.
His decision was based upon several factors: Comments and responses from the public, environmental consequences
discussed in the FEIS, and applicable laws, regulations, and policies.



 </SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 A very specific proposed action was developed for the area, and included timber harvest, reforestation activities
and watershed/fisheries rehabilitation as well as wildlife improvements, through implementation of timber sales.
The scope of the proposed action is limited to timber harvesting, reforestation, precommercial thinning, related
road construction, road removal, reconstruction activities and stream channel restoration and stabilization.
During development of the proposed action and alternatives to the proposed action, emphasis has been placed on the
water resource needs and visual concerns of local residents. 

 

Eight alternatives were developed, including a No-Action Alternative. Alternative 7 is the alternative preferred
by the Forest Service. Under Alternative 7, the harvest of green, dead and dying timber is scheduled for implementation
in three separate but related projects. The projects would produce an estimated 10.5 million board feet of timber
and treat 25 timber harvest units. Harvest methods include, commercial thin, salvage, group selection and group
shelterwood using helicopter and cable yarding. In this proposal 1 mile of road will be constructed, 2.39 miles will
be reconstructed and 13.08 will be reconditioned. Road removal projects will involve the treatment of new road construction
and existing roads identified in the road management plan as not being needed for future management needs. With the
removal of roads various miles of stream course will also undergo restoration. 

 Management activities would be administered by the Wallace Ranger District of the Idaho Panhandle National Forests
in Shoshone County, Idaho. This FEIS will tie to the Forest Plan (September 1987) which provides the overall guidance
(Goals, Objectives, Standards and Guidelines, and Management Area direction) in achieving the desired future condition
for this area.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of public hearings. 

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is holding public hearings on the investigation that the Department of
Commerce initiated, on April 5, 1994, to determine the effects on the national security of imports of crude oil and
refined petroleum products under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended. This notice identifies
the issues on which the Department is interested in obtaining the public's views. It also sets forth the procedures
for public participation in the hearings.



 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background and Specific Comments Requested 



On March 11, 1994, the Independent Petroleum Association of America petitioned the Department of Commerce to initiate
an investigation under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862), to determine the
effects on the national security of imports of crude oil and petroleum products. 


On April 5, 1994, the Department of Commerce formally accepted the petition and initiated an investigation. The findings
and recommendations of the investigation are to be reported by the Secretary of Commerce to the President no later
than December 31, 1994 (i.e., within 270 days). For further details on this investigation, see the 

Federal Register

 of April 12, 1994 (59 FR 17335). 



Consistent with the interest of the U.S. Department of Commerce in soliciting public comments on issues affecting
U.S. industry and national security, the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is holding public hearings as part
of the investigation. The presentations at the hearings will assist the Department in determining whether imports
of crude oil and petroleum products constitute a threat to the national security and in formulating remedies if such
a threat is found to exist. 


The Department is particularly interested in comments and information directed to the criteria listed in  705.4
of the National Security Industrial Base Regulations (15 CFR parts 700 to 709) (the ``regulations'') as they affect
national security, including the following: 

(a) Quantity of the articles subject to the investigation and other circumstances related to the importation of such
articles; 
(b) Domestic production and productive capacity needed for these articles to meet projected national defense requirements;

(c) Existing and anticipated availability of human resources, products, raw materials, production equipment,
facilities, and other supplies and services needed to produce these articles; 
(d) Growth requirements of domestic industries needed to meet national defense requirements and the supplies and
services (including investment, exploration and development) necessary to assure such growth;

(e) The impact of foreign competition on the economic welfare of the domestic industry; 
(f) The displacement of any domestic products causing substantial unemployment, decrease in the revenues of government,
loss of investment or specialized skills and productive capacity, or other serious effects; and 
(g) Any other factors that are causing, or will cause, a weakening of our national economy. 



II. Public Hearings and Comment Procedures 



The public hearings are scheduled to be held in New York, New York on Monday, June 6, 1994; in Dallas, Texas, on Monday,

June 13, 1994; and in Santa Clara, California, on Thursday, 
June 16, 1994. The hearings will commence at 8:30 a.m. and end at 5 p.m. The New York hearing will be held in the ceremonial
courtroom of the U.S. Court of International Trade, One Federal Plaza. The Dallas hearing will be held at the Joe C.
Thompson Amphitheatre, Cityplace Center East, 2711 N. Haskill. The Santa Clara hearing will be held at the City of

A. Procedure for Requesting Participation 



The Department encourages interested public participants to present their views orally at the hearings. Any person
wishing to make an oral presentation at the hearings must submit a written request to the Department of Commerce at
the address indicated in the 

ADDRESS 

section of this notice. The request to participate in the hearings must be accompanied by 10 copies of a summary of the
oral presentation. The written request and summary must be received by the Department no later than Monday, May 23,
1994. In addition, the request to speak should contain a daytime phone number where the person who will be making the
oral presentation may be contacted before the hearing. Please note that the submission of comments for presentation
at the public hearings is separate from the request for written comments contained in the April 12, 1994, 

Federal Register

 notice. 

Since it may be necessary to limit the number of persons making presentations, the written request to participate
in the public hearings should describe the individual's interest in the hearings and, where appropriate, explain
why the individual is a proper representative of a group or class of persons that has such an interest. If all interested
parties cannot be accommodated at the hearings, the summaries of the oral 
presentations will be used to allocate speaking time and to ensure that a full range of comments are heard. 

Each person selected to make a presentation will be notified by the Department of Commerce no later than 5 p.m. on Thursday,
May 26, 1994. The Department will arrange the presentation times for the speakers. Attendees will be seated on a first-come,
first-served basis. On the day of the hearing, persons selected to be heard should bring 100 copies of the summary of
their oral presentation to the hearing address indicated in the 

DATES

 section of this notice. 

Copies of the requests to participate in the public hearings and the summaries of the oral presentations will be maintained
at the Bureau of Export Administration's Freedom of Information Records Inspection Facility, room 4525, U.S. Department
of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20230, telephone (202) 482-5653. The
records in this facility may be inspected and copied in accordance with the regulations published in part 4 of title
15 of the Code of Federal Regulations (15 CFR 4.1 

et seq.

) Information about the inspection and copying of records at the facility may be obtained from Ms. Margaret Cornejo,
the Bureau of Export Administration's Freedom of Information Officer, at the above address and telephone number,

between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. 



B. Conduct of the Hearing 



The Department reserves the right to select the persons to be heard at the hearings, to schedule their respective presentations,
and to establish the procedures governing the conduct of the hearing. Each speaker will be limited to 
10 minutes, and comments must be directly related to the criteria listed in  705.4 of the ``regulations''. 

A Commerce official will be designated to preside at the hearings. Representatives from the Departments of Energy
and Interior will also participate in the hearings. This will not be a judicial or evidentiary-type hearing. Only
those conducting the hearing may ask questions, and there will be no cross-examination of persons presenting statements.


 

Any further procedural rules for the proper conduct of the hearing will be announced by the presiding officer.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Minority Business Development Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with Executive Order 11625 and 15 U.S.C. 1512, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is soliciting
competitive applications under its Minority Business Development Center (MBDC) Program. The total cost of performance
for the first budget period (12 months) from October 1, 1994 to September 30, 1995, is estimated at $333,125. The application
must include a minimum cost-share of 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. Cost-sharing
contributions may be in the form of cash contributions, clients fees, in-kind contributions or combinations thereof.
The MBDC will operate in the Riverside, California Geographic Service Area.



The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.


The MBDC program provides business development services to the minority business community to help establish and
maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate public and
private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of management and technical
assistance to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority
business. 

Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: The experience and capabilities of the firm and its staff
in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs of minority businesses,
individuals and organizations (50 points); the resources available to the firm in providing business development
services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to preforming the work requirements included
in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points). An application
must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category to be considered programmatically
acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will then be evaluated
by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the demonstrated responsibility
of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit
findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application
not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point score will not necessarily receive the award.


MBDCs shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. To
assist in this effort, the MBDCs may charge client fees for management and technical assistance (M&TA) rendered.
Based on a standard rate of $50 per hour, the MBDC will charge client fees at 20% of the total cost for firms with gross
sales of $500,000 or less, and 35% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of over $500,000. 

Quarterly reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as an MBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Anticipated processing time of this award is 120 days. Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal
Programs,'' is not applicable to this program. The collection of information requirements for this project have
been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB control number 0640-0006. Questions

reveal if any key individuals associated with the applicant have been convicted of or are presently facing criminal
charges such as fraud, theft, perjury, or other matters which significantly reflect on the applicant's management,
honesty or financial integrity.




Award Termination

_The Departmental Grants Officer may terminate any grant/cooperative agreement in whole or in part at any time before
the date of completion whenever it is determined that the award recipient has failed to comply with the conditions
of the grant/cooperative agreement. Examples of some of the conditions which can cause termination are unsatisfactory
performance of MBDC work requirements, and reporting inaccurate or inflated claims of client assistance. Such inaccurate
or inflated claims may be deemed illegal and punishable by law.




False Statements

and grounds for possible punishment by a fine or imprisonment as provided in 18 U.S.C. 1001.

for the first budget period (12 months) from October 1, 1994 to September 30, 1995 is estimated at $198,971. The application
must include a minimum cost-share of 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. The Federal
amount includes $4,125 for an annual audit fee. Cost-sharing contributions may be in the form of cash contributions,
client fees, in-kind contributions or combinations thereof. The MBDC will operate in the Columbus, Georgia geographic
service area.


The award number for this MBDC will be 04-10-94010-01.
The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.
The MBDC Program provides business development services to the minority business community to help establish and
maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate public and
private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of management and technical
assistance to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority
business.
Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: the experience and capabilities of the firm and its staff
in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs of minority businesses,
individuals and organizations (50 points); the resources available to the firm in providing business development
services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included
in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points). An application
must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category to be considered programmatically
acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will then be evaluated
by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the demonstrated responsibility
of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit
findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application
not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest points score will not necessarily receive the award.

MBDCs shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. To
assist in this effort, the MBDCs may charge client fees for management and technical assistance (M&TA) rendered.
Based on a standard rate of $50 per hour, the MBDC will charge client fees at 20% of the total cost for firms with gross
sales of $500,000 or less, and 35% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of over $500,000.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

As authorized by Section 16 of the Act of March 3, 1901, as amended (15 U.S.C. 278f), the NIST Building and Fire Research
Laboratory conducts directly and through grants and cooperative agreement, a basic and applied fire research program.
Academic institutions, non-Federal agencies, independent and industrial laboratories are considered eligible
for this program. This program has been in existence for several years at approximately $1.5 million per fiscal year.
No increase in funds has taken place. The Fire Research Program is limited to innovative ideas which are generated
by the proposal writer on what research to carry out and how to carry it out. Grants awarded under the Fire Research program
will generally provide financial assistance to the recipient without substantial NIST involvement in the projects.
Cooperative agreements awarded for Fire Research projects will generally involve a close working relationship
between a group of NIST experts and the recipient. No matching funds are required. Proposals will be considered for
research projects from one to three years. All grant proposals submitted must be in accordance with the programs and
objectives listed below.


Program Objectives


a. 

Fire Protection Applications: 

Researcges, develops and demonstrates the application to building fire problems of fire protection analytical
(computerized) tools and methods of assessing the ignition and burning rate of contents of buildings. This includes:
developing a performance based fire code and methods of assessing fire risk; developing methods of evaluating and
predicting the performance of and interactions between building fire safety design features; developing an understanding
of the burning rate of furniture and other building contents; developing a data base that provides the necessary input
to users of the analytical tools; and operating the Fire Research Information Services which supports the entire
laboratory staff and the fire community and has an on-line bibliographic data base.

Performs research on and develops analytical models for the quantitative prediction of the consequences of fires
and the means to assess the accuracy of those models. This includes: Creating advanced, usable models for the calculation
of the effluent from building fires; modeling the spread of fire over furniture and building elements such as walls;
developing field and zone modeling techniques to predict the movement of fire effluent in buildings and the effectiveness
of fire sensors; and developing a protocol for determining the accuracy of both the algorithms used in the fire models
as well as the comprehensive models themselves. 
 
c. 

Large Fire Research: 

Performs research on and develops techniques to measure, predict the behavior of, and mitigate large fire events.
This includes: understanding the mechanisms of large fires that control the gas phase combustion, burning rate,
thermal and chemical emissions, transport processes; developing techniques for computer simulation; developing
field measurement techniques to assess the near and far field impact of large fires and their plumes; performing research
on the use of combustion for environmental cleanup; predicting the performance and environmental impact of fire
protection measures and fire fighting systems and techniques; developing and operating the Fire Research Program
large scale experiment facility. 
 
d. 

Smoke Dynamics Research: 

Produces scientifically sound principles, metrology, data, and predictive methods for the formation/evolution
of smoke components in flames for use in understanding and predicting general fire phenomena. This includes: Research
on the effects of within-flame and post-flame fluid mechanics on the formation and emission of smoke, including particulates,
aerosols, and combustion gases; understanding the mechanistic pathway for soot from chemical inception to post-flame
agglomerates; developing calculation methods for the prediction of the yields of CO (and eventually other toxicant)
as a function of fuel type, availability of air, and fire scale. 
 
e. 

Materials Fire Research: 

Performs research to understand fundamentally the mechanisms that control the ignition, flame spread, and burning
rate of materials and the chemical and physical characteristics that affect these aspects of flammability; develops
methods of measuring and predicting the response of a material to a fire. This includes: characterizing the burning
rates of charring and non-charring polymers and composites; delineating and modeling the enthalpy and mass transfer
mechanisms of materials combustion; and developing computational molecular dynamics and other mechanistic approaches
to understand the relationships between polymer structure and flammability. 
 
f. 

Fire Sensing and Extinguishment: 

Develops understanding, metrology, and predictive methods to enable high-performance fire sensing and extinguishment
systems; devises new approaches to minimizing the impact of unwanted fires and the suppression process. This includes:
research for the identification and 

in-situ 

measurements of the symptoms of pending and nascent fires or explosions, and the consequences of suppression; devising
or adapting monitors for these variables and creating the intelligence for timely interpretation of the data; determining
mechanisms for deflagration and detonation suppression by advanced agents and principles for their optimal use;
modeling the extinguishment process; and developing performance measures for the effectiveness of suppression
system design.
 


Proposal Review Process 
 


All proposals are assigned to the appropriate group leader of the eight programs listed above for review, including
external peer review, and recommendations on funding. Both technical value of the proposal and the relationship
of the work proposed to the needs of the specific program are taken into consideration in the group leader's recommendation

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action:

 Notice of establishment of a Laboratory Accreditation Program (LAP)_NVLAP Calibration Laboratories Accreditation
Program.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 The National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP), National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST), will accept applications from laboratories seeking accreditation under the Calibration Laboratories
Accreditation Program. The program is in accord with the intent of the original request by the National Conference
of Standards Laboratories as announced previously in the 

Federal Register

.


Due to the large number of anticipated responses to this program, applications will be processed in order of the date
received.
Accreditation will be offered to all applicant laboratories that fulfill the requirements of the National Voluntary
Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


This notice is issued in accordance with NVLAP Procedures (15 CFR part 7). In a 

Federal Register

 Notice dated May 18, 1992, (57 FR 21073), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced the
decision to develop the program, ``Accreditation for Calibration Laboratories,'' requested from the National
Conference of Standards Laboratories in a letter dated June 13, 1991, announced in the 

Federal Register

 of August 21, 1991, (56 FR 41526).
Administrative and general technical criteria have been developed and incorporated into a Procedure and General
Requirements Handbook (NIST Handbook 150). A companion draft Calibration Laboratories Technical Guide (NIST Handbook
150-2) contains amplifying technical information for each of the eight fields of calibration. Technical experts,
selected and trained by NVLAP, will use the NIST Handbook 150 and the Technical Handbook to conduct the on-site assessment.
They will present their findings to the applicant calibration laboratory at the time of assessment; however, the
final evaluation will be made by NVLAP-selected panels.
Proficiency testing will be used, along with an on-site assessment, to determine the competence of the applicant
calibration laboratories to perform calibrations at the claimed levels of uncertainty. Proficiency testing will
be conducted annually in at least one parameter for each field of calibration for which a laboratory applies.
An application package consisting of the NIST Handbook 150, Technical Guide, application forms (OMB Control No.
0693-003) and fee schedule will be provided on request. Fees are charged to laboratories seeking accreditation
in two stages. The Stage I fee is standard and is charged to all applicant laboratories. It covers the cost of initial
review of the application, quality manual, and related documentation. The Stage II fee is variable, based on the scope
of accreditation desired by the applicant laboratory.
After the laboratory has successfully fulfilled Stage I, the fees for Stage II will be established to include administrative/technical
support, on-site assessment, and proficiency testing costs.
NVLAP will publish a directory of all accredited calibration laboratories and the accreditation will be renewable
annually.

 Notice of application.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 The Western Systems Power Pool (WSPP) has requested authorization to export electric energy to Canada. The application
has been filed on behalf of most jurisdictional members of WSPP.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 Exports of electricity from the United States to a foreign country are regulated and require authorization under
section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act.



On December 3, 1993, as amended March 17, 1994, the Western Systems Power Pool (WSPP or the Pool) filed an application
with the Office of Fossil Energy (FE) for authorization to export electric energy to Canada pursuant to section 202(e)
of the Federal Power Act. Specifically, WSPP was applied for authorization to transmit electric energy to a foreign
member of the Pool, British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority (BC Hydro), and other future Canadian members. The
Pool's public utility members participating in this application are: 






Arizona Public Service Company

Central and South West Services, Inc.

Central Louisiana Electric Company

Idaho Power Company

Kansas City Power and Light Company

Montana Power Company

Nevada Power Company

Oklahoma Electric Company

(San Diego Gas & Electric and Portland General Electric Company were among the applicant companies when WSPP
applied to Fe. Both companies, by letter to FE, subsequently withdrew from the WSPP application and were individually
issued electricity export authorizations in Docket Numbers EA-100 and EA-97.)



By this joint application, each of the participating Pool members seek an export authorization allowing them to enter
into transactions with BC Hydro which involve the exportation of electricity from the United States. All such transactions
would be pursuant to the terms and conditions of the WSPP's pooling Agreement and service schedules approved by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

The WSPP Agreement effects a marketing arrangement pursuant to which the members provide among themselves prescheduled
and realtime coordinated short-term power and energy transactions. The Agreement also sets forth the limitations
and parameters affecting all WSPP transactions.

The WSPP Agreement contains four service schedules approved by and on file with FERC. All WSPP transactions are conducted
voluntarily among members pursuant to the terms of the service schedules. The transactions are wholesale in nature,
involving no retail sales. Specifically, the schedules provide for (1) Economy Energy Service, (2) Unit Commitment
Service, (3) Firm System Capacity/Energy Sales or Exchanges, and (4) Transmission Service. Significantly, all
transactions among WSPP members must be no more than one year in duration. Also, all transmission services are voluntary.

The WSPP Agreement is not intended to relegate the members to a ``traditional power pool'' arrangement. The Agreement
does not work to supersede any of the contractual relationships of any of the members, and its does not preclude any
of the members from entering into future contractual relationships. In the WSPP application, WSPP asserts that,
in essence, the WSPP is intended to be superimposed on top of its members' other contractual relationships and thereby
serve to capture economic benefits which are not already realized under those existing agreements. Because of its
purpose as a supplemental agreement to facilitate the sale of short-term excess capacity and energy, transactions
under the WSPP agreement involve the use of only existing facilities and do not require the construction of new facilities.

The electric energy to be exported will be delivered by BC Hydro over the international transmission facilities owned
and operated by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). The construction, connection, operation, and maintenance
of these facilities has been authorized by Presidential permits issued pursuant to Executive Order 10485, as amended
by Executive Order 12038. These facilities consist of three electric transmission lines that interconnect with
facilities of BC Hydro: Two 500-kilovolt (kV) lines located at Blaine, Washington, (Presidential Permit PP-10)
and one 230-kV line at Nelway, British Columbia (Presidential Permit PP-46). In addition, BPA's 230-kV transmission
line that connects to West Kootenay Power and Light Company, Limited, also at Nelway, British Columbia, will be used
(Presidential Permit PP-36).

Procedural Matters: Any person desiring to be heard or to protest this application should file a petition to intervene
or protest at the address provided above in accordance with   385.211 or 385.214 of the Rules of Practice
and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211, 385.214).

Any such petitions and protests should be filed with the DOE on or before the date listed above. Additional copies of
such petitions to intervene or protests also should be filed directly with: Michael E. Small, Wright & Talisman,
suite 600, 1200 G Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005-3802.

Pursuant to 18 CFR 385.211, protests and comments will be considered by the DOE in determining the appropriate action
to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must
file a petition to intervene under 18 CFR 385.214. Section 385.214 requires that a petition to intervene must state,
to the extent known, the position taken by the petitioner and the petitioner's interest in sufficient factual detail
to demonstrate either that the petitioner has a right to participate because it is a State Commission; that it has or
represents an interest which may be directly affected by the outcome of the proceeding, including any interest as
a consumer, customer, competitor, or a security holder of a party to the proceeding; or that the petitioner's participation
is in the public interest.

A final decision will be made on this application after a determination is made by the DOE that the proposed action will
not impair the sufficiency of electric supply within the United States or will not impede or tend to impede the coordination
in the public interest of facilities in accordance with section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act. The final decision
would be issued to the individual members of WSPP and not to the Power Pool itself.

Before an export authorization may be issued, the environmental impacts of the proposed DOE action (i.e., granting
the export authorization, with any conditions and limitations, or denying it) must be evaluated pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969.

Copies of this application will be made available, upon request, for public inspection and copying at the address
provided above.

attached to the rest of KNI's system. It is also indicated that KNI has sought authorization to abandon these facilities
in Docket No. CP94-430-000. 

KNGG states that, by applying the modified primary function test as set forth in 

Amerada Hess,

 52 FERC   61,268 (1990), the facilities to be acquired from KNI qualify as gathering facilities exempt from Commission
jurisdiction under Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act. In support of its claim that the facilities are gathering,
KNGG indicates that the subject facilities are short in length, small in diameter, web-like in configuration, and
located entirely within the production area. It is also indicated that the facilities operate at a range of between
100 and 180 psig and are attached to approximately 700 wells throughout the system. KNGG also states that the gas gathered
in the system is delivered into four small field compressors which boost the pressure of the gas sufficiently to enter
Williston's facilities. In addition, KNGG states that the dehydration plants located in the system perform dehydration
required to meet Williston's quality requirements.

FGT further states that it is suspending its Annual Unit Take-or-Pay Surcharge effective June 1, 1994, because of
the cessation of Southern's fixed charge allocations to FGT after May, 1994. Because of the suspension by the FERC
of procedural schedules in the proceedings affecting Southern's allocations of fixed charges and the absence of
actual information regarding April and May, 1994, throughput and recoveries, FGT states that it will make a supplemental
filing within ninety (90) days of the end of the Annual Recovery Period ending May 31, 1994 and make any related tariff
changes at that time.

not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene.
Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

 Acceptance of unsolicited application.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Policy, Planning and Program Evaluation, through the Chicago Operations
Office, announces that it intends to award a grant to the Western Interstate Energy Board (WINB) of Denver, Colorado.
The proposed award meets the criteria in 10 CFR 600.14 (d) and 10 CFR 600.14 (e). The financial assistance is for support
of the Western Interstate Energy Board workshop on the Linkage Between Western Utility Integrated Resource Planning
(IRP) and Regional Transmission Planning in a Competitive Environment. The workshop will be hosted at WINB facilities,
and is scheduled for the May 30, 1994 thru December 31, 1994 timeframe.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The workshop will be attended by Western State representatives, and 2 Canadian provinces from western public utility
commissions. The workshop will consist of state facility siting agencies, governors' energy agencies; and will
address important issues relating to the Energy Policy Act of 1992, particularly Title VII. The objectives of the
conference are:



a. Improve the understanding of the types of linkages (or lack of linkages) between utility-specific IRP, state facility
siting, and regional transmission planning given (1) the current level of competition, (2) increased wholesale
competition and (3) retail competition.
b. Identifying opportunities to enhance coordination of utility-specific IRP and state facility siting with regional
transmission planning.
c. Improving the understanding of the influence of competition on utility-specific IRP in terms of planning objectives,
planning processes, plan outputs and plan implementations, and identify potential changes to utility-specific
IRP to allow IRP to meet planning objectives in a competitive environment.



Results of this workshop will assist the western utilities and consumers in the area by fostering utility cooperation.
The proposed project will improve the understanding of the types of linkages between utility and specific IRP, state
facility siting, and regional transmission planning, identify the opportunities to better coordinate utility
specific IRP and improve the understanding of the effect of competition on utility-specific IRP and the changes in
IRP required by a more competitive environment. Results will favorably impact the cost for producing and transmission
of electricity, and the general public should gain with lower costs to electric utilities.
The DOE will provide funds in the amount of $25,000.00, and the Western Interstate Energy Board will provide $25,636.00
for the 7 months project period.

Campo Band of Mission Indians; Tentative Adequacy Determination of Tribal Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of tentative determination on application of the Campo Band of Mission Indians for full program adequacy determination,
public hearing and public comment period. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal
solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or conditionally exempt small quantity
generator waste will comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C)
requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate permit programs for
MSWLFs. EPA believes that adequate authority exists under RCRA to allow Tribes to seek an adequacy determination
for purposes of sections 4005 and 4010. 


Under separate authority of the Clean Air Act, EPA is reviewing an application for a non-attainment area permit to
construct a proposed MSWLF on the Campo Reservation. There will be a separate public comment period and decision on
that application. 
The Campo Band of Mission Indians (``Campo Band'') applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA.
EPA reviewed the Campo Band's MSWLF application and has made a tentative determination of adequacy for those portions
of the Campo Band's MSWLF permit program that are adequate to assure compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria. These
portions are described later in this notice. The Campo Band has drafted revisions to the remainder of its permit program
to assure complete compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria and gain full approval. EPA has determined that the
Campo Band's revised requirements and emergency regulations, if fully adopted and affirmed before EPA makes a final
determination, would be adequate to ensure compliance with the Federal Criteria.
Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on any determination to approve a Tribe's MSWLF program,
the Region has scheduled a public hearing on this tentative determination. Details appear below in the 

DATES

 section. The Campo Band's application for program adequacy determination is available for public review and comment.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Background 


1. Solid Waste Permit Program Criteria 


On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), 42 U.S.C. 6941-6949(a), requires States (and, as discussed
below, allows Indian Tribes) to develop permitting programs to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria
under part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA determine the adequacy of State municipal solid waste
landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement,
EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures
by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill permit programs. The Agency intends to approve
adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent
on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the
statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting
these requirements. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any
facility, the federal landfill criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities.

EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of STIR. EPA interprets the requirements
for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to impose several
minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that
are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue
a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe must
also provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b)(1) of RCRA.
Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement
authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program.


EPA is further requesting Tribes to provide a statement of legal authority from the Tribal Attorney General or its
equivalent demonstrating that the Tribe has adequate jurisdiction to regulate the MSWLFs on the reservation. In
addition, EPA is requesting a Tribe seeking program approval to demonstrate that it: (1) Is federally recognized;
(2) has a government exercising substantial duties and powers; and (3) is capable of administering a permit program.
If the Tribe has already demonstrated to EPA that it meets the first two of these criteria in the context of the approval
to operate another EPA program, it need not do so again. 

EPA is also requesting Tribes to provide an explanation of the jurisdiction and responsibilities of all Tribal program
implementing agencies (including any State agency acting pursuant to an agreement with the Tribe) and designation
of a lead agency to facilitate communications between EPA and the Tribe. These requests reflect the criteria used
in other environmental statutes to assess whether Tribes may apply for program approval. If a Tribe has already provided
information and/or a legal statement on the Tribe's jurisdiction and capability to operate another EPA program,
EPA requests the Tribe to provide only those additional material necessary to support its application for MSWLF permit
program approval. 

EPA Regions will determine whether a Tribe has submitted an adequate program based on the interpretation outlined
above. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives
full approval to a MSWLF program. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes
the State/Tribal Implementation Rule. 



2. Tribal Programs 



EPA is extending to Tribes the same opportunity to apply for permit program approval as is available to States. Providing
Tribes with the opportunity to apply for adequacy for purposes of adopting and implementing MSWLF permit programs
is consistent with EPA's Indian Policy. This Policy, formally adopted in 1984, recognizes Tribes as the primary sovereign
entities for regulating the reservation environment and commits the Agency to working with Tribes on a ``government-to-government''
basis to effectuate that recognition. A major goal of EPA's Indian Policy is to eliminate all statutory and regulatory
barriers to Tribal assumption of Federal environmental programs. Today's tentative determination to approve a
Tribal MSWLF permit program represents another facet of the Agency's continuing commitment to the implementation
of this long-standing policy. 

EPA's interpretation of RCRA is governed by the principles of 

Chevron, USA 

v. 

NRDC, 

467 U.S. 837 (1984). Where Congress has not explicitly stated its intent in adopting a statutory provision, the Agency
charged with implementing that statute may adopt any interpretation which, in the Agency's expert judgment, is reasonable
in light of the goals and purposes of the statute as a whole. 

Id.

 at 844. Interpreting RCRA to allow Tribes to apply for an adequacy determination satisfies the Chevron test. 

States generally are precluded from enforcing their civil regulatory programs on Tribal lands, absent an explicit
Congressional authorization or State-Tribal agreement to do so. 

California 

v. 

Cabazon Band of Mission Indians,

 480 U.S. 202, 216 and n.18 (1987). Yet, under the current statutory scheme, EPA generally is precluded from enforcing
the MSWLF criteria as well. Furthermore, Congress has not yet created an explicit role for Tribes to implement the
Subtitle D program, as it has done under most other major environmental statutes amended since 1986 (Safe Drinking
Water Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act).


RCRA does not explicitly define a role for Tribes under sections 4005 and 4010 and reflects an undeniable ambiguity
in Congressional intent. Indeed, the only mention of Tribes anywhere in RCRA is in section 1004(13), a part of the definitions
of key terms in RCRA. Section 1004(13) defines the term ``municipality'' to mean;

 


a city, town, borough, county, parish, district or other public body created by or pursuant to State law, with responsibility
for the planning or administration or solid waste management, 

or any Indian tribe or authorized tribal organization or Alaska Native village or organization[.]

 


Id. 

(emphasis added). The term ``municipality'', in turn, is used in sections 4008(a)(2) and 4009(a) of RCRA with reference
to the availability of certain Federal funds and technical assistance for solid waste planning and management activities
by municipalities. Thus, Congress apparently intended to make explicit that Tribes could receive funds and assistance
when available in the same manner as municipal governments. However, Congress did not explicitly recognize any other
role for Tribes under other provisions. There is no accompanying legislative history which explains why Tribes were
included in section 1004(13) and nowhere else. 

EPA does not believe that Congress, by including Tribes in section 1004(13), intended to prohibit EPA from allowing
Tribes to apply for an adequacy determination under subtitle D. First of all, it is clear that Tribes are not ``municipalities''
in the traditional sense. Tribes are not ``public bodies created by or pursuant to State law.'' Indeed, Tribes are
not subject to State law except in very limited circumstances. 

Cabazon

, 

supra.

 Indian Tribes are sovereign governments whose authority is subject only to Congressional approval. 

Worcester 

v. 

Georgia, 

31 U.S. (10 Pet.) 515 (1832). There is no indication in the legislative history that Congress intended to abrogate
any sovereign Tribal authority by defining them as ``municipalities'' under RCRA, i.e., that Congress intended
section 1004(13) to subject Tribes to State law for RCRA purposes. Moreover, it is a well-established principle of
statutory construction that Federal statutes which might arguably abridge Tribal powers of self-government must
be construed narrowly in favor of retaining Tribal rights. F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law, 224 (1981); See,


e.g., Ramah Navajo School Board 

v. 

Bureau of Revenue, 

458 U.S. 832, 846 (1982). 

EPA believes that inclusion of Indian Tribes in section 1004(13) was a definitional expedient, to avoid having to
include the phrase ``and Indian tribes or tribal organizations or Alaska Native villages or organizations'' wherever
the term ``municipality'' appeared, not to change the sovereign status of Tribes for RCRA purposes. Second, given
the limited number of times the term ``municipality'' appears in RCRA, it does not appear that Congress intended to
define an all-inclusive role for Tribes for all potential statutory purposes.

The ambiguity in RCRA regarding Indian Tribes also is evident from the structure of the 1984 Amendments. As mentioned
earlier, Congress expressed a strong preference for a State lead in ensuring compliance with 40 CFR part 258, in that
Section 4005(c) allows EPA to enforce the criteria only after a finding of inadequacy of the State permit program.
Yet, the legislative history of the 1984 Amendments does not suggest that Congress intended to authorize States to
implement such programs on Tribal lands or that Congress intended to override the general legal principle that States
generally are precluded from such implementation. 

Cf. Washington Dept. of Ecology 

v. 

EPA, 

752 F.2d 1465 (9th Cir. 1985) (RCRA Subtitle C does not constitute an explicit delegation of authority to States to
implement hazardous waste programs on Indian lands); 

accord, Nance 

v. 

EPA



1

, 645 F.2d 701 (9th Cir. 1981). Thus, Congress has otherwise put States in a primary role for the MSWLF program, yet on
Indian lands has failed to define how Tribes participate where States lack authority. EPA believes it necessary to
harmonize the conflicts and resolve the ambiguities created by these provisions. 





EPA concludes that interpreting Sections 4005, 4008, and 4010 to allow Indian Tribes to seek an adequacy determination
is reasonable. Several factors enter into this determination. First, as discussed in the previous paragraph, this
approach is consistent with subtitle D because it preserves Congressional intent to limit the Federal government's
role in MSWLF programs. Absent the opportunity to seek a determination of adequacy, there would be few or no adequate
permit programs in place on Indian lands (because the State lacked the authority and the Tribe could not apply for program
approval), potentially resulting in the Federal government assuming a substantial role in MSWLF programs by having
EPA enforce 40 CFR part 258 directly. 

In addition to expanding the Federal role, failure to approve Tribal programs would deny Tribes the option available
to approved States of granting their MSWLF owners and operators flexibility in meeting the requirements of 40 CFR
part 258. The revised Federal criteria (40 CFR part 258) would be implemented without benefit of an EPA approved permit
process. All MSWLFs on Indian Lands, whether Tribal or private, would be in a disadvantaged position relative to other
MSWLFs, being unable to take advantage of the flexibility that Congress built into Sections 4005 and 4010 and that
EPA has incorporated into 40 CFR part 258. By approving Tribal permit programs, however, MSWLFs on Indian Lands would
be under the jurisdiction of the closest sovereign with sufficient permitting authority, 

i.e. 

the Tribe. 

EPA, in accordance with its Indian Policy, has worked to ensure that Congress revises other environmental statutes
(

e.g., 

the Clean Water Act), at the earliest opportunity to define explicitly the role for Tribes under these programs. Yet,
EPA also has stepped in on at least two occasions to allow Tribes to seek program approval despite the lack of an explicit
Congressional mandate. Most recently, EPA recognized Indian Tribes as the appropriate authority under the Emergency
Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), despite silence on the Tribal role under EPCRA. 55 FR 30632 (1990).
EPA reasoned that since EPCRA has no federal role to backup State planning activities, failure to recognize Tribes
as the authority under EPCRA would leave gaps in emergency planning on Indian lands. 54 FR 13000-130001 (1989).


EPA filled such a statutory gap much earlier as well, even before development of its formal Indian Policy. In 1974,
EPA promulgated regulations which authorized Indian Tribes to redesignate the level of air quality applicable to
Indian lands under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program of the Clean Air Act in the same manner
that States could redesignate for other lands. See 

Nance 

v. 

EPA, 

645 F.2d 701 (9th Cir. 1981) (upholding regulations). EPA promulgated this regulation despite the fact that the Clean
Air Act at that time made no reference whatsoever to Indian Tribes or their status under the Act.

2

 





One Court already has recognized the reasonableness of EPA's actions in filling such regulatory gaps on Indian lands.
In 

Nance, supra, 

the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed EPA's PSD redesignation regulations described in the previous
paragraph. The Court found that EPA could reasonably interpret the Clean Air Act to allow for Tribal redesignation,
rather than allowing the States to exercise that authority or exempting Indian lands from the redesignation process.


Id. 

at 713. The Court noted that EPA's rule was reasonable in light of the general existence of Tribal sovereignty over
activities on Indian lands. 

Id.

 at 714. 

Today's tentative determination to approve a tribal MSWLF permit program is analogous to the rule upheld in 

Nance. 

EPA is proposing to fill a gap in jurisdiction on Indian lands. As with the redesignation program, without recognition
of Tribal MSWLF programs, there would be no acceptable way to implement at the Federal level a key statutory provision,
i.e., the MSWLF permitting process. 

Furthermore, the case law supporting EPA's interpretation is even stronger today than at the time of the 

Nance

 decision. First, the Supreme Court reaffirmed EPA's authority to develop reasonable controlling interpretations
of environmental statutes. 

Chevron, supra.

 Second, the Supreme Court has emphasized since 

Nance

 that Indian Tribes may regulate activities on land belonging to the Tribe or held by the United States in trust for the
Tribe. 

Montana 

v. 

United States, 

450 U.S. 544, 557 (1981). All land within the Campo Reservation is tribal trust land. 

In the case of MSWLFs, EPA believes that improperly maintained MSWLFs would not be protective of human health (including
that of Tribal members) and the environment (including Indian lands). Tribes are likely to be able to assert regulatory
authority over landfills on tribal lands to protect these interests. Allowing Tribes to seek adequacy would reflect
general principles of Federal Indian law. Thus, as in 

Nance, 

EPA believes that allowing Tribes to apply for program approval reflects the sovereign authority of Tribes under
Federal law.

To have its MSWLF permit program deemed adequate by EPA, a tribe must have adequate authority over the regulated activities.
Indian reservations include lands owned in fee by non-Indians. The extent of Tribal authority to regulate activities
by non-Indians on such land has been the subject of considerable recent discussion. The test for civil regulatory
authority over nonmember lands within Indian reservations was stated in 

Montana 

v. 

U.S., 

450 U.S. 544, 565-66 (1981) (citations omitted): 



To be sure, Indian tribes retain inherent sovereign power to exercise some forms of civil jurisdiction over non-Indians
on their reservations, even on non-Indian fee lands. A tribe may regulate * * * the activities of non-members
who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members, through commercial dealing, contracts, leases,
or other arrangements. * * * A tribe may also retain inherent power to exercise civil authority over
the conduct of non-Indians on fee lands within its reservation when that conduct threatens or has some direct effect
on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe. 



In 

Brendale 

v. 

Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakima Indian Nation, 

492 U.S. 408 (1989), the Court applied this test. Both the State of Washington and the Yakima Nation asserted authority
to zone non-Indian real estate developments on two parcels within the Yakima reservation, one in an area that was primarily
Tribal, the other in an area where much of the land was owned in fee by nonmembers. Although the Court analyzed the issues
and the appropriate interpretation of 

Montana

 at considerable length, the nine members split 4:2:3 in reaching the decision that the Tribe should have exclusive
zoning authority over property in the Tribal area and the State should have exclusive zoning authority over non-Indian
owned property in the fee area. 
Specifically, the Court recognized Tribal authority over activities that would threaten the health and welfare
of the Tribe, 492 U.S. at 443-444 (Stevens, J., writing for the Court); 

id.

 at 449-450 (Blackmun, J. concurring). Conversely, the Court found no Tribal jurisdiction where the proposed
activities ``would not threaten the Tribe's * * * health and welfare.'' 

Id.

 at 432 (White, J., writing for the Court). Given the lack of a majority rationale, the primary significance of 

Brendale 

is in its result, which was fully consistent with 

Montana 

v. 

United States. 
In evaluating whether a Tribe has authority to regulate a particular activity on land owned in fee by nonmembers but
located within a reservation, EPA will examine the Tribe's authority in light of the evolving case law as reflected
in Montana 

and 

Brendale 

and applicable Federal law. The extent of such Tribal authority depends on the effect of that activity on the Tribe.
As discussed above, in the absence of a contrary statutory policy, a Tribe may regulate the activities of non-Indians
on fee lands within its reservation when those activities threaten or have a direct effect on the political integrity,
the economic security, or the health or welfare of the Tribe. 

Montana, 

450 U.S. at 565-66. For further discussion of this issue see 56 FR 64876. 
However, in 

Brendale 

several justices argued that for a Tribe to have ``a protectable interest'' in an activity, the activity's effect
should be ``demonstrably serious * * *.'' 

Brendale, 

492 U.S. at 431 (White, J.). In addition, in a more recent case involving Tribal criminal jurisdiction, a majority
of the Court indicated in 

dicta

 that a Tribe may exercise civil authority ``where the exercise of tribal authority is vital to the maintenance of tribal
integrity and self-determination.'' 

Duro 

v. 

Reina, 

110 S.Ct. 2053, 2061 (1990). 

See also Brendale,

 492 U.S. at 450 (Blackmun, J.) (test for inherent Tribal authority whether activities ``implicate a significant
tribal interest''); 

id.

 at 462 (Blackmun, J.) (test for inherent Tribal authority whether exercise of authority ``fundamental to the political
and economic security of the tribe * * *''). 
As discussed above, the Supreme Court, in recent cases, has explored several options to assure that the impacts upon
Tribes of the activities of non-Indians on fee land, under the 

Montana 

test, are more than 

de minimis, 

although to date the Court has not agreed, in a case on point, on any one reformulation of the test. In response to this
uncertainty, the Agency will apply, as an interim operating principle, a formulation of the standard that will require
a showing that the potential impacts of regulated activities of non-members on the Tribe are serious and substantial.

The choice of an Agency operating principle containing this standard is taken solely as a matter of prudence in light
of judicial uncertainty and does not reflect an Agency endorsement of this standard 

per se.

 Moreover, as discussed below, the Agency believes that the activities regulated under the various environmental
statutes generally have serious and substantial impacts on human health and welfare. As a result, the Agency believes
that Tribes usually will be able to meet the Agency's operating principle, and that use of such a test by the Agency should
not create an improper burden of proof on Tribes or create the administratively undesirable result of checkerboarding
reservations. 
Whether a Tribe has jurisdiction over activities by nonmembers will be determined case-by-case, based on factual
findings. The determination as to whether the required effect is present in a particular case depends on the circumstances.
Nonetheless, the Agency also may take into account the provisions of environmental statutes and any legislative
findings that the effects of the activity are serious in making a generalized finding that Tribes are likely to possess
sufficient inherent authority to control reservation environmental quality. See, 

e.g., Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass'n 

v. 

DeBenedictis, 

480 U.S. 470, 476-77 and nn.6, 7 (1987). As a result, in making the required factual findings as to the impact of
a solid waste activity on a particular Tribe, it may not be necessary to develop an extensive and detailed record in
each case. The Agency also may rely on its special expertise and practical experience regarding the importance of
solid waste management.

The Agency believes that Congressional enactment of RCRA establishes a strong Federal interest in effective management
of solid waste. EPA also notes that, where solid waste affects ground water which has pathways that allow it to migrate
readily, it would be practically very difficult to separate out the effects of solid waste disposal on non-Indian
fee land within a reservation from those on Tribal portions. In other words, any environmental impairment that occurs
on, or as a result of, activities on non-Indian fee lands is very likely to impair Tribal lands. This also suggests that
the serious and substantial effects of solid waste within the non-Indian portions of a reservation are very likely
to affect Tribal health and welfare. EPA believes that a ``checkerboard'' system of regulation, whereby the Tribe
and State split up regulation of solid waste on the Indian Lands, would exacerbate the difficulties of assuring compliance
with RCRA requirements. 
The Agency also believes that the effects on Tribal health and welfare necessary to support Tribal regulation of non-Indian
activities on Indian Lands may be easier to establish in the context of environmental regulation than with regard
to zoning, which was at issue in 

Brendale. 

There is a significant distinction between land use planning and environmental regulation of solid waste under RCRA.
The Supreme Court has explicitly recognized such a distinction: ``Land use planning in essence chooses particular
uses for the land; environmental regulation does not mandate particular uses of the land but requires only that, however
the land is used, damage to the environment is kept within prescribed limits.'' 

California Coastal Comm'n 

v. 

Granite Rock Co., 

480 U.S. 572, 587 (1987). The Court has relied on this distinction to support a finding that States retain authority
to carry out environmental regulation even in cases where their ability to carry out general land use regulation is
preempted by federal law. 

Id. 

at 587-89. 
Further, management of solid waste serves the purpose of protecting public health and safety, which is a core governmental
function, whose exercise is critical to self-government. The special status of governmental actions to protect
public health and safety is well established.

3

 By contrast, the power to zone can be exercised to achieve purposes which have little or no direct nexus to public health
and safety. See, e.g., 

Brendale

, 492 U.S. at 420 n.5 (White, J.) (listing broad range of consequences of state zoning decision). Moreover, solid waste
may affect ground water, which is mobile, freely migrating from one local jurisdiction to another, sometimes over
large distances. By contrast, zoning regulates the uses of particular properties with impacts that are much more
likely to be contained within a given local jurisdiction. 




Operationally, EPA's generalized findings regarding the relationship of solid waste management to Tribal health
and welfare will affect the legal analysis of a Tribal submission by, in effect, supplementing the factual showing
a Tribe makes in applying for program approval. Thus, a Tribal submission regarding jurisdiction on fee lands will
need to make a relatively simple showing of facts that there is or may be solid waste within the meaning of Subtitle D
on the reservation and that the Tribe or Tribal members could be subject to exposure to that waste. The Tribe also must
explicitly assert that activities of non-Indians regarding that waste would have a serious and substantial effect
on the health and welfare of the Tribe. Once the Tribe meets this initial burden, EPA will, in light of the facts presented
by the Tribe and the generalized statutory and factual findings regarding the importance of solid waste discussed
above, presume that there has been an adequate showing of Tribal jurisdiction on fee lands, unless an appropriate
governmental entity (e.g., an adjacent Tribe or State) demonstrates a lack of jurisdiction on the part of the Tribe.

The Agency recognizes that jurisdictional disputes between Tribes and States can be complex and difficult. However,
EPA's ultimate responsibility is protection of the environment. In view of the mobility of environmental problems,
and the interdependence of various jurisdictions, it is imperative that all affected sovereigns work cooperatively
for environmental protection. 
For purposes of this determination, Tribe is defined to mean any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group
or community which is recognized by the Secretary of the Interior or Congress and which exercises substantial governmental
duties and powers over any area. While the definition of Tribes in today's determination does not explicitly include
Alaska Native Villages, EPA has not determined that such entities are ineligible to apply for permit program approval.
Alaska Native entities (e.g., villages) may apply for permit program approval. Alaska Native Villages that demonstrate
that their permit programs meet the requirements of today's proposal will be deemed adequate. 


B. Campo Band of Mission Indians 


On February 15, 1994, the Campo Band submitted an application for adequacy determination. EPA reviewed the Campo
Band's application and tentatively determined that the following portions of the Tribe's Subtitle D program will
ensure compliance with the revised Federal Criteria: 
1. General criteria governing scope and applicability, definitions, and consideration of other federal laws (40
CFR 258.1, 258.2, 258.3); 
2. Location restrictions for airport safety, floodplains, wetlands, fault areas, seismic impact zones, unstable
areas, and closure of existing units (40 CFR 258.10, 258.11, 258.12, 258.13, 258.14, 258.15, and 258.16); 
3. Operating criteria for exclusion of hazardous waste, cover material requirements, disease vector control, explosive
gases control, air criteria, access requirements, run-on/run-off control systems, surface water requirements,
liquids restrictions, and recordkeeping requirements (40 CFR 258.20, 258.21, 258.22, 258.23, 258.24, 258.25,
258.26, 258.27, 258.28, and 258.29); 
4. Design criteria (40 CFR 258.40); 
5. Groundwater monitoring and corrective action criteria governing applicability (40 CFR 258.50); 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940511-2-00070 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940511-2-00046 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

6. Closure and post-closure care requirements (40 CFR 258.60 and 258.61); 
7. Financial assurance criteria governing applicability and effective date, and allowable mechanisms (40 CFR 258.70
and 258.74). 
Not all States/Tribes will have existing permit programs through which they can ensure compliance with all provisions
of the revised Federal Criteria. Were EPA to restrict a State/Tribe from submitting its application until it could
ensure compliance with the entirety of 40 CFR part 258, many States/Tribes would need to postpone obtaining approval
of their permit programs for a significant amount of time. This delay in determining the adequacy of the State/Tribal
permit program while the State/Tribe revises its statutes, codes or regulations could impose a substantial burden
on owners and operators of landfills because the State/Tribes would be unable to exercise the flexibility available
to States/Tribes with permit programs which have been approved as adequate. 
The Campo Band needs to revise aspects of its permit program to ensure compliance with the following provisions of
the Federal Criteria: 
1. Groundwater monitoring and corrective action criteria for groundwater monitoring systems, sampling and analysis
requirements, detection monitoring program, assessment monitoring program, and corrective action implementation
(40 CFR 258.51, 258.53, 258.54, 258.55, and 258.58). Although existing CEPA regulations ensure compliance with
the federal assessment of corrective measures and selection of remedy requirements (40 CFR 258.56 and 258.57) in
and of themselves, it would be impossible to separate compliance with these portions of CEPA's regulations from the
rest of CEPA's groundwater monitoring program. Therefore, if CEPA does not fully adopt draft regulatory changes
to the groundwater monitoring systems, sampling and analysis requirements, detection monitoring program, assessment
monitoring program, and corrective action implementation requirements, EPA cannot approve CEPA for the assessment
of corrective measures and selection of remedy portions of its program. 
2. Financial assurance criteria for closure, post-closure and corrective action (40 CFR 258.71, 258.72, and 258.73).

The Campo Band submitted an amendment to its application for program adequacy determination on April 18, 1994. The
Campo Band's amendment included draft revised requirements for those parts of the Campo Band's existing program
that are not adequate to ensure compliance with the federal criteria. EPA Region 9 reviewed the Campo Band's amendment
to its application and determined that these draft regulatory requirements would be adequate to ensure compliance
with the Federal Criteria. 
If the draft regulatory requirements submitted to EPA on April 18, 1994 are fully adopted before EPA makes a final determination,
then EPA proposes to fully approve the Campo Band's MSWLF program. If all the necessary draft regulatory requirements
are not adopted with the relevant effective dates or are adopted with altered language that would not clearly assure
compliance with the Federal Criteria, then EPA proposes to partially approve the Campo Band's program. Partial approval
would only be for those portions of the Campo Band program that assure compliance with the Federal Criteria. 
In addition, before EPA grants partial or full program approval, the Campo Band must reaffirm the February 13, 1994
promulgation of the emergency regulations submitted with the Campo Band's February 15, 1994 final application.
Although the Campo Band's emergency regulations are currently in effect, they remain in effect only 180 days after
February 13, 1994 unless the original promulgation is affirmed. The emergency regulations must be affirmed without
altered language that would not clearly assure compliance with the Federal Criteria in order for EPA to approve those
portions of the Campo Band program governed by the emergency regulations. 
The Campo Band has demonstrated that the Campo Band of Mission Indians is a Federally recognized Tribe. See 53 FR 52830
(December 29, 1988). The Constitution (the ``Constitution'') of the Campo Band of Mission Indians establishes a
General Council that serves as the Campo Band's governing body and enumerates the Council's powers and responsibilities.
Among the enumerated powers, the Constitution authorizes the General Council to establish subordinate entities
for the Band and, by appropriate ordinances and resolutions, to delegate to such subordinate entities any of the powers
and duties of the General Council. Pursuant to this power under the Constitution and by Resolution No. 88-005,
the General Council established the Campo Environmental Protection Agency (CEPA) for the purpose of protecting
public health and safety and the environment. CEPA is charged with the administration and enforcement of the solid
waste management permitting and regulatory compliance programs. 
All land within the Campo Reservation is tribal trust land. The Campo Band has established that the Campo Band of Mission
Indians has adequate jurisdiction over the land of the Campo Reservation based on general principles of Tribal sovereignty,
the Band's status as a ``federally recognized Indian Tribe,'' the Tribal Constitution, a map and narrative description
which established the boundaries of the Reservation and copies of Tribal codes and regulations. 
In making today's tentative determination that the Campo Band's MSWLF permit program is adequate, the Agency has
tentatively determined that the Tribe has adequate authority over the activities regulated by such a program. In
its application, the Campo Band has also demonstrated that it has adequate resources to manage a MSWLF permit program
and adequate authority to issue permits, ensure compliance monitoring and enforcement, and to provide for intervention
in civil enforcement proceedings. 
Region 9 will hold a public hearing on this determination from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. June 30, 1994 at the Alpine Elementary
School Auditorium, 1850 Alpine Blvd., Alpine, California, 91901. An open house is scheduled for 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. on
June 30, 1994 at the Alpine Elementary School Auditorium to give the public an opportunity to discuss the tentative
approval before the hearing. The public may submit written comments on EPA's tentative determination until the close
of the public comment period July 14, 1994. Copies of the Campo Band's application and supporting documents are available
for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the ``Addresses'' section of this notice. 
EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period and
public hearing. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of adequacy or inadequacy for
the Campo Band's program. EPA will make a final determination on whether or not to approve the Campo Band's program
and will give notice of it in the 

Federal Register

. The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all major comments.

Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce
the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained
in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal
program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October
9, 1991).

<DOCTITLE>Entomopathogen; Extension of an Exemption from Requirement of a Tolerance </DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 







</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has extended the temporary exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of the insecticide fungal
entomopathogen 

Beauvaria bassiana

, Naturalis-L strain, and has broadened the tolerance to include residues in or on all raw agricultural commodities.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA issued a notice that was published in the 

Federal Register

 of August 4, 1993 (58 FR 41473) that a temporary exemption from the requirement of a tolerance had been amended for residues
of the insecticide fungal entomopathogen 

Beauvaria bassiana

, Naturalis-L strain in or on the following raw agricultural commodities: cotton seed; peanuts; peanut forage; peanut
hay; tomatoes; lettuce; cantaloupe; cabbage and peppers for the control of boll weevil, whiteflies and leafhoppers.
This exemption from the requirement of a tolerance has been estended in response to pesticide petition (PP) 2G4157,
submitted by Fermone Corporation, Incorporated, 2620 No. 37th Drive, Phoenix, AZ 85009. 


The company has requested an expansion to include all raw agricultural crops and a 1-year extension of the temporary
tolerance to permit the continued marketing of the above raw agricultural commodities when treated in accordance
with the provisions of experimental use permit 53871-EUP-1, which is being issued under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended (Pub. L. 95-396, 92 Stat. 819; 7 U.S.C. 136). 

The scientific data reported and other relevant material were evaluated, and it was determined that the exemption
from the requirement of a tolerance will protect the public health. Therefore, the temporary exemption from the requirement
of a tolerance has been extended and expanded on the condition that the pesticides be used in accordance with approved
experimental use permits and with the following provisions:

1. The total amount of the active ingredients to be used must not exceed the quantity authorized by approved experimental
use permits.

2. Fermone Corporation must immediately notify the EPA of any findings from the experimental use that have a bearing
on safety. The company must also keep records of production, distribution, and performance and on request make the
records available to any authorized officer or employee of the EPA or the Food and Drug Administration. 

This temporary exemption from the requirement of a tolerance expires January 18, 1995. Residues remaining in or on
all the raw agricultural commodities after this expiration date will not be considered actionable if the pesticides
are legally applied during the term of, and in accordance with, the provisions of the experimental use permit and temporary
exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This temporary exemption from the requirement of a tolerance may be
revoked if the experimental use permit is revoked or if any experience with or scientific data on this pesticide indicate
that such revocation is necessary to protect the public health.

The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12866.


Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemption from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

<DOCTITLE>Cancellation of Tariffs for Failure To Comply With Automated Tariff Filing and Information System (``ATFI'') Filing
Requirements (European Trade)</DOCTITLE>


By Order published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 69,365) on December 30, 1993 (``December Order''), the Commission directed 35 carriers with tariffs on file
in the European trade areas to show cause why their paper tariffs should not be cancelled for failure to register and
file a tariff in ATFI by the required data (

i.e., 

August 27, 1993). This action was taken pursuant to section 8 of the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C. app. 1707), the Commission's
regulations implementing ATFI at 46 CFR Part 514 and Supplemental Report Nos. 2, 3 and 4 issued in Docket No. 90-23,
Notice of Inquiry on Ocean Freight Tariffs in Foreign and Domestic Offshore Commerce (Automated Tariff Filing and
Information System).






Formal responses were filed on behalf of CarAmerica S.R.L. (``CarAmerica''), Hermann Ludwig GMBH & Co. (``Hermann
Ludwig''), and Compania Trasatlantica Espanola, S.A. (``CTE''). CarAmerica requested that the Commission refrain
from cancelling its paper tariff until its ATFI tariff becomes effective. Hermann Ludwig stated it was not serving
the United States trade and was reorganizing the company. It requested the Commission to refrain from cancelling
its paper tariff since it intended to register and file a tariff in ATFI under its new name. CTE requested that the Commission
cancel its tariffs since it no longer serves the United States.
CarAmerica's ATFI Tariff No. 001 was filed and became effective on March 12, 1994, so this firm will be dismissed from
the proceeding.
The Commission believes that Hermann Ludwig was given adequate notice of the AFTI filing time frames and therefore
should not be granted any further extension. Moreover, as noted above, it is no longer serving the United States trades
nor has it evidenced its intent to do so by registering to file an ATFI tariff under its new corporate name. Accordingly,
its tariff will be cancelled.
CTE has not filed an ATFI tariff and moreover has asked that its tariff be cancelled. The Commission will grant CTE's
request.
The Commission did not receive responses from 17 of the respondents. None of these respondents have registered in
ATFI or filed an ATFI tariff. They will have their tariffs or portions of tariffs applicable to the European trade cancelled.
The 15 remaining carriers have filed their tariffs in ATFI or cancelled their paper tariffs, and will be dismissed
from the proceeding, along with CarAmerica.
Therefore, 

It is Ordered 

that the tariffs or portions of tariffs currently on file with the Commission with European scope of the carriers identified
in Appendix A to this Order be cancelled effective five days from publication of this Order in the 

Federal Register

.
It is Further Ordered, That the parties listed in Appendix B to this order are dismissed from this proceeding.



By the Commission.

Public Law 102-375 and Public Law 103-171.

C. Program Description


President Clinton announced in February that he has formally called for a White House Conference on Aging to be convened
in May 1995.
Previous White House Conferences in 1961, 1971 and 1981 adopted recommendations that resulted in local, state and
Federal initiatives which improved the security and well being of older Americans. The 1995 Conference will produce
recommendations that will meet the needs of Older Americans in the twenty-first century.
A White House Conference on Aging in intended to produce policy recommendations to guide national aging policy over
the next decade. In Public Law 102-375, the Older Americans Act amendments of 1992, Congress specifically identified
six primary purposes for the Conference. They are:
(1) To increase public awareness of the interdependence of generations and the essential contributions of older
individuals to society for the well-being of all generations;
(2) To identify the problems facing older individuals and the commonalities of the problems with problems of younger
generations;
(3) To examine the well-being of older individuals including the impact the wellness of older individuals has on our
aging society;
(4) To develop such specific and comprehensive recommendations for executive and legislative action as may be appropriate
for maintaining and improving the well-being of the aging;
(5) To develop recommendations for the coordination of Federal policy with State and local needs and the implementation
of such recommendations; and
(6) To review the status and multigenerational value of recommendations adopted at previous White House Conferences
on Aging.
Of major significance to the 1995 White House Conference on Aging in direct participation by individuals and organizations
in the pre-conference stages. As part of this grass roots effort, the WHCoA has adopted a four pronged approach that
includes local forums, mini-conferences as well as State and Regional conferences. The purpose of these events is
to identify those issues of mutual concern to the aging population and to develop recommendations that warrant specific
attention by the White House Conference of Aging. An integral part of this strategy is the conduct of mini-conferences
which are topic or constituency specific. The recommendations from these conferences will play an integral role
in the development of the agenda for the 1995 Conference.
In order for a mini-conference to be considered for funding, the proposed event must:
(1) Be a policy oriented event. The focus of the event must be either:
(a) On one of the following specific Federal policy issues:

Instructions for the SF-424A
General Instructions


This form is designed so that application can be made for funds from one or more grant programs. In preparing the budget,
adhere to any existing Federal grantor agency guidelines which prescribe how and whether budgeted amounts should
be separately shown for different functions or activities within the program. For some programs, grantor agencies
may require budgets to be separately shown by function or activity. For other programs, grantor agencies may require
a breakdown by function or activity. Sections A, B, C, and D should include budget estimates for the whole project except
when applying for assistance which requires Federal authorization in annual or other funding period increments.
In the latter case, Sections A, B, C, and D should provide the budget for the first budget period (usually a year) and
Section E should present the need for Federal assistance in the subsequent budget periods. All applications should
contain a breakdown by the object class categories shown in Lines a-k of Section B.

This certification is required by regulations implementing the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, 45 CFR Part 76, Subpart
F. The regulations, published in the May 25, 1990 

Federal Register

, require certification by grantees that they will maintain a drug-free workplace. The certification set out below
is a material representation of fact upon which reliance will be placed when the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) determines to award the grant. If it is later determined that the grantee knowingly rendered a false certification,
or otherwise violates the requirements of the Drug-Free Workplace Act, HHS, in addition to any other remedies available
to the Federal Government, may taken action authorized under the Drug-Free Workplace Act. False certification or
violation of the certification shall be grounds for suspension of payments, suspension or termination of grants,
or governmentwide suspension or debarment. 

Workplaces under grants, for grantees other than individuals, need not be identified on the certification. If known,
they may be identified in the grant application. If the grantee does not identify the workplaces at the time of application,
or upon award, if there is no application, the grantee must keep the identity of the workplace(s) on file in its office
and make the information available for Federal inspection. Failure to identify all known workplaces constitutes
a violation of the grantee's drug-free workplace requirements. 

Workplace identifications must include the actual address of buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where
work under the grant takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used (e.g., all vehicles of a mass transit authority
or State highway department while in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, performers in
concert halls or radio studios.) 

If the workplace identified to HHS changes during the performance of the grant, the grantee shall inform the agency
of the change(s), if it previously identified the workplaces in question (see above). 

Definitions of terms in the Nonprocurement Suspension and Debarment common rule and Drug-Free Workplace common
rule apply to this certification. Grantees' attention is called, in particular, to the following definitions from
these rules: 

``Controlled substance'' means a controlled substance in Schedules I through V of the Controlled Substances Act
(21 U.S.C. 812) and as further defined by regulation (21 CFR 1308.11 through 1308.15). 

``Conviction'' means a finding of guilt (including a plea of nolo contendere) or imposition of sentence, or both,
by any judicial body charged with the responsibility to determine violations of the Federal or State criminal drug
statutes; 

``Criminal drug statute'' means a Federal or non-Federal criminal statute involving the manufacture, distribution,
dispensing, use, or possession of any controlled substance; 

``Employee'' means the employee of a grantee directly engaged in the performance of work under a grant, including:
(i) All ``direct charge'' employees; (ii) all ``indirect charge'' employees unless their impact or involvement
is insignificant to the performance of the grant; and, (iii) temporary personnel and consultants who are directly
engaged in the performance of work under the grant and who are on the grantee's payroll. This definition does not include
workers not on the payroll of the grantee (e.g., volunteers, even if used to meet a matching requirement; consultants
or independent contractors not on the grantee's payroll; or employees of subrecipients or subcontractors in covered
workplaces). 

The grantee certifies that it will or will continue to provide a drug-free workplace by: 

(a) Publishing a statement notifying employees that the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession
or use of a controlled substance is prohibited in the grantee's workplace and specifying the actions that will be taken
against employees for violation of such prohibition; 

(b) Establishing an ongoing drug-free awareness program to inform employees about: 

(1) The dangers of drug abuse in the workplace; (2) the grantee's policy of maintaining a drug-free workplace; (3)
Any available drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employee assistance programs; and, (4) The penalties that may
be imposed upon employees for drug abuse violations occurring in the workplace; 

(c) Making it a requirement that each employee to be engaged in the performance of the grant be given a copy of the statement
required by paragraph (a); 

(d) Notifying the employee in the statement required by paragraph (a) that, as a condition of employment under the
grant, the employee will: 

(1) Abide by the terms of the statement; and, (2) Notify the employer in writing of his or her conviction for a violation
of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace no later than five calendar days after such conviction; 

(e) Notifying the agency in writing, within ten calendar days after receiving notice under subparagraph (d)(2) from
an employee or otherwise receiving actual notice of such conviction. Employers of convicted employees must provide
notice, including position title, to every grant officer or other designee on whose grant activity the convicted
employee was working, unless the Federal agency has designated a central point for the receipt of such notices. Notice
shall include the identification number(s) of each affected grant; 

(f) Taking one of the following actions, within 30 calendar days of receiving notice under subparagraph (d)(2), with
respect to any employee who is so convicted: 

(1) Taking appropriate personnel action against such an employee, up to and including termination, consistent with
the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; or, (2) Requiring such employee to participate satisfactorily
in a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for such purposes by a Federal, State, or local health,
law enforcement, or other appropriate agency; 

(g) Making a good faith effort to continue to maintain a drug-free workplace through implementation of paragraphs
(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f).

<DOCTITLE>Determination of Regulatory Review Period for Purposes of Patent Extension; Reality

TM

 Female Condom</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined the regulatory review period for the Reality

TM

 Female Condom and is publishing this notice of that determination as required by law. FDA has made the determination
because of the submission of an application to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Department of Commerce,
for the extension of a patent which claims that medical device.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-417) and the Generic Animal Drug
and Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100-670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive,
or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's
regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.


A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: a testing phase and an approval phase. For medical devices,
the testing phase begins with a clinical investigation of the device and runs until the approval phase begins. The
approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market the device and continues until permission
to market the device is granted. Although only a portion of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount
of extension that the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks may award (half the testing phase must be subtracted
as well as any time that may have occurred before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory
review period for a medical device will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C.
156(g)(3)(B).
FDA recently approved the Reality

TM

 Female Condom for marketing. The Reality

TM

 Female Condom is a medical device that is indicated for use to help prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases,
including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, during vaginal intercourse. Subsequent to this approval,
the Patent and Trademark Office received a patent term restoration application for the Reality

TM

 Female Condom (U.S. Patent No. 4,976,273) from Chartex International Plc; the Patent and Trademark Office requested
FDA's assistance in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. In a letter dated July 28,
1993, FDA advised the Patent and Trademark Office that this medical device had undergone a regulatory review period,
and the approval of the Reality

TM

 Female Condom represented the first commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter, the Patent and
Trademark Office requested that the FDA determine the product's regulatory review period.
FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for the Reality

TM

 Female Condom is 2,017 days. Of this time, 1,460 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period,
while 557 days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:
1. 

The date the first clinical trial on this device was begun

: October 31, 1987. The clinical trial cited by the applicant was conducted outside the United States and was not subject
to FDA's requirement for an investigational device exemption (IDE) under section 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (the act) nor FDA's requirement for an institutional review board (IRB) approval under section 520(g)(3)
of the act. Therefore, the testing phase begins on the date the device is first used with human subjects as part of a clinical
investigation to be filed with FDA to secure premarket approval of the device (21 CFR 60.22(c)(1)(iii)). The applicant
has stated that the date on which the device was first used with human subjects as part of a clinical investigation to
be filed with FDA to secure premarket approval of the device was October 31, 1987. Because of the circumstances previously
described for the clinical trial cited by the applicant, FDA has no record in which to review this date (21 CFR 60.20(c)(6).
Although FDA cannot, therefore, confirm that testing began as stated by the applicant, FDA is using this date as the
start of the testing phase.
2. 

The date an application was initially submitted with respect to the device under section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act

: October 29, 1991. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that the premarket approval application (PMA) for the Reality

TM

 Female Condom (PMA P910064) was initially submitted on October 29, 1991.
3. 

The date the application was approved

: May 7, 1993. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that PMA P910064 was approved on May 7, 1993.
This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension.
However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual
period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 717 days of patent term
extension.
Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before July 11, 1994, submit to the Dockets
Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore, any interested
person may petition FDA, on or before November 7, 1994, for a determination regarding whether the applicant for extension
acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition must contain sufficient
facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41-42, 1984.) Petitions
should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30.
Comments and petitions should be submitted to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) in three copies (except
that individuals may submit single copies) and identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading
of this document. Comments and petitions may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

Supporting Statement for Information Collection_Notice of Fund-Availability_FY 1994_Indian Applicants Under
the Home Program


A. Justification


1. This information collection is required in connection with the publication in the 

Federal Register

 of a Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA) which announced the availability of $12.750 million for the HOME Program for
Indian tribes. The NOFA is authorized by the HOME Investment Partnerships Act (Pub. L. 101-625, dated 11/28/90).
The HOME Program provides funds to Indian tribes to expand the supply of affordable housing for very low-income and
low-income persons. HUD regulations 24 CFR part 92, subpart M apply specifically to the Indian HOME Program. The HOME
Act was amended 10/28/92 by the Housing and Community Development (HCDA) Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-550). Some
provisions of the HCDA 1992 directly affect the enactment. Copies of the 1994 HOME NOFA and applicable HUD regulations
are attached.
The information collection requirements imposed by the NOFA are as follows:
Section III (entirety)_Application requirements: Standard Form-424, Form HUD-4121.1, Indian HOME
Program Grants Comprehensive Approach, Form HUD-4122.1, Indian HOME Program Grants Project Summary, Form
HUD-4123-I, Indian HOME Program Grants, Cost Summary, Form HUD-4125-I, Indian HOME Program
Grants, Implementation Schedule, Form HUD-4126-I, Indian HOME Program Grant Certifications, narrative
and supporting documentation that are responsive to the selection criteria including a description of how the HOME
funds will be used, and the various kinds of information that are necessary in order to apply the selection criteria
and rating factors.
2. The information is necessary so that the applicants can apply and compete for funding opportunities under this
NOFA. The information provided by the applicants will be reviewed by HUD and evaluated against rating criteria for
possible funding. The applicants will be notified of their selection/rejection.
3. We have not considered the use of improved technology since there is no other way to obtain the information except
directly from the entities.
4. There will be no duplication of information.
5. There is no similar information already available which could be used or modified for this purpose.
6. We attempted to minimize the burden on the applicants by developing an application which limits the number of pages
(not to exceed five).
7. The information will be collected on a one-time basis.
8. There are no special circumstances that require the collection to be conducted in a manner which is inconsistent
with the guidelines in 5 CFR 1320.6.
9. There has been no outside consultation on this information collection.
10. No assurances of confidentiality is provided.
11. No sensitive questions are asked.
12. We do not estimate that there will be any additional cost to the Federal Government. The applicants will be reviewed
in accordance with HUD's existing review and monitoring requirements. Annual cost to the respondent is estimated
to be minimal since the application submission may be prepared by the Indian Housing Authorities.
13. We estimate that the information requirements of the proposed NOFA will have the following reporting burden:

Information Collection Submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for Review Under the Paperwork Reduction
Act


The proposal for the collection of information listed below has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget
for approval under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35). Copies of the proposed collection
of information and related forms and explanatory material may be obtained by contacting the Bureau's Clearance Officer
at the phone number listed below and or by writing the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Projects
(1004-34), Washington, DC 20503.


Title: 

Coal Management, 43 CFR Group 3400.


OMB Approval Number: 

1004-0073.


Abstract: 

The Federal Coal Management Program regulations are located at 43 CFR Group 3400 and require applicants, lessees,
licensees, and/or operators involved in operations for the discovery, testing, development, mining or processing
of Federal coal to submit information to the Bureau of Land Management. The information required is needed to allow
the authorized officer, on behalf of the Federal Government, to: gather data relevant to the extent and qualities
of the public coal resource and to the environmental impacts of coal leasing and development; manage the leasing and
development of coal in the public interest; determine the qualifications of prospective lessees and licensees to
mine; properly administer the statutes applicable to coal mining, production, resource recovery and protection,
operations, and exploration on Federal leases and licenses; ensure that lessees comply with applicable statutes,
regulations, and policies; and ensure that accurate records are kept of all Federal coal produced.
No revisions to the regulations are being proposed at this time. Information requirements are located in several
sections of the regulations. All requirements are consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's authority to:
Manage federally owned coal through leasing or exchange; oversee exploration, development, production, resource
recovery and protection, diligent development, continued operation, preparation, handling, and certain abandonment
operations on Federal coal lands; and require that coal mining operations are conducted in an environmentally sound
manner. In many cases, a specific form is not required to collect information as that information is generated as part
of routine industry practice. In these cases, information requirements in the regulations are acceptable in any
form which meets the regulatory specifications. The obligation to respond is generally required to obtain a benefit,
although it is mandatory for some requirements once the lease or license is obtained.
Failure to collect the information covered by this information collection would result in violations of statute
and in lack of knowledge about Federal coal resources and would reduce the effectiveness of the program in meeting
policy and statutory objectives.


Frequency: 

On occasion, quarterly, semiannually, and annually.


Description of Respondents: 

Coal lessees, licensees, operators, applicants, and members of the general public.


Estimated completion time: 

On average, 19 hours.


Annual Responses: 

1,299.


Annual Burden Hours: 

24,737.

<SUMMARY>

SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has prepared a draft Environmental Impact Statement
for the Oro Cruz Operation of the American Girl Project, a proposed gold mining operation on public lands in Imperial
County, California. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The proposed action is a surface and underground mining project on unpatented lode and placer claims on public lands
in Imperial County, California. About 2.5 million tons of ore and 8.5 million tons of waste rock would be mined from
two open pits, the Cross Pit and the Queen Pit, during an estimated two year period. The Queen Pit would be backfilled
upon completion of mining. Underground mining would begin in the Cross Pit and be conducted concurrently with surface
mining. One-half million tons of ore and 65,000 tons of waste rock would be produced during a three year period. Ore
produced by both surface and underground mining would be transported 2.5 miles by haul trucks to existing mill and
heap leach facilities in American Girl Canyon via a proposed haul road. Waste rock would be disposed of in the Queen
Pit, and on one large and three smaller waste rock dumps. Aggregate for use in stabilizing underground mine workings
would be hauled from a quarry near the existing American Girl Canyon facilities to the Cross Pit along the same haul
road. Surface disturbance resulting from the proposed action would total 191 acres.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent and scoping.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) will be directing the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
for the proposed Bald Mountain/Alligator Ridge Project in White Pine County, Nevada. This EIS will be prepared by
contract and funded by the proponent, Placer Dome U.S. The BLM invites comments and suggestions on the scope of the
analysis.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Placer Domer U.S. has submitted to the Ely BLM District Office a Plan of Operations (POO). The POO describes proposed
mining operations, including required access, for an area in White Pine County approximately 60 miles northwest
of Ely, Nevada. The Buck and Bald Mining District has been active since 1984 with mineral exploration of the area and
open pit/heap leach gold mining. There are currently six separate mining operations and five are operated by Placer
Domer U.S. The other is Western State's White Pine Gold Mine at the northern end of the mining district. Placer Dome
U.S. is proposing to expand their operation at Bald Mountain Mine by opening the Sage flats area and by establishing
a new processing plant and heap/tailings facility. The Sage Flat area would be mined and ore transported to Placer
Dome's current heap leach facility at the Bald Mountain Mine. The new heap/tailing facility operation would process
2.5 million tons per year and would consist of a new crushing facilities and tailing disposal area. The company also
proposes to open a new open pit mine and heap leach facility in the Mooney Basin. This operation would consist of seven
pits and would mine ore at a rate of 1.5 million tons per year. These modifications to the mine plan and new mine operations
would allow Placer Dome U.S. to operate for seven more years.



The issues expected to be analyzed in the EIS are impacts to: Surface and groundwater, threatened and endangered species,
cultural resources, wildlife, wild horses and mine reclamation. Cumulative impacts for the mining district will
be analyzed in detail and will cover the complete mining district.

<DOCTITLE>Real Action; Proposed Direct Sale </DOCTITLE>



May 2, 1994. 



The following described public lands have been examined and determined to be suitable for transfer out of Federal
ownership by direct sale under the authority of Sections 203 and 209 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of
1976, as amended (90 Stat. 2750; 43 U.S.C. 1713 and 90 Stat. 2757; 43 U.S.C. 1719), at not less than the appraised fair
market value: 



Willimette Meridian, Oregon 



T. 11 S., R. 7 W., 



Sec. 14, Lot 5, (Parcel A), 

Sec. 23, Lot 1, (Parcel B), 

Sec. 23, Lot 2, (Parcel C).

 


The above-described parcels aggregate 1.53 acre in Benton County. 

 


The parcels will not be offered for sale until at least 60 days after publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The fair market value of the parcels have not yet been determined. Anyone interested in knowing the values may request
this information from the address shown below. 

The above-described lands are hereby segregated from appropriation under the public laws, including the mining
laws, but not from sale under the above-cited statute, for 270 days or until title transfer is completed or the segregation
is terminated by publication in the 

Federal Register

, whichever occurs first. 

The parcels are difficult and uneconomic to manage as part of the public lands and are not suitable for management by
another Federal department or agency. No significant resource values will be affected by this transfer. Because
of the parcels' relatively small size and lack of physical or legal access, their best use is to merge them with the adjoining
ownerships. The sale is consistent with the Westside Management Framework Plan and the public interest will be served
by offering these parcels for sale. 

The parcels are being offered only to the following individuals: Parcel A to Daniel L. Marshall, contract purchaser,
and Judith A. Heintz, aka Judith A. Fullen, fee owner of Tax Lot 1100, Map 11 7 14; Parcel B to Beverly Clair, fee owner
of Tax Lot 201, Pam 11 7 23; and Parcel C to Jerry L. and Patsy M. Boyd, fee owners of Tax Lot 603, Map 11 7 23. Use of the direct
sale procedures authorized under 43 CFR 2711.3-3, will avoid inappropriate land ownership patterns and would
recognize equities of the individuals involved. 

The terms, conditions, and reservations applicable to the sale are as follows: 

1. The above-named individuals will be required to submit a deposit of either cash, bank draft, money order, or any
combination thereof for not less than the appraised value of the parcel to be sold. 

2. The mineral interests being offered for conveyance have no known mineral value. A bid will also constitute an application
for conveyance of the mineral estate, in accordance with Section 209 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act.
The above-named individuals must include with their bid a nonrefundable $50.00 filing fee for the conveyance of the
mineral estate. 

3. The conveyance documents will be subject to: 

a. Rights-of-way for ditches or canals will be reserved to the United States under 43 U.S.C. 945. 

b. All valid existing rights and reservations of record. 

Detailed information concerning the sale is available for review at the Salem District Office, 1717 Fabry Road SE,
Salem, Oregon 97306. 

For a period of 45 days from the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

, interested parties may submit comments to the Alsea Area Manager, Salem District Office, at the above address. Any
adverse comments will be reviewed by the Salem District Manager, who may sustain, vacate, or modify this realty action.
In the absence of any adverse comments, this realty action will become the final determination of the Department of
the Interior.

On May 2, 1994, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) issued a permit (PRT-789799) to the University of
Florida, College of Veterinary Medicine to import one Galapagos tortoise (

Geochelone elephantopus

) from the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador. The 30-day public comment period required by section 10(c) of the Endangered
Species Act was waived. The Service 
determined that an emergency affecting the health and life of this tortoise existed and that no reasonable alternative
was available to the applicant. The tortoise required life-saving emergency surgery which could not be performed
on the Galapagos Islands nor in Ecuador

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Availability of a Draft Revised Recovery Plan for the Green Pitcher Plant for Review and Comment</DOCTITLE>

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of document availability and public comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of a draft revised recovery
plan for the green pitcher plant (

Sarracenia oreophila

). Populations are known to occur in northeast Alabama (Cherokee, DeKalb, Etowah, Jackson, and Marshall Counties),
north Georgia (Towns County), and southwest North Carolina (Clay County). A historical record exists for Tennessee.
Habitat for the green pitcher plant varies somewhat with populations located in moist upland areas and others along
boggy, sandy stream edges. With the exception of a few sites on State park land, populations occur on privately owned
lands. The Service solicits review and comment from the public on this draft plan.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 





Background



Restoring endangered or threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining
members of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program.
To help guide the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native
to the United States. Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish
criteria for the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the
recovery measures needed.

The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that a public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment to provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.

The species considered in this draft recovery plan is the green pitcher plant (

Sarracenia oreophila

). This carnivorous plant occurs in moist upland areas and along boggy, sandy stream edges of northeastern Alabama,
north Georgia, and southwest North Carolina. The green pitcher plant was listed as endangered in 1979 due to its limited
distribution, and loss or decline in populations due to agricultural conversion, increased rural residential development,
encroachment by woody plants due to hydrological alterations and fire suppression, and commercial and amateur collecting.

The objective of this proposed plan is to delist the green pitcher plant. Delisting will be considered when a minimum
of 18 viable populations, representing the diversity of habitats and the geographic range of the species, are protected
and managed as necessary to ensure their continued existence. Actions needed to reach this goal include: (1) Protecting,
managing, and monitoring populations, (2) surveying for new populations, (3) gathering additional baseline and
hydrological information, (4) studying pollination biology and conducting genetic analyses of populations, (5)
monitoring transplant and reestablishment experiments, (6) preserving genetic stock, and (7) continuing public
education efforts.

This Plan is the second revision of the original and is being submitted for technical and agency reviews. After consideration
of comments received during the review period, it will be submitted for final approval.



Public Comments Solicited



The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified
above will be considered prior to approval of the plan.



Authority



The authority for this action is Section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f).

Calcium Aluminate Cement and Cement Clinker From France 



Determination 



On the basis of the record

1

 developed in the subject investigation, the Commission unanimously determines,

2

 pursuant to section 735(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1673d(b)) (the Act), that an industry in the United States
is not materially injured or threatened with material injury, and the establishment of an industry in the United States
is not materially retarded, by reason of imports from France of calcium aluminate cement and cement clinker, provided
for in subheadings 2523.30.00 and 2523.10.00, respectively, of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States,
that have been found by the Department of Commerce to be sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV). 






Background 



The Commission instituted this investigation effective November 1, 1993, following a preliminary determination
by the Department of Commerce that imports of calcium aluminate cement and cement clinker from France were being sold
at LTFV within the meaning of section 733(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b(b)). Notice of the institution of the Commission's
investigation and of a public hearing to be held in connection therewith was given by posting copies of notices in the
Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC, and by publishing notices in the 

Federal Register

 of December 22, 1993 (58 FR 67809) and the 

Federal Register

 of March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11088). The hearing was held in Washington, DC, on March 31, 1994, and all persons who requested
the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel. 

The Commission transmitted its determination in this investigation to the Secretary of Commerce on May 2, 1994. The
views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2772 (May 1994), entitled ``Certain Calcium Aluminate
Cement and Cement Clinker from France: Investigation No. 2772 (Final).''

 Notice. 



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined not to review an initial determination
(ID) issued by the presiding administrative law judge (ALJ) in the above-captioned investigation. The ALJ granted
the joint motion of complainants Nordstrom Valves, Inc. (``Nordstrom'') and Measurement and Flow Control Holding
Co., Inc. (MF&C) to terminate respondents Natural Gas Products Co. (``NGPC'') and Friatec AG Keramik und Kunststoffwerke
(``Friatec'') on the basis of a settlement agreement. The ALJ also granted the motion of Nordstrom and MF&C to
withdraw their complaint against the only remaining respondents, MT Deason, Inc. (``MTD'') and Power and Process,
Inc. (``P&P''). 

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On November 8, 1993, complainants Nordstrom and MF&C filed a complaint with the Commission alleging violations
of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 in the importation and sale of certain plastic ball valves and components thereof
which are allegedly covered by four claims of U.S. Letters Patent 4,047,275, which is owned by MF&C and licensed
to Nordstrom. The Commission instituted an investigation of the complaint on December 16, 1993. 58 F.R. 65731. 



On January 28, 1994, complainants and respondents NGPC and Friatec filed a joint motion to terminate the investigation
based on a settlement agreement. On the same date, complainants filed a motion to withdraw the complaint as to the final
respondents, MTD and P&P. Both motions were supported by the Commission investigative attorney. On April 4,
1994, the ALJ issued an ID granting both motions. No petitions for review, or agency or public comments were received.


This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1337) and section 210.53
of the Commission's Interim Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 210.53).

<DOCTITLE>Certain Tape Dispensers; Issuance of General Exclusion Order</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>

 U.S. International Trade Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has issued a general exclusion order in the above-captioned
investigation.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The authority for the Commission's determination is contained in section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended
(19 U.S.C. 1337), and in section 210.58 of the Commission's Interim Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 210.58).



Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Corporation (``3M'') filed an amended complaint on June 30, 1993, under section
337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1337) alleging that three respondents: (1) Acurite Industries Corp.; (2) Fancy
International (HK) Ltd.; and (3) Charles Leonard, Inc., had violated section 337 in the importation into the United
States, the sale for importation, or the sale within the United States after importation of certain tape dispensers.
The tape dispensers are alleged to infringe a design patent, U.S. Letters Patent Des. 289,180 (the '180 patent). The
Commission instituted this investigation by notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 21, 1993, at 58 FR 39036. The Commission terminated Fancy International as a respondent and added Hoi Fung Industrial
Company, Safina Office Products, and Shiang Shin Trading Company as respondents by notice published on November
10, 1993, at 58 FR 59735. The notice of investigation was further amended on January 12, 1994, after a request by 3M to
terminate respondent Shiang Shin Trading Company and to change the name of respondent Safina Office Products to Shiang
Shin International Inc. d/b/a Safina Office Products. 59 FR 1762-1763. 
On December 23, 1993, the presiding administrative law judge (ALJ) issued a final initial determination (``ID'')
finding that there was a violation of section 337. The ALJ found that U.S. Letters Patent Des. 289,180 is infringed
and that a domestic industry exists with respect to the patent claim in issue. On January 21, 1994, the Commission determined
not to review the ID, which thereby became the determination of the Commission. The Commission also requested written
submissions concerning the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding. 59 FR 3868-3869 (January 27,
1994). 


On April 5, 1994, the Commission made its determinations on the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding.
The Commission determined that the appropriate form of relief is a general exclusion order prohibiting the importation
of infringing tape dispensers. Finally, the Commission determined that the public interest factors enumerated
in 19 U.S.C. 1337 (d), (f), and (g) do not preclude the issuance of the aforementioned relief, and that the bond during
the Presidential review period shall be in the amount of 220 percent of the entered value of the infringing tape dispensers.



Copies of the Commission order, the Commission opinion in support thereof, and all other nonconfidential documents
filed in connection with this investigation are or will be available for inspection during official business hours
(8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.) in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street, SW., Washington,
DC 20436, telephone 202-205-2000. Hearing-impaired persons are advised that information on the matter
can be obtained by contacting the Commission's TDD terminal on 202-205-1810.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This announcement consists of four parts: Part I_Background, Part II_Application Process, Part III_Statement
of Work, and Part IV_Evaluation Criteria.



Part I_Background



The Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA), in collaboration with other Federal agencies,
has undertaken a series of initiatives: (1) To enhance the effectiveness of and to better coordinate the services
provided through a variety of programs and (2) to enhance the competitiveness of the American worker. An important
aspect of these initiatives is to elicit the participation and involvement of private sector firms both by a direct
approach to major firms and by developing strategies and materials that will provide assistance to State and local
officials in dealing with small and medium-size employers.

A key tenet of this effort is that the delivery of programs should be customer-focused. To accomplish this, there is
a need to elicit direct input from a broad range of employers on the services available through various ETA programs
and to obtain detailed views of these private sector ``customers'' on ways to ultimately improve services to employment
and training clients.

It is important for potential grantees to recognize that the support requested depends to a substantial degree on
the enactment of legislation proposed or to be proposed to the Congress. While the Department favors the enactment
of such legislation, there is no assurance that such bills will be enacted or that there will not be substantial revisions
in the bills enacted into law.



Part II_Application Process



A. Eligible Applicants



Awards under this Solicitation will be made to non-profit organizations.



B. Submission of Proposals



An original and three (3) copies of the proposal shall be submitted. The proposal shall consist of two (2) separate
and distinct parts.

Part I shall contain the cost proposal, consisting of the following items: Standard Form (SF) 424, ``Application
for Federal Assistance'' (Appendix No. 1) and SF 424A, ``Budget'' (Appendix No. 2). Also, the budget shall include
on a separate page(s) a detailed cost analysis of each line item in the budget.

Part II shall contain a technical proposal that demonstrates the applicant's capabilities in accordance with the
Statement of Work contained in this announcement. Applicants are strongly encouraged to submit a technical proposal
of less than one hundred fifty (150) pages in length (exclusive of appendices) which sets forth the applicant's explanation
of how it proposes to accomplish the elements described in the Statement of Work.

<PARENT> FR940511-2-00092 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

No cost data or reference to price shall be included in the technical proposal. In order to assist applicants in preparing
their proposals and to facilitate the expeditious evaluation by the review panel, proposals should be organized
and presented in the same sequential order as the Evaluation Criteria in Part IV of this announcement.



C. Hand-Delivered Proposals



Proposals should be mailed at least five (5) days prior to the closing date. However, if proposals are hand-delivered,
they must be received at the designate place by 2 p.m., Eastern Time by June 15, 1994. All overnight mail will be considered
to be hand-delivered and must be received at the designated place by the specified closing date. Telegraphed and/or
faxed proposals will not be honored. Failure to adhere to the above instructions will be a basis for a determination
of nonresponsiveness.



D. Late Proposals



Any proposal received at the office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt will
not be considered unless it is received before award is made and it_

(1) Was sent by U.S. Postal Service registered or certified mail not later than the fifth calendar day before the date
specified for receipt of application (e.g., an offer submitted in response to a solicitation requiring receipt of
applications by the 20th of the month must have been mailed by the 15th); or

(2) Was sent by U.S. Postal Service Express Mail Next Day Service_Post Office to Addressee, not later than 5 p.m. at
the place of mailing two working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals. The term ``working days''
excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.

The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a late proposal sent either by U.S. Postal Service
registered or certified mail is the U.S. postmark both on the envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt from the
U.S. Postal Service. Both postmarks must show a legible date or the proposal, shall be processed as if mailed late.
``Postmark'' means a printed, stamped, or otherwise placed impression (exclusive of a postage meter machine impression)
that is readily identifiable without further action as having been supplied and affixed by employees of the U.S. Postal
Service on the date of mailing. Therefore, applicants should request the postal clerk to place a legible hand cancellation
``bull's eye'' postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper.



E. Withdrawal of Proposals



Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice or telegram (including mailgram) received at any time before award.
Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an applicant or an authorized representative thereof, if the representative's
identity is made known and the representative signs a receipt for the proposal before award.



F. Period of Performance



The period of performance will be 12 months from the date of execution.



G. Funding



DOL has set aside up to $1.8 million to be disbursed for all categories.



H. Option to Extend



Based on the availability of funds, effective program operation, and the needs of the Department, the grants may be
extended for up to two option years.



Part III_Statement of Work



Each of the following initiatives has a specific set of parameters, activities, and tasks:



A. School-to-Work



The United States is the only industrialized nation that lacks a comprehensive system to help its youth acquire the
knowledge, skills and information about the labor market necessary to make an effective transition from school to
career-oriented work. Three-fourths of America's high school students enter the workforce without college degrees.

Many do not possess the basic academic and occupational skills necessary for the workplace or to pursue further education.


The Departments of Labor and Education have made the development of a school-to-work system a high priority. The ``School-to-Work
Opportunities Initiative'' builds on earlier work of the two Departments as well as exemplary programs at the State
and local levels. The ``School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994'' was developed by the Departments of Labor and
Education and was signed into law by the President on May 4, 1994.


This legislation provides a broad framework for effective school-to-work strategies and seed money for statewide
and local implementation of school-to-work systems. During Fiscal Year 1994, the Departments are using pre-existing
legislative authority to begin developmental activities.

As envisioned, States and localities will have considerable flexibility to design and implement programs which
fit their individual circumstances and unique needs. However all programs will share some basic components:


1. 

Work-based learning

 that provides a planned program of job training and experience, paid work experience, workplace mentoring and instruction
in workplace competencies and in a broad variety of elements of an industry.


2. 

School-based learning

 that provides career exploration and career counseling, instruction in a career major (selected no later than the
11th grade), a program of study that is based on high academic and skill standards and typically involves at least one
year of post secondary education, and periodic evaluations to identify students' academic strengths and weaknesses.


3. 

Connecting Activities

 that coordinate involvement of employers, schools and students, matching students and work-based learning opportunities,
and training teachers, mentors, and counselors.


Students, upon successful completion, will receive a high school diplomas, or its equivalent; a certificate or diploma
from a post-secondary institution, if appropriate; and a skill certificate.


At the State level, the Governor, the chief state school officials and state agency officials responsible for job
training and employment, economic development, post secondary education and other appropriate offices will collaborate
in the planning and development of the state school to work system. At the local level, partnerships that consist of
employers, secondary and post secondary education institutions, labor organizations and other local community
and business leaders will design and administer school-to-work programs.


The Departments of Labor and Education are supporting State and local developmental and implementation activities
by providing grants and through research, evaluation, technical assistance and other support activities. For those
States who are ready to move beyond developmental activities, the two Departments are making available a limited
number of larger, multi-year implementation grants. States will be selected to receive these grants through a competitive
process with an anticipated award date of July 1994.


Employers must play a critical role in designing and implementing school to work strategies. Successful programs
will require the active involvement of the business community. Employers, in partnership with labor, must define
the skill requirements for jobs, participate equally in the governance of the program, offer quality learning experiences
for the students at the worksite, and provide jobs for students and graduates.


Thus, development of an effective school-to-work ``system'' requires the active involvement of a substantial portion
of this nation's business community. Accomplishing this objective is a daunting and challenging task. Employers
must be convinced that it is in their best interest to participate in such arrangements.


Employers who agree to participate may need assistance in developing the capacity to transform their workplaces
into quality learning environments a well as assuming other partnership roles. Experience to date suggests that
a multitude of approaches are needed to effectively mobilize this nation's business community.


State Officials involved in school-to-work transition have indicated that this is an area where federal assistance
is needed. Accordingly, applicants interested in this portion of the solicitation shall explain how they intend
to accomplish the following objectives:


1. Create awareness among the business community about the ``School-to-Work Opportunities Initiative'' in general
and, more specifically the business role in developing and administering the system;


2. Build demand among the business community to participate in local partnerships;


3. Develop capacity of business to participate as an active partner in local school-to-work opportunities program;


4. Broker the formation of coalitions of business and of local partnerships among business, education, labor (where
appropriate) and community organizations to develop and administer local school-to-work opportunities programs.

Provide direct assistance to State and local programs in achieving employer involvement and assistance in developing
effective local programs. This may entail training of State and local staff, on-site involvement to obtain major
employer representation and participation in the local School-to-Work Program and other assistance as requested
by local or state programs.

States and localities will be organizing their implementation of school-to-work systems around broad industry/occupational
clusters. Accordingly, the Department is seeking to complement State and local effort by providing business related
assistance focused around broad industry clusters.

Thus, the Department is seeking applicants that can organize their efforts around broad industry groups that would
at least include: Manufacturing, service, retail and wholesale trade, and finance, insurance and real estate. Within
each sector, applicants must be able to demonstrate their ability to enlist the support of both leading edge companies
and small and mid-size firms.

In addition, applicants must indicate the major occupational clusters within each industry sector that the organization
believes offers the greatest potential for inclusion in school-to-work transition opportunities programs. The
Department is seeking to work closely with the applicant(s) that is selected for these partnership activities, but
not to prescribe the methods the applicant will employ to accomplish the objectives laid out above. The Department
recognizes that those applicants which have demonstrated the capability to deliver services have established methods
and processes for reaching and supporting the employer community.

Each applicant proposal for this section of the Statement of Work must include:

1. A comprehensive implementation plan for providing targeted assistance to States as they move forward to implement
their school-to-work transition systems. Such plan must have specific actions what will be accomplished within
the grant period.

2. A brief description of all proposed technical assistance guides, videos, promotional materials, newsletters
and other materials and publications developed under this grant. Complete drafts of these materials are to be submitted
for review and, as necessary revision prior to publication/release.

3. A listing of significant events sponsored by the organization that relates to the objectives of this grant, regardless
of whether this is the primary purpose of the event.

4. A plan for assessment of the incentives, both financial and nonfinancial, that will be required to recruit their
members participation in local school-to-work opportunities programs, on a large-scale basis.



B. Skill Standards



The Department wants to promote the active involvement of business organizations in the development of national
voluntary skill standards. Once established these standards are designed to meet the needs of the current and potential
workforce, from high school dropouts to graduates of school-to-work. programs, from dislocated workers to workers
progressing along a career path. Business participation and leadership in these activities is critical to achieving
our major objectives of a common language of skill classification and a portable credential.

Therefore, proposals submitted in response to this section of the Statement of Work should include a strategy, implementation
plan and timetable for the following elements:

1. 

Marketing.

 To include information sharing, promotion and generate interest among the business community, broadly defined,
of activities in this area and informing workers of the benefits of the system for enhancing their ability to enter
or reenter the workforce or move up in a career progression;

2. 

Coalition Building.

 To prepare the business community for participation in voluntary partnerships encourage by the National Skill Standards
Board to be established under the GOALS 2000: Educate American Act (this would include stimulating business participation
as well as courting business partnerships with representatives from the education and training community, State
and local governments, community-based organizations and organized labor);

3. 

Research.

 To draw the linkage between high performance work organization, skill standards and competitiveness gains, and
to examine the connection between the human resource requirements of ISO 9000 and the Malcolm Baldrige Award using
skill standards as a tool.



C. Reemployment Program Activities



Each year more than one-fourth of the workforce move to new jobs either to advance careers or to rebound from a job loss.
The Administration plans a major investment to help experienced workers move from one job to the next to equip workers
with skills needed for the new jobs of the future.

Currently, over 60 Federal programs deliver job training and employment services to Americans_each with its own
funding mechanisms, eligibility criteria and range of services. DOL/ETA presently administers six separate programs
focused on dislocated workers: Economic Dislocation and Worker Adjustment Assistance, Defense Conversion Program,
Defense Diversification Program, Clean Air Employment Transition Assistance, Trade Adjustment Assistance and
North Atlantic Free Trade Act-Bridge.
Applicants seeking to submit a proposal for this portion of the solicitation shall include the following:
1. 

One-Stop Career Centers.

 Grantees will propose a strategy for developing effective local support for one-stop career centers and the local
level governance approach to such centers. This will require the development of an approach to building business
support for Workforce Investment Boards, where they are created and for training of both members of such boards and
staff.
(a) The grantees will develop and introduce a strategic planning model to assist local areas on implementing effective
governance of one stop career centers and the relationship of such centers to the needed services. This will include
the dissemination of workforce investment principles and presentations to major employer organizations and their
membership of these principles to obtain support and participation.
(b) Develop and disseminate, in consultation with ETA, models (or best practices) for implementing workforce Investment
Boards, with specific emphasis on the relationship with existing structures such as Private Industry Councils or
other existing local boards;
(c) Develop and provide methods to build capacity and/or orient board members to ensure success; and,
(d) Provide recommendations on staffing needs for such local bodies.
(2) 

Worker Adjustment.

 The Worker Adjustment initiative will require grantees, in consultation with ETA, to undertake research efforts
and disseminate technical assistance and training materials to support worker adjustment services for experienced
workers. Proposals shall include:
(a) Review of the delivery structure for delivery of rapid response assistance, how it is controlled, what role substate
grantees play and ``best practices'' of effective Dislocated Worker Units.
(b) Examination of effective layoff aversion through rapid response and dissemination of what has been tried, what
has worked, who does it and how much it costs.
(c) Technical assistance material on relocation opportunities for discrete groups of dislocated technical, professional
and managerial workers. To what extent have organizations developed systems to match clusters of dislocated professionals
with job openings in other areas and what can be undertaken to expand or enhance these efforts.
(d) Examination of various approaches and development of a specific approach for obtaining customer feedback (including
participants, hiring employers and discharging employers) concerning their services offered and the timing of
such services.
(e) Examination of the delivery structure for dislocated worker services_What organizations are substate grantees
under Title III? How many are Title II administrative entities? How many use essentially the same process for dislocated
workers as disadvantaged workers? What is the delivery structure for workers receiving services under TAA? What
recommendations can be made for improving or restructuring the delivery of these services, especially under a comprehensive
program approach?


PART IV_EVALUATION CRITERIA


Prospective offerors are advised that the selection of grantees for awards is to be made after careful evaluation
of proposals by an evaluation panel within DOL. Applicants are advised that discussions may be necessary in order
to clarify any inconsistencies in their applications. The panel results are advisory in nature and not binding on
the Grant Officer. The final decision on the award will be based on what is most advantageous to the Federal Government
as determined by the ETA Grant Officer. Panelists will evaluate the proposals on the basis of the following factors:

<USBUREAU>Employment Standards Administration Wage and Hour Division</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions</DOCTITLE>



General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.

The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR part 1, Appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.

Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.

General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 

Federal Register

, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Rate Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.

Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., room S-3014, Washington, DC 20210.

1, section 1.5.) Contracts for which bids have been opened shall not be affected by this notice. Also, consistent with
29 CFR 1.6(c)(2)(i)(A), when the opening of bids is within ten (10) days of this notice, the contract specifications

<DOCTITLE>Investigations Regarding Certifications of Eligibility To Apply for NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance</DOCTITLE>



Petitions for transitional adjustment assistance under the North American Free Trade Agreement-Transitional
Adjustment Assistance Implementation Act (P.L. 103-182), hereinafter called (NAFTA-TAA), have been filed
with State Governors under Section 250(a) of Subchapter D, Chapter 2, Title II, of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended,
are identified in the Appendix to this Notice. Upon notice from a Governor that a NAFTA-TAA petition has been
received, the Director of the Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance (OTAA), Employment and Training Administration
(ETA), Department of Labor (DOL), announces the filing of the petition and takes actions pursuant to paragraphs (c)
and (e) of Section 250 of the Trade Act.

The purpose of the Governor's actions and the Labor Department's investigations are to determine whether the workers
separated from employment after December 8, 1993 (date of enactment of Pub. L. 103-182) are eligible to apply
for NAFTA-TAA under Subchapter D of the Trade Act because of increased imports from or the shift in production to Mexico
or Canada.

The petitioners or any other persons showing a substantial interest in the subject matter of the investigations may
request a public hearing with the Director of OTAA at the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) in Washington, DC, provided
such request is filed in writing with the Director of OTAA not later than May 23, 1994.

Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels; List of Arbitrator Names 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Copyright Office, Library of Congress. 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Determination of CARP arbitrator list. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Copyright Office of the Library of Congress is publishing the list of arbitrators eligible for selection to a Copyright
Arbitration Royalty Panel (CARP) during 1994. This CARP arbitrator list will be used to select all arbitrators required
for any royalty fee distribution proceeding initiated under 17 U.S.C. 802 and beginning during calendar year 1994.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993, Public Law No. 103-198, 107 Stat. 2304 (1993), creates a system
of Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels (CARPs), administered by the Librarian of Congress and the Copyright Office,
for the distribution of copyright royalty fees collected by the Copyright Office under the various compulsory licenses
of the Copyright Code, 17 U.S.C., and for adjustment of compulsory license royalty rates. For royalty rate adjustments
and distributions that are in controversy, section 802(b) of the Copyright Code requires the selection of a CARP consisting
of three arbitrators from ``lists provided by professional arbitration associations.'' The Librarian selects
two arbitrators, who in turn select the third to serve as their chairperson. If the two arbitrators cannot agree, the
Librarian is instructed to select the third arbitrator. 



List of Nominated Arbitrators 



To implement the CARP selection process of section 802(b), the Copyright Office recently issued a set of interim regulations.
59 FR 23964 (1994). Subpart A of part 251 of these regulations describes the selection and organization of the CARPs.
37 CFR part 251. For 1994, arbitration associations were asked to submit a list of persons qualified to serve on a CARP,
as described in  251.5, by May 6. The regulation required that the submitting arbitration association supply
the following information for each person: 

(1) The full name, address, and telephone number of the person. 

(2) The current position and name of the person's employer, if any, along with a brief summary of the person's employment
history, including areas of expertise, and, if available, a description of the general nature of clients represented
and the types of proceedings in which the person represented clients. 

(3) A brief description of the educational background of the person, including teaching positions and membership
in professional associations, if any. 

(4) A statement of facts and information which qualify the person to serve as an arbitrator under  251.5. 

(5) A description or schedule detailing fees proposed to be charged by the person for service on a CARP.

37 CFR 251.3(a). 



Section 251.3(b) directs: 





After May 6, 1994 * * * the Librarian of Congress shall publish in the 

Federal Register

 a list of at least 30, but not more than 75 persons, submitted to the Librarian from at least three professional arbitration
associations or organizations. The persons so listed must satisfy the qualifications and requirements of this subchapter
and can reasonably be expected to be available to serve as arbitrators on a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel during
that calendar year. This list will constitute the ``arbitrator list'' referred to in this subchapter. 





The publication of today's list satisfies the requirements of  251.3. Although  251.3(b) sets an upper
limit of 75 names, the Copyright Office is publishing an arbitrator list containing 107 names. The short period of
time between receipt of the names from the arbitrator associations and the need to publish the arbitrator list precluded
the possibility of prescreening the list to stay within the 75 person maximum. The Office is therefore waiving the
maximum limitation for this year and is publishing all the names submitted by the arbitration associations that met
the eligibility criteria of  251.5. Arbitration associations submitted names of people that they found to
satisfy the CARP eligibility requirements described in  251.5 including ability to serve on a CARP at any time
during 1994.
 





As noted above in the quotation from  251.3(b), today's list constitutes the CARP ``arbitrator list'' for purposes
of subchapter B. The information submitted by an arbitration association with respect to each person listed is available
for copying and inspection at the Licensing Division of the Copyright Office. See  251.3(b) of the new regulations.
Thus, for example, if the Librarian is required to convene a CARP this year for a royalty fee distribution, parties
to that proceeding may contact the Licensing Division of the Copyright Office, LM-458, to review that information
as a means of formulating objections to listed arbitrators under  251.4. 



Deadline for Filing Financial Disclosure Statement 



Publication of today's list also triggers a requirement imposed by the new regulation on the individuals named in
the list. Section 251.32(a) of the CARP rules provides that, within one month of date of publication in 

Federal Register

, each listed person must ``file with the Librarian of Congress a confidential financial disclosure statement as
provided by the Library of Congress.'' The Copyright Office is sending a financial disclosure statement, with specific
instructions for completing and filing the statement, to every arbitrator on the CARP arbitrator list. The disclosure
statement will be used by the Librarian for purposes of determining what conflicts of interest, if any, may preclude
the person from serving as an arbitrator in a CARP proceeding. Unlike the information submitted by arbitration associations
under  251.3(a), the information contained in the financial disclosure statements is confidential and is
not available to the public or to the parties to the proceeding. 

The arbitrators identified on the arbitrator list published today have until June 13, 1994, to file their financial
disclosure statement with the Librarian. Failure to file the statement on time may preclude consideration of the
person to serve on a CARP. 



The CARP arbitrator list for 1994 includes:

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; Government Securities Clearing Corp.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Relating
to the Comparison and Netting of Members' Treasury Auction Purchases



May 2, 1994.



On January 26, 1994, Government Securities Clearing Corporation (``GSCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (``Act'').
 On February 18, 1994, GSCC filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change.
 The Commission published notice of the proposed rule change in the 

Federal Register

 on March 10, 1994.
 The Commission received one comment letter in response to this notice.
 As discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change.








I. Description



The proposed rule change modifies GSCC's rules to allow GSCC to accept and report data on proprietary purchases of
Treasury notes, bills, and bonds made at auction by members of GSCC's netting system; to net the purchases with when-issued
trades of such members in the member securities; and to deliver purchased securities through GSCC's clearing mechanism
(the ``auction takedown system''). GSCC has established links with the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Chicago,
and San Francisco in order to provide the auction takedown system, and will establish links with other Federal Reserve
Banks as needed. GSCC intends to implement the auction takedown system in the Spring of 1994.

The proposed rule change also authorizes GSCC to establish a mechanism for accepting data on members' trades in eligible
securities from sources such as exchanges and other clearing corporations on a ``locked-in'' basis. This means that
GSCC members would be obligated to accept trades as reported by such sources and GSCC would treat such data, under its
rules, as if they were the successful results of GSCC's comparison of trade data submissions from buying and selling
members.



1. The Auction Takedown Service



a. Eligible Securities



Only auction purchases meeting two conditions are eligible for inclusion in GSCC's auction takedown system. First,
the purchase must be of a security with an issue date one or more business days after the auction date. Second, only proprietary
purchases are eligible. The auction bid submitted to the Federal Reserve Ban must not include a customer's or client's
name on the tender form or on an attachment to the tender form.

<DOCNO> FR940511-2-00167 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940511-2-00108 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

b. Necessary Authorizations



Prior to its first eligible auction purchase, a GSCC member must authorize GSCC to receive data on the member's auction
purchase from the applicable Federal Reserve Bank.
 If a GSCC netting member does not provide the authorization, GSCC would not allow the participant to remain a netting
member. The GSCC member also must provide to the applicable Federal Reserve Bank an authorization to provide to the
applicable Federal Reserve Bank an authorization to provide GSCC with the data on the member's auction purchase and
an authorization to deliver the auction purchase to GSCC's agent bank.







C. Receipt of Data by GSCC


In the afternoon or evening of the day of a U.S. Department of Treasury (``Treasury'') auction, the Federal Reserve
Banks will transmit to GSCC information, on a per-CUSIP basis, regarding which netting members received auction
awards of eligible securities and the amount and value of those awards at each yield. The auction award data will be
deemed to be a compared trade; the contra-party will not submit any data on the trade. GSCC will report the auction trade
to the purchasing member as part of the daily comparison output, and the trade will be binding on the member at that time.





d. Netting


After the auction award is reported to the GSCC member, the position will go directly into GSCC's netting system. GSCC
will treat the award, for settlement purposes, in the same manner as a compared trade which will be netted with a member's
compared secondary market trades in the same CUSIP to establish net settlement positions. GSCC will then report to
the member the net position (deliver, receive, or take no action) and net payment obligation. Once netted, GSCC will
be obligated to accept from the applicable Federal Reserve Bank delivery of each member's auction purchase and pay
for such purchase, through its agent banks. Pending delivery on issue date, GSCC will collect clearing fund margin
and forward mark allocation payment
 amounts based on the net settlement position taking into account auction purchases. In addition, GSCC will collect
clearance difference amounts on an intra-day basis for any money differences that arise as a result of the pairing
off of auction purchases with fail obligations.






e. Delivery


Each Federal Reserve Bank will deliver the auction purchases to the clearing bank designated by GSCC for such purpose.
Early in the day on issue date, GSCC will provide its agent banks with instructions for receipt and delivery so that
the auction purchases can be received against payment from the Federal Reserve Banks and redelivered to GSCC members
against payment automatically and virtually instantaneously.

GSCC will pay the Federal Reserve Banks for the auction awards at the award price. GSCC will redeliver the auction awards
to GSCC members against payment of the settlement value,
 equal to the greater of the system (market) value for the position or the average auction price for such auction purchase.
This adjustment is necessary to permit GSCC to net auction awards with when-issued and forward settling trades in
the same security.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940511-2-00168 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940511-2-00108 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The normal GSCC delivery process should provide members with timely delivery of their auction awards to the extent
that members have net long positions consisting of auction securities. Because members could be flat or short with
respect to other GSCC members and long with respect to non-GSCC dealers or their customers, GSCC will provide a mechanism
for ensuring timely delivery of needed auction purchases to a member who, as a result of its secondary market trading,
will have on issue date a net short or flat position, or a long position that is smaller than the amount of auction purchases
that it requires.
 Under this procedure, no later than the evening of the second business day prior to issue date,
 each such member can request that GSCC deliver to it auction purchases made by such member on a CUSIP-by-CUSIP basis
(``Priority Delivery Request''). GSCC will split such member's existing net settlement position into a long position
equal to the level of the requested delivery, and an offsetting short position. For purposes of calculating a member's
required clearing fund deposit, a priority delivery request will be treated as if it were a net long position if it is
greater than the member's actual net long position.






GSCC will establish the following auction award delivery priorities: first to members to fulfill Priority Delivery
Requests; next to members with net long positions to the extent comprised of auction purchases; and then to members
with net long positions that remain unfilled, on an equal basis, in $50 million increments.






f. Participant Failure



In the event that a member with an auction award fails, on or prior to issue date, GSCC could incur a loss above the amount
of collateral it holds from that member in liquidating the member's positions. The Treasury will not be liable for
assessment for any loss that occurs as a result of the auction purchase. Instead, pursuant to its arrangement with
the Treasury, GSCC will have the right to refuse delivery from a Federal Reserve Bank on issue date of all or a portion
of the auction purchases of a GSCC member if certain conditions exist. 

A netting member who made the auction purchase in a CUSIP must remain in a long position in that CUSIP. GSCC must have
reasonable cause to believe, based on the information it has received, that the member cannot or will not timely take
delivery of and fully pay for auction purchase amounts due it from GSCC. GSCC must have determined from its analysis
and prevailing market conditions that there is reasonable cause to believe that, if it were to liquidate the member's
position, GSCC would incur a loss that would not be covered by the margin deposited by the member with GSCC and/or profits
from the liquidation of other positions of the member. GSCC can specify the amount of auction purchases on which it
will not take delivery, which amount may not exceed the member's net long position in that CUSIP.

GSCC must notify the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank, in a mutually acceptable manner, of its exercise of this right
by no later than 8:30 a.m. New York time on the relevant issue date. The failing member will remain responsible for the
payment of such securities pursuant to the terms established by the Treasury.

If GSCC incurs a residual loss as the result of the liquidation of a member's auction purchase, the loss will be allocated
in the same manner as any other allocation of loss. The loss will be spread among all of the netting members that the failed
member did business with on or prior to the day of default.



2. Locked-In Trades



The proposed rule change establishes a facility permitting GSCC to treat trade data received from designated sources
other than a Federal Reserve Bank, such as exchanges or clearing corporations, as locked-in trades.






a. Reporting of Locked-In Trade Data



GSCC will accept trade data from a locked-in trade source without matching it with data provided by a member. GSCC will
report these locked-in trades to members as part of its daily comparison output. For purposes of GSCC's rules, locked-in
trades will be considered as compared trades and will be as valid, binding, and enforceable as comparisons issued
based on a match of corresponding data submitted to GSCC by two members. 

Each member that makes an eligible locked-in trade will be obligated to provide GSCC with authorization for GSCC to
receive data on the locked-in trade from the locked-in trade source. A locked-in trade source can correct or delete
a previously submitted trade by providing appropriate instructions to GSCC. If the locked-in trade source is not
a party to the trade, GSCC may delete or correct the data upon receipt of matching instructions from each member that
is a party to the trade.

<PARENT> FR940511-2-00108 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

b. Netting



Subject to the terms and conditions that GSCC agrees to with the locked-in trade source, GSCC may exclude any locked-in
trade from its netting system. Each netting member that makes a locked-in trade that is eligible for netting and settlement
by GSCC must provide GSCC and the locked-in trade source with authorization for GSCC to receive and the locked-in trade
source to transmit data on the locked-in trade.



3. Other Revisions



Under GSCC's rules, a forward settling trade is eligible for GSCC's netting system only if the trade settles within
less than a certain number of days after comparison by GSCC. For example, only trades that settle fifteen days or less
after comparison currently are eligible for GSCC's netting system. The proposed rule change amends GSCC Rule 11,
section 2 to permit GSCC to establish the maximum number of business days between comparison and settlement by a separately
published schedule. GSCC will file with the Commission, pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act, any proposals
to change this time period.
 GSCC's rules also have been amended to allow GSCC to net fail deliver obligations and fail receive obligations with
any other receive obligations and deliver obligations.





II. Comments



As noted above, in response to the notice published in the 

Federal Register

, the Treasury provided the Commission with comments in support of the proposal. The Treasury believes that including
Treasury auction purchases in a multilateral netting system could be beneficial to the efficiency of the government
securities market. In addition, the Treasury believes that the proposal would enable GSCC to improve its risk management
by providing a more complete picture of its members' positions.



III. Discussion



The Commission believes the proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A of the Act, and, therefore, is approving
the proposal. Specifically, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with section 17A(b)(3)(F)
 of the Act in that it promotes the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions, fosters
cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in clearance and settlement of securities transactions, and
removes impediments to the national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.






In the 1992 Joint Report on the Government Securities Market (``Joint Report''), the Commission, the Treasury, and
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System recommended several enhancements to GSCC's system.
 One such enhancement was the inclusion of auction take-down activity in GSCC's netting system, since the benefits
of netting would increase as more trades are included in the net. The Joint Report concluded that if the auction takedown
proposal were implemented, ``additional information on the overall distribution process required to settle Treasury
auction purchases and on the true net settlement positions of members during a when-issued period would be available
at GSCC. GSCC's proposal is especially significant in light of the risk to the Treasury resulting from the auction
settlement process and the use of autocharge agreements. GSCC's proposal would reduce the risk to the Treasury to
the extent that GSCC assumes responsibility for auction purchases that are netted against when-issued sales.''








The proposal provides a more efficient method of clearing and settling auction securities. GSCC members will be able
to access information on the securities awarded to them through GSCC's reporting system, and will have the securities
delivered and paid for through GSCC's clearance system. The processing required will be reduced since the Federal
Reserve Banks will provide information and securities to, and receive payment from, one source, GSCC, for all GSCC
members. By channeling the payment and delivery obligations through one source (and reducing those obligations
through netting), the clearance process will be made more efficient.

<DOCNO> FR940511-2-00170 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940511-2-00108 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Currently, the proposal only covers purchases of Treasury securities that settle one or more business days after
the auction date. This limitation is needed because of the limitations in GSCC's system. However, the number of Treasury
securities that settle on the same day as auction date is so small that this limitation should not have a significant
effect on the national clearance system.






In addition, the proposal only covers proprietary purchases. If a GSCC member were to fail, GSCC would still accept
auction awards to the extent covered by the GSCC member's short position. If a GSCC member's customer purchases were
included in the proposal, there is a possibility that a customer's purchase would be used to satisfy the failed member's
short position rather than delivered to the customer. Once the auction takedown proposal has been implemented, there
will be opportunities to study means of including customer trades without undue risk to the customer. Until such time,
the Commission believes that it is reasonable to exclude customer trades.






The proposal would change GSCC's settlement pricing to accommodate introduction of auction positions. These changes
will serve two functions. First, it will ensure that GSCC never delivers auction purchases for less than the amount
it paid for the securities. Second, it will provide GSCC with a risk control measure when a member is subject to higher
than normal surveillance status. This should help GSCC address the risk of liquidity problems, and enhance GSCC's
ability to safeguard funds and securities.

The proposal also provides a general mechanism for GSCC to accept locked-in trade data from sources other than a Federal
Reserve Bank. By accepting the trades directly from a locked-in trade source (such as an exchange), the process of
clearing and settling the locked-in trade is made more efficient. The GSCC member does not have to duplicate input
of the data, submitting the data once to the locked-in trade source and once to GSCC. Instead, the information flows
directly to GSCC, thereby lessening the risk of incorrect or incomplete submissions, or unconfirmed trades.

The proposal extends the benefits of GSCC's centralized, automated netting system to netting members' auction securities
purchases. By including auction securities in GSCC's netting system, the level of potential netting is increased
and the number of required movements of securities are reduced.
 Netting of auction securities also may have the effect of increasing a member's liquidity. Previously, a GSCC member
with a short position would have its required margin payments calculated based on its short position, even if it had
an offsetting long position in auction purchases. Once the positions are netted, the member's margin payments will
be calculated based on the position after taking into account the auction purchases, perhaps creating a lower margin
payment. The additional liquidity may assist in the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.
In this manner, the proposal removes impediments to the national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and
settlement of securities transactions, and fosters cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in clearance
and settlement of securities transactions.





IV. Conclusion



For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A of
the Act.



It is therefore ordered

, Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (SR-GSCC-94-01) be, and
hereby is, approved.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating
to Warrants Based on Foreign Government Bonds</DOCTITLE>



May 5, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on March 2, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the Amex. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Amex proposes to approve for listing and trading under Section 106 of the Amex Company Guide warrants tied to changes
in the prices of foreign government bonds.

The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the Amex, and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The Exchange proposes to list and trade under Section 106 of the Amex Company Guide warrants that can be expected to
fluctuate in value based on changes in prices of foreign government bonds.
 Such issues may relate to a single bond issue or several bond issues of one or more foreign countries.







Warrants based on prices of foreign government bonds will conform to the listing guidelines under Section 106 of the
Amex Company Guide which currently provide that:

(1) The issuer shall have assets in excess of U.S. $100,000,000 and otherwise substantially exceed the size and earnings
requirements of Section 101(A) of the Amex Company Guide;

(2) The term of the warrants shall be for a period ranging from one to five years from date of issuance; and

(3) The minimum public distribution of such issues shall be 1,000,000 warrants together with a minimum of 400 public
holders, and an aggregate market value of U.S. $4,000,000.



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940511-2-00172 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940511-2-00109 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


Such warrants shall be direct obligations of their issuer subject to cash settlement in U.S. dollars, and exercisable
throughout their life (

i.e. 

American style) or exercisable only at expiration (

i.e., 

European style). Upon exercise, or at the warrant expiration date (if not exercisable prior to such date), the holder
of a warrant will be entitled to a cash settlement value computed in accordance with a formula specified in the issuer's
prospectus. If ``out of the money'' at the time of expiration, the warrants will expire worthless. 

Warrants may be structured either to increase or decrease in value based on the increase or decrease in the price or
yield of the government bond or bonds. Because all payments will be required to be in U.S. dollars, there would be no
currency risk except to the extent that fluctuations in the value of the relevant currency affect the price or yield
of the government bond(s). 

The Amex will require that member firms only sell such warrants to investors whose accounts have been approved for
options trading pursuant to Amex Rule 921. The Exchange also will distribute a circular to its membership prior to
the commencement of trading calling attention to the risks associated with the purchase and trading of such warrants.


At this time, the Exchange anticipates the listing of a warrant issue based on the prices of between three and five foreign
government issues. Holders of such warrants would be entitled to receive from the issuer in U.S. dollars a cash settlement
value, if any, based on changes in the arithmetic average yield to maturity of the bonds as calculated by the designated
Calculation Agent based on prices obtained from three dealers in the bonds.






The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts
and practices and to promote just and equitable principals of trade, and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination
between customers, issuers, brokers and dealers.



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition 



The Amex believes that the proposed rule change will not impose an inappropriate burden on competition.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others 



Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received. 



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action 



Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register 

or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will: 

(a) By order approve such proposed rule change, or 

(b) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. 



IV. Solicitation of Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission , 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions
should refer to File No. SR-Amex-94-05 and should be submitted by June 1, 1994. 





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Participants Trust Company; Order Approving on a Temporary Basis a Proposed Rule
Change Relating to Margin Levels for Collateralized Mortgage Obligations</DOCTITLE>



May 5, 1994.



On December 28, 1992, the Participants Trust Company (``PTC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR-PTC-92-16) pursuant to section 19(b)(1)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 relating to the establishment of margin levels on Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (``CMO security'' or ``CMO'')
currently eligible for deposit or which may become eligible for deposit at PTC. Notice of the proposal appeared in
the 

Federal Register

 on February 7, 1994.
 No comments were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change
on a temporary basis, until April 30, 1995.






I. Description



PTC's proposal establishes a method of computing the percentages to be deducted from the market value of certain securities
(``haircut'') to determine how those securities should be valued for purposes of participants' Net Free Equity.
 The securities in question are CMO securities
 which are eligible for deposit or which may become eligible for deposit at PTC. Currently, the only such securities
are Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits (``REMIC'') issued by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (``VA
REMIC'').







</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940511-2-00174 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940511-2-00110 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Under PTC's rules, the Applicable Percentage
 of the market value of securities is used in computing a participant's Net Free Equity. PTC's rules require participants
to maintain Net Free Equity of zero or greater in each of their agency, pledgee transfer, and proprietary accounts
in order for transactions to be processed.
 PTC has the right to borrow against or liquidate those assets that comprise the Net Free Equity computations in those
accounts in the event that the participant responsible for one or more of those accounts fails to pay the account debit
balance at the end of the day. By including only a portion of the market value of securities in Net Free Equity, 

i.e., 

the Applicable Percentage, PTC attempts to limit the risk caused by fluctuations in the market value of securities
in those accounts. In computing Net Free Equity, PTC deducts 5% from the market value of GNMA Single-Family securities,
and higher levels for GNMA Project, Construction, and Mobile Home Securities to reflect their reduced liquidity.








Unlike GNMAs, CMOs are structured as a series of tranches or classes, each of which represents a separate security
with unique characteristics, such as differing payment schedules and price volatility. In addition, there is a lack
of historical price data for CMOs, in contrast to GNMA securities. Consequently, PTC has chosen to rely on a model developed
by the Asset Backed Securities Group/Trepp (``Trepp'') that uses the yield on an underlying Treasury security to
predict the potential movement and prepayment risk of a corresponding CMO tranche when subjected to a rise or fall
in interest rates. Currently, PTC's model assumes a 50 basis point upward movement in the underlying Treasury securities
for CMO tranches which exhibit positive effective duration (

i.e., 

rise in value with falling interest rates). For CMO tranches which exhibit negative effective duration (

i.e., 

decline in value with falling interest rate), the model assumes a 50 basis point downward move in the underlying Treasury
security.






Rather than assigning a uniform Applicable Percentage for all CMO securities, PTC takes into account the unique characteristics
of each CMO tranche.
 Each CMO tranche is subjected to a stress test to determine its response to yield changes, thereby allowing PTC to assign
each tranche an appropriate margin. PTC's management will establish the margin based on the stated analysis as each
CMO tranche is deposited at PTC. Nevertheless, PTC has represented that the minimum margin level for any CMO product
will be 5%.







II. Discussion


The Commission believes that PTC's proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A of the Act, and, specifically,
with sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F).
 Those sections require a clearing agency to be organized, and its rules be designed, to promote the prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement of securities transactions and to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds which
are in its custody or control or for which it is responsible. The Commission is approving PTC's proposal until April
30, 1995, to allow PTC to gain more experience with CMO securities.

In 1992, the Commission approved a PTC proposal to make certain VA REMIC securities, guaranteed by the U.S. government,
eligible for deposit at PTC pursuant to PTC Article I, Rule 2.
 The approval ran through December 31, 1992, to coincide with the expiration of the legislation authorizing the issuance
of VA REMICs.
 In 1993, legislation extending the VA's authority to issue REMICs through December 31, 1995 was enacted.
 In light of the extension, the Commission approved a PTC proposal allowing it on a permanent basis to designate VA REMICs
depository eligible, as long as they continue to be guaranteed by the U.S. government.








PTC has relied on Trepp as its vendor for VA REMIC prices and has used Trepp's model to determine margin for such securities.
Trepp was established in 1979 and created the first independent CMO pricing service in 1988. Currently, Trepp provides
pricing and analytical services to more than 500 institutions, including 23 of the 25 largest bank trust departments.





Because each CMO tranche has unique characteristics, Trepp models each security to determine its value. The information
required to model each tranche of a CMO is derived from that CMO's prospectus, including the characteristics and principal
payment priorities of each tranche, initial price and interest rate, and remaining principal balances and prepayment
assumptions used to derive the cash flows and initial spread.





Initially, PTC gauges the accuracy of these models by comparing the cash flows and other data calculated by the model
to the information provided by the underwriter in the issuer summary report and the prospectus. In addition, the accuracy
of the model is tested on an ongoing basis by comparing its valuations to those of the underwriter, and by using available
factor information to verify the remaining principal balance of each security with those calculated by its corresponding
model.





PTC's model is an example of a static cash flow yield model, as distinguished from an option-adjusted spread (``OAS'')
model. Static cash flow and OAS models differ primarily in their handling of future interest rate and prepayment scenarios.
A static cash flow yield analysis uses an interest rate/prepayment scenario which relies on current market conditions.
This reliance creates two limitations. First, it might not measure accurately reinvestment risk caused by an investor's
inability to reinvest periodic payments at a rate equal to the yield on the security. Second, such a model does not value
the embedded option representing a mortgagee's ability to prepay, which can be a factor in determining the value of
a particular CMO tranche.
 It is the option to prepay which causes OAS models generally to be considered more accurate than static cash flow models.
However, the enhanced accuracy of OAS models comes at a cost; such models are more complex and computer intensive than
those relying on a static cash flow analysis. According to PTC, there are no daily price vendors that provide bulk prices
for CMOs using an OAS model.






Each CMO tranche is subjected to a stress test, the purpose of which is to observe the effect of an upward and downward
movement of 50 basis points in the underlying Treasury yield of each CMO tranche.
 Because the volatility of a CMO tranche is primarily a function of the level of interest rates, PTC has stated it will
recalculate margins whenever the Treasury yield curve has changed by 100 basis points from the time of original issue
or last margin recalculation. PTC has also stated that securities whose attributes warrant it shall have their margins
reevaluated quarterly.

In order to facilitate daily pricing and margin evaluations, PTC intends to acquire Trepp's CMO pricing model. Currently,
PTC receives a price tape from Trepp daily no later than 5 p.m. and meets regularly with representatives from Trepp
regarding its pricing service. Nevertheless, as the volume of CMOs deposited at PTC increases, the on-site availability
of the Trepp model should provide PTC with additional safeguards.





PTC's proposed methodology requires its model to predict accurately the market price of CMOs. Thus far, PTC's experience
has been limited to comparing the predicted versus actual transation price of VA REMICs.
 The data indicate that PTC's model has been reasonably accurate in predicting actual prices.
 However, VA REMICs represent the most stable of CMOs given that VA mortgages are assumable, and therefore less subject
to prepayment risk. Moreover, the structures of the VA REMICs so far issued and on deposit at PTC have not been particularly
complicated.





Another concern raised by the proposed methodology relates to the prepayment projections on which it relies. The
prepayment projections volunteered by twelve firms are averaged, but whether such quotes are executable is not considered.
This may affect the accuracy of the prepayment speeds used to arrive at a market price for CMOs. Without accurate prepayment
data, the predicted price might lag behind the market's true price by up to 30-45 days, when each agency issuing
mortgage pass-through securities releases the actual prepayment factors 
 and settlement occurs. The interest rate volatilities of the underlying Treasuries from which the CMOs are priced
can change 50-75 basis points over the course of 30-45 days. In part to address this concern, PTC has determined
to use fifty basis points for purposes of running the stress test to establish margin.






The Commission believes that in granting PTC temporary approval of its CMO pricing methodology until April 30, 1995,
PTC will be afforded an opportunity to gain experience with its methodology. In addition, the temporary approval
period will allow PTC to take steps to address any concerns which exist with respect to its methodology.

The Commission believes that granting PTC temporary approval of its proposal for one year should allow it sufficient
time to address the issues raised above. PTC's current CMO margining methodology should help ensure that CMO margins
will be established that take into account the unique characteristics of each CMO tranche, and that PTC's reliance
on a daily pricing source will provide it with timely price information. The resulting margins will afford PTC protection
should it be necessary for PTC to borrow against or liquidate these assets.



III. Conclusion



For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that PTC's proposal is consistent with section 17A of the Act.



It Is Therefore Ordered, 

Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that PTC's proposed rule change (SR-PTC-92-16) be, and hereby is, approved on a temporary basis
until April 30, 1995.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Merrill Lynch KECALP Growth Investments L.P. 1983, et al.; Application</DOCTITLE>


May 5, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for Exemptive Order under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

Merrill Lynch KECALP Growth Investments L.P. 1983, Merrill Lynch KECALP L.P. 1984, Merrill Lynch KECALP L.P. 1986,
Merrill Lynch KECALP L.P. 1987, Merrill Lynch KECALP L.P. 1989, Merrill Lynch KECALP L.P. 1991 (The ``Partnerships''),
KECALP Inc. (the ``General Partner''), Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (``ML & Co.'').




RELEVANT 1940 ACT SECTIONS: 

Exemption requested pursuant to section 6(b) of the Act and rule 17d-1 thereunder to permit certain transactions
otherwise prohibited by section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1. The requested order would amend a prior order.


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants request an order that would permit the Partnerships to make certain joint investments with ML & Co.
or an affiliate of ML & Co. and to co-invest with certain limited partnerships in which ML & Co. is an investor.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.


Applicants' Representations


1. Each of the Partnerships is a closed-end management investment company. Each Partnership also is an ``employees'
securities company,'' as defined in section 2(a)(13) of the Act, and is exempt from certain provisions of the Act pursuant
to a prior order of the SEC (the ``KECALP Order'').
 Partnership interests in the Partnerships were offered exclusively to certain employees of ML & Co. and its subsidiaries
and to non-employee directors of ML & Co. Applicants request that any relief relating to the present application
be extended to partnerships commencing operations in the future that operate under the terms of the KECALP Order.
These partnerships are also referred to as the ``Partnerships.''




2. ML & Co. is a diversified financial services holding company. The General Partner, a registered investment
adviser, is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of ML & Co. and acts as the general partner of the Partnerships.
All investments and dispositions of investments by each Partnership are approved by the board of directors of the
General Partner.

3. Applicants request an amendment to the KECALP Order to permit the Partnerships to co-invest with ``Affiliated
Co-investors,'' defined as: Limited partnerships or other investment vehicles that (a) are not sponsored or managed
by ML & Co. or one of its affiliates; (b) are an ``affiliated person'' of ML & Co. or one of its affiliates by virtue
of the ownership by ML & Co. or its affiliate of 5% or more of the voting securities or partnership interests in such
entity; and (c) are not controlled by ML & Co. or one of its affiliates (within the meaning of section 2(a)(9) of
the Act).

<DOCNO> FR940511-2-00179 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940511-2-00111 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

4. The requested amendment also would permit ML & Co. or its affiliates to participate in co-investments with
a Partnership and an Affiliated Co-investor may make additional investment opportunities available to its security
holders, which would include ML & Co. or an affiliate. 


5. The Kecalp Order approves certain transactions in accordance with rule 17d-1. Specifically, the Partnerships
may invest in (a) any other partnerships or investment vehicles which are sponsored or managed by ML & Co. or its
affiliates or (b) investments in which a partnership described in clause (a) is a participant or plans to become a participant
and which would not be prohibited investments except that ML & Co. or any of its subsidiaries, or one or more officers,
directors, or employees of the General Partner, have a partnership interest in or compensation arrangement with
such partnership. Since the Affiliated Co-investors are not, by definition, sponsored or managed by ML & Co.
or its affiliates, co-investments by the Partnerships with the Affiliated Co-investors are not permitted under
the terms of the Kecalp Order. 


6. Employees of ML & Co. and its subsidiaries must meet the suitability standards of a Partnership in order to be
eligible to purchase units in a Partnership. In addition, the Partnerships' prospectuses have stated prominently
that the units are speculative and are not a suitable investment for all qualified investors. Partnership interests
in Partnerships formed after 1991 will not be offered to employees who earned, or whose annualized salary was, less
than $75,000 with respect to the calendar year preceding the offering of such Partnership. In addition, no employee
meeting the salary requirement will be permitted to invest more than 15% of his or her cash compensation from ML &
Co. or its subsidiaries in any Partnership unless such employee is an ``accredited investor,'' as defined in rule
501(a) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 




Applicants' Legal Analysis 




1. Applicants request an order under sections 6(b) and 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 thereunder to permit the
Partnerships to co-invest with the Affiliated Co-investors. Section 6(b) provides that the SEC shall, upon application,
exempt any employees' securities company from the provisions of the Act if and to the extent that the exemption is consistent
with the protection of investors. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 thereunder prohibit an affiliated
person of an investment company, acting as principal, from participating in or effecting any transaction in connection
with any joint enterprise or joint arrangement in which the investment company participates. 


2. ML & Co. and its affiliates (as such term is defined in the Act) may be deemed to be affiliated persons of the General
Partner under the Act. The General Partner is an affiliated person of the Partnerships within the meaning of the Act.
As a result, joint investments by any Partnership with ML & Co. or an affiliate of ML & Co. may be subject to section
17(d). In addition, a co-investment by a Partnership with an Affiliated Co-investor may be subject to section 17(d)
to the extent the Affiliated Co-investors is an affiliated person of ML & Co. 

3. Rule 17d-1 permits the SEC to approve a proposed joint transaction covered by the terms of section 17(d). Applicants
represent that the General Partner and its affiliates are concerned with the relationship among themselves and the
key employees and directors who invest in the Partnerships and that the Partnerships were organized by ML & Co.
to generate and maintain goodwill. In addition, the limited partners of the Partnerships have been informed of the
possible Partnerships' dealing with ML & Co. and its affiliates and as professionals employed in financial services
businesses, the limited partners are able to evaluate the risks associated with those dealings. Applicants submit
that the composition and operation of the board of directors of the General Partner also will mitigate any potential
for disadvantageous treatment of the Partnerships. The board is comprised principally of individuals representing
senior management of a diverse group of subsidiaries of ML & Co. who are selected on the basis of their substantive
area of expertise. Accordingly, applicants believe that the terms of the relief requested are consistent with the
standards in section 6(b) of the Act and rule 17d-1. 




Applicants' Conditions 




Applicants agree that any order of the SEC granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:

1. (a) To the extent that a Partnership has funds available for investment, the board of directors of the General Partner
will review, among other investments, co-investments with Affiliated Co-investors that may be brought to the attention
of the General Partner. The board of directors of the General Partner will make a determination as to whether each particular
investment meets applicable investment criteria and is consistent with the existing composition of the Partnership's
portfolio in terms of diversification of investments.
(b) The General Partner will commit to a co-investment with an Affiliated Co-investor only if the board of directors
of the General Partner, by a majority vote at a properly called and held meeting of the board of directors prior to making
the investment, concludes, after consideration of all information deemed relevant, that:
(i) The terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the limited partners
of the Partnership and do not involve overreaching of the Partnership or such partners on the part of any person concerned;
(ii) The transaction is consistent with the interests of the limited partners of the Partnership and is consistent
with the Partnership's investment objectives and policies as recited in filings made by the Partnership under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, its registration statement, and reports to its limited partners; and
(iii) The investment by an Affiliated Co-Investor, or, as permitted by these terms, ML & Co. or an affiliate thereof,
in such transaction would not disadvantage the Partnership in the making of its investment, maintaining its investment
position, or disposing of the investment and will be made on the same basis as the Affiliated Co-investors and ML &
Co. or any of its affiliates.
2. Purchases of an investment pursuant to these conditions in a transaction in which ML & Co. or an affiliate is
a participant shall consist of a class of securities also acquired by ML & Co. and/or its affiliate on the same terms
(excluding terms as to aggregate purchase price, but including terms as to registration rights, if any, and other
rights provided to the purchasers of such investments). Investments made pursuant to the order by a Partnership with
an Affiliated Co-investor or with ML & Co. or one of its affiliates will be acquired by the partnership on the same
settlement date as acquired by the Affiliated Co-investor and ML & Co. or its affiliates.
3. No investment will be made by a Partnership in any entity in which any other Partnership, ML & Co., or any subsidiary
thereof (such three categories being referred to as ``Affiliates'' for this condition) has previously acquired
an interest, provided that this prohibition shall not be applicable to (a) any investment specifically permitted
by any other order of the SEC, (b) any investment in a publicly-traded security that is permissible under the Act or
the rules thereunder, (c) any investment in an entity in which one or more Affiliates have a prior investment if the
securities offered are of the same or senior class of securities held by each such Affiliate and each such Affiliate
invests in the subsequent offering on the same terms as a Partnership which does not have a prior investment in that
entity, or (d) any investment by a Partnership in an entity in which an Affiliate has made a prior investment, if an institutional
investor with total assets of at least $100 million that is not an affiliated person of the Partnership makes an initial
investment with the Partnership on the same terms as the Partnership making its initial investment in that entity.
4. If ML & Co. or one of its affiliates
 elects to sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of an investment acquired pursuant to these terms that also is held
by one or more of the Partnerships, notice of the proposed disposition will be given to the Partnership at the earliest
practical time and the Partnership will be given the opportunity to participate in such disposition on a proportionate
basis on the same terms as those applicable to ML & Co. or such affiliate. Each Partnership will participate in
such disposition if such action is determined by a majority vote at a properly called and held meeting of the board of
directors of the General Partner to be in the best interests of the Partnership. Each Partnership will bear its own
expenses associated with the disposition of such an investment.




5. If the board of directors of the General Partner, with respect to a Partnership, or ML & Co. or one of its affiliates
determines to make a ``follow-on'' investment (

i.e., 

an additional investment in the same entity) in a particular portfolio company whose securities are held by an Affiliated
Co-investor or to exercise warrants or other rights to purchase securities of such an issuer, notice of such transaction
will be provided to each Partnership owning securities of such issuer at the earliest practical time. Each Partnership
owning securities in an issuer in which the opportunity to make follow-on investments becomes available will participate
in such a follow-on investment if the board of directors of the General Partner determines, in the manner required
by these conditions, that such action is in the best interests of such Partnership. The acquisition of follow-on investments
as permitted by this condition will be subject to the other conditions set forth in the application.
6. The board of directors of the General Partner will review quarterly all information concerning co-investment
transactions by the Partnerships with Affiliated Co-investors to determine whether all such investments made during
the preceding quarter complied with the conditions set forth above. 
7. At least annually, the General Partner will provide to the Partnerships' limited partners a written list of co-investment
transactions by the Partnerships with Affiliated Co-investors.
8. The General Partner will maintain the records required by section 57(f)(3) of the Act and will comply with the provisions
of section 57(h) of the Act, as if each Partnership were a business development company, all of which will be available
for inspection by the limited partners of each respective Partnership. All records referred to or required under
these conditions will be available for inspection by the SEC. All such records, as they relate to a particular Partnership,
will be available for review by limited partners of that Partnership.
9. In any case where co-investments are made with an Affiliated Co-investor, any individual involved in the management
of both the Partnerships and the Affiliated Co-investor will not participate in the Partnerships' determination
of whether to effect any co-investment transaction.

Finding of No Significant Impact: MG Industries, Inc., pipeline at Otay Mesa, CA



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of State.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of a finding of no significant impact with regard to an application to amend MG Industries permit to authorize
installation of a third pipeline in the existing right of way across the U.S.-Mexico border in San Diego County, California.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of State has conducted an environmental assessment of the proposal to amend MG Industries permit authorizing
installation of a third pipeline to transport liquid argon alongside two existing pipelines across the U.S.-Mexico
international boundary. Based on the environmental assessment and after reviewing all comments, the Department
of State has concluded that amendment of the existing Presidential Permit will not have a significant effect on the
human environment. Consequently, no environmental impact statement was prepared.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

MG Industries, Inc., has applied for an amendment to a Presidential Permit issued September 4, 1991 authorizing installation
of a third pipeline carrying liquid argon alongside two existing pipelines carrying oxygen and nitrogen across the
U.S.-Mexico border at Otay Mesa, California. Argon is an inert, colorless, odorless gas that is a natural component
of the earth's atmosphere. The liquid argon has been transported by tank truck. The U.S. Customs Service requested
installation of a pipeline to facilitate border inspection and control.



The Department of State has concluded that amendment of the permit will not have a significant effect on the human environment.
This finding is based on an environmental assessment conducted by the Department of State. 

The proposed installation of a new pipeline will require no new construction. The lid of the existing concrete duct
containing two existing pipelines will be lifted and the third (two inch) pipeline installed. The material to be conveyed
in the new pipeline, liquid argon, is an inert, colorless, odorless gas that is a naturally occurring component of
the atmosphere. Thus, any release of the argon would have no environmental consequence.

Noise Exposure Map Notice; Receipt of Noise Compatibility Program and Request for Review Central Florida Regional
Airport Sanford, FL




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its determination that the revised future noise exposure map
submitted by the Sanford Airport Authority, Sanford, Florida for The Central Florida Regional Airport under the
provisions of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96-193) and 14 CFR part 150
is in compliance with applicable requirements. The FAA also announces that it is reviewing a proposed noise compatibility
program that was submitted for The Central Florida Regional Airport under part 150 in conjunction with the noise exposure
maps, and that this program will be approved or disapproved on or before October 16, 1994. This program was submitted
subsequent to a determination by FAA that the associated existing noise exposure map submitted under 14 CFR part 150
for The Central Florida Regional Airport was in compliance with applicable requirements effective September 16,
1993.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The notice announces that the FAA finds that the revised future noise exposure map submitted for The Central Florida
Regional Airport is in compliance with applicable requirements of part 150, effective April 19, 1994. Further, FAA
is reviewing a proposed noise compatibility program for that airport which will be approved or disapproved on or before
October 16, 1994. This notice also announces the availability of this program for public review and comment.




Under section 103 of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the
Act''), an airport operator may submit to the FAA noise exposure maps which meet applicable regulations and which
depict noncompatible land uses as of the date of submission of such maps, a description of projected aircraft operations,
and the ways in which such operations will affect such maps. The Act requires such maps to be developed in consultation
with interested and affected parties to the local community, government agencies, and persons using the airport.

An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by FAA to be in compliance with the requirements
of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part 150, promulgated pursuant to Title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility
program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing
noncompatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatible uses.

The Sanford Airport Authority, Sanford, Florida, submitted to the FAA on March 8, 1994, a revised future noise exposure
map, descriptions and other documentation which were produced during the Central Florida Regional Airport FAR part
150 Study conducted between September, 1992 and February, 1994. It was requested that the FAA review this material
as the future noise exposure map, as described in section 103(a)(1) of the Act, and that the noise mitigation measures,
to be implemented jointly by the airport and surrounding communities, be approved as a noise compatibility program
under section 104(b) of the Act.
The FAA has completed its review of the revised future noise exposure map and related descriptions submitted by the
Sanford Airport Authority, Sanford, Florida. The specific map under consideration is ``Future (1998) DNL Noise
Contours With Recommended Controls'' in the submission. The FAA has determined that this map for The Central Florida
Regional Airport is in compliance with applicable requirements. This determination is effective on April 19, 1994.
FAA's determination on an airport operator's noise exposure maps is limited to a funding that the maps were developed
in accordance with the procedures contained in appendix A of FAR part 150. Such determination does not constitute
approval of the applicant's data, information or plans, or a commitment to approve a noise compatibility program
or to fund the implementation of that program.
If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific properties to noise exposure contours depicted
on a noise exposure map submitted under section 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involved in any way
in determining the relative locations of specific properties with regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting
the noise exposure maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which properties should be covered by the provisions
of section 107 of the Act. These functions are inseparable from the ultimate land use control and planning responsibilities
of local government. These local responsibilities are not changed in any way under part 150 or through FAA's review
of noise exposure maps. Therefore, the responsibility for the detailed overlaying of noise exposure contours onto
the map depicting properties on the surface rests exclusively with the airport operator which submitted those maps,
or with those public agencies and planning agencies with which consultation is required under section 103 of the Act.
The FAA has relied on the certification by the airport operator, under  150.21 of FAR part 150 that the statutorily
required consultation has been accomplished.
The FAA has formally received the noise compatibility program for The Central Florida Regional Airport, also effective
on April 19, 1994. Preliminary review of the submitted material indicated that it conforms to the requirements for
the submittal of noise compatibility programs, but that further review will be necessary prior to approval or disapproval
of the program. The formal review period, limited by law to a maximum of 180 days, will be completed on or before October
16, 1994.
The FAA's detailed evaluation will be conducted under the provisions of 14 CFR part 150,  150.33. The primary
considerations in the evaluation process are whether the proposed measures may reduce the level of aviation safety,
create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, or be reasonable consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing
existing noncompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses.
Interested persons are invited to comment on the program with specific reference to these factors. All Comments,
other than those properly addressed to local land use authorities, will be considered by the FAA to the extent practicable.
Copies of the noise exposure maps, the FAA's evaluation of the maps, and the proposed noise compatibility program
are available for examination at the following locations:

<DOCTITLE>Environmental Impact Statement; Davidson County, TN</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an environmental impact statement will be prepared for a proposed
project in Nashville Tennessee.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The FHWA, in cooperation with the Tennessee Department of Transportation and the City of Nashville will prepare an
environmental impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to improve access through the Nashville Central Business District,
extending from Interstate Route (I-40) and Demonbreun Street to Interstate Routes 24/65 (I-24/65) and
Shelby Avenue in Nashville, Tennessee. The proposed improvement would primarily use existing streets and would
include the reconstruction of existing or construction of new structures over both the CSX Railroad and the Cumberland
River, replacing the existing Demonbreun Street Viaduct and the Shelby Avenue Bridge, depending upon the choice
of proposed alternatives. Improvements to the corridor are considered necessary to provide for both present and
projected traffic needs. 


Options under consideration include (1) widening the existing corridor which includes the Demonbreun Street Viaduct,
Demonbreun Street and the Shelby Avenue Bridge, and (2) utilizing other corridors south of the existing alignment
and constructing new structures over the River and Rialroad. A total of four build alternatives are being considered.
Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments were sent to appropriate federal, state and local
agencies on April 12, 1994. A public meeting soliciting comments on the included alternatives was held on March 3,
1994. A public hearing will be held at a future date. Public notice will be given of the time and place of this hearing.
The Draft EIS will be available for public and agency review and comment. These activities are providing input regarding
the scope of the EIS.
To ensure that the full range of issues to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified,
comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments and suggestions concerning the proposed
action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided above. (Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance
Program Number 20.205, Highway Research, Planning and Construction. The provisions of Executive Order 12372 regarding
state and local clearinghouse review of federal and federally assisted programs and projects apply to this program.)

<DOCTITLE>Petition for Waivers of Compliance </DOCTITLE>



In accordance with title 49 CFR   211.9 and 211.41, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration
(FRA) has received a request for waiver of compliance with certain requirements of the Federal safety laws and regulations.
The petition is described below, including the regulatory provisions involved, the nature of the relief being requested
and petitioner's arguments in favor of relief.




Canadian National Railway Company (CN)



Since the turn of the century, CN and its predecessor has operated trains over its Sprague Subdivision between Winnipeg,
Manitoba and Thunder Bay, Ontario, a distance of 433 miles. Approximately 44 miles of this trackage traverses the
State of Minnesota between International Boundary and Rainy River. A minimum of 12 CN trains per day operate between
Winnipeg and Thunder Bay over this line with mainly traffic originating and terminating in Canada. CN has always considered
this bridge traffic to be a Canadian operation and has operated all such trains in compliance with all Canadian regulations.
Certain regulations of the FRA differ from Canadian regulations. Canadian locomotives and cars which are to be interchanged
in the United States are built or modified to be in compliance with FRA standards and are designated for ``International
Service''. In addition to the above ``bridge trains'', a minimum of six daily ``International Service'' trains are
operated on the Sprague Subdivision between Winnipeg and Duluth, Minnesota. The waivers are requested for the ``bridge
trains'' only. Following are the individual petitions involved.



FRA Docket Number RSGM-93-30



Canadian requirements for locomotive and caboose glazing are similar to those of the FRA except Canada does not mandate
retrofit of equipment built prior to November 19, 1982, whereas FRA requires that basically all equipment be retrofitted.
The area of operation is remote and there have been no incidents or injuries related to glazing. Locomotives and cabooses
designated for International Service do meet FRA requirements. CN seeks a waiver for ``bridge trains'' on the Sprague
Subdivision from the requirements of   223.11(c) and 223.13(c) that locomotives and cabooses be equipped
with FRA certified glazing by June 30, 1984.



FRA Docket Number RSRM-93-1



Canadian rules for rear end markers allow retroreflective markers as opposed to the highly visible marker light required
by 49 CFR part 221. CN has approximately 720 rear end-of-train telemetry devices with the reflective material and
113 with FRA flashing red markers. The latter are designated for International Service. CN estimates that at least
100 additional devices with lights would be required on the Sprague Subdivision at an overall cost of $1,800 each.
CN states that all trains operated on the Sprague Subdivision are governed by centralized traffic control (CTC) and
train separation is ensured by two separate mechanisms. A Rail Traffic Controller supervises the movement of all
trains, controlling signals at junctions, sidings, etc. An automatic intermediate signal system is actuated automatically
by the train within a particular block. In the 15 years of operation with CTC on this subdivision, no rear end collision
has occurred. CN seeks a waiver of compliance from the requirements part 221 for all ``bridge trains'' on the Sprague
Subdivision.


FRA Docket Number LI-93-16


Title 49 CFR  229.123 requires that ``each lead locomotive be equipped with an end plate that extends across
both rails, a pilot, or a snowplow.'' Presently, 95 percent of CN's locomotives meet this requirement. To equip the
remaining 50 locomotives would cost approximately $1,000 each. Only rarely would one of these locomotives be in the
lead on a train on the Sprague Subdivision. There has never been an accident or injury attributable to these locomotives
on this subdivision. CN seeks a waiver of compliance from the provisions of 49 CFR 229.123 for all ``bridge trains''
on the Sprague Subdivision.

CN tests and inspects its locomotives at least once every 3 months as required by Canadian Transport Board Order O-21
and the results are documented on a form, one copy of which is displayed in the cab of the locomotive. FRA has similar
inspection, test and documentation requirements each 92 days. FRA also requires that each locomotive be inspected
at least once during each calendar day and that the record of the inspection be maintained. Canadian daily inspection
requirements differ in that only the lead locomotive safety control devices are certified as operating. In addition,
engineers are required to report and record locomotive defects found enroute. CN feels all safety requirements are
satisfied by their system. CN seeks a waiver of compliance with 49 CFR  229.23 and  229.21 for all ``bridge
trains'' on the Sprague Subdivision.

<DOCTITLE>Petition for Exemption or Waiver of Compliance </DOCTITLE>


In accordance with title 49 CFR   211.9 and 211.41, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration
(FRA) has received requests for exemptions from or waivers of compliance with a requirement of its safety standards.
The individual petitions are described below, including the party seeking relief, the regulatory provisions involved,
and the nature of the relief being requested.
Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written reviews, data, or comments.
FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear
to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comment, they should notify FRA, in writing,
before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request. 

All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition
Docket Number RSGM-94-4), and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel,
FRA, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, 
DC 20590. 

Communications received before June 10, 1994, will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received
after that date will be considered as far as practicable. All written communications concerning these proceedings
are available for examination during regular business 
hours (9 a.m.-5 p.m.) in room 8201, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. 
The individual petitions seeking an exemption or waiver of compliance are as follows:


Cape May Seashore Lines (CMSX); Waiver Petition Docket Number RSGM-94-4


The CMSX seeks a permanent waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Safety Glazing Standards (49 CFR part
223) for three self-propelled passenger cars. CMSX has exclusive rights to operate rail passenger service on the
27-mile long rail line between Tuckahoe and Cape May, New Jersey. Initially, two services will be provided; a tourist
train ride between Cape May and Cape May Court House, New Jersey, a total distance of 12 miles and a shuttle service between
Cape May and Rio Grande, New Jersey, a distance of 6 miles. Self-propelled Rail Diesel Cars built in 1950 and 1951, will
be used in both operations. The cars are presently equipped with laminated safety glass. 


Adrian and Blissfield Railroad Company (ABRX); Waiver Petition Docket Number RSGM-94-5


The ABRX seeks a permanent waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Safety Glazing Standards (49 CFR part
223) for one passenger car. The car, which was built in 1949, is used in excursion service between Adrian and Blissfield,
Michigan, a distance of approximately 10 miles. The railroad operates in a rural area and there have been no incidents
of vandalism in three years.


Wisconsin Central LTD. (WC); Waiver Petition Docket Number RSGM-94-6


The WC on behalf of their customer Flambeau Papers, seeks a permanent waiver of compliance with certain provisions
of the Safety Glazing Standards (49 CFR part 223) for one locomotive. The locomotive, an EMD Model SW-1 built
in 1950, is used primarily in the Flambeau plant but is used approximately 30 minutes each day in picking up and setting
out cars in the WC Yard at Park Falls, Wisconsin. The distance traveled on the WC is approximately 1 mile.


Newburgh and South Shore Railroad Company (NSR); Waiver Petition Docket Number RSGM 94-7


The NSR seeks a permanent waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Safety Glazing Standards (49 CFR part
223) for two locomotives. The locomotives are used in switching service to the NSR within the Cleveland, Ohio, switching
district. The locomotives were formerly owned by the Newburgh and Southern Railway and were covered by waiver RSGM-80-38.


Dubois County Railroad (DCRR); Waiver Petition Docket Number RSGM-94-8


The DCRR seeks a permanent waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Safety Glazing Standards (49 CFR part
223) for one locomotive. The DCRR operates over 16 miles of track between Dubois and Huntingburg, Indiana. The railroad
states there has been no problem with vandalism in this rural area. The locomotive, a 1000 hP ALCO switcher built in
1953, is now equipped with safety glass.

<DOCTITLE>Withdrawal of Petition for Import Eligibility Determination</DOCTITLE>


The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (``NHTSA'') published notice in the 

Federal Register

 on October 26, 1993 (58 FR 57666) that it had received from Champagne Imports, Inc. of Lansdale, Pennsylvania, a Registered
Importer of motor vehicles, a petition for a determination that a 1993 Jaguar XJ6 that was not originally manufactured
to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards is eligible for importation into the United
States. Such a petition may be granted under section 108(c)(3)(C)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act and 49 CFR part 593 if the Registered Importer demonstrates (1) that the vehicle is substantially similar
to a vehicle that was originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and that was certified
by its manufacturer as complying with the safety standards, and (2) that it is capable of being readily modified to
conform to the standards. Following publication of the notice, Champagne Imports informed NHTSA that it was unable
to demonstrate such compliance for the 1993 Jaguar XJ6 and that, accordingly, its petition was being withdrawn.
NHTSA possesses insufficient information to determine independently whether the 1993 Jaguar XJ6 is capable of being
readily modified to conform to the standards, and therefore will make no decision regarding that vehicle at this time.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of public symposium.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

RSPA will host a public symposium on carbon fiber composite technology and its application to the design of overwapped
metallic cylinders for transportation of compressed gases.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

RSPA will host a public symposium on carbon fiber composite technology and its application to the design of over-wrapped
metallic cylinders for transportation of compressed gases in commerce. The purpose of this symposium is to obtain
information on state-of-the art carbon fiber composite technology, experience in prolonged use under normal and
extreme temperatures, and applications to pressurized cylinders. The symposium is structured toward the presentation
of technical papers from industry and government experts and follow-up discussions. RSPA anticipates hearing from
representatives of the Compressed Gas Association and composite cylinder manufacturers. Other persons interested
in presenting technical papers should contact RSPA in advance. 



Carbon fiber composite pressure vessel technology is being used in aerospace applications, such as in pressure vessels
and rocket motor casings. Application of this advanced technology to the commercial transportation of compressed
gases in high pressure cylinders may offer a significant weight and efficiency advantage over current packaging
systems without compromising safety. However, safety considerations differ between the design of aerospace vehicles
and support systems and the design of cylinders that transport compressed gases in commerce. Issues of most concern
to RSPA include materials technology, cylinder design and fabrication, and quality assurance. There also will be
a presentation and discussion on the performance of a failure mode and effects analysis when considering the use of
of advanced technologies in the design of compressed gas cylinders. This symposium will not address issues relating
to compressed natural gas fuel systems for vehicles.

AGENCY:

 Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), DOT.




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Advisory to offshore pipeline operators on coordinating emergency planning with offshore producers. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This advisory calls the attention of offshore pipeline facility operators to a safety recommendation by the National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) regarding the need for emergency planning and coordination between themselves
and offshore producers. 



Advisory 



As a result of NTSB accident report NTSB/PAR-90/02 and NTSB Safety Recommendation P-90-31, on an
incident on October 3, 1989, involving a Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) underwater transmission
line in the Gulf of Mexico, this advisory bulletin informs offshore pipeline operators of the following report findings:

(a) The accident report records the following shortcomings in the transmission line operator's emergency plan for
offshore emergencies (NTSB's rationale is in parenthesis): 
(1) Inadequate guidance for Gas Control personnel on notification procedures (when NGPL Gas Control personnel were
first notified of the accident, they failed to contact the district superintendent directly). 
(2) Inadequate guidance on the duties and responsibilities of the emergency coordinator (the district superintendent
failed to properly fulfill his duties as emergency coordinator because of a lack of guidance in the NGPL emergency
plan). 
(3) Inadequate guidance for liaison and coordination with public officials (although the NGPL emergency plan listed
a telephone number for the Coast Guard, NGPL took no action to establish liaison with local Coast Guard officials).

(4) Inadequate guidance for liaison and coordination with offshore producers (neither the NGPL emergency plan nor
the district superintendent had an emergency telephone number with which to contact personnel responsible for the
unmanned offshore production platform where automatic shutdown equipment was located and which failed to shut off
gas flow into the failed pipeline). 
(b) With respect to item (a)(3) above, the requirements for emergency plans in 49 CFR 192.615 for gas pipelines, and
similar requirements in 49 CFR 195.402(e) for hazardous liquids pipelines, require operators to establish and maintain
adequate communication and liaison with appropriate fire, police and other public officials. As noted in (a)(3)
above, the operator failed to establish adequate means of communication and liaison with the local Coast Guard (public
officials) as required by 49 CFR 192.615. 



Background 



This advisory bulletin is based on two offshore pipeline failures and an NTSB safety recommendation. 
In March 1989, an ARCO production platform in the Gulf of Mexico was engulfed in flames and destroyed when a sudden release
of gas ignited during repairs to a Southern Natural Gas Company (SONAT) 18
'
' offshore pipeline. There were seven fatalities. In preparing for the repair work, SONAT began venting the
pipeline to atmosphere through piping at the ARCO platform. Unfortunately, and unbeknown to SONAT, venting came
to a halt when ARCO personnel isolated the platform by closing valves on all pipelines entering the platform, including
SONAT's 18'' pipeline (ARCO did this in preparation for some platform maintenance work). As a result, the 18
'
' pipeline which the SONAT crew began to repair, and which they thought had been safely vented free of flammables,
still contained some gas and liquids. A cutting machine was being used on the pipeline's 18
'
' riser at the platform, and as cutting neared completion, the pipe separated unexpectedly, releasing gas
and liquids which ignited. In the judgment of Federal accident investigators, a lack of adequate coordination between
both the producer's (ARCO) and the pipeline operator's (SONAT) field personnel was a significant contributing factor.

In October 1989, another pipeline failure involving fatalities occurred in the Gulf of Mexico. A fishing vessel,
the Northumberland (crew of 14), punctured an NGPL 16
'
' underwater transmission line carrying natural gas at 835 psig pressure. The escaping gas ignited almost
immediately, creating a fireball which completely destroyed the vessel. Eleven (11) crew members perished. The
incident happened at approximately 6:00 PM. However, gas flow feeding the fire was not fully shut off for over three
hours, until shortly after 9:15 PM. 
According to the NTSB report, a major contributing factor in this long delay was the lack of a telephone number for contacting
the operators of an unmanned production platform [refer to (a)(4) above]. As a result, NTSB Safety Recommendation
P-90-31 was issued to RSPA, as follows: 




Evaluate, with the assistance of the Minerals Management Service, the need for emergency planning and coordination
between offshore pipeline operators and producers, and then implement, if necessary, appropriate safety regulations.





The NTSB report also noted an inadequacy involving communications with local Coast Guard officials [refer to (b)
above] and shortcomings [refer to (a)(1) through (a)(5) above]. 




Issued in Washington, DC, on May 5, 1994.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Departmental Offices, Treasury.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice to delete Privacy Act systems of records.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of the Treasury is deleting the following systems from its inventory of Privacy Act systems of records
notices.




Treasury/DO .003_Personnel Working Files;
Treasury/United States Mint .006_Examination Reports of Coins Forwarded to the Mint from U.S. Secret Service;
Treasury/United States Mint .010_Purchases and Sales of Precious Metals; and 
Treasury/United States Mint .001_Redemption of Uncurrent or Mutilated Coins.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of the Treasury conducted a review of several of its Privacy
Act systems of records. The records covered by Treasury/DO .003_Personnel Working Files, are used by office directors
within the Departmental Offices for basic factual data about an individual's employment while at the Department
of the Treasury. Records in this system are used in various ways by office directors or other supervisory personnel,
including screening qualifications of employees; determining status, eligibility, recommendations for promotions
and/or suspensions, performance appraisals, and other information needed to conduct day-to-day personnel administration.





It has been determined that Treasury/DO .003_Personnel Working Files, duplicates the government-wide system of
records covered by OPM/GOVT-1_General Personnel Records, established by the Office of Personnel Management.
Treasury/DO .003 also contains records covered by OPM/GOVT-2_Employee Performance File System Records,
and OPM/GOVT-3 Records of Adverse Actions, Performance Based Reduction in Grade and Removal Actions, and Termination
of Probationers. Therefore, Treasury/DO .003_Personnel Working Files, is being deleted from Treasury's inventory
of Privacy Act systems of records. The system notice was last published in its entirety in the 

Federal Register, 

Vol. 57, page 13905, April 17, 1992.

There systems of records maintained by the United States Mint were reviewed and it was determined the records were
no longer subject to the Privacy Act. System of records Treasury/United States Mint .006_Examination Reports of
Coins Forwarded to Mint from U.S. Secret Service, no long maintains the records on individuals and the information
is not retrievable by name or other personal identifier. Treasury/United States Mint .010_Purchases and Sales of
Precious Metals, is being deleted because the U.S. Mint no longer purchases precious metals from individuals. The
system of records titled Treasury/United States Mint .011_Redemption of Uncurrent or Mutilated Coins, is being
deleted because the records are not retrievable by name or other personal identifier. The system notices were last
published in their entirely in the 

Federal Register, 

Vol. 57, pages 14117, 14119 and 14120 respectively, on April 17, 1992.

 Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA).

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This NOFA announces HUD's FY 1994 funding of $13,125,000 for the Youth Sports Program (YSP) to be used for sports, cultural,
educational, recreational, or other activities designed to appeal to youth as alternatives to the drug environment
in public or Indian housing developments. In the body of this document is information concerning the purpose of the
NOFA, applicant eligibility, available amounts, selection criteria, and application processing, including how
to apply and how selections will be made

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 




The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and have been assigned OMB control number 2577-0140.



I. Purpose and Substantive Description 



(a) Authority 




This program is authorized by section 520 of the National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) (approved November 28, 1990,
Pub. L. 101-625), as amended by section 126 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (HCDA 1992) (Pub.
L. 102-550, approved October 28, 1992). 



(b) Allocation Amounts 




Section 126(a) of HCDA (1992) provides that five percent of any amount made available in any fiscal year for the Drug
Elimination Program shall be available for Youth Sports Program grants. The Departments of Veterans Affairs and
Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act 1993, (approved October 28, 1993, Pub.
L. 103-124), (94 App. Act) appropriated $265 million for the Drug Elimination Program in FY 1994. This appropriation
results in $13,250,000 as the amount set aside for the Youth Sports Program. Of this amount, $125,000 is being used
to fund the FY 1993 application of the Greenville Housing Authority, which was not funded in FY 1993 because of a computational
error, leaving $13,125,000 as the available amount under this NOFA. Program funds are to be used for sports, cultural,
educational, recreational, or other activities designed to appeal to youth as alternatives to the drug environment
in public or Indian housing developments. 

Because of the limited amount of funding appropriated for this program, and to ensure that the program is implemented
on a broad, nationwide basis, each applicant may submit only one application. The maximum annual Youth Sports grant
amount per applicant is $125,000. As more fully explained below, applicants must supplement grant funds with an amount
of funds from non-Federal sources equal to or greater than 50 percent of the amount provided by the grant.

(c) Eligibility 




(1) Eligible Applicants 




Funding for this program in FY 1994 is limited to PHAs and IHAs. Although section 520 of NAHA lists seven categories
of entities qualified to receive grants (States; units of general local government; local park and recreation districts
and agencies; public housing agencies (PHAs); nonprofit organizations providing youth sports services programs;
Indian tribes; and Indian housing authorities (IHAs)), and HCDA 1992 section 126(b) added institutions of higher
learning that have never participated in a Youth Sports program as eligible applicants, the 94 App. Act limited the
funding for the Drug Elimination Program to PHAs and IHAs only. Since the funding of the Youth Sports Program is dependent
on the appropriation for the Drug Elimination Program, the limitations that apply to Drug Elimination affect Youth
Sports as well. Therefore, for FY 1994 only PHAs and IHAs are eligible applicants for Youth Sports Program Funding.



In designing an activity for funding, PHA and IHA applicants shall consult with RMCs/RCs where they exist, and with
other entities that would be eligible for funding under this program, as listed above, with at least two years of experience
in designing or operating sports, cultural, recreational, educational or other activities for youth. Eligible
local entities that are affiliates of national organizations may rely on the experience of the national organization
for this purpose. These consultations will provide applicants with valuable resident input and will involve entities
with experience in designing and implementing the eligible types of activities under this program with PHA and IHA
applicants that may not have this type of experience. These experienced entities may establish a sub-contracting
relationship, in accordance with 24 CFR part 85, with the PHA/IHA if deemed appropriate by the grantee to further their
public/private partnership. This consultation process will also provide entities that are not PHAs or IHAs with
a greater appreciation and understanding of the operations and problems of public and Indian housing developments.
The end result will be more effective program activities that make more efficient use of program funds. This result
is expected because it draws upon and combines the expertise of PHA and IHA applicants with respect to the operations
and problems of public and Indian housing developments, and the expertise of other entities with respect to designing
and implementing youth activities. 




(2) Eligible Activities 




Youth Sports Program funds may be used to assist in carrying out sports, cultural, recreational, educational or other
activities for youth in any of the following manners: 


(i) Acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of community centers, parks, or playgrounds is an eligible activity
under the Youth Sports Program. 


(A) Acquisition, construction or rehabilitation costs shall not be approved unless the applicant demonstrates
the need for the type of facilities to be assisted by the grant (section III.(a)(3) of this NOFA). 


(B) Facilities that receive Youth Sports funding must be used primarily for youth from the public or Indian housing
developments in which the funded facility is operated (section III.(a)(2)(ii) and III.(a)(10)(iii) of this NOFA).



(C) Facilities (community centers, parks, or playgrounds) acquired, constructed, or rehabilitated under this
program must be on or adjacent to the premises of the public housing development identified in the application for
assistance under this program. In the case of Indian Housing Authorities, the applicant must specify how youth from
IHA developments will have access to the facility, since IHAs often cover large areas (section III.(a)(9) of this
NOFA). 


(D) Facilities receiving Youth Sports funding must comply with any applicable local or tribal building requirements
for recreational facilities (section III.(a)(2)(iii) of this NOFA). 


(E) Facilities receiving Youth Sports funding must be used for Youth Sports activities commensurate with the extent
of the Youth Sports funding. For example, if a facility's operation is funded 60 percent by a Youth Sports grant, then
it must be used at least 60 percent for Youth Sports activities. 


(F) In accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR 8.21, facilities should be designed and constructed to be readily
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. Alterations to existing facilities shall, to the maximum
extent feasible, make them made readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. 


(G) In accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR 8.20, no qualified applicant with handicaps shall, because a recipient's
facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the benefit of, be excluded from
participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination in the program. 


(ii) Redesigning or modifying public spaces in public or Indian housing developments to provide increased utilization
of the areas by Youth Sports activities is an eligible activity under this program. 


(A) The construction of sports facilities on public or Indian housing property to implement Youth Sports activities
is permitted under this program. These facilities may include, but not be limited to, baseball diamonds, basketball
courts, football fields, tutoring centers, swimming pools, soccer fields, public or Indian housing community centers,
and tennis courts. 


(iii) Provision of public services, including salaries and expenses for staff of youth sports programs, cultural
activities, transportation costs, educational programs relating to drug abuse, and sports and recreation equipment
are eligible activities under this program. 


(A) Educational programs for youth relating to illegal drug use are permitted under this section. The program must
be formally organized and provide the knowledge and skills youth need to make informed decisions on the potential
and immediate dangers of drug abuse and involvement with illegal drugs. Grantees may contract with drug education
professionals to provide the appropriate training or workshops. These educational programs may be part of organized
sports activities or other eligible youth activities. 


(B) Activities providing an economic/educational orientation for Youth Sports Program participants are eligible
for funding as public services. These activities must provide, for public or Indian housing youth, the opportunities
for interaction with, or referral to, higher educational or vocational institutions, and develop the skills of program
participants to pursue educational, vocational, and economic goals. These activities may also provide public or
Indian housing youth the opportunity to interact with private sector businesses in their community with the purpose
of promoting the development of educational, vocational, and economic goals in public or Indian housing youth. 

(C) The cost of the initial purchase of sports and recreation equipment to be used by program participants is permitted
under this program.

(D) Cultural and recreational activities, such as ethnic heritage classes, and art, dance, drama and music appreciation
and instruction programs are eligible Youth Sports Program activities. 


(E) Youth leadership skills training for program participants is permitted under this program. These activities
must provide opportunities designed to involve public and Indian housing youth in peer leadership roles in the implementation
of program activities, for example, as team or activity captains, counselors to younger program participants, assistant
coaches, and equipment or supplies managers. Grantees may contract with youth trainers to provide services which
may include training in peer pressure reversal, resistance or refusal skills, goal planning, parenting skills,
and other relevant topics. 


(F) Transportation costs directly related to Youth Sports activities (for example, leasing a vehicle to transport
a Youth Sports team to a game) are eligible program expenses. 


(G) The purchase of vehicles under this program is prohibited. 


(H) Liability insurance costs directly related to Youth Sports activities are eligible program expenses. 




(3) Threshold Requirements for Funding



Every activity proposed for funding under the Youth Sports Program must satisfy each of the following requirements
or it will not be considered for funding: 


(i) The activity must be operated as, in conjunction with, or in furtherance of, an organized program or plan designed

identified in its application from the following: 


(A) States; 


(B) Units of general local government or agencies of such governments; 


(C) Indian tribes; 


(D) Private contributions; 


(E) Any salary paid to staff to carry out the Youth Sports activities of the applicant, computed as follows: 


(1) Only that portion of staff salaries representing time that will be spent on new and additional duties directly
involved with Youth Sports activities may qualify as funds from non-Federal sources;

comparable buildings.

(vi) Grant funds provided under this program and any State, tribal, or local funds used to supplement grant funds under
this program may not be used to replace other public funds previously used, or designated for use, for the purpose of
this program. (See, section III.(a)(2)(vi).



(d) Selection Criteria



Each application for a grant award that is submitted in a timely manner to the local HUD field office or, in the case of
IHAs, to the appropriate HUD Office of Native American Programs, and that otherwise meets the requirements of this
NOFA, will be evaluated. An application must receive a minimum score of 75 points out of the maximum of 120 points that
may be awarded under this competition to be eligible for funding. Grants will be awarded to the three highest-ranked,
eligible PHA applications within each of the following 10 groupings of Area and State Offices:




New England, New York, New Jersey, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Midwest, Great Plains, Rocky Mountain, Southwest,
Northwest/Alaska, Pacific/Hawaii.




In addition, grants will be awarded to the three highest-ranked, eligible IHA applications on a nation-wide basis,
subject to the following condition: Of the total grants awarded to IHAs, the Director of ONAP retains the authority
to insure that each Field Office of Native American programs receives a minimum of one eligible grant. This means that
before an award is made to an IHA from the jurisdiction of a Field ONAP in which an IHA has already received an award, that
award may be made to the next highest scoring IHA from the jurisdiction of a Field ONAP in which no IHA has yet received
an award.

All of the remaining eligible applications, both PHAs and IHAs, will then be placed in overall nation-wide ranking
order, with the remaining funds granted in order of rank, except as discussed above for IHAs, until all funds are awarded.
The following criteria will be used to evaluate eligible applications:

(1) The extent to which the Youth Sports activities to be assisted with the grant address the particular needs of the
area to be served by the activities and employs methods, approaches, or ideas in the design or implementation of the
activities particularly suited to fulfilling the needs (whether such methods are conventional or unique and innovative).
(Maximum points: 25). In assessing this criterion, HUD will consider the following factors:

(i) The appropriateness of the applicant's methods, approaches, or ideas in addressing the particular needs of the
area to be served by the program, as reflected in the description of the services to be provided by the applicant's proposed
Youth Sports Program (section III.(a)(3) of this NOFA); (10 points)

(9) The extent to which the applicant demonstrates local government or tribal support for the program. (Maximum points:
5) In assessing this criterion, HUD will consider the following factor: 

(i) The applicant's description of local or tribal government support as evidenced by contributions from these entities
listed under section III.(a)(5) of this NOFA. (5 points) 



(e) Environmental Review




Before making an award of grant funds under this part, HUD will perform an environmental review to the extent required
under the provisions of NEPA, applicable related authorities at 24 CFR 50.4, and HUD's implementing regulations
at 24 CFR part 50. 



II. Application Process




(a) An application package may be obtained from the local HUD field office or by calling HUD's Drug Information and
Strategy Clearinghouse at 1-800-578-3472. The application package contains information on all
exhibits and certifications required under this NOFA. 

(b) The deadline for the submission of grant applications under this NOFA is June 20, 1994. In order to be eligible,
the original and two copies of the application must be physically received by 4:30 p.m., local time, on the deadline
date at the local HUD field office or, in the case of IHAs, in the local HUD Office of Indian Programs, with jurisdiction
over the PHA or IHA, Attention: Public Housing Division Director, or Office of Indian Programs Director. A list of
these offices is included as Appendix 1 to this NOFA. This application deadline is firm as to date and hour. In the interest
of fairness to all competing applicants, the Department will treat as ineligible for consideration any application
that is received after the deadline. Applicants should take this practice into account and make early submission
of their materials to avoid any risk of loss of eligibility brought about by any unanticipated or delivery-related
problems. A Fax is not acceptable.

from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or
activity for which the applicant receives financial assistance; and will immediately take any measures necessary
to effectuate this agreement. With reference to the real property and structures which are provided or improved with
the aid of federal financial assistance extended to the applicant, this assurance shall obligate the applicant,

(F) It will comply with section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and with implementing regulations
at 24 CFR part 8, which prohibit discrimination based on handicap in federally assisted and conducted programs and
activities;

<PARENT> FR940511-2-00128 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(4) A workplan with an 18 months maximum task timeline providing an implementation schedule for the Youth Sports activities.


(5) A budget describing the financial and other resources committed to each activity and service of the program. The
budget must identify the share of the costs of the applicant's Youth Sports activities provided by a grant under this
program and provide a narrative describing how the share of the costs provided from other sources of funds (e.g. local
or tribal government, corporations, individuals), including funds from non-Federal sources, will be obtained.


(6) A statement regarding the extent to which the applicant's proposed Youth Sports activities meet the selection
criteria in section I.(d), above. 

(7) A plan designed to eliminate drugs and drug-related problems on the premises of the housing developments proposed
for funding. Applicants are given a choice to satisfy this requirement in one of two ways. First, an applicant may submit
a current-year plan prepared for the housing developments in accordance with 24 CFR 961.15 as a part of a Drug Elimination
Program grant. In this case, the applicant must indicate how its proposed Youth Sports activities will be operated
as, in conjunction with, or in furtherance of the  961.15 plan. The other choice is that an applicant may submit
an abbreviated plan prepared for this NOFA as follows: 

(i) The plan must describe the drug-related problems in the developments that are proposed for funding under this
program, using: 

(A) Objective data, if available, from the local police precinct or the PHA's or IHA's records on the types, number
and sources of drug-related crime in the developments proposed for assistance. If crime statistics are not available
at the development or precinct level, the applicant may use other reliable, objective data including those derived
from the records of Resident Management Corporations (RMCs), Resident Corporations (RCs), or other resident associations.
The data should cover the past one-year period and, to the extent feasible, should indicate whether these data reflect
a percentage increase or decrease in drug-related crime over the past several years. 

(B) Information from other sources which has a direct bearing on drug-related problems in the developments proposed
for assistance. Examples of these data are: Resident/staff surveys on drug-related issues or on-site reviews to
determine drug activity; vandalism costs and related vacancies attributable to drug-related crime; information
from schools, health service providers, residents and police. 

(ii) The plan must include a narrative discussion of the applicant's current activities, if any, to eliminate drug-related
problems in the targeted developments. Any efforts being undertaken by community and governmental entities, residents
of the development, Resident Management Corporations (RMCs), Resident Corporations (RCs), other resident associations,
or any other entities to address the drug-related problems in the developments proposed for assistance must be described.
The applicant must also indicate how its proposed Youth Sports activities will be operated as, in conjunction with,
or in furtherance of the other activities described in the plan. 

(8) An estimate of the number of youth involved. 

(i) The applicant must provide the total estimated number of youth involved for each proposed activity and participating
in youth leadership assignments (for example, team managers, assistant managers, team captains) computed on an
annual and, if applicable, a session or seasonal basis (for example, classes or league sports may be organized in sessions
or seasons that run for a certain number of weeks or months, or more activities may take place and more youth may be involved
on weekends than on weekdays). 

(ii) The total estimated number given for each activity must be further broken down by categories of age (e.g., 5-8
years old, 9-12 years old, etc.), sex (male, female, co-ed), and residency in public or Indian housing. 

(9) A description of the facilities used. 

(i) Facilities to be used for Youth Sports activities must be described in the application with regard to their dimensions,
location, accessibility to the disabled, and the number of youth that can be accommodated at one time. 

(A) In the case of an Indian housing development, if a facility to be acquired, constructed, or rehabilitated is not
located on or adjacent to the premises of the development to be assisted, the application must specify how youth from
the Indian housing development will have access to the facility (e.g., transportation will be provided, transportation
service is readily available). 

(ii) Where applicable, the application must provide a detailed explanation of all facility acquisition, construction,
rehabilitation, operation, redesign or modification proposed for funding under this program. 

(A) The application must specify what percent of the facility will be used for youth activities (as opposed to, for
example, senior citizen or adult activities). This percentage may not be less than the percentage of Youth Sports
funding provided for the facility. 

(iii) The application must identify the entity that will be responsible for the operation of any facility funded by
a Youth Sports grant.

<PARENT> FR940511-2-00128 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(10) A description of the organization of the applicant's proposed Youth Sports program, which must detail: 
(i) The consultations entered into by the applicant with RMCs/RCs, where they exist, and other entities experienced
in the design and implementation of the type of proposed youth sports activities; 
(ii) The position descriptions, or if the identity of persons who will fill positions is known, the resumes, of the
staff that will be responsible for managing and operating the Youth Sports activities must be included in the application;
if volunteers are involved, their number, job descriptions, and hours per week of involvement must be included; 
(iii) The procedures that will be followed to ensure that the Youth Sports activities or facilities will serve primarily
youth from the public or Indian housing development in which the program to be assisted by a grant is operated must be
explained in the application. 
(11) A description of the extent of involvement of local sports organizations or sports figures. 
(i) The applicant must provide documentation of the level of on-site or other participation by local and nationally
affiliated sports organizations, except as provided in section (ii) below, with at least two years of organizational
and operational experience. These may include, but are not limited to, strictly sports organizations, such as, Little
Leagues, Midnight Basketball, or professional teams. Participation by cultural, recreational, or educational
organizations is also permissible. The participation of these groups must be focused on the youth activities for
which the application is prepared. 
(ii) The applicant may demonstrate the involvement of local or national sports, cultural, recreational or educational
figures, such as athletes, coaches, artists, entertainers and teachers in place of, or in addition to, the participation
of organizations. The participation of these figures must be focused on the youth activities for which the application
is prepared. 
(12) A description of plans and resources to continue the Youth Sports activities beyond the grant term under this
program, including the commitment of entities (e.g., local and tribal governments, corporations, community organizations)
and individuals to continue their involvement in the applicant's Youth Sports activities and facilities. 

(13) HUD Form 2880. 



IV. Corrections to Deficient Applications 



(a) HUD will notify an applicant, in writing, of any curable technical deficiencies in the application. The applicant
must submit corrections in accordance with the information specified in HUD's letter within 14 calendar days from
the date of receipt of HUD's letter notifying the applicant of any such deficiency. 
(b) Curable technical deficiencies relate to items that: 
(1) Are not necessary for HUD review under selection criteria/ranking factors; and 
(2) Cannot be submitted after the application due date has expired, to improve the substantive quality of the proposal.
An example of a technical deficiency would be the failure of an applicant to submit a certification with its proposal.




V. Other Matters




(a) Environmental Impact




A Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR part 50 that implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4332.
The FONSI is available for public inspection and copying from 7:30 to 5:30 weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket
Clerk, room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20401. HUD will review all applications and their proposed
activities in accordance with the environmental requirements of 24 CFR part 50. 



(b) Federalism Impact




The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the provisions of this NOFA do not have ``federalism implications'' within the meaning of the Order. The NOFA
implements a program that provides positive sports, cultural, recreational, educational or other activities designed
to appeal to youth as alternatives to the drug environment in public and Indian housing, and makes available grants
to PHAs and IHAs to help them implement these activities. As such, the program helps PHAs and IHAs to combat serious
drug-related crime problems in their developments, thereby strengthening their role as instrumentalities of the
States. Further review under the Order is also unnecessary since the NOFA generally tracks the statute and involves
little implementing discretion. 



(c) Family Impact




The General Counsel, as the Designated Official for Executive Order 12606, the Family, has determined that the provisions
of this NOFA have the potential for significant positive impact on family formation, maintenance and general well-being
within the meaning of the Order. The NOFA implements a program that provides positive sports, cultural, recreational,
educational or other activities designed to appeal to youth as alternatives to the drug environment in public and
Indian housing, and makes available grants to PHAs and IHAs to help them implement these activities. As such, the program
is intended to improve the quality of life of public and Indian housing development residents by reducing the incidence
of drug-related crime and should have a strong positive effect on family formation, maintenance and general well-being
for PHAs and IHAs selected for funding. Further review under the Order is also not necessary since the NOFA essentially
tracks the authorizing legislation and involves little exercise of HUD discretion.

(d) Section 102 HUD Reform Act 





Documentation and public access requirements.

 HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this
NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including
any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than
30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients
of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly 

Federal Register

 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the
notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these documentation and public access requirements.)




Disclosures.

 HUD will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (HUD Form 2880) submitted in
connection with this NOFA. Update reports (also Form 2880) will be made available along with the applicant disclosure
reports, but in no case for a period of less than three years. All reports_both applicant disclosures and updates_will
be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations
at 24 CFR part 15, subpart C, and the notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these disclosure requirements.) 



(e) Section 103 HUD Reform Act. 



HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 was
published May 13, 1991 (56 FR 22088) and became effective on June 12, 1991. That regulation, codified as 24 CFR part
4, applies to the funding competition announced today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply until the announcement
of the selection of successful applicants. 

HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are limited by part 4 from
providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding decisions,
or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance in this
competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR part 4. 

Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708-3815. (This is not a toll-free
number.) The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well. However, a HUD
employee who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can be discussed with persons
outside the Department, should contact his or her Regional or Field Office Counsel, or Headquarters counsel for the
program to which the question pertains. 



(f) Section 112 HUD Reform Act. 



Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act contains two provisions dealing with efforts to
influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on those
who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the taking
of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment
of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units
received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance.


Section 13 was implemented by final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 17, 1991 (56 FR 22912). If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these ways, they
are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples contained in appendix A of the rule. 

Any questions regarding the rule should be directed to Director, Office of Ethics, room 2158, Department of Housing
and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410. Telephone: (202) 708-3815; TDD: (202)
708-1112. (These are not toll-free numbers.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from
the local HUD office.

Recombinant DNA Research: Proposed Actions Under the Guidelines



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Institutes of Health, PHS, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed actions under the NIH guidelines for research involving recombinant DNA molecules (51 FR 16958).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice sets forth proposed actions to be taken under the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines for Research
Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (51 FR 16958). Interested parties are invited to submit comments concerning
these proposals. These proposals will be considered by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee at its meeting on June
9-10, 1994. After consideration of these proposals and comments by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee,
the Director of the National Institutes of Health will issue decisions in accordance with the NIH Guidelines.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The NIH will consider the following actions under the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules:


I. Addition to Appendix D of the NIH Guidelines Regarding a Human Gene Transfer Protocol/Drs. Sobol and Royston



In a letter dated October 6, 1993, Drs. Robert Sobol and Ivor Royston of the San Diego Regional Cancer Center, San Diego,
California, submitted the human gene transfer protocol entitled: Injection of Glioblastoma Patients with Tumor
Cells Genetically Modified to Secrete Interleukin-2 (IL-2): A Phase I Study to the Recombinant DNA Advisory
Committee for formal review and approval. At the December 2-3, 1993, meeting, the Recombinant DNA Advisory
Committee disapproved the original protocol. The majority of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee members concluded
that the preclinical data derived from a previous single patient protocol was inadequate to justify the experiment.
The motion to disapprove the protocol passed by a vote of 10 in favor, 5 opposed, and 1 abstention.

Patients Undergoing Autologous Bone Marrow Transplantation to the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee for formal
review and approval.



V. Addition to Appendix D of the NIH Guidelines Regarding a Human Gene Transfer Protocol/Dr. Lyerly



In a letter dated April 12, 1994, Dr. H. Kim Lyerly of Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, submitted
the human gene transfer protocol entitled: A Pilot Study of Autologous Human Interleukin-2 Gene Modified Tumor Cells
in Patients with Refractory or Recurrent Metastatic Breast Cancer to the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee for
formal review and approval.



VI. Addition to Appendix D of the NIH Guidelines Regarding a Human Gene Transfer Protocol/Drs. Economou, Glaspy,
and McBride



In a letter dated April 11, 1994, Drs. James Economou, John Glaspy, and William McBride of the University of California,
Los Angeles, California, submitted a human gene transfer protocol entitled: A Phase I Testing of Genetically Engineered
Interleukin-7 Melanoma Vaccines to the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee for formal review and approval.



VII. Addition to Appendix D of the NIH Guidelines Regarding a Human Gene Transfer Protocol/Dr. Freedman



In a letter dated March 22, 1993, Dr. Ralph Freedman of M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, submitted the
human gene transfer protocol entitled: Use of a Retroviral Vector to Study the Trafficking Patterns of Purified Ovarian
Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocyte (TIL) Populations Used in Intraperitoneal Adoptive Immunotherapy of Ovarian Cancer
Patients: A Pilot Study to the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee for formal review and approval. At its June 7-8,
1993, meeting the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee deferred the protocol until the investigators return to the
full Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee with the following: 

(1) Data demonstrating efficient transduction of TIL,

(2) Sufficient information regarding demonstration of selectivity, i.e., specific trafficking of TIL to tumor,


(3) Complete statistical analysis,

(4) Revised Informed Consent document in simplified language, and 

(5) Address concerns about patient responsibility for research-related costs. The motion to defer the protocol
pending full Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee review of additional information passed by a vote of 18 in favor,
0 opposed, and no abstentions.

In a letter dated January 5, 1994, Dr. Freedman submitted a revised protocol to the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee
for formal review and approval. At its March 3-4, 1994, meeting, the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee deferred
the protocol until the investigator returns to the full Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee with:

(1) A modified protocol, which includes a revised treatment schema that will provide statistically significant
information, and 

(2) A revised Informed Consent document that adequately describes the procedures that will be performed in language
understandable to lay persons. The motion to defer the protocol pending full Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee
review of the additional information passed by a vote of 12 in favor, 1 opposed, and no abstentions.

In a letter dated April 13, 1994, Dr. Freedman submitted a revised protocol to the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee
for formal review and approval.



VIII. Addition to Appendix D of the NIH Guidelines Regarding a Human Gene Transfer Protocol/Drs. Deisseroth, Hortobagyi,

 expression of the FACC gene and safety data accumulated over a period of " 4 months demonstrating that the FACC-transduced
cells do not produce any untoward effects, i.e., malignant transformation:

(2) Data (cited in Dr. Cynthia Dunbar's December 1993 data management report, Protocol 

#

9206-025) regarding the possibility that ``stem cell factor could favor the growth of leukemic versus normal
progenitors during 

ex vivo

 culture periods;'' and

(3) Revised eligibility criteria sections for both the protocol and Informed Consent document that describe the
necessity for bone marrow examination following each infusion.

The consensus of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee was that the investigators were not required to submit this
additional data until 4 weeks prior to the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee meeting at which the information is
reviewed. Submission of previously reviewed information is not required. The motion to defer the protocol pending
full Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee review of additional information passed by a vote of 14 in favor, 0 opposed,
and 3 abstentions.

On May 2, 1994, Drs. Liu and Young submitted additional materials relating to the human gene transfer protocol to the
Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee for formal review and approval.


XII. Amendment to Part I-D of the Points to Consider in the Design and Submission of Protocols for the Transfer
of Recombinant DNA Into the Genome of Human Subjects, NIH Guidelines, Regarding Informed Consent/Dr. Zallen



During the December 2-3, 1993, Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee meeting, Dr. Gary Ellis, Director of the
Office for Protection from Research Risks (OPRR), NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, responded to the written comments submitted
by Dr. Zallen, Chair of the Working Group on Informed Consent Issues. Dr. Ellis noted the Recombinant DNA Advisory
Committee's concern regarding specific issues that should be addressed in human gene transfer protocol Informed
Consent documents, i.e., request for autopsy, recommendations for male/female contraception, separate Informed
Consent documents when gene therapy is separate from a clinical protocol, commitment to long-term patient follow-up,
and financial responsibility of the institution for all research-related costs. During his presentation, Dr. Ellis
provided the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee with background information regarding the roles of both OPRR and
local Institutional Review Boards (IRB) in the review of research proposals involving human subjects. Dr. Ellis
recommended that the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee draft a letter outlining its specific recommendations
to OPRR for distribution and consideration by the local IRBs.

In a memorandum dated December 23, 1993, Dr. Ellis further clarified the avenues that should be pursued by the Recombinant
DNA Advisory Committee with regard to the ``quality and content of informed consent documents into constructive
changes in the informed consent process,'' specifically in relation to human gene transfer. Dr. Ellis recommended
that the Points to Consider should be amended to introduce consistency in the Informed Consent document language.

During the March 3-4, 1994, Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee meeting, Dr. Doris Zallen, Chair of the Working
Group on Informed Consent, provided a summary of the proposed amendments to Part I-D, Informed Consent of the
Points to Consider. Two versions of revised Part I-D were presented:

(1) The version drafted by the working group, and
(2) A modified version incorporating the modifications suggested by Mr. Alex Capron. The Recombinant DNA Advisory
Committee recommended that the working group should develop a consolidated version of part I-D which includes
language from both proposed documents. The Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee suggested that questions should
be prefaced with an explanation as to the necessity for the requested information.

On April 27, 1994, Dr. Zallen submitted revised amendments to part I-D, Informed Consent, of the Points to Consider
in response to the specific comments posed by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee at its March 3-4, 1994,
meeting. The proposed amendments read:



Part I-D Informed Consent



``In accordance with the requirements of DHHS regulations for the protection of human subjects (45 CFR part 46), investigators
shall indicate how subjects will be informed about the proposed study, the manner in which their consent will be solicited,
and that the informed consent form makes clear the special requirements of gene transfer research.

Part I-D-1-a.

 Which members of the research group and/or institution will be responsible for contacting potential participants
and for describing the study to them? What procedures will be used to avoid potential conflicts of interest if the investigator
is also providing medical care to potential subjects?



Part I-D-1-b.

 Where will discussions or other means of informing individuals about the proposed study take place?



Part I-D-1-c.

 How will the major points covered in Parts I-A through I-C of the Points to Consider be disclosed to potential
participants and/or their parents or guardians in language that is understandable to them?



Part I-D-1-d.

 What is the length of time that the potential participants will have to make a decision about their participation in
the study?



Part I-D-1-e.

 If the study involves pediatric or mentally handicapped subjects, how will the assent of each person be obtained?



Part I-D-2. Informed Consent Document



``Investigators submitting human gene transfer proposals for Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee review must include
the Informed Consent document as approved by the local Institutional Review Board. A separate consent document should
be used for the gene transfer portion of a research project when gene transfer is used as an adjunct in the study of another
technique, such as when the gene is used as a `marker' or when it is used to enhance the power of immunotherapy for cancer.

``Because of the relative novelty of the procedures that are used, the potentially irreversible consequences of
the procedures performed, and the possibility that many of the potential risks remain undefined, the Informed Consent
document shall include the following specific information in addition to any requirements of the DHHS regulations
for the protection of human subjects (45 CFR part 46). Indicate if each of the specified items appears in the consent
form or, if not in the consent form, how those items will be presented to potential subjects. Include an explanation
if any of the following items is omitted from the consent process or document.



Part I-D-2-a. General Requirements of Human Subjects Research





Part I-D-2-a-(1). Description/purpose of study.

 ``The subjects should be provided a detailed explanation in non-technical language of the purpose of the study and
the procedures associated with the conduct of the proposed study, including a description of the gene-transfer component.



Part I-D-2-a-(2). Alternatives.

 ``The consent form should indicate the availability of other therapies, including the possibility of other investigational
therapies and approaches.



Part I-D-2-a-(3). Voluntary participation.

 ``The subjects should be informed that participation in the study is voluntary and that failure to participate in
the study, or withdrawal of consent, will not result in any penalty or loss of benefits to which the subjects are otherwise
entitled.



Part I-D-2-a-(4). Benefits.

 ``The subjects should be provided with an accurate description of the possible benefits, if any, of participating
in the proposed study. For experiments which are not reasonably expected to provide a therapeutic benefit to subjects,
the consent form shall clearly state that no direct clinical benefit to subjects is expected to occur as a result of
participation in the study, although knowledge may be gained that may benefit others.



Part I-D-2-a-(5). Possible risks, discomforts, and side effects.

 ``There should be a clear itemization in the consent form of types of adverse experiences, the relative severities,
and the expected frequencies. For consistency of definition, side effects that are listed as mild should be ones which
do not require a therapeutic intervention. Moderate side effects require an intervention. Severe side effects are
potentially fatal or life-threatening, disabling, or require prolonged hospitalization. Rare side effects occur
in less than one in one thousand subjects, uncommon side effects in less than 1% of subjects, common side effects in
one to 10% of subjects, and frequent side effects are those which occur in more than 10% of subjects.
